January 15 , 2010 - On January 11 , a judge in Faisalabad , Pakistan , convicted a Christian young man , Imran Masih , for defiling , damaging and desecrating the extracts of the Holy Quran and sentenced to life imprisonment .
He is now in judicial lockup of District Jail Faisalabad to serve out the sentences awarded to him .
Masih , a shopkeeper in the town , was indicted and arrested on charges of blasphemy law after he cleaned his shop of paper trash and leftover books , placing them in a barrel and burning them .
When neighboring shopkeepers noticed , they accused him of buring pages of the Koran .
The Muslims of the area then severely beat the man and damaged his shop .
The story spread among the mosques of the surrounding area , started inciting Muslims to take part in the assault , to take revenge from Christians for this outrageous act .
A large number of Muslims including clerics assembled , they staged a protest , blocked the roads , chanted slogans against Christian and demanded shouting " Death to blasphemers in public " .
Meanwhile , police arrived at the occurrence , took the Imran Masih into custody and framed a blasphemy case against him .

The Chinese government has announced that it plans to build as many as 20 hydro electric projects on the Yangtze river by the year 2020 .
The projects would be aimed at quenching China ’s increasing power demand and helping in flood control .
However , many domestic and international experts warn about the ecological sensitivity of the area might not be strong enough to cope with such massive infrastructure projects .
Current Problems
The Yangtze already has the world ’s largest hydro electric plan in the Three Gorges Dam which , according to some experts , is putting tremendous amounts of pressure on the neighboring areas leading to landslides .
Just few weeks ago there were news reports that a landslide in the area , estimated to be 3.6 million cubic meters and covering 100,000 square meters , could fall into the river .
Another problem with large hydro electric projects in China is their vicinity to earthquake prone areas with some of them actually laying over active faults .
The Sichuan earthquake last year killed 87,000 people with some experts attributing its cause to the large amount earth pressures exerted by the Zipingpu dam .
Lack of Transparency
China has had a long record of overlooking environmental and ecological aspects related to projects it deems vital to showing off the country ’s might and which hold high strategic importance .
China went ahead with the railway project in the disputed and ecologically pristine region of Tibet .
The Chinese government went ahead with the project costing $ 4.2 billion , a small sum to cement its claim over Tibet .
The problem with the Chinese system is the excessive secretive manner in which the planning of such projects is carried out .
The Chinese government in 2001 had refused to make public the Environmental Impact Assessment report of the Zipingpu dam in the Sichuan province .
And while concerns about ecological & environmental aspects of the region remain the government is set to infuse another $ 14.5 billion into the Three Gorges dam project in addition to the $ 23.6 billion already spent .
Feeding to its yet another strategic interest of securing unhindered oil supplies , Beijing ordered the construction of an oil refinery cum shortage facility near the environmentally sensitive areain the Nansha district near Hong Kong .
The government then directed various Chinese websites to block all information regarding the environmental impacts of the proposed project .
Experts believe that building hydro electric plants in such large numbers would not have adverse social and ecological impacts but would also increase the level of pollution in the rivers as these reservoirs tend to hold up the pollutants thus increasing their concentration .
A great amount of emphasis is given up on the debate that whether China be forced to reduce its carbon emissions or not but there is hardly any talk of the dismal state of China ’s EIA procedure .
China must be pressurized by the international community especially by the international lending agencies like the World Bank , Asian Development Bank and the IMF to increase transparency in assessment of impacts of all large scale infrastructure projects .

The Icelandic men ’s national handball team lost the semi-final match in the EHF European Handball Championships in Austria .
The hard - fought match ended 28 - 36 in France ’s favour , leaving the French team on course to be the only team ever to hold the European , world and Olympic handball titles at the same time .
Iceland managed to keep the scores consistently even during the first half ; but were overpowered by French speed and bulletproof defence during the second half .
Iceland will play either Croatia or Poland tomorrow for third place .
France will play the other of those two teams in the final , also tomorrow .
The Icelandic team ’s appearance in a second major international semi-final match in a row is seen as proof that the team ’s Olympic success was no mere stroke of luck .
The Pentagon ’s advanced research division has set aside $ 6 million from its next budget for research on the creation of “ synthetic organisms ” whose DNA can be altered to make them live forever , or die on command , and even keep a genetic record of what they have been doing .
In its 2011 budget ( PDF , 522 pages ) , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency lays out its intention to create “ BioDesign , ” a project to create artificial life , presumably with military purposes in mind .

“ BioDesign eliminates the randomness of natural evolutionary advancement primarily by advanced genetic engineering and molecular biology technologies to produce the intended biological effect , ” the DARPA document states .
The agency says it wants to develop “ a robust understanding of the collective mechanisms that contribute to cell death ” so as to “ enable a new generation of regenerative cells that could ultimately be programmed to live indefinitely . ”
But , if those organisms should malfunction or run the course of their usefulness , the agency also wants to have the ability to have them die on command , what it calls a “ self - destruct option . ”
The agency also wants to create “ tamper - proof ” genetic codes , so that enemy forces ca n’t reprogram the life forms to switch sides .
ADVERTISEMENT
And finally , DARPA also wants these organisms ’ genetic sequences to “ record ” what they have been doing , presumably for surveillance purposes , “ similar to a traceable serial number on a handgun . ”
Reporting at Wired.com , Katie Drummond says the Pentagon is “ up against some vexing , fundamental laws of nature . ”
First , they might want to rethink the idea of evolution as a random series of events , says NYU biology professor David Fitch .
“ Evolution by selection is nota random process at all , and is actually a hugely efficient design algorithm used extensively in computation and engineering , ” he e-mails Danger Room .
Even if Darpa manages to overcome the inherent intelligence of evolutionary processes , overcoming inevitable death can be tricky .
Just ask all the other research teams who ’ve made stabs at it , trying everything from cell starvation to hormone treatments .

Interpreting Fed Policy By Arnold Kling
1. Ricardo Reis writes ,
With regards to its interest - rate policy , the Federal Reserve has followed the advice from theory by committing to deflation and to keep interest rates at zero for the foreseeable future .
It has deviated from the theoretical recommendations by not making a clear commitment to have higher - than - average inflation in the future , and especially by not providing a clear signal that it will keep nominal interest rates low for some time even after the crisis is over .
Scott Sumner might feel a bit less lonely reading this .
Thanks to Mark Thoma for the pointer .
Reis also tries to explain the Fed ’s non-standard balance sheet moves .
Rather than try to come up with an economic theory to explain Fed policy , I would suggest a more cynical approach .
The goal has been to transfer wealth to banks and to the holders of mortgage securities .
The thinking is that those constituents are more important to the economy than taxpayers .
Suppose that in 2013 President Palin meets with Ben Bernanke and says , “ I want you to sell your entire portfolio of mortgage securities , by close of business today . ”
I do n’t think that Bernanke could argue that she was interfering with the conduct of monetary policy .
The Fed has changed from a central bank to a piggy bank .
Any economist who tries to interpret
Fed policy from the standpoint of economic theory is playing a fool ’s game .
Talking to the Sunday Times he said : “ These are revolting and unnecessary experiments .
Sadly , we are too familiar with the effects of terrorism .
It is perfectly possible to find out things we do n’t know without blowing up pigs to find out . ”
Federal and state officials , many facing record budget deficits , are starting to aggressively pursue companies that try to pass off regular employees as independent contractors .
President Obama ’s 2010 budget assumes that the federal crackdown will yield at least $ 7 billion over 10 years .
More than two dozen states also have stepped up enforcement , often by enacting stricter penalties for misclassifying workers .
Many workplace experts say a growing number of companies have maneuvered to cut costs by wrongly classifying regular employees as independent contractors , though they often are given desks , phone lines and assignments just like regular employees .
Moreover , the experts say , workers have become more reluctant to challenge such practices , given the tough job market .
Companies that pass off employees as independent contractors avoid paying Social Security , Medicare and unemployment insurance taxes for those workers .
Companies do not withhold income taxes from contractors ’ paychecks , and several studies have indicated that , on average , misclassified independent workers do not report 30 percent of their income .
I do n’t get geeked up over TV shows very often , but , man I am so stoked for the Lost premier tonight .
Hell of a show , that one .
Hell of a show , indeed .

Imaging technique pierces vegetative state .
A patient previously considered unconscious can think ' yes ' or ' no ' by visualizing tasks that activate different parts of the brain .
NEJM
Brain imaging has allowed a man who was previously considered unconscious to answer a series of yes - or - no questions .
The study , published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine1 , challenges clinicians ' definition of consciousness and provides an unprecedented opportunity to communicate with those who show no outward signs of awareness .
Patients are classified as unconscious , or being in a ' vegetative state ' , if they are unable to respond in any fashion to an extensive series of questions and requests .
But if the patient is completely unable to move , an aware or communicative mind could go unrecognized by this method of assessment .
" The conundrum with the vegetative state is that it 's a diagnosis made on lack of evidence , " says neuroscientist Adrian Owen of the Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brian Sciences Unit in Cambridge , UK .
Owen and his colleagues made headlines three years ago when they used a brain - scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to demonstrate that a woman in a vegetative state could respond to verbal commands2 .
When researchers directed her to imagine playing a game of tennis or walking through her house , the fMRI scan revealed that she activated the same areas of her brain as healthy subjects who were asked to do the same .
The findings sparked a debate over whether or not the woman was actually conscious ( see ' Thoughts of woman in ' waking coma ' revealed ' ) .
Some argued that what Owen and his collaborators saw was nothing more than an automatic activation of those brain regions on hearing certain words .
One such critic was Lionel Naccache , a neuroscientist at the Pitié - Salpêtrière hospital in Paris , who urged caution before concluding that the woman was indeed conscious .
This latest evidence of communication with a vegetative patient , however , has Naccache convinced .
" This is clear - cut evidence of consciousness , " he says .
Piercing the fog
Owen and his collaborators repeated their fMRI experiments on 54 patients who had previously been classified as either vegetative or ' minimally conscious ' ( a condition in which a patient may inconsistently respond to commands , but cannot communicate interactively ) .
They found that five of these 54 patients responded to commands to imagine playing tennis or navigating through a familiar house .
Four of those five patients had been classified as vegetative , but when clinicians repeated their assessment following the fMRI study , they found evidence that two of those four should instead have been classified as minimally conscious .
One of the responsive patients , a 22 - year - old man who had been diagnosed as vegetative for five years after a traffic accident left him with a traumatic brain injury , was selected for further study .
Because it is difficult — if not impossible — to determine whether someone is thinking ' yes ' or ' no ' , the researchers instead asked the patient to imagine playing tennis when the answer to a question was yes , and to imagine walking through a house when the answer was no .
Visualizing these two activities stimulates different parts of the brain that are easily distinguished using fMRI .
They asked the patient a series of simple yes - or - no questions pertaining to his personal history , such as " Is your father 's name Alexander ? " .
He answered five out of six questions correctly .
No brain activity was observed in response to the sixth question .
The results suggest that fMRI could be useful in diagnosing unresponsive patients , says Owen .
" There are things that are just not going to manifest themselves in outward behaviour , " says Owen .
" This method can tell us which patients are aware , and it can tell us what they are capable of . "
For Naccache , it is the patient 's ability to respond using the code suggested by Owen and his team that indicates he is truly conscious .
" When you are conscious , you have the ability to use an arbitrary code to communicate with somebody , " he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Parashkev Nachev , a neuroscientist at University College London who was not affiliated with the work cautions that it is important not to over - interpret the results .
The patient only answered a series of very basic questions , he notes , and the results in his view do not necessarily suggest that the patient is fully conscious or has the potential for recovery .
" There is no doubt that it does merit further research , " he says , " but I could not see using it as a clinical tool at this stage " .
As a next step , Owen and his colleagues intend to ask the patient a series of questions with unverifiable answers .
For example , the technique could be used to ask whether they are experiencing any pain — a question that frequently troubles family members and hospital staff .
But should a vegetative patient be asked whether they want to live or die ?
" I think there 's an enormous problem with that , " says Owen .
" Just because a patient is able to respond with ' yes ' or ' no ' does n't tell you if they have the necessary level of competence to answer difficult , ethically challenging questions about their destiny . "
National Super Bowl ads have been universally fun or relatable through the years , making up for their glib materialism with some entertainment value and giving fans of pop culture but not the sport a reason to watch .
Cute frogs croaked for beer ( “ Bud - wei- ser ! ” ) and babies sang off - key ( eTrade ) in memorable campaigns .
But this year , CBS and the Super Bowl – which drew more than 95 million viewers in 2009 – are kicking up political dust allowing an anti-abortion ad in the national broadcast .
The first religious - political ad CBS has approved to air in the entire history of the Super Bowl hails from the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family .
It features Pam Tebow , who recounts her decision to carry a pregnancy to term , against the advice of doctors who feared for her life and recommended an abortion .
By her side is thankful son Tim Tebow , Florida Gators quarterback and Heisman trophy winner .
The privilege of airing the ad cost Focus on the Family an estimated $ 2.5 million media buy , plus more to produce it .
Debate has been raging in the blogosphere .
Is Tebow too controversial to get drafted now ?
What ’s appropriate for broadcast during the Super Bowl ?
Should American women have the right to choose ?
And with teen pregnancy and teen abortions on the rise , should n’t we be focused on improving sex education , first ?
No matter where you stand on such matters , or whether you ’re one of more than 35 million women over the age of 18 likely to watch the Super Bowl this year ( according to Nielsen research ) , it ’s hard not to think of the positive human or environmental impact that a couple million dollars could have made , if redirected to help the already - born children of Haiti , for example .
Finally , there ’s another question the anti-abortion movement raises , constantly , and again with this ad : should women be encouraged to have kids at all costs , when overpopulation is wreaking havoc in the form of air , water and noise pollution , loss of species and habitat , and a low life expectancy for humans where you find the fastest growing populations ?

Ergo , you ’d be crazy to consider an abortion , ladies , and gents and those not of child - bearing age , do n’t even think about supporting a woman ’s right to choose , because how could you choose not to gestate and give life to a person as successful and handsome as Tim Tebow ? ” – A blog post by Elizabeth Gettelman for Mother Jones

But by early fall the core group that would travel to M.I.T. established itself .
In addition to Sandate , there was the team ’s founder , Leeza Sergeeva , a deadpan 19 - year - old from Moscow ; Angela Brock , 34 , with a bleached , punk haircut , who came back to school to study electrical engineering after dropping out 10 years ago ; and Bertram Lee , 47 , a high - spirited man who wore his pants high on the waist and short at the ankles .
Lee spent a decade designing databases in the financial sector , then took up science somewhat spontaneously after his parents passed away .
Finally there was Bowen Hunter , a plucky 27 - year - old certified massage therapist who went to a Southern Baptist high school in Texas that taught creationism instead of evolution and now wanted to get a master ’s and teach in City College ’s biotech track .
From a technical standpoint , the design of the team ’s battery was relatively straightforward compared with other iGEM projects , but it turned out to be ambitious in its own way .
Two glass containers , the size of cider jugs , would be connected by a glass tube .
Each contained a different species of bacteria , living in a liquid medium .
The bacteria on the right side , R. Palustris , are photosynthetic , converting sunlight into sugar , which they need to survive .
The other bacteria also subsist on sugar but ca n’t generate their own ; they use sugar as energy to create a small electric charge .
Both types of bacteria exist , as is , in nature ; the team spent a lot of time researching online for the best - suited species and ones they could easily obtain .
VandePol fetched a particularly good strain of R. Palustris from a lab at M.I.T. when he flew there for an iGEM teachers ’ training last spring , and the team bought the other bacteria , first discovered at the bottom of a bay in Virginia , for $ 240 through the mail .
The idea was to build a bacteria - based battery that could be powered entirely by the sun .
To do that , the team would redesign the photosynthetic R. Palustris so that it released some of the sugar it made and sent it through the tube to fuel the electricity generation of the bacteria on the other side .
The students would need to re-engineer R. Palustris to give up its food — something that in nature would be totally nonsensical .
They had a long list of tasks , but this was the pivotal one : give R. Palustris a leak .
The story of iGEM and , to some degree , the vision of synthetic biology that it champions , begins not with biologists but with engineers .
From the beginning , the approach was rooted less in the biologist ’s methods of patient observation than in the engineer ’s childlike love of building cool stuff and hyperrational expectations about the way things ought to work .
Drew Endy came to M.I.T. as a bioengineering fellow in 2002 at the age of 32 .
He now teaches at Stanford and is probably the field ’s most voluble and charismatic spokesman .
“ I sort of Facebook - stalk him , ” I overheard a student say at the jamboree .
( Last month , the National Science Foundation financed the creation of a full - scale BioBrick part factory in the Bay Area , called the Biofab ; Endy is a founding director . )
At M.I.T. , Endy found a group of colleagues — like him , all originally engineers by training — who were disappointed with how unmethodical a field that was termed “ genetic engineering ” appeared to still be : its major successes were more like imaginative , one - off works of art than systematic engineering projects .
As Endy told me , “ I grew up in a world where you can go into a hardware store and buy nuts and bolts , put them together and they work . ”
Just as you tell a computer to add 2 and 2 and know you ’ll get 4 , Endy said , you should be able to give a cell simple commands and have it reliably execute them — and explaining this , he still managed to sound honestly flummoxed that something so absolutely logical was n’t actually true ; his approach to the living world is astonishingly Spock - like .
“ Biology is the most interesting and powerful technology platform anyone ’s ever seen , ” he said .
“ It ’s already taken over the world with reproducing machines .
You can kind of imagine that you should be able to program it with DNA . ”
Arguably this has been an implicit dream of genetic engineering all along .
But starting in the mid-’90s , synthetic biologists concluded that we had amassed enough knowledge about how genomes work and developed enough tools for manipulating them that it was time to actively pursue it .
In 2003 , Endy formed a partnership with three other like - minded engineers at M.I.T. , Gerald Sussman , Randy Rettberg and Tom Knight .
Rettberg , who now directs iGEM , had absolutely no background in biology until , after retiring as a chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems in 2001 , he started reading textbooks and hanging around Knight ’s lab ; the two friends worked early in their careers on designing computers .
Knight had already developed the concept of BioBrick parts and a method for connecting them .
The four men decided that rather than spend decades figuring out how to turn life into the predictable machinery they wanted it to be and then teaching that to their students , they would enlist the students to help .
They taught a monthlong course challenging teams of students to design E. coli that “ blinked ” — that is , generated fluorescent light at regular intervals .
That first experimental class rapidly evolved , by 2006 , into an iGEM Jamboree involving 35 schools .
And from there , Endy told me , “ this thing goes international fast . ”
He seemed to have it all — a wife , three kids , a successful career .
But it was n’t enough .
What he really wanted was another X chromosome .
Our taxpayer , explains the Tax Court , “ was uncomfortable in the male gender role from childhood and first wore women ’s clothing secretly around age 10 … discomfort regarding her gender intensified in adolescence …
[ The taxpayer ] was a female trapped in a male body , and continued to secretly wear women ’s clothing . ”
So our taxpayer consulted a licensed social worker , which is apparently how these things are done , and after suitable counseling , decided to try on XX for size .
The first steps down the path the the Misses Department seemed to suit the taxpayer , so he took the next big leap .
$ 21,741 of surgical and related expenses later , the taxpayer was Ms. Rhiannon O’Donnabhain .
The Tax Court got involved when she deducted these expenses on her 2001 tax return .
The IRS said that the expenses were not “ medical ” expenses under Sec. 219 .
It would be an unusual man who would undergo this sort of thing absent dire medical need : “ The procedures that Dr. Meltzer carried out included surgical removal of the penis and testicles and creation of a vaginal space using genital skin and tissue . ”
It took 139 pages and 4 separate opinions , but the Tax Court agreed that the gender reassignment surgery is a deductible medical expense .
It ’s surprising that it was so difficult , considering that the court is largely composed of men who wear dresses at work .
But they felt it was necessary to go into the sort of privacy - killing detail that makes taxpayers think twice before spurning an appeals offer and going to Tax Court ( oh , you mean you ’re that Rhiannon O’Donnabhain ! ) :
Petitioner , anticipating the formal recommendations for her surgery , went for a consultation and examination by Dr. Meltzer in June 2001 at his offices in Portland , Oregon .
Dr. Meltzer concluded that petitioner was a good candidate for sex reassignment surgery .
Dr. Meltzer ’s notes of his physical examination of petitioner state : “ Examination of her breasts reveal [ sic ] approximately B cup breasts with a very nice shape . ”
Nice enough for government work , anyway .
The Court ruled that while the hormone therapy , vaginoplasty , feminizing facial surgery and penis and testicle removal were deductible , breast augmentation was , well , too much :
given the contemporaneous documentation of the breasts ’ apparent normalcy and the failure to adhere to the Benjamin standards ’ requirement to document breast - engendered anxiety to justify the surgery , we find that petitioner ’s breast augmentation surgery did not fall within the treatment protocol …
Instead , the surgery merely improved her appearance .
So if the Tax Court ’s view holds up on appeal , you can deduct the cost of changing sides , but if that ’s not enough to make you sufficiently hot , you ’re on your own .
Mozilla announced last week the availability of Firefox for Maemo 1.0 , the first official release of Firefox Mobile for Nokia 's Linux - based smartphone operating system .
It offers adequate browsing performance , support for add - ons , and a finger - friendly user interface that includes popular Firefox features like the AwesomeBar .
This Firefox variant is based on the Fennec project , which was originally launched in 2007 with the aim of bringing the full Firefox browsing experience to modern handheld devices .
In the time that has transpired since the inception of the project , advancements in mobile computing hardware have significantly boosted the performance of smartphones .
That factor , coupled with Mozilla 's aggressive optimization efforts , have made it possible for Firefox to become a mobile browser .
Mozilla eventually hopes to bring Firefox Mobile to several operating systems , but has largely focused on Maemo and Windows Mobile during the early stages of development .
The Maemo port is the first to achieve a sufficient level of maturity to deserve an official 1.0 release .
I conducted extensive testing of Firefox for Maemo on the Nokia N900 , a powerful smartphone with an ARM Cortex - A8 processor .
Mozilla hosts its own Firefox Mobile package repository for Maemo 5 , the operating system that runs on the N900 .
To install Firefox Mobile on the device , navigate to firefox.com / m with the N900's native browser and click the " Download " button .
It will launch the platform 's package manager and walk you through the short process of enabling the proper repository and installing the relevant package .
After it is installed , the program can be launched from the application list .
User interface
The user interface has the same basic design that we originally saw in the first Fennec alpha back in 2008 .
The general look and feel of the application has n't changed much since then aside from some minor aesthetic refinements and a few alterations to make it fit in better on Maemo 5 .
The top of the screen is dominated by the URL bar , which displays the page title when the user is not inputting text .
It also shows the favicon and a refresh button .
The URL bar will show your bookmarks when it gains focus , and it will provide AwesomeBar completion as you type .
The browser will always run in fullscreen mode , obscuring the platform 's standard taskbar .
The buttons that appear to the right and left of the URL bar provide a way to access Maemo 's task selector and quit the program .
The URL bar is tied to the top of the webpage .
When the user scrolls down , the bar will roll off the top of the screen and disappear .
It can be accessed by scrolling back to the top or invoking the sidebar panels .
This is a relatively practical design decision because it ensures that valuable screen space is n't wasted by the URL bar .
The sidebar panels are activated by dragging the page all the way to the left or right .
The left - hand panel provides access to your browser tabs and the right - hand panel provides access to settings , add - ons , and a number of other features .
Firefox Mobile has moderately decent support for tabbed browsing , but lacks some of the useful features of the Firefox desktop browser .
The highest number of tabs that I had open at one time during my test was six , but there does n't really seem to be a limit .
It got a bit sluggish at that level but was still usable .
The tabs show up as thumbnails in a vertical column on the left - hand pane .
Each column can accommodate up to four tabs .
When I exceeded four , it added an additional column .
You can switch to a tab by clicking its thumbnail in the interface .
Each one has is overlaid with a red close button that you can click to close the tab .
The close button looks a bit small on the device , but I had no difficulty hitting it and I almost never hit it by accident .
You can open a new tab by clicking the tab button that is displayed at the bottom of the sidebar .
Unfortunately , the only way to open a specific link in a new tab is to slide out the N900's keyboard and hold the ctrl key while you tap the link on the screen .
I 'd personally prefer to be able to do that without the keyboard , perhaps by clicking and holding .
The right - hand sidebar has a button near the top that can be used to bookmark the current page .
It works a lot like the star from the desktop version 's URL bar .
Directly below it , you will find the back and forward buttons which can be used to navigate through the browser history .
I was not able to find a way to view the complete history like you can with the desktop version .
At the bottom of the sidebar , there is a button with a gear icon .
You can click this to get to the extended preference panel .
It has browser settings , downloads , and add - ons .
The number of settings that are accessible through the preference panel is a somewhat limited .
You can toggle images and JavaScript , control cookie behavior , and clear private data .
Fortunately , power users can still dive into about : config to change pretty much any setting .
It works exactly like it does on the desktop .
My apologies if you ’re not a fan of Lost or rodent meteorologists .
I hate to say I told you , but I told you :
The Apple iPad is exactly what I said it was going to be except for two things : Multitasking and the touch - sensitive bezel .
Guess what Apple just did .

Yes , they registered a method to do the last thing .
The US Patent and Trademark Office just published patent 7,656,393 , which describes the use of a touch - sensitive bezel to bring hot corners up on the main screen .
An electronic device has a display and has a touch sensitive bezel surrounding the display .
Areas on the bezel are designated for controls used to operate the electronic device .
Visual guides corresponding to the controls are displayed on the display adjacent the areas of the bezel designated for the controls .
Touch data is generated by the bezel when a user touches an area of the bezel .
The device determines which of the controls has been selected based on which designated area is associated with the touch data from the bezel .
The device then initiates the determined control .
The device can have a sensor for determining the orientation of the device .
Based on the orientation , the device can alter the areas designated on the bezel for the controls and can alter the location of the visual guides for the display so that they match the altered areas on the bezel .

I 've included an explanation of what their invention can do in the gallery :
This is pretty much what I already proposed in my Apple tablet user interface article , both as a solution for the positioning of the home button — which , as Mark points out , is awkward to use in portrait mode — and as a way to invoke different menus and switch between running applications .
Whenever the hell they enable multitasking in the iPhone OS , that is .

You can see how hot corners may work using this sensitive bezel here :
We do n't know if Apple will finally implement this patent or not , but it certainly makes a lot of sense to make the iPad more powerful , while keeping the user interface as easy to use and intuitive as it is now .

In writing an exposé on Apple 's supply chain , Reuters ' reporters fleshed out what we already know :
There 's an immense pressure on companies under contract with Apple not to leak any information about forthcoming products ; said companies have shady labor histories ; working for one of these companies frankly sounds terrifying .
We touched on these problems when Foxconn was accused of driving an employee to suicide over an iPhone prototype leak last year , but at the time , our picture of Foxconn was patched together from a pile of second and third - hand reports , conflicting local news stories , and PR spin .
To date , there has n't been a better illustration of the problem than this

Tipped by a worker outside the Longhua complex that a nearby Foxconn plant was manufacturing parts for Apple too , our correspondent hopped in a taxi for a visit to the facility in Guanlan , which makes products for a range of companies .
As he stood on the public road taking photos of the front gate and security checkpoint , a guard shouted .
The reporter continued snapping photos before jumping into a waiting taxi .
The guard blocked the vehicle and ordered the driver to stop , threatening to strip him of his taxi license .
The correspondent got out and insisted he was within his rights as he was on the main road .
The guard grabbed his arm .
A second guard ran over , and with a crowd of Foxconn workers watching , they tried dragging him into the factory .
The reporter asked to be let go .
When that did n't happen , he jerked himself free and started walking off .
The older guard kicked him in the leg , while the second threatened to hit him again if he moved .
A few minutes later , a Foxconn security car came along but the reporter refused to board it .
He called the police instead .
After the authorities arrived and mediated , the guards apologized and the matter was settled .
The reporter left without filing a complaint , though the police gave him the option of doing so .
" You 're free to do what you want , " the policeman explained , " But this is Foxconn and they have a special status here .
Please understand . "

So , let 's get this straight :
If you , a reporter , take pictures of the outside of a Foxconn factory , you can dragged , kicked , threatened , and reminded of how ominously " special " Foxconn 's relationship with Apple makes them .
( PS : Omigod , have you heard about the new iPad ! ? )
For Apple , this could mean two things :
That they long ago entered into business with a company that 's predisposed to violent enforcement of security policy ; or that their extreme demands for secrecy , and extreme value to Foxconn , have driven the company to become this way .

In neither situation can you call Apple the culprit .
In both , though , they 're at the very least silently complicit .

2010 Olympics : Russia – Czech Republic preview ( Photo © Bruce Bennett / Getty Images )
Team Russia ‘s opponent in the third round robin match of the 2010 Olympic Tournament will be team Czech Republic .
The Czechs , lead by the evergreen Jaromir Jagr , feature a very good lineup with plenty of NHL caliber players .
Russia has to skate past Czech Republic in order to secure the first seed in the Group B and get a bye into the quarterfinals .
The Czechs are on the top of the standings with six points in two games .
The Slovaks follow with five points , but they played three games .
Team Russia will try hard to put the 1 - 2 defeat against Slovakia in the past .
“ It ’s always tough to lose , but it ’s good to have it happen now in the tournament , ” Alexander Ovechkin told espn.com .
Most likely team Russia ’s lineup will undergo many changes .
Vyacheslav Bykov will swap Evgeni Malkin and Pavel Datsyuk .
“ We try different combinations ” , said Bykov to sportbox .ru , “ so that it would be possible to vary the lines if necessary . ”
With this changes Ovechkin and Malkin will be paired together .
“ I think that now in our line there will be more speed and physical play ” , Ovechkin told Sovietskiy Sport .
“ We have to play our game and try not to do too much , or we wo n’t be successfull . ”
Evgeny Nabokov is going to get another start after the first win over Latvia , while Sergei Fedorov is going to play after missing a practice .
The puck is going to be dropped at the local 12 AM .
A person who I will call for purposes of anonymity “ one of my students ” sent me an interesting email the other day .
She was upset .
Apparently after I had shown her a few of the basic lines in the palm and how to “ cold read ” those lines to fit any person , she was suffering a strange sort of skeptical guilt :
“ I ’m not sure if I have gotten in over my head or not .
I ’m not sure even how it happened .
I was talking with several people there and we all started talking , we were talking about Facebook Friends and somehow I said , ‘ well I could find that out if I could read your palm ’
And a friend stuck his hand out .
I have n’t ever done a palm reading but I ’ve wondered if I could bluff it .
But I was awesome , at least in their eyes .
I just gave him a reading based on the things I already knew about him , and just general things that are common to most people like “ you would love to travel more but just ca n’t seem the time to go ” and I also told him things that I had heard as gossip about him .
He agreed to everything and was totally amazed .
I had told him that some of the things I was seeing are kinda personal and maybe I should n’t say them , he said , “ no , tell me , I do n’t care ”
Other people who I knew were shocked too , and they stood farther away after I kept getting hits .
They startde daring each other to get a reading from me reading , but some were having none of that .
The went back and forth and I said I do n’t want to read the palm of anyone that is n’t comfortable with that .
One person kept saying that I would discover too much about him .
So then I started to realize that maybe I should n’t have done this , I did n’t want to tell anyone that it was all crap , that I was reading him , repeating gossip and just stating general things .
It would make him look stupid for believing it , and me look like a liar .
Then it got worse , the guy I was reading just opened up to me and starting telling me all about his relationships .
He has never been a private person , I know he tells his girlfriend everything .
But we did n’t have that kind of a friendship , mainly we would just talk about small talk and I liked it that way .
So now I am not sure what to do ..
I suppose I will just not say anything unless someone presses it .
I will tell anyone that asks that I do n’t think it is a good idea for me to do anymore readings of people as I might say the wrong thing .
People like their privacy and I should n’t be prying into that kind of thing .
If anyone seriously asks me , or if they make a big deal out of it , I guess I will just have to say something about how palm reading is just reading things about a person , if you know them it is easier .
Gosh Mark , this was so easy to do , he just filled in all the details as I said stuff which just led on to more things .
I could have “ read ” him for an hour and not repeated myself .
It was very odd .
Now I ’m kinda mad at myself .
But it is done and I need your advise on how to handle this as I do n’t like the idea of letting people believe that I can read palms .
I can read people and so can most people , maybe that is what I can say .
Maybe I can give an example as a way it is done ..
I could say , ‘ Lets see if you can do this also . ’
I can point to someone in the place and say , ‘ tell me what you see about that person ’ then I can help them make general statements about them , ‘ they love to eat ’ or ‘ they love the outdoors ’ just by looking at them and explain how we make those general statements .
I think that is how I ’m going to handle it if it is brought up … ”
So we can certainly say in this case , a little knowledge proved to be somewhat dangerous ca n’t we ?
Perhaps just this sort of playful repartee is how a person like Sylvia Browne or James VanPraagh first fell into ?
Getting the credit and adulation of appearing psychic can quickly turn even the most high - minded skeptic down a dark path .
What starts out as a fun little lark can transform any social situation into a nightmare .
It ’s a fine line to cross .
When we are with friends , we do indeed know a lot about them , but we would n’t necessarily divulge what we really “ deep down ” think about them would we ?
People like Sylvia Browne who have learned how to get a hook into their prey and hold on for dear life do this all the time without the slightest twinge of remorse .
When you offer anyone a reading no matter what you use , you are setting yourself up for an experience that at its best can be entertaining .
Other times – not so much .
For a person who is skeptical , reticent or incapable of playing that role , it can be an uncomfortable ordeal .
It takes getting used to .
Even in jest , if you get hits ( and you will ) you ca n’t tell them it was all bullcrap – because much of what we would naturally see in a friend or relative is true !
What is a skeptic to do ?
Well , as they say ; if you ca n’t handle the heat , stay out of the kitchen .
This guru - psychic - medium stuff is best left to the …ahem , … professionals .
Professional con artists do n’t have a hard time at all .
In fact they love it when you fill in all the blanks with as much information as you can possibly give them .
How you re-package and sell it back to them in a cunning way is waht seprates the pros from the dabblers .
The real question that raises it ugly head is when this happens , ( at least in their minds ) … is it at all psychic ?
Of course not .
You and I knowm it is n’t , but Joe Average does n’t have a clue .
If you happen to get stuck in this bind , just BE HONEST .
It ’s that simple .
That ’s what I did for over ten years when I was on a 900 line and that ’s still how I handle my “ psychicness ” if it becomes a problem .
For example :
Tell them about the time they told you about their dog
Megs that they also conveniently forgot they told you about .
Let them know that facial expressions can sometimes literally allow you to “ read their mind . ”
Tell them about body language , NLP and that generalities fit everyone and the more privileged information you might have “ fed back ” to them was nothing any aware person who can read which way the wind blows might have offered .
They may fight and struggle to accept what you may need to say , but if you stay on point it will eventually sink in .
That pretty much takes the wind out of that sail quite quickly .
Two problems will likely present themselves :
1 ) Are you willing to make this type of “ breakthrough ” for the person … or are you beginning to see the benefits of this power tripping ?
Hmmmmmmm .
2 ) The second problem any honest person who gets caught up in this kind of situation usually faces is this :
Even though you get down on your hands and knees and beg for most people to accept these facts as the honest truth that was accessed through purely normal means , many people will still ascribe some connection with something psychic to you !
They may tell their friends , “ Well , … I know she knew about my dog Megs , but when she said I was going to do something creative like with art !
How could she have known that just yesterday I dragged that paint by numbers set out of the garage !
It ’s just unreal ! ”
So really , you ca n’t win .
Now on the other hand , if you want to make lots of money in your spare time …
BOTTOM LINE :
Try if you must to see for yourself how easy it is to be a psychic , it can be most illuminating .
But beware of the traps that will open up beneath your feet if you dare to become too accurate – even if that happens by mistake .
If you choose to let slepping dogs lie and carry on like a Sylvia wannabe , eventually you will have a terrible burden to shoulder if you have even the smallest bit of a conscience .
Trust me , I know .
I have been there and back and I still have qualms even when I ’m dressed as an obvious gypsy parody working a sideshow venue .
Yo Chip , Sylvia and VanPraagh : How are you sleeping these days ?
Are those big lumps of cash in your pillow cases keeping you awake at night ?
This racket is always new to somebody and a sucker IS born every minute .
Unless you are a legit counselor ( and there ’s plenty of sickos in that business too … ) it ’s probably best not to “ dabble ” with being a psychic .
Leave to us pros …
Our British readers will already be painfully familiar with the comical propensity that government officials ( even spies ! ) have for losing sensitive data while on the move .
It might be an idea , therefore , to give your forgetful local representative a break with one of these new Corsair USB drives .
The Padlock 2 features OS - agnostic password protection via the keypad you see above plus 256 - bit encryption of the data stored on the flash inside .
So even if someone is tenacious enough to pry the case open , he 'll have a hard time getting anything useful out of it .
Oh , and do n't worry about forgetting the passcode , there 's a procedure for wiping the drive clean and generating a new one .

Over the past four decades Israel has defrauded Palestinians working inside Israel of more than $ 2 billion by deducting from their salaries contributions for welfare benefits to which they were never entitled , Israeli economists have revealed .
A new report , “ State Robbery ” , to be published later this month , says the “ theft ” continued even after the Palestinian Authority was established in 1994 and part of the money was supposed to be transferred to a special fund on behalf of the workers .
According to information supplied by Israeli officials , most of the deductions from the workers ’ pay were invested in infrastructure projects in the Palestinian territories — a presumed reference to the massive state subsidies accorded to the settlements .
Nearly 50,000 Palestinians from the West Bank are working in Israel — following the easing of restrictions on entering Israel under the “ economic peace ” promised by Benjamin Netanyahu , the Israeli prime minister — and continue to have such contributions docked from their pay .
Complicit in the deception , the report adds , is the Histadrut , the Israeli labor federation , which levies a monthly fee on Palestinian workers , even though they are not entitled to membership and are not represented in labor disputes .
“ This is a clear - cut case of theft from Palestinian workers on a grand scale , ” said Shir Hever , a Jerusalem - based economist and one of the authors of the report .
“ There are no reasons for Israel to delay in returning this money either to the workers or to their beneficiaries . ”
The deductions started being made in 1970 , three years after the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began , when Palestinian workers started to enter Israel in significant numbers , most of them employed as manual laborers in the agriculture and construction industries .
Typically , the workers lose a fifth of their salary in deductions that are supposed to cover old age payments , unemployment allowance , disability insurance , child benefits , trade union fees , pension fund , holiday and sick pay , and health insurance .
In practice , however , the workers are entitled only to disability payments in case of work accidents and are insured against loss of work if their employer goes bankrupt .
According to the report , compiled by two human rights groups , the Alternative Information Center and Kav La’Oved , only a fraction of the total contributions — less than eight per cent — was used to award benefits to Palestinian workers .
The rest was secretly transferred to the finance ministry .
The Israeli organizations assess that the workers were defrauded of at least $ 2.25 bn in today ’s prices , in what they describe as a minimum and “ very conservative ” estimate of the misappropriation of the funds .
Such a sum represents about 10 per cent of the PA ’s annual budget .
The authors also note that they excluded from their calculations two substantial groups of Palestinian workers — those employed in the Jewish settlements and those working in Israel ’s black economy — because figures were too hard to obtain .
Mr Hever said the question of whether the bulk of the deductions — those for national insurance — had been illegally taken from the workers was settled by the Israeli High Court back in 1991 .
The judges accepted a petition from the flower growers ’ union that the government should return about $ 1.5 million in contributions from Palestinian workers in the industry .
“ The legal precedent was set then and could be used to reclaim the rest of these excessive deductions , ” he said .
At the height of Palestinian participation in the Israeli labor force , in the early 1990s , as many as one in three Palestinian workers was dependent on an Israeli employer .
Israel continued requiring contributions from Palestinian workers after the creation of the Palestinian Authority in 1994 , arguing that it needed to make the deductions to ensure Israeli workers remained competitive .
However , the report notes that such practices were supposed to have been curbed by the Oslo process .
Israel agreed to levy an “ equalization tax ” — equivalent to the excessive contributions paid by Palestinians — a third of which would be invested in a fund that would later be available to the workers .
In fact , however , the Israeli State Comptroller , a government watchdog official , reported in 2003 that only about a tenth of the money levied on the workers had actually been placed in the fund .
The finance ministry has admitted that most of the money taken from the workers was passed to Israeli military authorities in the Palestinian territories to pay for “ infrastructure programs ” .
Hannah Zohar , the director of Kav La’Oved who co-authored the report , said she believed that the ministry was actually referring to the construction of illegal settlements .
The report is also highly critical of the Histadrut , Israel ’s trade union federation , which it accuses of grabbing “ a piece of the pie ” by forcing Palestinian workers to pay a monthly “ organizing fee ” to the union since 1970 , even though Palestinians are not entitled to membership .
Despite the Histadrut ’s agreement with its Palestinian counterpart in 2008 to repay the fees , only 20 per cent was returned , leaving $ 30 m unaccounted for .
The Histadrut was also implicated in another “ rip- off ” , said Mr Hever .
It agreed in 1990 to the Israeli construction industry ’s demand that Palestinian workers pay an extra two per cent tax to promote the training of recent Jewish immigrants , most of them from the former Soviet Union .
Mr Hever said that in effect the Palestinian laborers were required to “ subsidize the training of workers meant to replace them ” .
The funds were never used for the stated purpose but were mainly issued as grants to the families of Israeli workers .
In one especially cynical use of the funds , the report notes , the money was spent on portable stoves for soldiers involved in Israel ’s three - week attack on Gaza last year .
In response , the finance ministry called the report “ incorrect and misleading ” , and the Histadrut claimed it was “ full of lies ” .
However , neither provided rebuttals of the report ’s allegations or its calculations .
Mr Hever said the government body responsible for making the deductions , the department of payments , had initially refused to divulge any of its figures , but had partly relented after some statistics were made available through leaks from its staff .
Assef Saeed , a senior official in the Palestinian Authority ’s labor ministry , said the PA was keen to discuss the issue of the deductions , but that talks were difficult because of the lack of contacts between the two sides .
A version of this article originally appeared in The National , published in Abu Dhabi .
An Illinois House Democrat is planning to introduce a bill that would ban private security contractors , including Blackwater , from US military and intelligence operations .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) has circulated a letter among her colleagues asking them to co-sponsor the Stop Outsourcing Security ( SOS )
Act , which would “ responsibly phase out the use of private security contractors for functions that should be reserved for US military forces and government personnel , ” the letter states .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the letter , obtained by investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill , Schakowsky suggests that the recent controversies surrounding security contractor Blackwater were among her motivations for proposing the legislation .
“ As illustrated by the recent dismissal of the case against the Blackwater guards accused of killing 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad ’s Nisour Square in 2007 , prosecution of private security contractors who commit severe abuses remains exceedingly difficult , ” Schakowsky wrote .
When a federal judge dismissed the charges against five Blackwater guards late last year , on the argument that the State Department had promised them immunity for the testimony that was the backbone of the prosecution ’s case , Schakowsky told the LA Times , “ A question I ’ve been asking for a long time is , ‘ Can these private military contractors actually get away with murder ? ’
This indicates that the answer is yes . ”
Following news reports last November that the US military is using Blackwater in targeted killings inside Pakistan , Schakowsky wrote on her congressional Web site that “ what appears to be a deep relationship between Blackwater and the CIA should cause all Americans to take pause .
It is extremely dangerous for the US to become dependent on private contractors for military or intelligence operations . ”
As Scahill noted in his report , Schakowsky has tried this before .
In 2007 , she introduced a bill to ban security contractors from the military , garnering the support of only two senators : Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and then - Sen. Hillary Clinton .
“ Ironically , Clinton — now Secretary of State — is currently the US official responsible for most of Blackwater ’s contracts , ” Scahill wrote .

Mr. Obama was right when he said the banks owe “ an extraordinary commitment ” to taxpayers , and he got some promises to lend more .
But that would have been more convincing if the administration had held the banks ’ feet to the fire in the first place and had not agreed so quickly to freeing them from the bailout restraints .
The truth is that the taxpayers are still very much on the hook for a banking system that is shaping up to be much riskier than the one that led to disaster .
Big bank profits , for instance , still come mostly courtesy of taxpayers .
Their trading earnings are financed by more than a trillion dollars ’ worth of cheap loans from the Federal Reserve , for which some of their most noxious assets are collateral .
They benefit from immense federal loan guarantees , but they are not lending much .
Lending to business , notably , is very tight .
What profits the banks make come mostly from trading .
Many big banks are happy to depend on the lifeline from the Fed and hang onto their toxic assets hoping for a rebound in prices .
And the whole system has grown more concentrated .
Bank of America was considered too big to fail before the meltdown .
Since then , it has acquired Merrill Lynch .
Wells Fargo took over Wachovia .
And JPMorgan Chase gobbled up Bear Stearns .
If the goal is to reduce the number of huge banks that taxpayers must rescue at any cost , the nation is moving in the wrong direction .
The growth of the biggest banks ensures that the next bailout will have to be even bigger .
These banks will be more likely to take on excessive risk because they have the implicit assurance of rescue .
The White House ’s proposal to overhaul financial regulation has ideas for banks that are too big to fail .
The House passed a bill last week that would require big banks to have bigger capital cushions to absorb losses .
It gives the government authority to seize and dismantle big financial firms at imminent risk of failure and mandates banks to pay for a $ 150 billion fund to cover the costs of any future mess .
It grants regulators authority to limit the operations or even break up big banks deemed too risky , even if they appear healthy .

Mouse sperm cells team up with their kin in the race to fertilize eggs .
The sperm of some rodents form trains to speed their passage to the egg .
Fisher & Hoekstra
The sperm of a mouse can recognize and team up with sperm from the same male , US biologists have found .
The discovery is further evidence that , far from being simply shells loaded with DNA , sperm cells have evolved sophisticated social behaviours that aid them in the race to fertilize eggs .
The sperm of some rodent species form ' trains ' .
Up to several dozen cells attach to one another using hooks on their heads , and swim in concert .
A sperm train can swim up to 50 % faster than a lone cell .
Heidi Fisher and Hopi Hoekstra of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , studied the train - making behaviour of sperm cells of the deer mouse ( Peromyscus maniculatus ) and the oldfield deer mouse ( P. polionotus ) .
The mice live in different parts of North America , but they can interbreed successfully in the lab .
Each species ' sperm can form trains .
Fisher and Hoekstra used a dye to label the sperm of different males with different colours .
When the two species ' sperm was mixed in a Petri dish , three - quarters of all sperm teamed up with their own kind .
Oh Brother , where art thou ?
To test whether the sperms ' powers of recognition go beyond the ability to spot their own species , the researchers also mixed sperm from different males of the same species .
The oldfield deer mouse P. polionotus is largely monogamous , so the sperm from two males of this species are unlikely to find themselves in competition in the wild .
In this species , mixed sperm leads to mixed sperm trains .
Sperm from different P. polionotus males stick together .
Fisher & Hoekstra , Nature
P. maniculatus , by contrast , has a hectic sex life ; females have been seen mating with different males within the space of a minute , and the pups in a litter usually have several different fathers .
Its sperm stand a good chance of finding themselves racing the sperm of another P. maniculatus male to fertilize an egg .
When the sperm of two P. maniculatus individuals is mixed , the sperm separate out to form trains with sperm from the same male , even if the sperm came from two siblings .
" It 's quite shocking that the level of discrimination between littermates is the same as that between species , " says Fisher .
The team 's work is published online today in Nature1 .
" This study shows very elegantly that sperm have a fantastic ability to discriminate between kin and non-kin , " says animal - behaviour expert Tim Birkhead of the University of Sheffield , UK .
" When sperm were discovered in the 1600s , they were called ' animalcules ' — it was thought they were independent little organisms .
In a way , this work fulfils those original observations . "
Recognition puzzle
The greater selectiveness of P. maniculatus sperm for who they cooperate with makes sense in the light of the two species ' differing sex lives .
Only one sperm can fertilize any single egg , so all but one of the cells in the train are , in fact , going nowhere fast .
What 's more , many of the cells in the train prematurely trigger the reaction that is used to bore through the egg 's wall .
This speeds the train on its way , but amounts to suicide for the sperm that triggered the reaction .
The more genetically similar the winning sperm is to its train - mates , the more evolutionarily worthwhile their self - sacrifice becomes .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ability of sperm to recognize each other may well be common among sperm from promiscuous species , says evolutionary biologist Paula Stockley of the University of Liverpool , UK : " There 's no reason not to expect this to be a general effect . "
The next step , says Birkhead , is to work out how sperm recognize their brothers .
It could be a chemical marker that promiscuous male mice add to the sperms ' surface , he suggests , or it could be something that the sperm make themselves , depending on their genetic make - up .
For example , some unicellular yeast and slime moulds carry an extremely variable gene encoding a sticky protein that allows related cells to recognize and attach to one another .
Fisher suspects that the deer mice could have something similar .
In the weeks before and after the Copenhagen climate change conference last December , the science of climate change came under harsh attack by critics who contend that climate scientists have deliberately suppressed evidence — and that the science itself is severely flawed .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the global group of experts charged with assessing the state of climate science , has been accused of bias .
The global public is disconcerted by these attacks .
If experts cannot agree that there is a climate crisis , why should governments spend billions of dollars to address it ?
The fact is that the critics — who are few in number but aggressive in their attacks — are deploying tactics that they have honed for more than 25 years .
During their long campaign , they have greatly exaggerated scientific disagreements in order to stop action on climate change , with special interests like Exxon Mobil footing the bill .
Many books have recently documented the games played by the climate - change deniers .
Merchants of Doubt , a new book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway set for release in mid-2010 , will be an authoritative account of their misbehaviour .
The authors show that the same group of mischief - makers , given a platform by the free - market ideologues of The Wall Street Journal 's editorial page , has consistently tried to confuse the public and discredit the scientists whose insights are helping to save the world from unintended environmental harm .
Today 's campaigners against action on climate change are in many cases backed by the same lobbies , individuals , and organisations that sided with the tobacco industry to discredit the science linking smoking and lung cancer .
Later , they fought the scientific evidence that sulphur oxides from coal - fired power plants were causing " acid rain . "
Then , when it was discovered that certain chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) were causing the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere , the same groups launched a nasty campaign to discredit that science , too .
Later still , the group defended the tobacco giants against charges that second - hand smoke causes cancer and other diseases .
And then , starting mainly in the 1980s , this same group took on the battle against climate change .
What is amazing is that , although these attacks on science have been wrong for 30 years , they still sow doubts about established facts .
The truth is that there is big money backing the climate - change deniers , whether it is companies that do n't want to pay the extra costs of regulation , or free - market ideologues opposed to any government controls .
The latest round of attacks involves two episodes .
The first was the hacking of a climate - change research centre in England .
The emails that were stolen suggested a lack of forthrightness in the presentation of some climate data .
Whatever the details of this specific case , the studies in question represent a tiny fraction of the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to the reality and urgency of man-made climate change .
The second issue was a blatant error concerning glaciers that appeared in a major IPCC report .
Here it should be understood that the IPCC issues thousands of pages of text .
There are , no doubt , errors in those pages .
But errors in the midst of a vast and complex report by the IPCC point to the inevitability of human shortcomings , not to any fundamental flaws in climate science .
When the emails and the IPCC error were brought to light , editorial writers at The Wall Street Journal launched a vicious campaign describing climate science as a hoax and a conspiracy .
They claimed that scientists were fabricating evidence in order to obtain government research grants — a ludicrous accusation , I thought at the time , given that the scientists under attack have devoted their lives to finding the truth , and have certainly not become rich relative to their peers in finance and business .
But then I recalled that this line of attack — charging a scientific conspiracy to drum up " business " for science — was almost identical to that used by The Wall Street Journal and others in the past , when they fought controls on tobacco , acid rain , ozone depletion , second - hand smoke , and other dangerous pollutants .
In other words , their arguments were systematic and contrived , not at all original to the circumstances .
We are witnessing a predictable process by ideologues and right - wing think tanks and publications to discredit the scientific process .
Their arguments have been repeatedly disproved for 30 years — time after time — but their aggressive methods of public propaganda succeed in causing delay and confusion .
Climate change science is a wondrous intellectual activity .
Great scientific minds have learned over the course of many decades to " read " the Earth 's history , in order to understand how the climate system works .
They have deployed brilliant physics , biology , and instrumentation ( such as satellites reading detailed features of the Earth 's systems ) in order to advance our understanding .
And the message is clear : large - scale use of oil , coal , and gas is threatening the biology and chemistry of the planet .
We are fuelling dangerous changes in Earth 's climate and ocean chemistry , giving rise to extreme storms , droughts , and other hazards that will damage the food supply and the quality of life of the planet .
The IPCC and the climate scientists are telling us a crucial message .
We need urgently to transform our energy , transport , food , industrial , and construction systems to reduce the dangerous human impact on the climate .
It is our responsibility to listen , to understand the message , and then to act .

Das Bundeszentralamt für Steuern ( BZSt ) hat im Jahr 2009 auf Ersuchen von Finanzämtern und Sozialbehörden insgesamt 43.066 Kontostammdaten abgerufen .
Das sind fast 10.000 Abfragen oder 28 Prozent mehr als noch im Vorjahr , meldet die Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung .
Im Vergleich zu 2005 , als das Kontenabrufverfahren eingeführt wurde , habe sich die Zahl der Datenzugriffe sogar verfünffacht .
Bereits im August zeichnete sich eine deutlich steigende Tendenz für das vergangene Jahr ab .
Damals war bekannt geworden , dass das BZSt allein im ersten Halbjahr 17.626 Kontenabrufe durchgeführt hatte .
Weiterhin steigendes Interesse an den Kontenübersichten haben vor allem die Sozialbehörden .
Bearbeitete das Bundeszentralamt 2008 noch 2109 Anfragen aus diesem Bereich , waren es dem Bericht zufolge im vergangenen Jahr bereits 5775 .
Das entspricht einem Zuwachs von 173 Prozent .
Neben Finanzämtern sind zudem Arbeitsämter vorne in der Statistik mit dabei .
Der Zugriff auf den Datenpool wird vom BZSt gesteuert .
Über einen erfolgten Kontenabruf werden Betroffene im Steuerbescheid informiert .
Die Einzelheiten regeln das Kreditwesengesetz und die Abgabenordnung .
Voraussetzung für eine Abfrage ist ein konkreter Verdacht .
Erhärtet sich dieser , kann von Banken die Offenlegung von Guthaben und Kontobewegungen beansprucht werden .
Für separat erfolgende Abfragen von Strafverfolgungsbehörden ist die Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht ( BaFin ) zuständig .
Diese werden in einer getrennten Statistik erfasst .
Ein Sprecher des Bundesfinanzministeriums erklärte die Zunahme der Abrufzahlen mit dem Hinweis , dass das noch vergleichsweise junge Instrument nach einer Anlaufzeit nun offenbar voll in Anspruch genommen werde .
Dies diene der Steuerehrlichkeit und der Gerechtigkeit .
Für Thilo Weichert , Leiter des Unabhängigen Landeszentrums für Datenschutz Schleswig- Holstein ( ULD ) , ist die Entwicklung dagegen besorgniserregend .
Er forderte die Bundesregierung auf , das Verfahren der Kontenabrufe restriktiver zu handhaben .
Das einfache System über das Bundeszentralamt ermutigt seiner Ansicht nach geradezu zum Datenzugriff .
Je mehr sich das Verfahren in der Praxis etabliere , desto exzessiver kontrollierten die Behörden .
Dabei würden nicht immer die gesetzlichen Einschränkungen beachtet .
CDU / CSU und FDP hatten sich im Herbst in ihrer Koalitionsvereinbarung darauf verständigt , das Kontenabrufverfahren " überprüfen " zu wollen .
Seitdem ist in diesem Bereich aber offenbar wenig passiert .
Die Liberalen hatten zunächst eine Einschränkung der Befugnisse für die Abfragen der Kontostammdaten angestrebt , konnten sich damit aber nicht gegen die Union durchsetzen .

( CNN ) -- Abu Dhabi stepped in to help troubled fellow emirate Dubai and its state - owned holding company , Dubai World , with $ 10 billion in financing on Monday .
The announcement by the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee comes as $ 4.1 billion in Islamic bonds became due today .
" The remaining funds would also provide for interest expenses and company working capital through April 30 , 2010 - conditioned on the company being successful in negotiating a standstill as previously announced , " Sheikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum , Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee said in a statement released Monday .
Dubai World shocked investors globally when it asked Nov. 25 for a debt standstill at Dubai World , the government 's flagship holding company , for payments owed on its $ 26 billion in debts .
The holding company includes DP World , the shipping magnate , Nakheel , developer of some of the city 's largest projects and investment company Ishitar .
Some of its foreign investments include the QE2 cruise liner and Cirque du Soleil .
The company asked for a standstill of debts owed until May 30 as it begins restructuring its debt .
" Today the Government of Dubai will announce a comprehensive reorganization law , a framework that is based upon internationally accepted standards for transparency and creditor protection , " the statement said .
" This law will be available should Dubai World and its subsidiaries be unable to achieve an acceptable restructuring of its remaining obligations . "

It 's not news to regular C&L readers that militias are forming again in rural areas , a reality confirmed this summer by the SPLC .
It 's deja vu all over again .
And just as they did in the '90s , they 're all insisting they really are just sincere patriots concerned about the looming tyranny of the federal government .
And just as in the '90s , journalists are lapping it up .
The chief beneficiaries of this parachute - style journalism have been the reformed Michigan Militia , which was previously profiled by CNN in similarly heartwarming fashion .
Two reports this week on the Michigan Militia continued in this vein , though they at least contained some notes indicating that something darker is at work with militia organizing than the image the militiamen themselves want to cultivate -- that of ordinary citizens who are being civic - minded and patriotic .
Which is true .
What 's also true is that they 're jacked up on large doses of paranoia about a " tyranny " that simply does n't exist ( particularly a fear that President Obama plans to take their guns away ) .
What 's striking to me is how they sound just like the militiamen I met in the 1990s when they knew reporters were around ( and , as we learned eventually , it was quite different from the way they talked among themselves in private ) .
But even then , they sounded fairly extreme and marginal in their beliefs .
Now , they sound just like your average Tea Partier .
Indeed , it 's remarkable how much their rhetoric is echoes Glenn Beck .
One report , from Michigan NPR Radio , was reasonably careful in dealing with the subject :
It 's a Wednesday night in February , and 22 men and one woman are gathered at Mayberry 's Restaurant in Farmington Hills .
They 're all Caucasian .
Some are middle - aged , out of shape ; others are in their twenties , and fit .
This is the militia 's monthly business meeting .
It 's also recruitment night .
You also get the feeling that the militiamen are overhyping the success of their recruitment efforts :
Only one potential new member shows up at the meeting .
Jeff is in his early thirties , he has a wife and a new baby .
He 's deeply distrustful of the government and he believes something is to about happen , probably the collapse of the American economy .
" Well , I feel like I can't rely on our elected officials , I can't rely on our military who works for our government , so bottom line is we have to have somebody to rely on , " he says .
This is fairly typical of the paranoia that was common to the '90s militias as well .
Of course , if you watch Glenn Beck regularly and believe the garbage he peddles , then you 're probably going to be in a similar state of mind .
They 're also fearful about their guns , still :
Protecting the Second Amendment is the primary reason for the militia 's existence .
Jeff is 42 .
He 's a rifle team leader .
He believes the current administration is sneaking around the back door to take his guns away , and he wants the right to protect his family during an emergency " Okay , I 've got this food , I 've got this water , " he says .
" I need to be able to defend that from people that do n't .
In a time of need , a couple of weeks without food and water and gasoline , people are going to be hungry .
And they 're going to do desperate things to do whatever they can to feed their families . "
Right .
Sounds a lot like that scenario
Beck 's guest offered just the other day .
The second piece on the Michiganders was from WWMT - TV , and it contained largely more of the same .
In it , militia leader Lee Miracle does offer a novel reason why it 's unfair to connect the militias to Tim McVeigh :
“ Let 's say after the Oklahoma City bombing they said Timothy McVeigh , a known bread eater , blew up a building .
Now when you go the store and buy some bread they 're going to say , ' Oh he 's eating bread just like Timothy McVeigh , ' ” said Miracle .
Well , if there were something in bread that made a person a person believe in conspiracy theories and various " facts " about incipient government tyranny that eventually will enslave all Americans , then this might be an accurate analogy .
Because all that is true of the militias , and has a powerful causal connections to the motives of people like McVeigh when they set off bombs and commit terrorist acts .
It is not , however , true of bread .
Which is why one can't help be darkly amused when the WWMT reporter asks Miracle if there 's any chance he could suddenly become a violent terrorist with a gun .
His answer :
“ No , I 'm a postal worker . "
Somehow , that 's less than assuring .

The former British Airways pilot whose Boeing 777 airliner crash - landed at Heathrow Airport two years ago has said he feared all onboard would die .
Captain Peter Burkill told the BBC he had to stop the jet crashing into a Tube station near the runway .
He and his co-pilot were hailed as heroes for avoiding a disaster .
An investigation into the crash has found the plane lost power because fuel flowing into the engines had become restricted by a build up of ice .
In his first interview since the accident , Mr Burkill said he continued to be affected on a daily basis by what had happened .
No warning
The airliner , which had 152 people on board , came down short of Heathrow 's southern runway - but inside the airfield perimeter - on 17 January 2008 .
Mr Burkill said : " I always think about it - as well as my wife - it will probably never leave me . "
He told the BBC 's transport correspondent Tom Symonds that the plane lost power just as it was landing .
He said : " It was about 35 seconds until we were due to touch down and it was about 500 ft ( 152.4 m ) - when we were just passing the north - side of Hounslow Heath , we were about two miles ( 3.22 km ) from the landing runway when we became aware there was a problem . "
There had been no warning until that point that there was failure with the power in both of the plane 's engines and Mr Burkill said the Boeing 's pilots were initially in disbelief .
Captain Peter Burkill said he had to make split second decisions " It naturally became apparent that we were going to crash and we were not going to make the runway " .
He said since he was the captain , it was fairly important for him to begin to react immediately in order to ensure nobody died because of the crash .
" My view of that accident from that point was that we were going to start descending very quickly - about an 1,800 ft ( 548.64 m ) descent rate and I could see the impact point was going to be around about the Hatton Cross area which includes catering buildings , a Tube station and a petrol station , " he said .
He told co-pilot John Coward to continue flying the plane while Mr Burkill tried to find out the cause of the problem in a bid to try to fix it .
He said the priority was to get the plane over any buildings and away from the Heathrow perimeter road .
It was a situation none of those on board had trained for and he said the atmosphere in the cockpit was quiet as everyone concentrated on getting the plane to land safely .
" I had no time to communicate any decisions with my crew , " Mr Burkill said .
He decided to use a non-standard procedure and in a bid to reduce the drag force as the plane touched down , took the decision to raise the plane 's landing flaps .
Pilots John Coward and Peter Burkill were hailed as heroes at the time
He said : " When I realised we were coming in far too steeply with the loss of power and we were heading towards the buildings , I had to reduce the drag , and as we were going to crash on ground , I needed the [ landing ] gear .
" The gear was going to take most of the brunt of the crash so I dare n't raise that up . "
His only other decision was to raise the flaps by one setting which would reduce the drag from the wings , but he said there was a risk with doing that as it could change the " stall margins " and the plane could have fallen out of the sky .
But by reducing the drag , the rate of descent decreased and the plane was no longer at risk of hitting the buildings .
He said when the plane hit the ground he reverted from being the captain and became just like all the other passengers .
He coughed as he said : " We were now in an aircraft on the ground that was sliding uncontrollably and at that point I thought I was going to die , so I said goodbye to my wife . "
After the plane stopped , he looked around at his two co-pilots and when they realised none of them were injured , they could not initially believe it .
However Mr Burkill said his next priority was to carry out an evacuation of the aircraft as there was still the fear a fire could break out .
I'm a tried and tested emergency pilot
Peter Burkill
However the final report into the Heathrow crash by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) has said that no fault could be attached to the pilots , who had completed proper procedures .
The official accident report said the crash happened after the plane lost power because there was a restricted " fuel flow " to both its engines caused by a build - up of ice .
The investigators have made several safety recommendations which follow on from an initial set of recommendations made in September last year .
Mr Burkill , who took voluntary redundancy from British Airways last year , said he was still looking for a new flying role .
He said : " I did a good job on the the day and I believe with the best outcome which has not been proved wrong - and it's never been bettered , so I 'm a tried and tested emergency pilot "
He said he had received letters of thanks from some of the passengers on board , but said he and his co-pilot had just been doing their jobs .

An 8.8 - magnitude earthquake struck central Chile early Saturday .
Rescuers searched for victims and survivors after an apartment complex was knocked onto its back in Concepción .
Associated Press
James Dillon has written some of the UK 's most important music - and last night won another major award .
Why is he better known abroad ?
Andrew Clements reports .
Meanwhile , Tom Service names five other neglected composers
By his own admission , James Dillon likes to stay on the fringes of Britain 's musical life .
He 's never seen at high - profile premieres , and is extremely reluctant to be photographed .
He was once associated with composers such as Brian Ferneyhough and Michael Finnissy , in what became known as the " new complexity " movement , but Dillon 's music has always been very much his own , showing only the most superficial connections to that of his contemporaries .
Over 70 % of performances of his music take place abroad ( his own estimate ) , but he is unquestionably one of Britain 's leading composers .
Last night his Fourth String Quartet received this year 's Royal Philharmonic Society award for chamber - scale composition .
Unprecedentedly , it is the third time in the last 10 years that one of Dillon 's works has won the RPS prize .
This is a measure not only of how his work is valued by his peers , but also of how its complex rhythms and teeming , densely detailed surfaces ( which give him a superficial connection with a composer such as Ferneyhough ) pack such a direct , expressive impact .
Dillon 's musical language may have the rigour of 20th - century modernism behind it , but it also carries the weight of the musical tradition , and seems fully aware of its debt to the past .
Born in Glasgow in 1950 , Dillon was virtually self - taught musically , yet he is now one of that rare breed of composers who manages to support himself entirely through his commissions .
" I live cheaply , " he says .
" I 've never had money . "
In his teens , his first interest was pop music , or more specifically rhythm and blues , and he formed his first band at the age of 13 .
" It was really the Rolling Stones first , and on the back of their recording sleeves I discovered names like Muddy Waters , Lightnin ' Hopkins and the Delta blues .
It was also a time when lots of dance was coming through from the States - Tamla Motown and Stax , and so I quickly moved away from the Stones . "
From the start , Dillon was playing guitar and writing his own songs - " I'm a total control freak , which meant I had to produce my own material " - and left school as soon as he had done his O - levels .
He did a foundation year at Glasgow School of Art , but knew he really wanted to be a musician .
" I did n't know how I would do it , and I remember odd experiences in which I imagined musical ideas that I did n't know how to place . "
The way forward came by happy accident , when Dillon was living in a communal house in Cornwall .
" Someone turned up with some LPs that he had swapped for dope , and among them was a version of The Rite of Spring and some Webern played by the Italian Quartet .
I was completely perplexed by the Webern .
I realised that either this music was completely crazy , or that I had to learn a lot more about music .
For me , the biggest source of information was the back of record sleeves , just as it had been for rock 'n'roll , and there I read about something called the Second Viennese School - I did n't even know what the First Viennese School was .
I 've always been rather curious , and I soon realised here was an open field which had a resonance for me , a place where things were not circumscribed . "
Dillon moved to London as soon as he could .
" I thought I could get lost there , just do what I wanted , which was to work , and get away from the scene I was in , which was dominated by pop music and drugs . "
He was lucky , too , in arriving in the capital at the same time Pierre Boulez was starting his Roundhouse concerts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra , programming brand new works alongside the modernist classics .
For Dillon , it was a perfect way in .
" The irony was that I knew the Roundhouse as a rock venue where I had seen the Doors and the Stones , so I felt more at home there than I ever did at the South Bank . "
He switched to playing classical guitar and discovered John Dowland at the same time as he was discovering Xenakis and Stockhausen .
" I was n't interested in the period the music came from , only in whether it spoke to me . "
By then he had decided that he would n't go to music college .
" I thought it was too late , although I did wonder how I could get to study with Messiaen , how I could find the money to go to Paris .
His was the name that kept coming up , and in his music of the 1960s I found an amazing balance between intellectual rigour and sensual speech .
It fascinated me that you could drag this language into a space that I could recognise . "
From the Greek Xenakis , too , he learnt it was no longer necessary for a composer to feel part of the central European tradition , that coming from the west of Scotland , on the Atlantic fringe of Europe , was perhaps an advantage .
Dillon 's first public performance was a " little piano piece " at the inaugural Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in 1978 .
" Up to that point I had been writing things that were either never performed or were a bad experience , " he says .
After that , though , there were no miscalculations , just a constant stream of works , many of which he has tended to group in cycles or series .
This was a consequence of his growing frustration with the structure of traditional concerts , he says , which he describes as " a parade of unconnected works with all the disruptions between them .
One of the things that I did carry over from my experience of popular music was the notion that you do n't break the enchantment , that going to a concert is like stepping into the magic circle .
This was utopic of course , and the ideal was that one of these cycles would occupy a whole concert , but of course it has never happened . "
The most important of these cycles is Nine Rivers , a series of nine vocal , electronic and ensemble works that dominated Dillon 's output through the late 1980s and 1990s .
It 's one of the most significant achievements in British music in the last quarter century , but because of the sheer logistics and expense of mounting a performance , it has yet to be heard complete .
A full cycle is , however , planned for Strasbourg in 2008 ( " I 'll believe it when it happens " ) .
His first opera , Philomela , based on Ovid 's Metamorphoses , was premiered in Porto in 2004 , and also seen in Paris and Strasbourg , but so far there are no plans for it to be staged in the UK .
It would be a good project for Scottish Opera , I suggest , but Dillon is doubtful and seems to have given up hope of receiving any recognition in the country of his birth .
If you move abroad , even to England , he says , then Scotland forgets about you .
The intensely thoughtful , quietly spoken person one meets now is hard to square with the prickly reputation Dillon acquired in the early part of his career .
" If I look back at the early 1980s , part of what I was doing then was reacting against what was around me , and part of that was a frustration with the way in which British music had gone , so there was a certain bloody - mindedness if you like .
But it 's only in retrospect I can see that I was being confrontational .
Britain has always had a problematic relationship with modernism .
Though it was on its last legs by the time I was beginning , modernism still produced some extraordinary works . "
Yet he admits that he still feels uncomfortable if he senses he is becoming part of something ; he is far happier being an outsider , away from new - music politics .
The commissions come in steadily enough , and a new piano concerto will be performed at this year 's Proms ; a piece for the Orchestre de Paris is in progress .
Even so he is never entirely pleased with what he has composed .
" There are moments in pieces when I feel that my concentration has n't lapsed .
There are things that work quite well .
As Beckett said , you fail and try to fail better - I can live with that . "
· James Dillon 's piano concerto Andromeda will receive its first performance at the Proms on August 10 .
The RPS Music Awards will be broadcast on Radio 3 on May 10
Laptops , ensembles and a piece called XXX Live Nude Girls !!!
Brian Ferneyhough
Now professor of music at Stanford University , California , Coventry - born Ferneyhough has reached the heights of contemporary - music fame : on the continent at least .
There are precious few performances of his music here , although you can hear the UK premiere of his fifth String Quartet at this year 's Aldeburgh festival ( box office : 01728 687110 ) .
He 's credited with starting " new complexity " , the movement - even if it's a label he now rejects - thanks to the sheer calligraphic density and difficulty of his scores .
Michael Finnissy
Probably Britain's most prolific composer , Finnissy has one of the most diverse catalogues of any composer working today .
A leftwing radical , he takes an uncompromising intellectual stance , but the heady textures of pieces such as his Verdi Transcriptions and Gershwin Arrangements for solo piano are sensuous and attractive .
Apart from a dedicated following at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and concerts at the British Music Information Centre 's Cutting Edge series , his music is shamefully under - represented on concert programmes in the UK .
Richard Barrett
Another leftwing radical , 46 - year - old Richard Barrett has made his career in Germany and Holland , and he's as active a laptop improviser as he is a composer of chamber and orchestral pieces .
The ensemble Elision has created a performance tradition for his music in Australia , but he hardly ever appears in the repertoires of new music ensembles such as the London Sinfonietta in this country .
Now lives and works in London , so perhaps his time is coming .
Jennifer Walshe
Irish - born Walshe , 32 this year , trained in Scotland and Chicago and now lives in Berlin .
Her work uses radical forms of theatre and often explores pop culture - typical titles include XXX Live Nude Girls !!!
and He Wants His Cowboys to Sound Like How He Thinks Cowboys Should Sound .
A rising star in Germany and also in America , we do n't know enough of her music here .
Joanna Bailie
Thirty - three - year - old Bailie , born in London , is another young composer who has made her career anywhere but in the UK : Holland , then New York , and now Brussels , where she set up Ensemble Plus - Minus .
Her fastidious , ambiguous music gets the odd performance by Plus - Minus and the ensemble Apartment House .
There 's a rare chance to hear a performance of her Five Famous Adagios this Saturday at LSO St Luke's , London EC1 ( box office : 020-8576 1227 ) .
The mental and emotional storm that struck America on 11 September 2001 with the attacks on New York and Washington has been recreated with the release of more than half a million pager messages sent on that day .
The whistleblowing website Wikileaks published the messages over a 24 - hour period beginning on Tuesday at dawn , releasing them in batches in chronological order as if in real time .
The massive archive includes thousands of messages from US officials including Pentagon workers and New York police , as well as members of the public from all over America , which together provide an insight into the initial chaos and confusion , followed by a dawning horror as 9/11 unfolded .
The released messages begin by underlining what an ordinary day it had started out to be .
At 7.55 am CNN puts out its world news headlines : Israel has surrounded yet another West Bank city ; Michael Jordan is making yet another return to pro basketball " for the love of the game " .
By 8.18 am , four minutes after American Airlines flight 11 was hijacked en route from Boston to Los Angeles , the country is gearing itself up for work .
" Not good yesterday goal $ 21,175 . actual $ 11,455 , " came one message .
At 8.46 and 46 seconds , six seconds after flight 11 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre , the following message is paged : " Market data inconsistent … Cantor API problem Trading system offline . "
The global financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald had its offices on the 101st to 105th floors of the north tower and lost 658 employees in the devastation .
Quickly , the media began catching up with events , and viewers were picking up on the news .
At 8.50 am Karen sends out a message saying : " CNN SAID THEY THINK IT WAS A PLANE THAT HIT THE BLDG . "
Most of the messages put out by Wikileaks have nothing to do with the events of that fateful day , being routine service messages and random communications between individuals .
But amid the fog of thousands of messages , they build up a picture of a pre-eminent event in history .
The website has declined to reveal how it obtained the documents .
All it would say on the subject was : " It is clear that the information comes from an organisation which has been intercepting and archiving US national telecommunications since prior to 9/11 . "
It added : " We hope that its entry into the historical record will lead to a more nuanced understanding of how this tragedy and its aftermath may have been prevented . "
Several of the pager messages point to the mass of confusion and rumour - mongering that set in after the first plane hit the north tower .
At 8.50 am a message says that a bomb has been detonated in the World Trade Centre .
A minute later , Teresa messages : " THE WORLD TRADE CENTER HAS JUST BLOWN UP , WE SEEN THE EXPLOSION OUTSIDE OUR WINDOWS . "
By 8.53 am , seven minutes after the plane went in , the New York police operations division is still in the dark .
" POSSIBLE EXPLOSION WORLD TRADE CENTER BUILDING , " it tells its officers as it announces the start of its highest - level mobilisation to downtown Manhattan .
Meanwhile , for many , ordinary life continues .
Also at 8.53 am , Melissa messages her loved one : " Did you turn the iron off ? " and Heather sends a message that reads : " Why do n't YOU come sit on MY lap and kiss me :-) " .
But elsewhere , anxiety is starting to set in .
Numerous notes are sent urging colleagues , friends and relatives to tune in to what is happening .
" TURN ON CNN Sat channel 202 ASAP ! " says Robert Sargent .
Then , equally swiftly , come the messages pleading for information that will indicate loved ones are safe : " LARRY , CALL BRIAN .
WANT TO KNOW IF OUR MEN ARE OKAY , SAW A PLANE HIT BLDG . "
At that point , most people thought it was a small plane , and probably an accident , but many were worried none the less .
" A SMALL PLANE CRASHED INTO THE WORLD TRADE CTR IN N.Y .
JUST NOW .
CALL ME , LOVE YOUR WIFE . "
Panic sets in only after the south tower is hit at 9.03 am .
" HUGE explosion just rocked the World Trade Center , " comes a text a minute later .
" The second tower is now on fire . "
Once again , confusion reigned .
A message sent at 9.04 am said that the fuselage of the first plane at the north tower had caused a second explosion – misinterpreting the second strike at the south tower .
Through the morning , false leads multiply as terror sets in .
A mistaken alarm is put out about a car bomb in downtown Washington , a report of " two Arab males " detained at the presidential retreat at Camp David , and a text that an aircraft had hit the White House .
But the scale and nature of the attacks is also quickly realised .
The first mention of a " terrorist attack " comes at 9.05 am , just two minutes after the second plane strikes .
By 10.48 am , 20 minutes after both the towers have collapsed , the finger is already being pointed at al - Qaida by individual pagers .
" I guess we are not going tonight ! " messages Duane .
" I want some Bin Landen [ sic ] ass ! "

LP Texas chairman Pat Dixon speaks about " spoiling " in the Texas Tribune , January 25 , 2010 :
Dixon does n’t care if his candidates take votes away from the major parties .
You ca n’t spoil an election if the mainstream parties are already rotten , he says .
“ [ Spoiling ] would be a concern if there were candidates on the ballot on either the Democratic or Republican parties who were really close enough that we would rather have them in office , ” he said .
Dixon pointed to the fact that Libertarians often do not run against U.S. Rep.
Ron Paul , who represents the more libertarian element of the Republican Party , and who was the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 1988 .
Ironically , this year a Libertarian will be challenging Paul for his seat .
In the wake of various events over the last few months , players on all sides of the legislative and political battlefield are attempting to move the debate their way .
The Massachusetts election , the failure of the Copenhagen Conference to reach a binding treaty to curb global warming , the continuing difficulties that Democrats are having getting any major legislation through the Senate , all have altered the debate somewhat .
Some of the efforts by conservatives are mainly for the benefit of their own choir , while others are serious attempts to prevent any action by Congress or the president .
Some efforts by Democrats and Obama are positive steps to push through meaningful change or reach reasonable compromise , while others back away from a forthright environmental position .
Conservatives are seizing on a typo in the last International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report , which mistakenly appeared to predict the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers by 2035 , instead of the intended 2350 !
The conservatives and climate change deniers are trying to make this into a major scandal that refutes the entire scientific consensus about human - caused global climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions .
This , like the earlier “ scandal ” about some e-mails from a climate change scientist which in these folks ’ fevered imaginations seemed to imply an effort to exaggerate the data , is a tempest in a teapot , a minor glitch almost everyone will forget about soon .
Another piece of news the deniers will no doubt trumpet as refuting human - caused global warming is the reevaluation of the role of water vapor in climate change .
One major study recently concluded that water vapor might account for as much as one - third of global warming .
In other words , the conclusion of this study was that greenhouse gas emissions account for two - thirds of global warming , still hugely significant .
However , this will be portrayed as “ proving ” that humans are n’t causing global warming , so we should just shut up and adjust , and especially shut up about limiting greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the profits of energy companies .
Meanwhile , all indications are that global warming is speeding up , with potential dire consequences for the entire human race .
It is getting harder to ignore the mounting evidence , so conservatives are shouting even louder in an attempt to drown out that evidence .
Obama , in his State of the Union speech , again pushed the Senate to pass a version of the energy / climate change bill already passed by the House .
The Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps to plan the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions , if Congress does n’t act , which ups the pressure on Congress , and on the Democrats from coal - producing states who oppose carbon dioxide regulation .
As a result , Lisa Murkowski , Republican senator from Alaska , has introduced legislation to prevent the EPA from regulating carbon emissions .
While this bill has little chance of passing either the Senate or the House , it is part of the conservative effort to make this a politically more volatile issue , to put the White House on the defensive .
Obama , in his State of the Union speech , also upped his rhetoric supporting the rapid development of more nuclear power , and again expressed support for the idea of “ clean coal , ” which may be an attempt to win enough conservative and Blue Dog support for an energy / climate change bill .
But these are examples of what used to be called “ triangulation ” when practiced by Bill Clinton , giving in to some conservative pressures in order to win some legislative victories , even at the cost of diluting those victories significantly .
While there has been an important shift in tone with the Obama administration on climate change issues , the U.S. remains far behind both Europe and China in many areas of environmental and energy policy .
China is already producing far more wind turbines to generate electricity using wind power than the U.S. or any other country , putting China on track to meet its goals for production of renewable energy .
The European Union has an active carbon trading market ( what is referred to in this country as “ cap - and - trade ” ) which while deeply flawed is actually functioning and beginning to reduce carbon emissions .
The popular movement for real environmental action , while enjoying majority support in polls , has not yet managed to organize enough of a political force to require Congress to act .
We ca n’t count on Obama , the Democrats in Congress , or the renewable energy industry to solve this problem ; it demands more concerted organized efforts .
For all the discussion of “ green jobs , ” not enough is being done to create green jobs , to shift the production of energy to renewables , to limit greenhouse gas pollution , nor to reach a binding , enforceable international agreement .
There has been a lot of talk around the league about what a great addition Ray Whitney would be to any team looking to help themselves down the playoff stretch .
The winger 's name has been mentioned almost every day in a variety of possible scenarios .
Yesterday , Bob McKenzie from TSN reported that Whitney was almost traded to the Los Angeles Kings , but when he was approached for approval because of the " no trade clause " built into his contract , he demanded a three year contract extension .
" The Wizard " is known for his practical jokes , but no one was amused with his request .
Many thought the 37 year old would be reasonable when it came to doing what was best for the team , but if what McKenzie is reporting is true , then that obviously is not the case .
And really , why should it be ?
Whitney is in the twilight of his career and is most likely looking to exploit the situation .
One probably should not blame a player for doing that because they only have so many years in which to make the millions that they make .
But one might ask the question , why does he have the " No Trade Clause " to begin with ?
It would seem that these types of clauses , which give players so much control and literally tie the hands of general managers , would be few and far between .
But not so with the Hurricanes .
For instance Niclas Wallin also has one , and has used it in the past when the Hurricanes tried to trade him previously .
It 's been reported that the franchise would like to try to trade him again right now , and there has been interest by other teams .
But why would he approve the deal ?
Players who request " no trade clauses " , probably want them because they do not want to move .
So it would also seem logical that once they have acquired that right , they would usually be unwilling to waive it , unless the perfect scenario presented itself .
That is probably the case with Whitney , as he might be looking for the perfect scenario , one that would guarantee him a multimillion dollar salary until he 's 40 years old .
In the meantime , Jim Rutherford 's kindness , ( or short - sightedness ) , could end up costing the Hurricanes the best possible prospects because Whitney is not going to make his decision based upon what is best for the Carolina Hurricanes , he 's going to make a decision which best benefits Ray Whitney .
While rumored acquisition target Colten Teubert would be exactly what the doctor ordered to bolster the organization 's defensive depth , the Hurricanes might end up with a lower rated prospect because a player has the final say on a trade , and not the general manager .
Hence the danger of the dreaded " no trade clause " .
JAKARTA , Indonesia 
A statue of President Barack Obama as a 10 - year - old boy was transferred Monday from a public park here to an elementary school that Mr. Obama attended as a child .
The removal of the statue came after criticism of its placement by Indonesian users of Facebook .
Officials in Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia , bowed to protesters who said that the park should be reserved to honor Indonesians and that Mr. Obama had yet to make any particular contributions to the country .
Financed by a $ 10,000 donation from local supporters of the president , the 43 - inch bronze statue was unveiled in December in the park , located in Menteng , the neighborhood where Mr. Obama lived with his mother and Indonesian stepfather in the late 1960s .
The statue shows the boy  known at the time as Barry  in shorts and a T - shirt , smiling as a butterfly lands on his left thumb .

Opposition and pro-government Iranians are preparing to take to the streets of Iran on Thursday to mark the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution , in a political and ideological showdown set to shape the future of Iran .
Supreme religious leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has promised that the West and Iran ’s enemies would be “ stupefied ” by an unprecedented show of support for the regime .
But every senior leader of Iran ’s opposition – the so - called Green Movement that grew out of disputed elections last June – has also called for huge turnout on a day that has always been considered by many Iranians as more a nationalistic than pro-regime event .
“ It ’s going to be a big show of force , a big competition between the two sides over who can rule this day – and who can lay claim to the legacy of the revolution , ” says Ahmad Sadri , an Iran specialist at Lake Forest College in Illinois .
At issue are fundamental questions that have been fought over in the streets , in the prisons , and from the pulpits of Iran for eight months .
At stake is who are the true heirs of Iran 's revolution and its first promises of “ Independence , freedom , [ and ] Islamic Republic . ”
Weeks of violence were sparked last summer by the officially declared election landslide for incumbent hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , which many Iranians and analysts say was an impossible result achieved through fraud .
Protests since then have veered increasingly toward challenging Iran ’s entire Islamic system led by Ayatollah Khamenei .
But opposition leaders such as former prime minister and presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi have called for greater moderation from supporters on Thursday to avoid provoking violence .
Violence in store ?
At least eight were killed in clashes – with some reports saying more than 30 – during religious commemorations at the end of December .
“ Everybody knows that people in the streets , many of them , are not at all content with the present regime , ” says Mr. Sadri .
“ But I think there is a chance that they would heed this particular request as a strategic move to deny the government the excuse to go after them with the brutality of they have shown in the past . ”
As early as Tuesday night , security forces set up nighttime checkpoints in some districts in Tehran .
“ They are going to intimidate people , ” said one close observer in the capital who asked not to be named .
“ It ’s going to be a decisive showdown . ”
Authorities have warned repeatedly in recent weeks that they would not permit the anniversary rally to be hijacked by Green Movement protesters , as has taken place on a number of previous calendar dates important for the regime .
The opposition are “ both hopeful and anxious , and still angry , ” says the analyst about the state of mind of the opposition .
“ They are hopeful that they can force the government to back down a bit , but they are not sure about that .
They do n’t see violence , but they are confronted with violence . ”
Senior police officers have vowed that events on Thursday would prove the final nail in the coffin for opponents of the regime , who have been branded Mohareb , or “ enemies of God . ”
Scores have died in protests and thousands have been arrested .
Iran 's detention centers have consistently yielded stories of abuse and even rape .
Yet tough efforts by security forces – both official and unofficial regime enforcers – have failed to stop the protest movement .
The violence that accompanied Ashura , which has historically lionized martyrdom and came this year in late December , “ was a serious blow – they want to reverse it , ” says the analyst in Tehran .
“ On previous occasions they have been defeated in their plans [ to control the streets ] by some unpredictable forces and events .
The huge number of people can change everything . ”
Both sides of Iran ’s political divide have been preparing for the anniversary , which traditionally includes a speech from the sitting president and state TV broadcasts showing huge crowds across the country shouting “ Death to America ” and “ Death to Israel ” while they burn the flags of these perennial regime enemies .
One Revolutionary Guard commander said that any protest would be met with force .
" The security forces will be after maintaining the safety of the demonstrations and will fiercely confront anyone who might want to fall out of line with the revolution 's caravan , " said Hossein Hamedani , according to ISNA news agency .
The revolution anniversary , he added , " belongs to all 70 million Iranians and we will not let anyone confiscate it for the sake of a certain group . "
Protesters prepare
One list of tips for protesters circulating on the Internet gave practical advice , such as carrying a napkin wet with vinegar to “ fight the effects of tear gas , ” and those with medical experience to carry small first aid kits .
The list asked protesters not to carry weapons such as knives , but called on people living along protest and rally routes to stash sacks full of stones for throwing .
“ We must make it as difficult as possible for Ahmadinejad to give a speech on the main podium , ” the list suggested , adding that “ creating disturbances around the square and affecting Ahmadinejad ’s psychological preparation for his speech should be our first priority . ”
But Khamenei warned in recent days against giving heed to any dissenters : " Whenever the great masses of the people – all over Iran – feel danger or serious enmity towards the revolution , they go to the streets without being called upon , " he said , according to a translation by IranTracker.org .
" Of course , ever since the beginning of the victory of the Islamic revolution , there were some who were opposed to this regime and desired return to hegemony of the United States .
Today they are both inside and outside the country . "
In years past on the anniversary , this reporter has heard a cross-section of views about the Islamic Republic , both from die - hard supporters of the regime and those who believed that its promises of social justice , economic improvement , and freedom had yet to be met after three decades .
Mr. Mousavi spoke recently about the need to change the Constitution – and democratize it .
“ The basic agenda of the reform movement has been … to make the power of the Supreme Leader into a ceremonial power , rather than a real source of power , ” says Sadri .
But that is a counter - revolutionary view to hard - liners in Iran , who know they are fighting for their political lives against fellow Iranians they believe to be “ enemies . ”
“ The trick for reformers is how to neutralize them .
Because not only are [ hardliners ] in power , but they have a base .
They have the Basij [ militia ] and Revolutionary Guard … and also people who sincerely believe that this is Islamic government , ” adds Sadri .
“ Even if the Green Movement succeeds … if you do n’t include [ the hard - line base ] , they can turn into some kind of Baath Party , and blow up things the way they are doing in Iraq .
Even if we win … they can shovel sand into the gears of this democratic movement with obstructionism , with terrorism . ”

If we 're going to have a federal spending freeze , why not hit the most egregious target -- defense pork ?
Nancy Pelosi is making that argument now , too .
" While we all want to support our men and women in uniform ... and our national defense and our veterans , I do n't think that we should protect military contractors , and I want to make that distinction very clear , " Pelosi said at her weekly press conference Thursday ....
" I do n't support exempting them from the freeze , " she said .
" So I think there has to be a bifurcation in terms of : we support our military and their families and we want them to have everything they need , but we do not support an entitlement program for overruns on the part of a military contractor . "
That view is supported by a growing number of defense analysts .
Leading defense wonks , particularly those on the left , have harsh words for the exemption .
“ Ridiculous , ” said Laicie Olson of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
“ Completely inappropriate , ” said Lawrence Korb of the Center for American Progress .
“ A political decision , ” said Charles Knight of the Project on Defense Alternatives .
Obama ’s first defense budget , submitted last spring , topped out at $ 663 billion when including the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — an overall increase from the final Bush administration Pentagon budget — but also terminated major defense programs hated by reformers , including the Air Force ’s F - 22 fighter jet , the Army ’s Future Combat System vehicle and ground - based missile defense .
But despite the real - dollar increase , conservatives criticized Obama ’s budget when they saw that those program cancellations would bring down future defense spending .
Similarly , Obama raised the Department of Homeland Security ’s budget to $ 43 billion from $ 40 billion ....
But while Obama did not rule out future defense cuts in the speech , many of these defense wonks could not understand why an effort at deficit reduction would explicitly exclude defense spending .
“ Defense spending is over half our discretionary spending , ” Olson said .
“ It would be crazy not to include it .
It begs the question whether this is a real effort . ”
Shortly before the speech , Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , the speaker of the House , told reporters that any spending freeze ought to include defense spending ....
“ Its absolutely ridiculous to think that we ’re going to cut things like education and spend money on nuclear weapons and programs that do n’t work , are faulty , have been faulty for years and continue to waste money , ” Olson said .
Defense contracts should not be sacrosanct .
A real and effective deficit slicing measure will have to include ending the decades long welfare program those contractors have enjoyed .
The Marble Caves of Puerto Rio Tranquilo are some of the most remarkable attractions of Patagonia .
This magnificent nature place is located in the Region of Aisen in Chile .
Las Cavernas de Marmol , as the Spanish call them were created by the clear waters of Rio Tranquilo that dug into a giant limestone peninsula , creating an impressive labyrinth of caves .
The peninsula is known as the Marble Cathedral and can be reached by boat , during a guided tour .
In describing the beauty of the place , while texts always do injustice , photos are worth a thousand words .
Hope you enjoy the beauty that God created .

The pressure to conform affects everyone , understanding how and when puts you one step ahead of the pack .
The Future of highway transport could be driven on current roads ,
without changing any existing infrastructure !
What if this Change started inside each car instead …
It was Jean - Paul Sartre who said ; L’enfers c’est les Autres , or “ Hell is Others ” .
So it seems more than just a little bit ironic to use the name “ Sartre ” for an automobile - guidance system that requires you to join others in a convoy , or “ train ” .
So leaving aside the existential quandaries of grouping cars together , let ’s just look at the practical implications .
Sartre is a guidance system that creates “ trains ” of cars .
Once cars join this train , drivers cede control of their cars to a lead driver through a combination radio telemetry , remote controls , and GPS ( called ‘ telemetrics ’ ) to enable this automated form of road travel .
Perhaps the philosophical tie - in offered by the “ Sartre ” system is that by willingly choosing to give up some of our cherished egotism and autonomy , we can become more socially aware ( safer ? ) on the road in the process .
At the very least , it might encourage nervous or downright bad drivers to just group themselves together , and free up some time / space for those who can more effectively navigate the mildly ordered chaos of our shared roadways .

Draft Dodging
Anybody who ’s seen a high - speed ( restrictor plate ) car race on the banked oval of a SuperSpeedway , knows the value of drafting in a tight pack of cars , and could appreciate the benefit of being able to safely do this on a highway as well .
Although , few of us would feel comfortable tucking right in behind a transport , even if we did have a CB radio to signal our intent , we could surely the imagine the aerodynamic gains and passing opportunities that would result from the reduction in aerodynamic drag and congestion …
Even if this meant nothing more than removing just that one , lane hogging ( and already oblivious ) slowpoke out of the left lane , and improving the overall flow for everyone else .
There are lots of other examples of the kind of tail - gating madness and dangerous inside passes that left - lane hogs incite in other drivers
.
If you think about it , automobiles ( and the driving culture that surrounds them ) have surprisingly changed very little in the past few decades .
Not at least since the advent of fuel injection , and processor driven Engine Controls that have provided us with impressive mileage gains , even despite the offsetting performance of largely effective emissions controls .
However with more and better cars , have also come all the pitfalls of our over - populated roadways .
The Future still beckons us however with it ’s possibilities , and in this case it offers us highway travel in a semi- to fully - automated form of guidance , which according to the Consortium leads at Ricardo Inc. also offers the potential to improve traffic flow and journey times , offer greater comfort to drivers , reduce accidents , and improve fuel consumption and hence lower CO2 emissions .
.
This may seem like some sort unrealized ‘ Jetsonian ’ dream of the 21st century , but the remarkable thing is that this vision can exist without any major overhauls of our infrastructure , or need to install tubes !
Although it ’s difficult to see how this system could be adapted via retrofits to older cars , by enhancing the already existing engineering of today ’s new cars , what we ’re looking at is essentially a new class of vehicles that premiere automotive companies like Volvo are obviously keen to lead the way with .
Perhaps this is the sort of R&D springboard that Toyota could also take advantage of as it seeks to climb out of the damage created by its recent recall of faulty throttle mechanisms .
“ This type of autonomous driving actually does n’t require any hocus - pocus technology , and no investment in infrastructure .
Instead , the emphasis is on development and on adapting technology that is already in existence . ” – Erik Coelingh of Volvo , principal SARTRE participant
As always the world of MotorSports has already offered some insight into the Future with it ’s widely varied expertise in telemetry , and throttle / engine control systems .
It ’s still difficult to grasp how this type off system will translate to steering control as well , especially considering the wide variances in individual performance characteristics , but if the automatic parallel parking systems of today luxury sedans are any indication of where things are going , then we are certainly on the road to the Future here .
.
This new direction in automotive , uhm…automation is n’t necessarily a loss of person autonomy however , so long as there are still ‘ open ’ lanes available for manual driving .
But what if our accelerators all become inevitably manageable via such telemetrics , as a “ safety ” feature in heavy traffic ?
Surely the independent spirit of Americans will assure that there are always options to the status quo , whatever that turns out to be .
In the meantime lawyers would be lined up to profit from liabilities ( in the name of assuring a ‘ safer society ’ of course ) , and Libertarians will surely object to any potential loss of personal freedoms , under any such perceived ( or mandatory ) systems of central control on America ’s free and open roadways !
The various design principals behind these ‘ car trains ’ are still very much up for debate , but in the case of of the SARTRE project , GPS will be the key source of data .
Unlike alternate systems which rely on either magnetic paint , or in sub-surface conduits to provide invisible ‘ rails ’ as a reference signal , the SARTRE concept enables full implementation without any need to modify existing infrastructure whatsoever !
So since we ’re talking about adapting vehicles to the concept , rather than starting from scratch with entirely new roadways / systems , the devil will be in the details of controlling the individual driving characteristics of each car fitted for use in a SARTRE car - train , or “ platoon ” as it is also referred to .
Formula One Racing fans can already appreciate the intricacies of throttle control , and this is likely to be where the greatest benefits might be realized , even if the auto - piloted dream of SARTRE fails to realize itself , for whatever reason .
Consider at least the element of ‘ grouped ’ or collective throttle control on movement ans spacing , and thus being able to eliminate the accordion effect of congested traffic jams .
Namely , eliminating the cumulative delays introduced by individual reaction times and the spastic stop / start / stop tenancies , which all accumulate to wasted accelerations , harder sudden braking , and full stoppages further back in the traffic pileup .
Perhaps you can see how ceding autonomy to a gentle and steady throttle control protocol might someday help clear at least temporary congestion , if not offer us a safer , more automated driving experience in general .
At this early point in our forming Future , it ’s almost unfathomable to imagine how the Big Auto manufacturers could ever hope to standardize their engineering and production around such the protocols for nationwide or continental automation systems , resulting in a more truly socialized road usage .
The patents - pending on such underlying concepts alone would be a nightmare to navigate and appease through such an industry wide and multinational engineering effort .
With so many theoretical and interdependent systems to develop however , it seems that in this case the carriage MUST be designed and put in place before the horsepower is applied .
Yet ironically this dream , like so many other Futuristic visions , has been in the works since the 1950’s , as evidenced by this patent application .
Which effectively reminds us all just how long we ’ve been waiting for the Future to arrive !
If you ’d like to consider a perfect example of how long we ’ve been waiting for the Future to arrive , you can consider this patent application from 1968 that is based in previous patents that date back into the 1950 ’s and one for ‘ automatic steering ’ that dates back to the 1930s ! ! !
” The Future ai n’t what it used to be ”
– S.L. Clemens
Meanwhile back in Reality …
Most would sub-consciously presume that the potential liabilities and threats of litigation would limit such progressive ideas to private test tracks only … with few clear possibilities for the industrial protocols to underpin wider commercial support , much less the social support required to trust and buy into such technology .
One could easily just relegate this high flown concept to being just another high - tech luxury for the rich and famous , and like the supersonic flights of the Concorde , it would be left to wither and die on the vine of public consciousness .
Others might simply equate this futuristic vision as simply another manifestation of a technocratic tendency to establish a ‘ robot ’ driven world based in Cybernetics …
Which is not as widely appealing as some might presume .
Without some sophisticated gating or signaling to cars merging from onramps , negotiating passage via highway exits , on - ramps , and interchanges could become a nightmare .
For example , how are safe lane changes managed from the head of a longer car - train ?
If the slow lane is n’t safe to drive a car - train in ( due to merging traffic ) , would we have to cede the passing lane to these trains , and thus increase congestion in the right hand lane even more , with so many added lane changes …
Which we all know are right up there with ‘ rubber - necking ’ when it comes to dragging traffic flow down to a congested crawl !
Keep on Trucking …
Some facts are inescapable though , and since trucking transport is already being increasingly regulated with speed limiters , then why not get some major drafting going in the slower lane behind all this trucking traffic anyhow .
Perhaps then we could also look at re-establishing the lost protocols around the now almost mythical or so - called “ passing ” lane !
Maybe by looking at the Future , we can see how the Present could be improved based on things that we used to do in the Past !
Philosophy
Of course this system relies on effective leadership .
So by enabling a trust in the gentle but firm guidance ( benevolent fascism ? ) of a presumably professional lead driver , perhaps we can see our way past Sartre ’s incisive observations of fallibility in the individual solipsism of the Human Condition .
Thus we might all benefit from a presumably more secure , productive , and economicaly beneficial highway driving experience .

The bon temps rouler - ed all weekend long in New Orleans , and Mike was there in his bumblebee costume .
We 're told he 's still drunk .
Let 's pick up his account midstream :

Headed to some parades , then to the Milan Lounge where two fantastic things happened .
First , some jackass was ringing a cowbell in the bar .
The bartender told the guy to " stop ringing the fucking bell . "
He did n't .
So this 60 year old bartender leaps the bar and goes after the guy , finally catching him outside and jacking him .
I 've never seen someone move that fast .
Then , our friend Dylan informs us of a costume party going on at Michelopolis ' art warehouse .
I wore my friend Hilary 's super tight , female bumble bee costume and felt underdressed .
Naked people everywhere .
Band was great .
They opened , of course , with ' Stand up and get Crunk ' .
Wake up , head to Parasols and have a dozen oysters , get my game face on .
Head to the Kingpin for the game .
place is slammed .
My friend Les , a die hard fan of 40 + years , is wearing a Mexican blanket with a huge Fleur De Lis on it in black and gold .
Les is probably about 300 lbs .
Best outfit of all time .
Anyway , game starts , they go down 10 - 0 fast , but everyone still had a feeling .
When that interception happened at the end to seal it , I 've never heard a bar as loud as it was in there .
Total hysteria .
So then we head downtown to celebrate .
Everyone thinks Bourbon Street is where it's at , but the real party is on Frenchman Street .
Head there , mass euphoria out of everyone .
Then , a brass band shows up in the street and I convince them to march through the Marigny and into the French Quarter .
Amazing .
Just people going insane .
Get back to Frenchman and head to the Blue Nile to see more music .
For whatever reason , we start chanting " Sex , sex , sex " and this couple starts having sex in the window of the bar .
That 's how crazy it got .
Supposed to have a flight Monday afternoon .
Not happening because of snow storm in DC .
Here till Thursday now .
Party kept rolling last night , involving me shirtless bartending at Parasols .
About to head to the victory parade .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain raised its terrorism threat level to ‘ severe ’ -- the second highest level -- on Friday , days before London hosts major international meetings on how to deal with militancy in Afghanistan and Yemen .
The decision to raise the level from ‘ substantial ’ means security services now consider an attack in Britain , a key U.S. ally , to be “ highly likely ” but the government said it had no information to suggest an attack was imminent .
Britain gave no reason for the move by its Joint Terrorism Analysis Center ( JTAC ) which comes as Britain and other countries step up precautions in the wake of the failed Christmas Day attack on an airliner in Detroit .
Raising the threat level is expected to lead to tighter security at airports and public buildings .
“ JTAC keeps the threat level under constant review and makes its judgments based on a broad range of factors , including the intent and capabilities of international terrorist groups in the UK and overseas , ” Home Secretary ( interior minister ) Alan Johnson said in a statement .
“ The fact that we ’ve moved to another threat level means we put more resources in , we heighten the state of vigilance .
It should n’t be thought to be linked to Detroit or anywhere else for that matter , ” he told the BBC .
Security expert Anthony Glees said his guess was that the decision to raise the threat level was linked to the Afghanistan conference and to intelligence from the United States .
“ I think it ’s very probable that people , either members of al Qaeda or associated to al Qaeda , will be figuring that it would be a huge trophy attack in some way to damage the holding of the Afghanistan conference , ” he told the BBC .
The threat level was last changed on July 20 , 2009 when it was lowered to substantial from severe .
It had been lowered to severe on July 4 , 2007 from critical , the highest level , which had been declared a few days earlier following attempted car bombings in London and Glasgow .
Suicide bombings in July 2005 killed 52 people on London ’s transport networks and a number of plots have been thwarted since then .
MAJOR CONFERENCE
Britain hosts an international conference on Afghanistan on Thursday that London says may set a timetable for transferring responsibility for some areas to Afghan control .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , NATO Secretary - General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and foreign ministers from 50 countries are expected to take part .
Talks on Afghanistan will be preceded by a January 27 meeting on Yemen , which declared war on al Qaeda last week under pressure for a crackdown on the global militant group after its Yemen - based wing said it was behind an attempt on December 25 to blow up a U.S. passenger jet .
The Nigerian suspect in the Detroit airliner plot , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , studied a few years ago in London , raising concern about whether he was radicalized in Britain .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told parliament this week Britain was suspending direct flights to Britain by a Yemeni airline and was stepping up immigration checks in the wake of the failed Detroit attack .
“ We know that a number of terrorist cells are actively trying to attack Britain and other countries , ” Brown said .
Sajjan Gohel of the Asia Pacific Foundation thinktank said one factor that affected threat level changes was security agencies ’ monitoring of electronic “ chatter ” among militants .
“ It may be that Britain is being mentioned more often or it may be the volume of potentially threatening messages being collected that provides a sense of heightened threat , ” he said .
U.S. Homeland Security Department spokesman Matt Chandler said Britain was raising its measures to effectively where the United States was .
“ We have enhanced our security measures and communicated specific information to industry , law enforcement and the American people , ” he said .
The Food and Drug Administration has raised its level of concern over the safety of bisphenol - A , or BPA , an industrial chemical found in baby bottles and the linings of canned goods and other consumer products .
That is a welcome shift in attitude by an agency that seemed bent , during the Bush administration , on minimizing the potential for harm .
But it sheds little light , for now , on how dangerous the chemical might be in the small amounts that leach out and are imbibed by infants and older people  or how rigorously it should be regulated .
In August 2008 , the Bush - era F.D.A. released a draft report asserting that the small amounts of BPA that leach into milk or food are not dangerous .
One month later , the National Toxicology Program , an interagency assessment group , came to a less reassuring conclusion .
It expressed “ some concern ”  midway between “ negligible concern ” and “ serious concern ”  about the potential effects on the brain , behavior and prostate in fetuses , infants and children .
Now the F.D.A. has also expressed “ some concern ” about the same risks .
Still , the message remained murky .
Health officials said they have no proof that the chemical has harmed either children or adults .
They have not taken any regulatory action to curb its use .
Nor have they urged families to change their use of infant formula or foods because the benefit of good nutrition outweighs the potential risk from BPA exposure .
Instead , the two agencies will conduct crucial research on the safety of BPA over the next 18 to 24 months to reduce “ substantial uncertainties ” in assessing the risks of low - dose exposures .
And the F.D.A. will seek more robust and flexible regulatory authority to clamp down on the chemical if the evidence warrants .

* FCC will submit broadband plan to Congress on Mar 17
* 93 million Americans without broadband -- FCC
* Cost , digital literacy , relevance are major barriers - FCC
WASHINGTON , Feb 23 ( Reuters ) - U.S. communications regulators will unveil on March 17 a blueprint aimed at bringing fast affordable Internet access to more than 90 million Americans being held back by fees and technology .
The Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday that the long - awaited National Broadband Plan will try to help connect 93 million Americans to high - speed Internet to find jobs , access educational and healthcare services , and reduce household energy costs .
“ In the 21st century , a digital divide is an opportunity divide , ” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in a statement , highlighting that various roadblocks are stopping one - third of the United States from subscribing to broadband .
“ To bolster American competitiveness abroad and create the jobs of the future here at home , we need to make sure that all Americans have the skills and means to fully participate in the digital economy . ”
The FCC , which in August started a series of fact - finding workshops , will submit its recommendations to Congress on March 17 , in an effort to lift the United States out of the 19th spot behind Japan , Korea and France -- the leaders in a 2008 world ranking for broadband speed .
In the last couple of weeks the FCC has begun publicly talking about key aspects of the plan .
More is expected in the coming days leading up to March 17 .
Last week Genachowski said he wants Internet service providers to offer a minimum connection speed of 100 megabits per second by 2020 , compared with current industry estimates of less than 4 Mbps .
The benchmark was announced a week after Google Inc GOOG .
O rattled ISPs with its own plan to build a super - fast Internet network but Google 's plan was met with some skepticism from some providers such as AT&T Inc T.N .
During a speech at the Brookings Institution late Tuesday morning , Genachowski is expected to highlight why the broadband plan is essential to helping 93 million Americans overcome barriers to subscribing to broadband service at home .
With President Barack Obama pushing for ubiquitous high - speed Internet throughout the country , Genachowski is also expected to discuss the importance of spectrum for mobile broadband in a speech Wednesday .
MONTHLY FEES
For subscribers , broadband on average costs $ 40.68 a month but those who bundle it with other services pay $ 37.70 , the FCC said .
Standalone broadband subscribers pay an average of $ 46.25 a month .
In a report titled “ Broadband Adoption and Use in America , ” the FCC identified affordability , digital literacy and relevance as the three main barriers to greater broadband subscription among 80 million adults and 13 million children over the age of five .
The FCC , after having surveyed random Americans in October and November , said 28 million Americans , or 36 percent , said monthly fees and the cost of buying a computer are holding them back from subscribing to broadband service .
Another 22 percent said they simply do n’t understand the technology , and they are concerned about inappropriate content or the safety of their personal information .
Nineteen percent said the Internet is a waste of time or they have no interest in online content , and some said they are happy with their current slower dial - up service .
Other non-adopters said broadband is either not offered in their communities or already have access at work , the FCC said .
Some of those without broadband service cited facing more than one reason for not subscribing .
John Horrigan , FCC ’s director of consumer research for the broadband project , said U.S. officials will have to focus on helping Americans overcome those key hurdles , without specifically saying how the FCC will address those issues .
“ The gap in broadband adoption is a problem with many different dimensions that will require many different solutions , ” he said .
Gordon Brown repeatedly shouted at Tony Blair " you ruined my life " in the final confrontation that forced Blair to agree to announce a date by which he would stand down as prime minister , according to Andrew Rawnsley 's new book .
The revelations in the Observer journalist 's book , The End of the Party , raised fresh questions this week about the Brown 's character and prompted him to deny at prime minister 's questions today he had ever sanctioned briefings against his chancellor , Alistair Darling .
The latest disclosures detail the extent to which Brown manoeuvred to oust Blair .
Rawnsley describes how in a two - hour morning meeting in early September 2006 Brown insisted not only that Blair step down , but that he fix it so no one stood against him .
Blair said he could not deliver that promise .
Brown 's insistence to Blair that he become prime minister unchallenged is at odds with public proclamations that he would welcome a contest .
The book also says Ed Balls , then City minister and Brown 's closest ally , was the driving force behind the coup launched in autumn 2006 .
In the final showdown between Brown and Blair , against the backdrop of a backbench letter urging Blair to stand aside , Brown demanded not only a ­public declaration that he would hand over power but also to work as his partner in the interim .
The book says Brown demanded : " Who do you think is better than me ?
Do you think there is anyone who is better than me ? "
John Reid was " far too rightwing " .
Alan Johnson was " a lightweight " .
David ­Miliband was much too young .
Was Blair saying , Brown demanded , that any of them was better qualified to become prime minister ?
This face - off came to an end without a resolution .
Talking about it afterwards to close allies , Blair described this confrontation with Brown as " ghastly " and " terrible " and told them : " He [ Brown ] kept shouting at me that I 'd ruined his life . "
Rawnsley reveals that Brown rang Blair while he was staying with the Queen at ­Balmoral .
He was furious that Alan ­Milburn , Blair 's close ally , had written a piece supporting the prime minister 's right to stay at No 10 .
Rawnsley writes : " The chancellor 's fury was titanically demented even by his standards .
' You put fucking Milburn up to it , ' Brown raged down the phone .
' This is factionalism !
This is Trotskyism !
It 's fucking Trotskyism ! '
Blair was nonplussed .
He had not even seen the article .
After the call , he then read it and phoned Milburn to say it was excellent .
They laughed about Brown 's hysterical reaction . "
Drawing on witness accounts from within No 10 and the Treasury , Rawnsley also discloses that Balls , in effect , forced Brown into pressing on with the coup .
At one meeting at the Treasury , Brown said he needed more time to think , but Balls interrupted : " It 's too late .
It 's all in place .
It is going to happen . "
Balls was referring to the fact that Tom Watson , then defence minister , was about to hand in a letter of resignation from the government that called for Blair to quit .
Rawnsley writes that at one meeting Balls was vehement Gordon had been " too weak for too long " .
Balls said : " Blair is never going to go .
He has to be pushed .
You must n't be weak .
You 've been weak for too long . "
A spokesman for Balls said these ­allegations were untrue .
" Mr Balls had always advised Mr Brown to stay out of any ' move to oust ' Mr Blair , " he said .
Jonathan Powell , Blair 's former chief of staff , tells Rawnsley the Brownite coup " fitted with a pattern of behaviour over 13 years " .
Baroness Morgan , Blair 's director of government relations for four years , says Blair knew Gordon was behind it .
In the middle of the coup , the former welfare minister Frank Field went to No 10 to plead with Blair not to give way to Brown .
" You ca n't go yet .
You ca n't let Mrs Rochester out of the attic , " he said .
Rawnsley writes : " Blair roared with laughter . "

Education and family reporter , BBC News
The report calls for more maths in science A - levels Science and maths exams should be more demanding and more experts should be involved in teaching the subjects , an independent report has said .
The Science and Learning Expert Group says improving science and maths has been a high priority in recent years .
But it calls for more demanding GCSEs and A - levels , regulation of private exam boards and greater use of flexible pay to attract specialist teachers .
The government says many of the issues raised are being addressed .
Exams ' inadequate '
It set up the expert group as one of five which would provide advice on the UK's Science and Society Strategy .
An excellent education depends on excellent teaching , a strong curriculum and assessment that is fit for purpose
Sir Mark Walport , chairman of the Science and Learning Expert Group Science and Learning Expert Group chairman Sir Mark Walport said : " Many of us have good cause to be grateful to a single inspiring teacher whom we encountered during our school education .
" Our overarching recommendation is that specialist teachers and their subjects need to come to the fore in the teaching of science and mathematics in schools and colleges . "
The report also calls for more maths content in GCSE and A - level science courses - especially in chemistry and physics A - levels .
The authors suggest exams are dictating what is taught in schools and that the exams themselves are seen as " inadequate " in testing the depth of students ' knowledge and their understanding of key concepts .
The trend for multiple - choice questions was criticised , with the authors saying there should be " greater emphasis on accurate use of the English language " .
The report said assessment should follow the curriculum rather than define it and that expert groups should be set up for each subject area to advise on the curriculum for five to 19 - year - olds and on GCSEs and A - levels .
The science and maths community want a greater say in the development of qualifications and assessment , it adds .
' Right track '
Sir Mark said : " An excellent education depends on excellent teaching , a strong curriculum and assessment that is fit for purpose . "
We believe that by involving those with real experience and understanding of teaching , a more holistic and effective science and mathematics education system will result
Professor John Pethica , Royal Society vice - president
The group calls for regulation of private exam boards which offer GCSEs and A - levels , saying this would " prevent competition between them leading to lower standards " .
The fear is that schools might opt for exam boards they consider to be offering easier qualifications .
Schools Minister Iain Wright said the report suggested the government was " on the right track " and that many of the issues raised were being addressed .
These included the need for greater maths content in GCSE science , the need to continue recruiting and supporting specialist teachers and the need for science A - levels to be more challenging , he added .
' Valuable contribution ' Royal Society vice - president Professor John Pethica said he was " delighted " by the recommendation that expert groups should advise on the development of the curriculum and qualifications .
" We believe that by involving those with real experience and understanding of teaching , a more holistic and effective science and mathematics education system will result , " he said .
Sylvia McNamara , from the QCDA , the body responsible for the development of the curriculum and qualifications in England , said the report made a " valuable contribution " to the debate around the critical role of science and maths .
" This summer A - level students will sit the new style exams , which demand a more broader understanding and will better prepare young people for higher education and employment , " she said .
" Input from teachers and lecturers , awarding bodies , subject specialists and the royal societies all played a vital role in the recent revisions to maths and science GCSEs , as well as the new Science Diploma for 2011 . "
A spokeswoman for Ofqual , England 's exams watchdog said it worked to maintain standards .
" Ofqual carries out rigorous monitoring of the awarding bodies throughout the awarding process to ensure that standards are maintained year - on - year , across awarding bodies and across subjects , " she said .
" Where we find problems or cause for concern over standards we have and will take action .
" While Ofqual accepts that teachers who become examiners have a wealth of experience and it is right that they should be able to share this experience with others for the educational good of pupils and students , we agree that there are limits to what can be allowed . "

Flere forfjamsede innringere forteller til VG
Nett at de aldri har sett noe lignende .
Har du bilder ?
Hva tror du det mystiske lyset er ?
Diskutér og del bilder her !
VGTV : Se video av det mystiske fenomenet HER
Meteorologisk institutt har mottatt telefoner fra folk som har sett den mystiske kjempespiralen Trøndelag til Finnmark .
- Folk fra helt nord i Finnmark til sør i Trøndelag ringer og sier de har observert lyset , sier Mona Mariann Lie ved meteorologisk institutt til VG Nett .
- Det snurret og eksploderte på himmelen , forteller Totto Eriksen fra Tromsø .
Vet du hva dette er? Kontakt VG
Netts journalisterhereller send melding til 2200 .
Kjempespiral
Han og datteren Amalie Nyborg ( 16 ) var på vei til jobb og skole da himmelen plutselig eksploderte .
- Vi så det fra Indre havn i Tromsø .
Det var helt fantastisk .
Det så nesten ut som en rakett som snurret rundt og rundt , og så gikk på skrå nedover himmelen .
Det så ut som månen skulle komme over fjellet , men så kom det noe helt annet , sier Eriksen .
- Folk stoppet på kaia .
Det var helt sykt , sier Eriksen .
- Det var som en kjempespiral - et stjerneskudd som snurret rundt og rundt .
Jeg trodde først det var en lyskaster .
Det lyser fortsatt , sier Axel Roseberg fra Alta .
- Det må være et fenomen som har skjedd i atmosfæren .
Spørsmålet er om det har kommet ovenfra eller nedenfra .
VG Nett har vært i kontakt med Andøya rakettskytefelt som opplyser at det ikke har vært noen oppskytninger onsdag morgen .
MYSTISK : Så langt er det ingen som har noe klart svar på hva det kan være .

Røed Ødegaard : - Kan ha vært rakett
Kjendisastronom Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard opplever personlig rekord i nedringning onsdag morgen .
Heller ikke han vet hva dette er , og sier han aldri har hørt om noe lignende .
- Dette er sett over et eksepsjonelt stor del av landet , i hele Nord - Norge og hele Trøndelag .
Min første tanke var at det var en ildkulemeteor , men det har vart altfor lenge til at det kan ha vært det .
Det kan ha vært en rakett i Russland , men jeg garanterer ikke at det er svaret , sier Ødegaard til VG Nett .
Han har vært i kontakt med Flykontrolltårnet i Tromsø .
- De sa at det var sett i over to minutter .
Det er altfor lenge til at det kan være et astronomisk fenomen .
Ildfenomener er ikke uvanlige , men at det er spiralformet er unikt .
Dette er avgjort ikke en variasjon av nordlys , sier han .
- En grå sjokkbølge
Han forteller at folk løp ut på verandaen for å se på lyset .
- Det var sånn at du sto og måpte .
Jeg hørte ingenting .
Det var som en grå sjokkbølge som spredte seg som en perfekt sirkel utover horisonten , sier Roseberg .
- Det så ut som den kom over et fjell .
Først gikk den i bane , før den stoppet helt opp .
Så begynte den å sirkulere , og så gikk den i oppløsing .
Så ble det plutselig til en stor ring , så stor at den dekket hele himmelen , sier Stig Roar Hansen ( 38 ) som jobber på Skjervøy i Troms .
- Sterkt hvitt lys
Morten Bjørkmo Kristiansen ( 23 ) hadde akkurat kommet hjem fra nattevakt da fenomenet åpenbarte seg over ham .
- Først var det et veldig sterkt hvitt lys i midten av ringen .
Så begynte det å bre seg utover .
Den grønne streken eller strålen som du ser på bildet var der i sikkert ti -tolv minutter etterpå .
Det var faren min som oppdaget det .
Han har heller ikke sett noe sånt før .
Vi sto på verandaen hjemme og lurte på hva dette kunne være .
Jeg tror ikke det er nordlys .
Det er vi vant til å se , sier Kristiansen .
Vet ikke hva det er
Meteorologene i Tromsø vet heller ikke hva lyset skyldes .
- Vi aner ikke hva det er .
Jeg tør ikke gjette heller , men det har visstnok vært veldig spektakulært , sier Trond Robertsen , vakthavende meteorologikonsulent ved instituttet i Tromsø .
- Folk beskriver lysbevegelsen som voldsomt , utrolig vakkert og til dels skremmende .
De beskriver det som nyttårsraketten som ligner en spinnende spiral , sier Robertsen til VG Nett .
Han forteller at himmelen fortsatt er turkis på de stedene lyset kunne sees .
Lysfenomenet varte i noen få minutter , like før klokken åtte onsdag morgen .
Robertsen mener lyset tydligvis har kommet østfra .
- Vi har fått telefoner fra folk fra Alta i nord til Kjøpsvik , like sør for Narvik , sier Robertsen .
Ikke sett noe lignende før
- Folk har ingen formening om hva det er .
De har ingenting de kan relatere det til , for ingen har sett noe lignende før .
Det kan være en meteoritt , men det blir kun spekulasjon .
Vi vet ikke hva det er , men skal prøve å finne det ut .
Vi er like nysgjerrige vi også .
Det eneste Robertsen er sikker på er at lyset ikke har noe med nordlyset å gjøre .

“ If I shine shoes on Broadway , ” Mr. Abraham said he told him , “ he ’ll be shining shoes next to me . ”
MR . Abraham has not had to resort to shining shoes , but his three decades owning the little neighborhood hardware store have not always been smooth .
Kramer ’s has narrowly survived several rough economic periods , and has contended with the arrival in Brooklyn of two huge competitors , Home Depot and Lowe ’s , both of which have outlets within three miles of the store .
Through it all , George has been an ideal worker : honest ( perhaps because he is incapable of lying ) , uncomplaining and extremely punctual .
His routine is as inflexible as a brass - plated wood screw .
Every day , without fail , he arrives in the neighborhood by bus at 7 a.m. , an hour before the store opens .
Every day , he eats breakfast in one of two places  a restaurant called La Guadalupana Taqueria Mexicana , next to Kramer ’s , or a Dunkin ’ Donuts a few blocks away .
And every day , regardless of which place he patronizes , he orders the same thing : a bagel with cream cheese , coffee and orange juice  “ the combo . ”
George raises the store gates at exactly 8 a.m .
Most of the customers are building superintendents , and as they trickle in , they greet him playfully : “ Hey , George , did you miss me ? ” “ How ’s your girlfriend , George ? ”
Much to their amusement , he answers straightforwardly , with little inflection .
“ Yes , my friend , ” he might say , or “ No , ” or “ I do n’t know . ”
At exactly 5 p.m. , George lowers the gates and takes the bus down Coney Island Avenue to his home .
He lives in one of several Brooklyn residences run by the Adult Retardates Center , a group for people with developmental disabilities that his parents helped found in the 1950s .
He eats dinner with the other residents at 5:15 , showers at 8 and goes to bed at exactly 11 .
His weekends are similarly scheduled , with visits to the Young Israel synagogue on Avenue J and to a recreational center  “ the Club ”  where he plays games , drinks Diet Cokes and dances with his companion of 21 years , who lives in one of the group ’s other residences .
Every year George sends out dozens of birthday cards to relatives ; every year he calls to make sure the card has arrived on time .
At family gatherings , which he begins talking about months in advance , he insists on taking a picture of every person at the table .
His photo albums contain the most comprehensive record of my family that there is  thousands of unevenly framed snapshots documenting decades of Seders and Thanksgivings .
And yet , as devoted as George is to these routines , it is difficult to say exactly why he performs them or how they affect him .
He seldom makes eye contact .
Hardly anyone has seen him laugh , or cry , and although he is often pronouncing things ( mostly restaurants ) good or bad  “ Garden of Eat - In on Avenue J !
That ’s good ! ”  it is hard to know whether he is expressing genuine feelings or repeating opinions picked up from others .
Most of the time , he is quiet .
When he speaks , it is often to blurt out some phrase that has no apparent relevance .
Only when he is pressed does it become clear that these utterances do , in fact , have meaning .
“ April 5th Monday night ! ” he shouted out one afternoon in December , prompting a request for an explanation .
“ I have to go shul April 5th , ” he replied .
“ Mommy ’s yahrzeit .
That ’s important .
But electric bulbs only .
No candles in the house .
That ’s dangerous . ”
There 's something deliciously futuristic about the fact that Microsoft and Google are patrolling our roads , documenting their every nook and cranny with large multidirectional cameras strapped to SUVs .
But what about the unpaved wilderness ?
Well , Google 's after that too now , with its new Street View snowmobile it 's unveiled just in time for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver .
Sure , it 's a bit of a gimmick , but also it 's surprisingly thrilling to chase down the various slopes in use for the Olympics , and Google Earth even has most everything mapped out in 3D for your aerial viewing pleasure .
Check out a video of the snowmobile in action after the break , or hit up that source link to " hit the slopes . "
If something gets in your way , turn .
The technological history of hockey is littered with elaborate ideas that did not pan out , like the Fox network ’s glowing puck , the heated skate blade and Cooperalls .
But since last November , a simple innovation that costs next to nothing has become popular among N.H.L. professionals and weekend warriors alike : a skate - sharpening method called the flat - bottom V .
“ It ’s been great for me , ” said Jack Johnson , a defenseman for the Los Angeles Kings and a candidate for the United States Olympic team .
“ It ’s sharper , but at the same time , you can get just as much glide as with the old sharpening , so you get the best of both worlds . ”
BlackStone Sports , the Ontario manufacturer of skate maintenance equipment that developed the flat - bottom V method , says players on about 20 of the N.H.L. ’s 30 teams have switched from the traditional sharpening method in use for decades .
The list of notables includes Zach Parise of the Devils , Joe Thornton and Rob Blake of the San Jose Sharks , Jason Arnott of the Nashville Predators , Milan Michalek of the Ottawa Senators and Doug Weight of the Islanders .
The white - suited one is still trying his hand at sensible road - testing .
It ’s not going well
Heads - up , kids -- Mobile World Congress is but days away from liftoff , and it looks like Texas Instruments will be there with a purpose .
The company has today introduced what it 's calling the " industry 's first quad - radio single chip , " which throws 802.11n , GPS , FM transmit / receive and Bluetooth radios onto a single 65 - nanometer WiLink 7.0 solution .
Purportedly , this device reduces costs by 30 percent , size by 50 percent and bragging rights by 894 percent .
The chip is currently sampling to OEMs with undisclosed names , which could mean that a prototype phone or two will be taking advantage in Barcelona .
Fingers crossed .
Polizisten aus Bad Oldesloe in Schleswig - Holstein haben in der Silvesternacht auf der Autobahn 1 bei Ahrensburg einen entlaufenen Hund totgefahren .
Absichtlich .
Nun soll die 65 - jährige Halterin des Tieres für den Einsatz 2.557,31 Euro bezahlen , weil bei der Aktion das Einsatzfahrzeug beschädigt wurde .
Die Polizei rechtfertigt das tödliche Manöver .
Hund Robby , ein Australian Shepherd , habe eine Stunde lang nicht eingefangen werden können .
Die Halterin und Tierschützer fragen nun , warum die Autobahn nicht gesperrt wurde , um den Hund in Ruhe und ohne Gefahren von der Fahrbahn holen zu können .
In der Silvesternacht werde die Autobahn kaum befahren , zitiert das Hamburger Abendblatt ( Link über Google News , sonst Bezahlcontent ) einen Tierschützer .
Good news , earthlings !
Apparently Google 's taken all the complaints about Nexus
One upgrade pricing to heart , because it 's giving $ 100 rebates to current T - Mobile subscribers who paid $ 379 for the HTC - built handset -- and it says it 'll be widening the net and offering upgrades to even more current T - Mo subs , although we still do n't know how that 's determined .
That means the new Nexus
One pricing tiers break down like this : $ 529 unlocked , $ 279 upgrade for ( some ) current T - Mo subs , and $ 179 on a new 2 - year contract .
Handshakes all around .
Now , let 's fix up family plan activations and that crazy double ETF , shall we ?
Just in case you needed the reassurance , Google 's confirmed all this to be true .
[ Thanks to everyone who sent this in ]
As sentient Americans will recall , the U.S. national debt tripled under Ronald Reagan only to double again George W. Bush .
In between , President Clinton erased the GOP budget deficits , producing a $ 236 billion surplus by his last year in office and leaving Bush a 10 year forecasted surplus of $ 5.6 trillion .
As President Obama made clear in setting Hensarling straight on Friday , he inherited a $ 1.2 trillion annual deficit when he was sworn in January 2009 :
" Now , look , let 's talk about the budget once again , because I 'll go through it with you line by line .
The fact of the matter is , is that when we came into office , the deficit was $ 1.3 trillion .
-- $ 1.3 [ trillion . ]
So when you say that suddenly I 've got a monthly budget that is higher than the -- a monthly deficit that 's higher than the annual deficit left by the Republicans , that 's factually just not true , and you know it 's not true . "
While Obama is certainly right , Hensarling now insists was referring to something else .
That something is Democratic blame for the Bush deficits and Republican ownership of the Clinton surpluses .
As The Hill reported :
In anticipation of Obama rolling out his budget proposal Monday , Hensarling 's Saturday statement cited Congressional Budget Office statistics putting the average deficit during 12 years of GOP House control at $ 104 billion and the average deficit under three years of Democratic control at $ 1.1 trillion .
The Republicans , as you 'll remember , captured the House in 1994 , maintaining control of the chamber until they were ejected in 2006 .
During that span , Bill Clinton presided over the end of the Reagan - Bush I deficits , only see to George W. Bush blow the surplus on tax cuts for the rich , the funded Medicare prescription drug program and the war in Iraq .
While Americans can look back fondly at the surpluses of the Clinton years , Jeb Hensarling wants them to forget that the Republican Party had very little to with it .
In 1993 , Congress passed and President Clinton signed a half - billion deficit reduction package , one that included a boost in upper income tax rates to 39.6 % .
When Clinton 's 1993 economic program scraped by without capturing the support of even one GOP lawmaker , the New York Times remarked :
Historians believe that no other important legislation , at least since World War II , has been enacted without at least one vote in either house from each major party .
Inheriting massive budget deficits and unemployment topping 7 % from Bush the Elder , Clinton 's $ 496 billion program was nonetheless opposed by every single member of the GOP , as well as defectors from his own party .
As the Times recounted , it took a tie - breaking vote from Vice President Al Gore to earn victory :
An identical version of the $ 496 billion deficit - cutting measure was approved Thursday night by the House , 218 to 216 .
The Senate was divided 50 to 50 before Mr. Gore voted .
Since tie votes in the House mean defeat , the bill would have failed if even one representative or one senator who voted with the President had switched sides .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Except that Jeb Hensarling and Congressional Republicans are trying to rewrite it .
In their telling , the spiraling deficits of the final Bush years are entirely the Democrats ' fault .
And the halcyon days of the Clinton surpluses and the flush Treasury he produced , Jeb Hensarling now mythologizes , were brought to you courtesy of the Republican Party .

You are a juror in the prosecution of a step - grandfather for lewd conduct with a minor , the minor being his eight or nine year old step - granddaughter , with whom he allegedly had genital - to - genital contact .
The step - granddaughter has just testified to sexual molestation by her step - grandfather , including sexual intercourse , occurring on many occasions .
Do you infer that the step - granddaughter could not possess the sexual knowledge that she possesses unless her step - granddaughter molested her ?
According to the vast majority of courts , you do , and the widespread belief in this largely untested “ sexual inference innocence theory ” has led to the evisceration of the rape shield rule in many child molestation prosecutions .
In his special concurrence in the recent opinion of the Court of Appeals of Idaho in State v. Molen , 2010 WL 90580 ( Idaho . App. 2010 ) , however , Judge David Gratton called into question this belief , and this post puts a spotlight on his opinion .
The facts in Molen were as stated above , and Idaho ’s rape shield rule , Idaho Rule of Evidence 412 , provides in relevant part that :
( a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law , in a criminal case in which a person is accused of a sex crime , reputation or opinion evidence of the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim of such sex crime is not admissible .
( b ) Notwithstanding any other provision of law , in a criminal case in which a person is accused of a sex crime , evidence of a victim ’s past sexual behavior other than reputation or opinion evidence is also not admissible , unless such evidence other than reputation or opinion evidence is –
( 1 ) admitted in accordance with subdivisions ( c ) ( 1 ) and ( c ) ( 2 ) and is constitutionally required to be admitted ; or
( 2 ) admitted in accordance with subdivision ( c ) and is evidence of –
( A ) past sexual behavior with persons other than the accused , offered by the accused upon the issue of whether the accused was or was not , with respect to the alleged victim , the source of semen or injury ; or ( B ) past sexual behavior with the accused and is offered by the accused upon the issue of whether the alleged victim consented to the sexual behavior with respect to which the sex crime is alleged ; or ( C ) false allegations of sex crimes made at an earlier time ; or ( D ) sexual behavior with parties other than the accused which occurred at the time of the event giving rise to the sex crime charged .
The alleged victim in Molen was S.Z. , and the defendant , Michael Molen , “ filed a pretrial motion in limine seeking an advance ruling that the court would admit testimony by five family members who would say that S.Z. ’s mother had exposed the child to graphic sexual conduct prior to the charged offense . ”
According to Molen ,
One of the most pressing questions the jury will ask itself is how this eight year old girl would know so much about sex unless she had actually been molested .
The Defense will produce several witnesses , including the sisters and mother of [ T.D. ] , the alleged victim ’s mother , who will testify that [ T.D. ] has exposed her daughter [ S.Z. ] to a constant , graphic , sexually charged lifestyle for her entire life , including openly having sex with multiple partners with [ S.Z. ] in the home , openly discussing and showing sex toys and pornography in front of [ S.Z. ] , and openly disrobing in front of other family members in the presence of [ S.Z. ] , etc .
This evidence is not only relevant under IRE Rule 401 and 402 , it is crucial to the jury ’s understanding of [ S.Z. ’s ] knowledge of sexual matters and how she obtained it .
Without it , the jury will make assumptions that are in no way based in reality .
The prosecution argued in response
that how an eight - year - old knows about sex is “ completely irrelevant ” because kids learn about sex in any number of ways at any number of different ages .
The district court apparently agreed with the prosecution ’s relevance argument , because it held that the testimony would not be admitted .
On Molen ’s subsequent appeal , neither side raised Idaho Rule of Evidence 412 , which meant that the Court of Appeals merely had to address the relevance of Molen ’s proposed testimony .
On this front , the Court of Appeals of Idaho noted that most other state courts had
held that evidence of a child victim ’s prior exposure to sexual conduct may be relevant to show an alternative basis for the child ’s sexual knowledge .
For example , in a case involving four child victims , the Wisconsin Supreme Court held the trial court had erred in excluding evidence of a prior sexual assault on one of the children , a seven - year - old boy .
The Court explained :
The inference that [ the victim ] could not possess the sexual knowledge he does unless Ms. Pullizano sexually assaulted the children greatly bolsters [ the victim ’s ] allegations .
In order to rebut that inference , Ms. Pullizano must establish an alternative source for [ the victim ’s ] sexual knowledge .
Evidence of the prior sexual assault is therefore a necessary and critical element of Ms. Pullizano ’s defense .
Nonetheless , the Court of Appeals of Idaho found that the trial court correctly excluded Molen ’s proposed testimony because “ Molen ’s offer of proof d[id ] not demonstrate that S.Z. was previously exposed to the sort of acts and bodily conditions that were described in her report of the charged acts . ”
Of course , the clear implication of the court ’s conclusion is that it would have found the proposed testimony admissible if S.Z. were previously exposed to the sort of acts and bodily conditions that were described in her report of the charged acts .
And , as the court itself noted , the basis for finding such testimony relevant , and thus admissible , is the belief that jurors would infer that a complainant such as S.Z. could not possess the sexual knowledge that she possesses unless the defendant molested her , making the testimony necessary to rebut the inference .
Judge Gratton disagreed with this reasoning .
After noting that this was indeed a case that triggered the rape shield rule , Judge Gratton noted that the majority was in essence adopting the sexual innocence inference theory .
According to Judge Gratton ,
the sexual innocence inference theory is based on the presumption that a jury will likely assume that a child is innocent of sexual matters and , when the child testifies to specific sexual acts , the jury will then infer that the child could not have testified to such acts unless they indeed occurred ….
This theory , backed by scant , if any , empirical data is , however , accepted in some fashion by a majority , but not all courts … .
These courts variously analyze this evidence as a way around rape shield laws or as constitutionally required despite or within the confines of rape shield laws … .
In order to rebut the inference , a defendant , like Molen , will seek to introduce evidence of an alternative source of sexual knowledge from which the child could describe the alleged events .
In the end , if one accepts the theory , at least to some extent , evidence of a child ’s prior sexual knowledge may be relevant to rebut the inference .
In addition to challenging the empirical basis for the sexual innocence inference theory , Judge Gratton took issue with the fact that the theory is treated as an inference .
According to Judge Gratton , “ [ r ] equiring analysis of the proffered evidence as rebuttal of a presumed fact or inference accords it too much weight and skews the relevance and balancing analysis . ”
This is because “ recognizing the theory as a presumption or inference has legal meaning ” as Black ’s Law Dictionary defines a “ presumption ” as
A legal inference or assumption that a fact exists , based on the known or proven existence of some other fact or group of facts .
Most presumptions are rules of evidence calling for a certain result in a given case unless the adversely affected party overcomes it with other evidence .
A presumption shifts the burden of production or persuasion to the opposing party , who can then attempt to overcome the presumption .
I agree with Judge Gratton on both counts .
First , there appears to be very little empirical data supporting the inference .
In support of his claim that there is scant empirical data supporting the inference , Judge Gratton cited to Christopher B. Reid , Note , The Sexual Innocence Inference Theory as a Basis for the Admissbility of a Child Molestation Victim ’s Prior Sexual Conduct , 91 Mich .
L. Rev. 827 , 830 & n.15 ( 1993 ) , in which the author noted that there is “ sparse empirical data which lend [ the inferece ] limited support [ FN15 ] ”
[ FN15 ]
At least one study argues that juries might make the sexual innocence inference in certain situations .
Gail S. Goodman et al. , When a Child Takes the Stand , 11 LAW & HUM .
BEHAV . 27 , 38 ( 1987 ) ( hypothesizing that jurors may be more likely to believe a younger child because such a child does not have the sexual knowledge to be able to fabricate a detailed sexual molestation charge ) ; See also Bruce E. Bohlman , The High Cost of Constitutional Rights in Child Abuse Cases – Is the Price Worth Paying ? , 66 N.D. L. REV . 579 , 582 ( 1990 ) ( “ [ The Goodman study , supra , ] concluded that while credibility usually increases as the age of the child increases , the opposite is true for children testifying in sexual abuse cases .
The study found jurors are more prone to believe a younger child because the young child does not have sufficient experience or knowledge to fabricate a report of sexual activity . ” ) ( footnotes omitted ) .
But see id . at 582 n.21 ( â€ œ The literature is in the developmental stage on the issue of credibility of children , and one can certainly state that children ’s credibility is not a subject on which there is universal agreement .
As in every case , the credibility of each witness is for the trier of fact to determine . ” ) ; HARRY KALVEN , JR .
& HANS ZEISEL , THE AMERICAN JURY 170 ( 1966 ) ( “ [ I ] n a series of child sex cases , the suggestion is that the jury has a distinctive tendency to believe the accused adult as against the accusing young child … .
[ This suggestion is doubtful . ]
One would expect that in these conflicts the choice between child and adult is extremely close , sometimes falling one way , sometimes the other .
And indeed this is the case . ” ) .
In other words , as of 1993 , there was about as much evidence disputing the inference as there was evidence supporting inference , and there was n’t much of either .
I scoured opinions applying the inference since 1993 to try to see if they were relying upon new empirical data to support the inference , and I did n’t find any .
So , if we ’re keeping tabs , both sides in child molestation cases have gripes based upon the lack of empirical evidence supporting credibility - based rules .
As noted above , prosecutors can claim that scant empirical evidence supports the sexual innocence inference theory .
Meanwhile , one of the justifications for Federal Rule of Evidence 414 , which allows for evidence of prior acts of child molestation to be introduced against a defendant charged with child molestation was that “ such cases require reliance on child victims whose credibility can readily be attacked in the absence of substantial corroboration .
140 Cong. Rec. H8991 ( daily ed. Aug. 21 , 1994 ) ( statement of House sponsor Rep. Molinari ) .
And one of the main criticisms of the Rule ( and Rules 413 and 415 ) was that it was not based upon any empirical evidence .
Now , it is bad enough that the majority of courts have adopted the sexual innocence inference theory based upon scant empirical evidence , but , as Judge Gratton noted , it is worse that these courts have given this theory the legal status of an inference .
As Judge Gratton indicated , “ recognizing the theory as a presumption or inference has legal meaning , ” which is why an inference is ” based on the known or proven existence of some other fact or group of facts . ”
For example , to establish an inference of employment discrimination , a plaintiff must demonstrate that :
( i ) she is a member of a protected class ; ( ii ) she was qualified for the position ; ( iii ) she was subjected to an adverse employment decision ; and ( iv ) either the position remained open or she was replaced by someone not a member of his protected class .
And the consequence of a plaintiff establishing this inference is that it shifts the burden of production to the employer to proffer a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its action .
Similarly , when a court recognizes the sexual innocence inference , the burden shifts to the prosecution to establish the irrelevancy of past sexual behavior by the alleged victim , a burden courts generally find that the prosecution cannot establish .
But again , where is the evidence to support the inference ?
In my review of precedent applying the inference , I have never seen a defendant present anything more than the mere assertion that the jury would likely infer that the alleged victim could not possess the sexual knowledge she does unless molested by the defendant .
And , as noted , there is scant empirical evidence to support the inference .
Such a paucity of evidence is insufficient to support inferences in any other context .
So , why do court continue to adopt the sexual innocence inference theory ?

As he prepares to leave Jerusalem after four years as a correspondent , Rory McCarthy reflects on a new , harsher climate of thought that is apparent in the wake of the Dubai assassination .
But this attitude is not universal : dissent thrives in the most unlikely places
A striking advertisement appeared in several Israeli newspapers recently .
It depicted Professor Naomi Chazan , former deputy speaker of the Knesset and respected political scientist , wearing a horn strapped to her forehead .
It was the latest offensive in a campaign against the New Israel Fund , of which she is president .
Its apparent crime : financing Israeli human rights groups who challenge violations by their country 's government and security forces and whose tenacious questioning , you might think , would be hailed a pillar of the vibrant democracy Israel insists it is .
Instead , the fund is derided as " anti-Israel " .
Living here for the past four years , it is hard for me to escape the sense that there is a new climate in Israel , one in which dissent is marginalised and any criticism from abroad robustly shouted down .
In part , it is the result of the election of a staunchly right - wing coalition government .
It also plays on a sense long shared by many Israelis that they are embattled , misunderstood and find themselves in an increasingly unsympathetic world .
Look at the response in the past week to the extraordinary unravelling of the assassination in Dubai of a Hamas militant .
Most voices in Israel have been defiant , with a proud wink and a nod to the much - vaunted secret service , the Mossad , and strikingly little sympathy for those seven , fearful Israeli citizens who had their identities stolen for use by a brazen hit squad .
Israeli officials seem unruffled by the anger in the British , Irish , French and German governments , whose passports have been forged to enable a high - profile extra-judicial killing in which the Mossad is the prime suspect .
Take the new hardline approach of the Israeli foreign ministry .
Last month Danny Ayalon , the deputy foreign minister , called in the Turkish ambassador for a diplomatic dressing - down over a Turkish television show .
It turned into a public humiliation when he sat the ambassador before him on a low sofa and egged on the camera crews to highlight his guest 's discomfort .
That required two apologies to avert a full - blown diplomatic crisis .
Then in a speech last week Ayalon compared the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , one of the most moderate of all Palestinian leaders , to the Taliban .
The next day Ayalon refused to meet a delegation of US congressmen simply because they had travelled with J Street , a new American lobby group which is " pro-Israel , pro-peace " .
It was , said Congressman William Delahunt , " an inappropriate way to treat elected representatives of Israel 's closest ally " .
When the Obama administration demanded Israel halt all settlement construction as a prelude to peace talks with the Palestinians last year , the Israeli government simply refused .
In the end , it offered only a partial , limited curb , but construction continues .
As a result , Abbas is now profoundly , perhaps fatally , weakened .
The prospect of a just , conflict - ending , two - state peace agreement has almost gone .
In my time here , Israel has fought two major wars – in Lebanon and Gaza – which killed more than 2,500 Lebanese and Palestinians and about 170 Israelis .
Most Israelis thought the wars were justified acts of self - defence .
However , particularly after Gaza , the international community began to disagree .
And of this , Israelis are acutely aware .
Last month , the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , listed the " Goldstone effect " as one of Israel 's top three security challenges .
It was a reference to the highly critical UN report authored by the South African judge Richard Goldstone which called on Israel and Hamas to investigate what he found to be credible evidence of war crimes during the Gaza war .
Israel 's approach has been to refuse all participation in the Goldstone inquiry – not even allowing the judge himself into Israel – and to see all the criticism and legal challenges that have followed as a new existential threat , something Netanyahu last week described as " lawfare " .
In other words , legal challenges are now to be regarded as just as unconscionable as militant violence .
It is what one Israeli thinktank , the Reut Institute , called the " de- legitimisation network " , which " operates in the international arena in order to negate Israel 's right to exist and includes individuals and organisations in the west , which are catalysed by the radical left " .
But now I have interviewed hundreds of Israelis , from professors to anarchists , generals to refuseniks , settlers to peace activists , Jews and Arabs , and the Israel I have seen is not formed of the one overarching narrative its government would impose .
Scratch beneath the surface and there are people asking awkward questions .
Sometimes it is just a hint of disagreement .
When I asked one professor last week about the Dubai assassination , he said Israel would be better off making peace with Syria and the Palestinians than killing terrorists .
This month , Ehud Barak , Israel 's defence minister and no dove , warned that failing to reach a peace deal risked creating an " apartheid " regime that ruled over millions of stateless , voteless Palestinians .
True , it is a far cry from the past when the Israeli left was a significant force .
Who now remembers the extraordinary moment in September 1982 when 300,000 Israelis stood in a Tel Aviv square to protest at their government 's complicity in the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps ?
Or the Four Mothers ' movement which in the late 1990s did so much to precipitate Israel 's withdrawal from that bitter 18 - year occupation in Lebanon ?
But even as recently as 2006 , after another Lebanon war , I was among a Tel Aviv crowd that heard the novelist David Grossman deliver an impassioned denouncement of Israel 's " hollow " leadership and call for Israel to talk to the Palestinians and " acknowledge their ongoing suffering " .
And there is Meron Benvenisti , the former deputy mayor of Jerusalem , who argues that Israel and the occupied territories are already a " de facto bi-national regime " .
Sometimes the questioning comes from the most unexpected places .
Breaking the Silence , one of the groups supported by the New Israel Fund , is an organisation of former Israeli combat soldiers who want a public debate about the " moral price " paid by Israeli society for the occupation .
They gather testimony from Israeli soldiers about their experiences , and it is hard to think of a group of people less anti-Israel than Israeli soldiers .
But read their most recent report , containing the stories of dozens of female soldiers .
A lieutenant , posted in the Gaza Strip with the education corps , says : " The truth is that I only confronted it in retrospect , after leaving : suddenly I realised to what extent I had not been a human being out there ...
It 's like a movie with a lot of death around you , an unreasonable reality , with soldiers doing inhuman things to others and to themselves . "
A sergeant from the Nahal unit : " I knew I was not real , I knew that something here was not right .
If I pass a seated person and spit at him , and call him a terrorist because I 've decided he 's a terrorist , then something here is just not right .
And that 's what I tell everyone : come take a look at the blood of someone who 's dead , it 's not right . "
Then there is the minority prepared to come out and protest .
Friday marked the fifth anniversary of the demonstrations in the village of Bil 'in against the West Bank barrier .
More than two years ago , even Israel 's supreme court ordered the state to re-route the fence and return much of the land lost by the village .
It has still not happened .
In recent weeks another regular protest has begun in Sheikh Jarrah , the scene of Palestinian evictions and Israeli settler expansion in east Jerusalem .
At first it was met with a heavy - handed police crackdown , in which several peaceful protesters were arrested until the courts came to their defence .
The crowd on Friday was small , a few hundred perhaps , but a mixture of old leftists , many academics among them , and a younger generation .
Standing in the fading winter sun was Avraham Burg , former head of the Jewish Agency , who described angrily the segregation and discrimination he saw in today 's Jerusalem .
He said he was concerned about the new stifling of free speech , for which the best challenge , he thought , was continued popular dissent .
" Technical democracy is functioning , " he said , " but substantial liberties are not here . "
One of those arrested in the early protests was Hagai El - Ad , head of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , another group supported by the New Israel Fund .
" It is very easy to portray those who do n't support the party line as enemies of the state , but I think that horribly weakens the state , " he told me .
" If this society is finally to start changing course for the better , maybe it will be inspired by what is happening here . "
How a window manager with tiling layouts makes a 1024x600 resolution livable .
I spend a lot of time in front of a screen , and for the past year I have used only my netbook .
No desktops , no laptops .
Just a cheap $ 200 computer that is nearly a kid 's toy .
The most challenging thing about this is dealing with the 1024x600 screen resolution .
When I moved to this screen from something with many more pixels , it at first seemed very cramped .
After a year , I think that the most important part of coping with the small screen is the flexability and customizability of layouts provided by the Xmonad window manager .
In this post I will explain a few layouts I have developed for fitting specific tasks onto the netbook screen .
( I assume that you know maybe 0.1 % of Haskell ( about what I do ) , and can read Haskell code without having a brain aneurysm . )
web browsing
It 's important that the web browser have as few toolbars and other cruft as possible , as horizontal space is especially at a premium .
I 've configured both Epiphany and Firefox to put everything in one tool bar .
But now I use Chromium , which comes pre-configured that way .
What the netbook is designed for .
You just want a web browser , taking up the full screen , and with its own tabs .
So far , so easy : that 's Xmonad 's Full layout .
But , you sometimes want to see two websites side - by - side .
This layout accomplishes that , allowing the sizes to be adjusted as needed .
It also uses Xmonad 's Magnifier to zoom the smaller window when it 's focused , which is useful if you briefly need to see more of a web site .
mySplit = magnifiercz ' 1.4 $ Tall nmaster delta ratio where --
The default number of windows in the master pane nmaster =
1 -- Percent of screen to increment by when resizing panes delta =
3/100 -- Default proportion of screen occupied by master pane ratio = 60/100
web development
If you 're doing web development , you 'll want probably one big web browser window , but also with a nice wide terminal on the same screen , in order to see web server logs .
A simple way to do this is to mirror Xmonad 's Tall layout by 90 degrees .
myWide = Mirror $ Tall nmaster delta ratio where --
The default number of windows in the master pane nmaster =
1 -- Percent of screen to increment by when resizing panes delta =
3/100 -- Default proportion of screen occupied by master pane ratio = 80/100
The myWide layout uses the full screen width for a single terminal , and splits the width when there are more .
This is sufficient for viewing logs and doing minor things at the shell prompt , in between testing the result in the web browser .
Of course a terminal can be temporarily moved to the master area by pressing mod-return , if you need it to be larger .
chat
Tips on configuring Pidgin for a netbook :
Set it up to use vertical tabs to save horizontal space .
Configure the input area to only 1 line tall , and turn off as much other cruft as you can .
The menu bars , sadly , cannot be disabled , nor can the excessively large borders .
In my screenshots , you can see that stuff wasting space that could be used to show four more lines of text .
For chat , you want to put the buddy list on the side of the screen , and use the rest for conversation windows .
Xmonad 's IM module takes care of allocating a sidebar on the screen for the buddy window .
The rest of the screen can be occupied by any layout you choose .
I like to have the conversation windows be as wide as possible , and typically only want to see two conversations at a time .
But sometimes I might have a dozen visible .
A good layout to cope with those needs is Grid .
my Chat ' l = withIM size roster l where -- Ratio of screen roster will occupy size =
1%5 -- Match roster window roster = Title " Buddy List " myChat = myChat ' Grid
The withIM layout puts the buddy list on the left ; I prefer it on the right for some reason , so I tweaked my layout to do that .
All it took was using the reflectHoriz layout modifier to get a mirror image of the layout .
Then I reflect the inner layout back to its normal orientation .
Being able to throw in a few function calls and mutate a layout like that is where Xmonad shines .
my Chat ' l = reflectHoriz $ withIM size roster $ reflectHoriz $ l
logs
Ever notice that tail -f wastes the last line of the terminal ?
On a netbook this matters .
shorttail lets the last line be used .
I have a dedidated workspace that I use to tail logs , and as a place to send long - running tasks ( such as compiles ) .
The layout for this needs to keep windows wide , to see whole logged lines , but they need only be five or so lines tall .
And it 's convenient to have one bigger window with the small ones below .
Xmonad has a perfect layout for this , called Dishes , because it 's sorta like a stack of plates .
myDish = limitWindows 5 $ Dishes nmaster ratio where --
The default number of windows in the master pane nmaster =
1 -- Default proportion of screen occupied by other panes ratio = 1/5
In the second screenshot above , I have 6 windows open , but only 5 are visible .
The limitWindows 5 accomplishes this .
It 's handy mostly because gnome - terminal has a bad habit of crashing when resized to 0x0 .
( That 's gotta be a bug in something ! )
Notice that the screenshots above also have Procmeter in a sidebar on the right .
I ( ab ) used the withIM layout to do that :
myLogs ' l = reflectHoriz $ withIM procmeterSize procmeter $ reflectHoriz $ l where -- Ratio of screen procmeter will occupy procmeterSize = 1%7 -- Match procmeter procmeter = ClassName " ProcMeter3 " myLogs = myLogs ' myDish
coding
Everything above was easy .
Doing coding ( or writing ) on a small screen is where it gets hard .
When I 'm coding I want to have one window that is exactly 80 columns wide , and as tall as possible , where I do the main development .
Then I need a minimum of two other windows also visible : one action window for running tests and the like , and one to view references ( emails , man pages , other files , etc ) .
I may need to view any of these windows fullscreen at any time , of course .
As an example of the three window rule :
While I 'm writing this post , I have a reference window open with my .xmonad / xmonad.hs , and an action window open where I am managing screenshots .
Often , deep into something , I will accumulate many other reference and action windows .
But three seems to be the magic , minimum number for me ; use of screen or anything else does n't reduce it ; if I can't see all three at once , I will waste time and concentration flipping back and forth .
The Xmonad layout I 've developed to handle this is based on the handy FixedColumn layout , which automatically keeps the master window 80 columns wide .
I modify this by adding the Magnifier , so that my action and reference windows " pop out " over the master window when focused .
myCode = limitWindows 3 $ magnifiercz ' 1.4 $ FixedColumn 1 20 80 10
The 1.4 was carefully tuned , to magnify a window to be big enough to be usable for editing , reading , or command - line , while not obscuring too much of the other two windows .
And again I use limitWindows , to only show three windows , in order to keep them all as big as possible .
Other windows are hidden offscreen , but I can rotate to them with alt - tab as needed .
reading ebooks
When I 'm reading an ebook , I want to have the reader in the middle of the screen .
But a widescreen netbook like mine is too wide to comfortably read text all the way across , so it 's nice to have margins .
( In the margins , I put terminals , or notes . )
The ThreeColumns module has a layout that does just that .
myBook = ThreeColMid nmaster delta ratio where nmaster =
1 -- Percent of screen to increment by when resizing panes delta =
3/100 -- Default proportion of screen occupied by master pane ratio = 2/3
putting it all together
I join all my layouts together , so Xmonad will allow switching between them .
These three combinations all have the same layouts , only ordered differently , so that different workspaces can have different default layouts .
codeFirst = myCode ||| myWide ||| myGrid | || myDish dishFirst = myDish ||| myCode ||| myWide ||| myGrid gridFirst = myGrid | || myDish ||| myCode ||| myWide
Xmonad layouts can be decorated with things like title bars .
To save horizontal space , I leave off the title bars on layouts where they are not needed to disambiguate windows .
Two helper functions can be applied to add or remove titles ( and also cause the layout to avoid the Gnome panel . )
withTitles l = noFrillsDeco shrinkText my Theme ( desktopLayoutModifiers l ) noTitles l = desktopLayoutModifiers l
I have semi-dedicated workspaces ; one for each of the above activities .
To assign a layout to a workspace , I use the PerWorkspace module .
Notice that the " web " workspace has only two available layouts .
Meanwhile , the " book " workspace always uses the specialized myBook layout ; I do n't use that layout elsewhere .
perWS = onWorkspace " logs " ( withTitles $ myLogs ' dishFirst ) $ onWorkspace " web " ( noTitles $ ( mySplit ||| myWide ) ) $ onWorkspace " chat " ( noTitles $ myChat ' gridFirst ) $ onWorkspace " book " ( noTitles $ myBook ) $ ( withTitles $ codeFirst )
Finally , I allow toggling between the currently selected layout and fullscreen mode , and use smartBorders to avoid displaying borders when there is only one window onscreen .
myLayout = smartBorders $ toggleLayouts Full perWS
Xmonad layout optimised for the small screen of a netbook : Done !
( For now ... )
To stimulate the growth of type II collagen -- the main protein in the clean , smooth cartilage that caps bones where they make contact in joints -- the NU researchers created a bioactive nanogel that can be injected into the joint in a minimally invasive manner .
The gel self - assmebles into a fibrous , solid extracellular matrix similar to what joint cells see in natural cartilage production .
The gel also binds to one of the key growth factors for cartilage regeneration and keeps it localized in the damaged area .
This stimulates the stem cells present in bone marrow that in turn activate type II collagen production naturally .
The matrix slowly breaks down into nutrients as the natural cartilage builds up , eventually being replaced altogether by locally grown cartilage tissue .

Tiger Woods said sorry .
John
Terry said sorry .
Even ­Vernon Kay said sorry .
It 's a sorry state of affairs .
If you were to rank the three in terms of transgression , that 's probably the order they 'd fall in : Woods first , then Terry , and finally ­Kay ( pictured ) , who did n't even cheat , or at least not in our physical realm .
Texting flirty messages ?
Maybe unwise when you 're otherwise engaged in a relationship , but at the very worst it 's a Matrix shag .
I 'm not exactly what you 'd call a fan of Kay 's presentational style , but I do n't derive any pleasure from watching him squirm and apologise to a pointing , cackling nation .
When did public displays of contrition become the norm ?
More to the point , who actually appreciates them ?
Sitting through any public apology is mortifying .
It just feels wrong .
And ­unless the poor sod in ­question is ­saying sorry for something as ­momentous as a war crime , it 's ­entirely unnecessary .
The public do n't need to hear it , because the public is n't as ­psychotically , self - regardingly deranged as the press .
Consequently , these apologies are aimed not at the public , not at the fans or the ­listeners , but the press .
The press demands apologies on its own behalf , regardless of the will of the people .
And it does this because it is insane , truly Caligula - level insane .
When it comes to the three scandals in question , the press has been ­perpetually and erroneously outraged on behalf of the public .
During the Terry debacle , I was working on a TV show that required me to watch hours of rolling news coverage , like a lab rat with its eyes glued open .
TV news vox pops are about as far from a scientific survey as it's possible to get without literally gluing a scientific survey to a rock , blasting it into deep space and bicycling like billyo in the opposite direction , but still : not one member of the public , with a microphone shoved in front of their face , managed to work up even 1 % of the indignant fury of some media pundits .
For the first ­couple of days , they could n't find ­anyone who would n't simply shrug and say , " So what ?
It 's his private life . "
After a week 's worth of media sabre - rattling and interminable witless debate over the morals of a man who kicks a ball around for a living , they managed to uncover a few – a few – pedestrians who were ­grudgingly ­prepared to admit that maybe he should step down , considering his ­position as a role model to kids .
But the whole role - model - to - kids ­argument was a bogus mantra in the first instance .
For one thing , kids do n't care about or even comprehend their idols ' sex lives , and for another , if you 're so worried about the havoc ­Terry 's shenanigans could wreak on impressionable minds , stop dredging up the details and printing them in simplified prose a child could ­understand , accompanied by massive photographs of his alleged ­mistress in her underwear .
And besides , even if Terry had been caught ­having sex with a Cabbage Patch Doll in the window of Hamleys , he 'd still be a better role model than any tabloid newspaper .
A child who idolised the tabloids would grow up to be a ­sanctimonious , flip - flopping , phone - tapping Peeping Tom who thinks puns are hilarious and spends half its life desperately ­rooting through bins for a ­living .
If I had a child like that , I 'd divorce it .
Or kill it .
Whichever proved cheapest .
Of course , the press has to feign outrage on behalf of the public because that 's ­virtually the only thing that lends the public - interest argument much weight when you 're dealing with ethical transgressions in the private lives of sportsmen .
It 's interesting that when the News of the World lawyer ( the cheerfully named Mr Crone ) spoke to ITN about the ­lifting of Terry 's super - injunction , he said that too often the public 's right to know is overlooked in ­favour of " wealthy and pampered " ­celebrities and footballers .
That 's true , of course , but the words " wealthy " and " pampered " seemed to be ­delivered with particular emphasis , as though this was a noble victory for the ­downtrodden little guy , rather than an immense corporation that makes a fortune from prying into the sex lives of hapless soap stars and ­clueless ball - wallopers .
It would 've been refreshing if he 'd said : " This is an important victory for freedom of the press – but never mind that : wahey !
Filth galore ! "
And then rolled his eyes and rubbed his belly and performed a cartoon backflip .
But no .
He did n't .
Instead ,
Terry paid the price for that daft super - injunction : he was publicly tarred and feathered .
As was Woods .
As was Kay .
In the west , adultery is n't ­punishable by ­stoning .
Instead , if you 're famous ( and even if you 've only committed virtual adultery by text ) it 's punishable by kicking .
Step out of line and the press will encircle and kick you .
And kick you and kick you and kick you until you beg for forgiveness .
At which point , if you 're lucky , they 'll chortle and sneer and move on .
They must be ­frightfully proud .
A sexual act performed in the presence of Lord Stanley 's Cup by a large group of people ( traditionally a Canadian hockey or olympic team ) .
During this act a single person often referred to as the " Prime Minister " will sport a pair of recently slaughtered moose antlers and have him / herself richly lathered in countless kilograms of maple syrup .
Then while humming the Canadian national anthem the other participants will remove the maple syrup and transfer it into the Stanley Cup without the use of their hands or inhibitions .
If you are moving from Office 2003 to 2007 or 2010 Beta , get ready for a learning curve when it comes to The Ribbon .
Instead of having the learning experience be frustrating , you can install a cool add - in called Ribbon Hero , a game that makes the learning process more fun .
Ribbon Hero
Note :
You ’ll need to download and install Visual Studio Tools for the Office system 3.0 runtime if not installed already .
After you install Ribbon Hero and open a supported Office app , the first time you ’ll get a verification message warning … we ’ve tested it and it ’s safe , so you can go ahead and let it install .
You ’ll need to verify it the first time you open Word , Excel , and PowerPoint .
When the install is complete and the Office application opens ( in this instance it ’s Word ) , you have the option to watch a tutorial video .
Uncheck the box net to Show this dialog upon startup if you do n’t want to see it anymore then click Close .
In the Home tab you will see Ribbon Hero located in the Office Labs panel .
When you kick off Ribbon
Hero you ’ll see how many points you have , a new challenge ( here we see how to apply Styles ) , Connect with Facebook , and your points breakdown .
Each challenge you can decide to play or skip to the next one .
Since we have no points yet , let ’s take a look at the challenge .
They give you an overview of what it is , so here we need to apply professional styles to a document with one click .
They also show you the before and how it will look after you successfully change it .
A new document opens up and again you ’re shown how it should look .
You need to apply the changes to the part of the document on the top .
We went through and made the simple style adjustments to the document and yay !
We can see the congratulations image , amount of points scored , and a balloons graphics floats by in the right panel .
Here we move on to the next challenge which is adding effects to a picture .
Here I am going through the second step of manipulating the image .
If you need help figuring it out , you can pull up a hint and it will show where in the Ribbon you need to go to make the changes .
This is basically how you play and after you achieve the goal you can see how many points you ’ve got and continue on to the next challenge .
You can also score points by doing things on your own as you would in everyday document creation .
You can use Ribbon Hero in PowerPoint …
and also in Excel …
You can share your scores with your friends on Facebook and challenge them as well .
This might seem like a dorky game , but if you have some free time and want to learn how to use the Ribbon to manipulate documents , it ’s a lot more fun than searching through help files trying to figure it out .
If you ’re looking for a way to make learning the Ribbon more tolerable , you might want to try out Ribbon Hero and introduce it to your friends and co-workers .

A new study of young children in orphanages in Bucharest , Romania , has found that children placed in foster care before age 2 were more apt to develop secure attachments to their foster parents than those who entered foster care after age 2 .
The study is based on data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project , the first randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutional care .
It was carried out by researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine , the University of Maryland , Harvard Medical School / Children 's Hospital Boston , and the University of California , Los Angeles , and appears in the January / February 2010 issue of Child Development .
The study 's goal was to determine whether a family - based intervention such as foster care could improve the quality of attachments between Romanian 3 - year - olds and their caregivers .
The researchers studied 169 children : Some had been in institutions from birth , some were institutionalized at birth and later placed in foster care , and some were raised by their families at home .
Children who were put in foster care before 24 months were much more likely to develop secure attachments to their foster parents than those placed after 24 months , the study found .
Children show secure attachment when they show behaviors that indicate they can reliably turn to caregivers for reassurance , comfort , or protection if they are frightened or need help .
In contrast , children cared for in institutions who were n't placed in foster care were more likely to have unusual and abnormal patterns of attachments to their caregivers , the study found .
" These findings are important for abandoned and abused or neglected children around the world who receive nonparental care , " according to Anna T. Smyke , associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Tulane University School of Medicine , the study 's lead author .
" Foster care is often thought of as ' just a place to stay , ' but it actually can be a powerful intervention to help young children recover from a variety of difficult early experiences . "

The Bucharest Early Intervention Project was funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Early Experience and Brain Development .

We were doing some shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York City , and during the commercial breaks I 'd go out and talk to the people in the audience .
And a little boy stood up and asked , When was the Magna Carta signed ?
I said 1216 .
I was off by a year .
I know a lot about the Magna Carta , but unfortunately I got the date wrong in front of 6,000 people .
I like to think that I 've picked up a lot of random trivia as a writer .
I often blurt out trivia at really inappropriate moments in casual conversation .
I like to think that I would rock on Jeopardy ! , but I have taken the show 's sample audition quizzes before , and the fact is ... I suck .
However , if there 's ever a Jeopardy !
category about Jeopardy ! , I might just ace it ... and now you can too .
After pitching it to the network brass , Merv Griffin decided to change the name to the catchier one we know today .
The reason ?
One of the execs thought that the game was a great idea , but that the game needed more jeopardies .
NBC ended up buying the show without even seeing a pilot .
On January 19 , 1993 , Air Force Lt. Col. Daryl Scott cleverly bid just enough to keep him afloat .
The other contestants got the question wrong and lost everything .
No one else has ever won by keeping a single George Washington .
The answer ?
“ His books ‘ No Easy Walk to Freedom ’ and ‘ The Struggle is My Life ’ were published during his imprisonment . ”
The question ?
“ Who is Nelson Mandela .
” If you ’re familiar with the song , no doubt it ’s not much of a lullaby to you - it serves more as a reminder that time is running out and you ’d better hurry .
It was tweaked a little bit and renamed “ Think ! ”
Over the years , Griffin estimated that royalties from the theme song earned him roughly $ 70 million .
He ’s the only contestant to surpass $ 52,000 in one day , and he surpassed it by a landslide with $ 75,000 .
Jennings actually holds 11 of the top 15 earnings spots .
One of these top 15 spots was actually earned during Jeopardy !
Kids
Week by a 12 - year - old from Virginia named Kunle Demuren , whose knowledge and quick buzzer finger earned him $ 49,000 .

They would pass preliminary tests over the phone and then set up a date and time to audition in person if the were eligible .
Once they made it to the actual office , potential contestants went through a written test and a faux game .
These days , the audition process often starts on the Internet during designated testing times .
Sometimes a “ Brain Bus ” also roams the country and tests Ken Jennings - wannabes .
If you think you have what it takes , one of the online testing periods is coming up soon - January 26 - 28 for adults .
They all returned the following week to play again .
You can see it happen here - Alex Trebek seems quite pleased .
Original host Art Fleming has a cameo as himself and original announcer Don Pardo shows up to tell Yankovic all of the fabulous prizes he failed to win .
The funny thing is , Weird Al was actually on Rock & Roll Jeopardy and lost to Gary Dell ’ Abate , better known as Howard Stern ’s sidekick Baba Booey .
She helped him develop the unique answer - and - question format when they were on a plane ride to New York in the early ' 60s .
From 1964 - 1975 , a piece Julann composed served as the theme to the show .
It was called " Take Ten . " .
Trebek is pretty brainy .
Time magazine once asked him if there was an easy question that he ever did n't know the answer to , and this was Trebek 's response :
He admits that he probably would n't do too well if he actually had to participate on the show , though , due to his slow reflexes .

Richard Branson has labelled Ferrari 's attack on Formula 1's new teams as ' sad ' , and thinks the Italian outfit should be welcoming fresh competition rather than be unhappy about it .
A column on Ferrari 's website this week attacked the push by former FIA president Max Mosley to bring new teams into the sport because of the struggles that US F1 and Campos Meta had faced .
It claimed Mosley 's ' holy war ' had been a failure and reckoned that F1 would have been better off keeping manufacturers like BMW and Toyota involved .
Branson , whose Virgin Racing team is one of four new outfits that won an entry for this season , is clearly unimpressed by the stance adopted by Ferrari - especially because proposed rules breaks that would have helped new outfits were blocked by the established teams .
" I think that it is a bit sad to see Ferrari carrying on with those kinds of words , " said Branson during a visit to testing at Barcelona on Saturday .
" F1 needs new teams , and Ferrari won the battle of making sure the new teams were shackled .
For testing , we built a new car and we are going to have to have exactly the same amount of practice time as Brawn or Ferrari or the others , who have had years and years and years to get their cars to a certain stage .
" We are not complaining about it , and we are happy to go on with it , but Ferrari should be welcoming new teams because they [ the new teams ] make the sport much more exciting .
And we will make them look better for a year or two until we catch them up .
Ultimately , I think the new teams will give Ferrari a run for their money and I think will make the sport more exciting - particularly as the budgets come down to more realistic levels . "
Branson also believes that the move by manufacturer teams that blocked the FIA 's plans to put a budget cap in place for this season was wrong .
" I think it was a pity that they were resistant and I think it is foolish actually , " he said .
" I think the one thing the Virgin team will prove is that you can have a really good racing team , running very fast , within a very tight budget .
There is no need to do massively expensive windtunnel testing , or all the other things that they do to get the extra second or two . "
Although the VR - 01 has had a troubled baptism , with hydraulic problems and a wing failure blighting early running , Branson is not unhappy with the state his team is in .
" We are tremendously excited , " he said .
" We love supporting the underdogs in every area that we are in .
This is one of the new teams .
The new teams eight or nine months ago were going to be given a few breaks here and there in order to give them a bit of a leg up - as it is they have been told that they have to come into the race with exactly the same rules as the teams that have been going for 20 , 30 or 40 years .
" So it is going to be tough for them - as it is literally having to start from scratch .
But that is what we at Virgin like - we like a challenge .
We 've got the best people in the world to work with and it is going to be very , very exciting . "
He added : " By the start of the season I think the gap between the new teams and the old teams will be less .
Give it a year or two - you cannot just build a new team from scratch and immediately start beating Ferrari that has spent £ 400 million on a car - whereas Virgin has spent less than £ 40 million .
" That is the budget that all the teams were meant to spend this year but then at the last minute changed the rules to spend the same kinds of monies that they have been spending for years .
So , the budgets are a lot less but they are going to be tremendous cars .
There will be a race among the new owners and then in time the new owners will start picking off some of the established teams . "
When asked about his target for the year , he said : " If this year we can beat the other new teams that will be a great start .
If we can take one or two of the established teams occasionally that will be fun , and then next year we will go a little bit better and start moving forward .
" Once the budgets for the established teams comes down to the £ 40 million that Bernie Ecclestone and the FIA have said they must come down to - then we will see a much more equal playing field . "
Eight years ago , my husband John and I left our home in Santa Fe , New Mexico , for a holiday in New York .
We wanted to celebrate having gone into business together ; I was a financial adviser , John a lawyer .
It felt like an exciting time .
But within a couple of days of ­arriving , we started to feel sick .
At first we thought we had flu , but then we both developed painful swellings in our groins .
The hotel sent us to a travel doctor who was so familiar with bizarre diseases that he diagnosed us immediately .
Unsurprisingly , he had never seen a case of bubonic plague before – there had n't been one in New York City in more than 100 years – and I think he was quite excited .
He pulled a book off his shelf and showed us a photograph of a bubo : a large , red swelling of the lymph node .
We were sent straight to hospital , and admitted under all kinds of security .
Plague is a possible bio- terrorism disease , so we were , until proven otherwise , suspected terrorists or victims of terrorism .
Within hours the story had reached the press , and when I looked out of the ward window , there were news trucks lined up on the street .
I was in a state of shock .
I was in hospital with the plague and watching the doctor who had diagnosed us being interviewed on Good Morning America .
It felt like a surreal movie .
We were dosed with antibiotics , which worked on me almost at once .
I started to feel the media hysteria was a fuss about nothing .
I 'd known the plague existed in New Mexico , and that every few years someone got it .
We were still young and in good health – John was 53 , I was 47 .
We 'd be up and out in a couple of days .
But 24 hours later it was clear John was getting worse .
He had something called disseminated intravascular coagulation , which meant his blood was clotting and his organs shutting down .
The doctors put him into a drug - induced coma and pumped him full of liquids to rehydrate him .
He looked horrific .
His body and face swelled up , and his hands and feet developed gangrene .
Eventually the doctors said they would have to amputate his legs below the knees .
John 's whole family flew in from different directions .
My three stepchildren were distraught ; they thought they had come to say goodbye to their father .
He was in a coma from 5 November until mid-January , and I was at his bedside every day ; I would n't let myself consider that he would n't make it .
Gradually , over several weeks , he regained consciousness – and the first thing he did was ask me to rub his feet .
I thought I 'd have an army of doctors , social workers and psychologists to tell him about the amputation , but it was just me and his sister .
He mouthed the words , " What ?
My feet ?
That 's unbelievable . "
By February he was strong enough to fly by air ambulance back to Santa Fe , where he was admitted to a local hospital .
When I first walked into our home , I thought , " Oh God , this is where it happened , where we were bitten by a flea and given the plague that changed our lives for ever . "
John and I have read a lot about the medieval plague since then and the symptoms are very similar .
I remember in the hotel , getting sicker and sicker , having this feeling of impending doom and darkness .
That was a characteristic of the plague back then .
The burning fever , the achiness ; it was so accurate .
No one knows why it affected John more than me .
During the Black Death , there were people who survived and there are theories that some of us over here have genes from our European ancestors that protect us .
It has been a long , slow recovery for John .
For such an active person , learning to walk again has been tough , but the good thing is we both appreciate everything far more than we ever could have imagined .
We feel pretty macho , too .
We survived the bubonic plague .
That 's a big deal .
There were people who asked , " How can you go back to New Mexico ? " but we knew it was just rotten luck .
John 's brother won $ 27 m in the Texas lottery a number of years ago .
Statistically , there is a greater chance of winning the lottery then there is of getting the plague .
To some , it might seem as if John got the raw deal , but he was given less than a 1 % chance of survival and he made it .
That 's pretty lucky .

Rachel Maddow has been on FIRE this week .
I ’ve been a fan of hers since I started listening to her Air America podcasts three years ago .
Smart .
Funny .
Brilliant .
Incisive .
Genius .
Awesome .
All of these words describe her well .
When she ’s on a panel , she ’s the smartest person there .
When she ’s on the radio , she has no peer .
When she ’s on television , she brings a fresh dose of reality into our living rooms unlike any other pundit or newsperson .
But this week …ah , this week .
Rachel Maddow is clearly out to change the way things are in this country right now .
Our current trajectory is toward a gridlocked Congress that can accomplish nothing .
If that does n’t change , it wo n’t matter which party is in power , nothing significant will ever be accomplished ever again .
Rachel Maddow is out to change that trajectory .
First , on Monday , she talked about what “ civics literacy tests ” really mean .
The dog whistle phrase uttered by Tom Tancredo is red meat to racist , xenophobic conservatives but it comes with tremendous baggage and national shame .
Maddow unflinchingly pulled back the curtain to show us what it really means .
Video is available in Vita Brevis ’ Rec Listed diary at the Daily Kos from Tuesday .
Here ’s a tasty morsel :
But I want you to know first , that this is what it was like .
You would head down to the courthouse to register to vote , if you dared .
In order to register , you ‘d face an exam .
It was sometimes called a literacy test , but it was n‘t testing to determine necessarily if you could read or write .
If you were black , the test was designed purely to afford a legalistic veneer of justification for denying you your constitutional right to vote .
The questions were n‘t about ABCs .
They were — they were questions like this one , from Alabama ‘s literacy test in 1965 .
If a person charged with treason denies his guilt , how many persons must testify against him before he can be convicted ?
Do you consider yourself qualified to vote in this country ?
Can you answer that question ?
You want to hear it again ?
If a person is charged with treason — if a person charged with treason denies his guilt , how many persons must testify against him before he can be convicted ?
Or how about this one from the same test :
In what year did the Congress gain the right to prohibit the migration of persons to the states ?
Do you know the answer to that one ?
Again , these are from Alabama ‘s literacy test in 1965 .
It was applied selectively , of course , to black voters , to keep them from registering .
If you lived in Georgia in 1958 , you would have faced questions like this one :
Who is the solicitor general of the state judicial circuit in which you live and who is the judge of such circuit ?
If such circuit has more than one judge , name them all .
How did you do on that one ?
Or how about this one :
What does the Constitution of Georgia provide regarding the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus ?
If you wanted to vote in Georgia in 1958 , those are the questions you would have to answer .
But , of course , not everyone would face those questions .
The board of registrars had the sole authority to determine who got asked which literacy test questions and whose answers to those questions rendered them ineligible to vote .
The idea was that black voters were n‘t being denied the right to vote based on race .
That would be illegal .
No , those voters just could n‘t pass this literacy test .
This is n‘t the plot of some Kagzo ( ph ) Klansman gothic short story .
This is n‘t a theoretical for first - year law students .
This is n‘t some State Department report on some tin pot dictatorship halfway around the world that we can‘t pronounce .
This is American history .
This is really , really recent American history — as in this lifetime for a lot of people American history .
And the opening night speech at the national tea party convention this weekend proposed bringing the literacy test for voting back .
And that proposal got a warm round of applause .
Then there was Tuesday .
On Tuesday , Ms. Maddow spoke directly to President Obama ( with a passing glance at Senate Democratic leaders ) :
President Obama originally wanted health reform done by august .
That did not happen because Max Baucus decided to waste three months chasing bipartisanship in the Senate Finance Committee .
Now , Mr. Obama plans to hold a bipartisan health summit in two weeks , which you just heard Senator Wyden talking about .
It will be presumably be similar to the bipartisan health summit that Mr. Obama held at the White House last March .
When President Obama addressed House Republicans last month , he rattled off a whole list of ideas taken from Republicans and put into the health reform bill .
All of that bipartisan - reaching , all of that eternal optimism has resulted in exactly one Republican vote for health reform in the entire Congress .
Congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana is the only Republican in Washington who voted for health reform , and he now says he wo n‘t do so again .
It does n‘t matter what ‘s in the bill .
It does n‘t matter which of their ideas you incorporate .
Republicans are not going to support this , period .
She then proceeded to eviscerate the stunningly hypocritical GOPosaurs who trash Obama ’s programs with one face and then take personal credit for their success with the other .
The epic pwning was something to see .
You can watch videos of it in ProgressiveLiberal ’s Rec Listed diary at the Daily Kos from Wednesday .
Highly recommended viewing and the Dems owe Rachel Maddow an enormous debt of gratitude for this opening salvo in the midterm election campaign .
Then came Wednesday when Bill Nye the Science Guy looked into the camera and spoke to climate change deniers the way he normally speaks to children ; in calm , direct , easy - to - understand language .
He told them this :
MADDOW : Is it consistent to have extreme weather conditions , like big storms , or even seasonally appropriate storms , and to have the kind of climate change that ‘s been forecast and discussed by most of the reputable scientists in the world ?
NYE : I know what you ‘re driving at Rachel .
Yes .
This would be consistent with such a thing — as is no snow near the city of Vancouver , on Mt. Cypress there .
As is the big mudslides we had here in southern California the day before yesterday , and a little bit last night .
There ‘s more energy in the atmosphere , and this is stirring things up .
If you want to get serious about it , these guys claiming that the snow in Washington disproves climate change are almost unpatriotic .
It ‘s really they ‘re denying science .
So , they ‘re very happy to have the weather forecast be accurate within a few hours , but they ‘re displeased or un-enchanted by predictions of the world getting warmer .
It ‘s really — it ‘s a— it shakes me up .
You can watch the video at Laughing Planet ’s Rec Listed diary at the Daily Kos from Thursday .
Then finally on Thursday , Rachel Maddow took on the boring meme that is the “ filibuster ” .
This resulted in yet another fourth Maddow - related Rec Listed diary at the Daily Kos from Eileen B on Friday .
Watch the video :
The suggestions are flowing in to her website and I have no doubt that once it ’s over , we ’ll have a snappy , sexy , thought - provoking , meme - evoking reference to the filibuster that Dems can use to pummel the GOPosaurs with .
Four days .
Four monumental , nearly historic op - eds by Rachel Maddow .
Four Rec Listed diaries at the Daily Kos based on her presentations .
We have gridlock in Congress that will never go away unless emperor is told he is naked and it wo n’t matter if the Democrats or the Republicans are in charge .
If anyone doubts that the Democrats will pull this same shit when they are in the minority , they are fooling themselves .
The camel ’s nose is under the tent and there ’s no turning back .
Along this trajectory Congress will never recover its ability to lead .
Only by changing the trajectory , exposing the lies and hypocrisy and open deception of the American populace that is taking place will this change .
And Rachel Maddow is very clearly and very deliberately taking it upon herself to change that trajectory .
Today she unleashed another salvo but this time on a more mainstream show , Meet the Press .
More pulling back the curtain .
More exposing lies and hypocrisy .
More plain talk that everybody can understand .
We all owe a debt of gratitude to Rachel Maddow .
May she continue doing what she ’s doing until the whole country gets it .
Oh , and can I just say there ’s one other reason I love Rachel Maddow ?
It ’s because of this :
Awesome .
I ’m just sayin ’ …

What 's New with Amazon EC2 .
2009 is over .
Yeah , sure , trueg , we know that , it has been over for a while now !
Ok , ok , I am a bit late , but still I would like to get this one out – if only for my archive .
So here goes .
Virtuoso
Let ’s start with the major topic of 2009 ( and also the beginning of 2010 ) : The new Nepomuk database backend : Virtuoso .
Everybody who used Nepomuk had the same problems : you either used the sesame2 backend which depends on Java and steals all of your memory or you were stuck with Redland which had the worst performance and missed some SPARQL features making important parts of Nepomuk like queries unusable .
So more than a year ago I had the idea to use the one GPL ’ed database server out there that supported RDF in a professional manner : OpenLink ’s Virtuoso .
It has all the features we need , has a very good performance , and scales up to dimensions we will probably never reach on the desktop ( yeah , right , and 64 k main memory will be enough forever ! ) .
So very early I started coding the necessary Soprano plugin which would talk to a locally running Virtuoso server through ODBC .
But since I ran into tons of small problems ( as always ) and got sidetracked by other tasks I did not finish it right away .
OpenLink , however , was very interested in the idea of their server being part of every KDE installation ( why would n’t they ; ) ) .
So they not only introduced a lite - mode which makes Virtuoso suitable for the desktop but also helped in debugging all the problems that I had left .
Many test runs , patches , and a Virtuoso 5.0.12 release later I could finally announce the Virtuoso integration as usable .
Then end of last year I dropped the support for sesame2 and redland .
Virtuoso is now the only supported database backend .
The reason is simple : Virtuoso is way more powerful than the rest – not only in terms of performance – and it is fully implemented in C ( ++ ) without any traces of Java .
Maybe even more important is the integration of the full text index which makes the previously used CLucene index unnecessary .
Thus , we can finally combine full text and graph queries in one SPARQL query .
This results in a cleaner API and way faster return of search results since there is no need to combine the results from several queries anymore .
A direct result of that is the new Nepomuk Query API which I will discuss later .
So now the only thing I am waiting for is the first bugfix release of Virtuoso 6 , i.e. 6.0.1 which will fix the bugs that make 6.0.0 fail with Nepomuk .
Should be out any day now . :)
The Nepomuk Query API
Querying data in Nepomuk pre-KDE - 4.4 could be done in one of two ways : 1 . Use the very limited capabilities of the ResourceManager to list resources with certain properties or of a certain type ; or 2 .
Write your own SPARQL query using ugly QString : : arg replacements .
With the introduction of Virtuoso and its awesome power we can now do pretty much everything in one query .
This allowed me to finally create a query API for KDE : Nepomuk : : Query : : Query and friends .
I wo n’t go into much detail here since I did that before .
All in all you should remember one thing : whenever you think about writing your own SPARQL query in a KDE application – have a look at libnepomukquery .
It is very likely that you can avoid the hassle of debugging a query by using the query API .
The first nice effect of the new API ( apart from me using it all over the place obviously ) is the new query interface in Dolphin .
Internally it simply combines a bunch of Nepomuk : : Query : : Term objects into a Nepomuk : : Query : : AndTerm .
All very readable and no ugly query strings .
Shared Desktop Ontologies
An important part of the Nepomuk research project was the creation of a set of ontologies for describing desktop resources and their metadata .
After the Xesam project under the umbrella of freedesktop.org had been convinced to use RDF for describing file metadata they developed their own ontology .
Thanks to Evgeny ( phreedom ) Egorochkin and Antonie Mylka both the Xesam ontology and the Nepomuk Information Elements Ontology were already very close in design .
Thus , it was relatively easy to merge the two and be left with only one ontology to support .
Since then not only KDE but also Strigi and Tracker are using the Nepomuk ontologies .
At the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit I met some of the guys from Tracker and we tried to come up with a plan to create a joint project to maintain the ontologies .
This got off to a rough start as nobody really felt responsible .
So I simply took the initiative and released the shared - desktop - ontologies version 0.1 in November 2009 .
The result was a s***- load of hate - mails and bug reports due to me breaking KDE build .
But in the end it was worth it .
Now the package is established and other projects can start to pick it up to create data compatible to the Nepomuk system and Tracker .
Today the ontologies ( and the shared - desktop - ontologies package ) are maintained in the Oscaf project at Sourceforge .
The situation is far from perfect but it is a good start .
If you need specific properties in the ontologies or are thinking about creating one for your own application – come and join us in the bug tracker …
Timeline KIO Slave
It was at the Akonadi meeting that Will Stephenson and myself got into talking about mimicking some Zeitgeist functionality through Nepomuk .
Basically it meant gathering some data when opening and when saving files .
We quickly came up with a hacky patch for KIO and KFileDialog which covered most cases and allowed us to track when a file was modified and by which application .
This little experiment did not leave that state though ( it will , however , this year ) but another one did : Zeitgeist also provides a fuse filesystem which allows to browse the files by modification dates .
Well , whatever fuse can do , KIO can do as well .
Introducing the timeline :/ KIO slave which gives a calendar view onto your files .
Tips And Tricks
Well , I thought I would mention the Tips And Tricks section I wrote for the techbase .
It might not be a big deal but I think it contains some valuable information in case you are using Nepomuk as a developer .
Google Summer Of Code 2009
This time around I had the privilege to mentor two students in the Google Summer of Code .
Alessandro Sivieri and Adam Kidder did outstanding work on Improved Virtual Folders and the Smart File Dialog .
Adam ’s work lead me to some heavy improvements in the Nepomuk KIO slaves myself which I only finished this week ( more details on that coming up ) .
Alessandro continued his work on faceted file browsing in KDE and created :
Sembrowser
Alessandro is following up on his work to make faceted file browsing a reality in 2010 ( and KDE SC 4.5 ) .
Since it was too late to get faceted browsing into KDE SC 4.4 he is working on Sembrowser , a stand - alone faceted file browser which will be the grounds for experiments until the code is merged into Dolphin .
Nepomuk Workshops
In 2009 I organized the first Nepomuk workshop in Freiburg , Germany .
And also the second one .
While I reported properly on the first one I still owe a summary for the second one .
I will get around to that – sooner or later . ;)
CMake Magic
Soprano gives us a nice command line tool to create a C++ namespace from an ontology file : onto2 vocabularyclass .
It produces nice convenience namespaces like Soprano : : Vocabulary : : NAO .
Nepomuk adds another tool named nepomuk - rcgen .
Both were a bit clumsy to use before .
Now we have nice cmake macros which make it very simple to use both .
See the techbase article on how to use the new macros .
Bangarang
Without my knowledge ( imagine that ! )
Andrew Lake created an amazing new media player named Bangarang – a Jamaican word for noise , chaos or disorder .
This player is Nepomuk - enabled in the sense that it has a media library which lets you browse your media files based on the Nepomuk data .
It remembers the number of times a song or a video has been played and when it was played last .
It allows to add detail such as the TV series name , season , episode number , or actors that are in the video – all through Nepomuk ( I hope we will soon get tvdb integration ) .
I am especially excited about this since finally applications not written or mentored by me start contributing Nepomuk data .
Gran Canaria Desktop Summit
2009 was also the year of the first Gnome - KDE joint - conference .
Let me make a bulletin for completeness and refer to my previous blog post reporting on my experiences on the island .
Well , that was by far not all I did in 2009 but I think I covered most of the important topics .
And after all it is “ just a blog entry ” – there is no need for completeness .
Thanks for reading .
A Brooklyn jury awarded a woman who was groped by a police officer when she was 17 a total of $ 915,000 .
The panel ruled that the city must pay $ 750,000 , while former Officer Andrew Johnson — who purportedly barged into Ronessa Hollingsworth 's residence , flashed a gun , and forced himself her — must pay $ 165,000 .
The 2006 incident began when Johnson picked up Hollingsworth for truancy .
He reportedly drove her to her family 's apartment , returned hours later , pushed his way inside , and told the teen : " It 's okay .
You 're 17 now .
You 're legal . "
The officer allegedly fled when Johnson spotted her mother 's car outside the window .
According to the Post , Hollingsworth had filed suit against the city , Johnson , and his partner for $ 5 million .
During the criminal case against him , Johnson pleaded guilty to official misconduct and was issued a conditional discharge , meaning he admitted guilt but could not be sentenced .
His partner was never charged or disciplined .
" In essence , the jury has told the Police Department , ' You must supervise and train these officers , ' " said Seth Harris , the victim 's lawyer .
The U.S. government must spend its way out of the recession , the Democrats ' third - ranking House leader stressed Monday .
Rep. James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , the House majority whip , said that trying to find greater savings in the budget , which was released by President Barack Obama this morning , would n't help alleviate the recession .
" We 've got to make some decisions here as to what 's in the best interests of our country going forward , " Clyburn said during an appearance on Fox News .
" And I think the best interest is to invest in education , control these deficits , while at the same time trying to get people back to work . "

" We 're not going to save our way out of this recession , " the majority whip added .
" We 've got to spend our way out of this recession , and I think most economists know that .
" Obama 's budget , which was unveiled Monday morning , calls for $ 3.8 trillion in spending for 2010 , but is projected to cause a $ 1.27 deficit .
A number of key Democrats in Congress have responded to the proposal , including House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey ( D - Wis. ) , who said lawmakers would seek to abide by spending freezes within the budget , but seek to extend caps to defense and national security spending , too .
Some other Democrats have worried that without expanded spending on social programs and other elements of the budget , some people hit hardest by the recession would be disadvantaged by the budget .
Clyburn suggested that talk of reducing the deficit was moot as long as the economy remained sluggish in the foreseeable future .
" You 're not going to bring down the deficits , you 're not going to eliminate these problems without growing this economy , " he said .
" And you 're not going to grow the economy by wishing it ; you 've got to invest in it .
And that 's what we 're doing with this budget . "
A man has been charged with the first degree murder of Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado .
Lopez Mercado , 19 , was found dead by the side of a road on Saturday in the city of Cayey .
His body had been burnt and dismembered .
The fashion student was said to be well - known among the island ’s gay community and was known to have taken part in charity work .
Juan A Martinez Matos was arrested on Monday evening .
He has also been charged with three counts of weapons violations and one count of hiding evidence .
According to Associated Press , Matos is thought to have confessed to the murder .
Authorities are still deciding whether he will also be charged with a hate crime .
Puerto Rico has had laws against homophobic hate crime since 2002 but these have never been used before .
Prosecutor Jose Bermudez Santos said that Matos and Lopez Mercado had met on Thursday night while Lopez was dress in women ’s clothes .
Matos allegedly killed him after discovering he was a man .
Local gay activist Pedro Julio Serrano said : “ All the information we have is very clear that this is indeed a hate crime . ”
Matos could be one of the first to be tried under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act , which offers federal protection against hate crimes motivated by homophobia and transphobia .
The law was signed by President Barack Obama last month .
The days of rifling through couch cushions for a television remote could be coming to an end , as 3 - D gesture - recognition technology finds its way into set - top boxes following a deal between Intel and Softkinetic - Optrima .
Wired.com was given an exclusive sneak peek at the technology in advance the general announcement , which is expected Thursday .
Like a hyperevolved descendant of The Clapper , the devices will let television viewers navigate menus and control volume by moving their arms in a predefined patterns .
Gesture recognition technology — previously somewhat arcane — gathered momentum last year when Microsoft demoed its Project Natal to enormous acclaim .
Natal applies similar technology to hard - core gaming on the Xbox , letting users play fighting games by actually punching and kicking in the air , using technology from Microsoft 's acquisition of Israel - based gesture - recognition company 3DV .
In addition to a partnership with EA Sports for games , Softkinetic - Optrima plans to apply gesture recognition to the lean - back television experience , allowing people to turn up the volume by moving their hand in a circle , switch the channel by swiping to the right , pause by extending their hands in a " stop " gesture , and so on .
Softkinetic - Optrima 's gesture - recognition technology , which links up with cameras with radarlike properties , will be bundled in a box running on top of Intel 's powerful Atom Processor CE4100 , Wired.com has learned .
That chip will appear in Orange 's cable services in Africa , Europe and the Middle East by the end of this year or early next year , and likely in the United States as cable and satellite providers incorporate Intel 's chip , which also supports 3 - D television .
The jury is still out on 3 - D TV , but regardless of whether people are willing to don 3 - D glasses , Softkinetic - Optrima 's gesture - recognition technique might come in handy ( so to speak ) because it works with regular broadcasts and menus .
" We provide basically the exact same technology , except not being Microsoft , we can adapt it to many other environments , like television and set - top boxes , " said Softkinetic - Optrima managing director Michel Tombroff .
This soon - to - be - announced Intel deal sets the stage for cable and satellite set - top box manufacturers to bring gesture recognition to the masses .
Softkinetic - Optrima also licensed its technology to Raytheon earlier this month , for military applications including soldier training , and the company is in talks with medical device manufacturers as well , to make computers doctors do n't have to touch .
Competitors , including Israel - based Primesense , are working on similar projects .
" Any place where a system would be controlled by gestures is a candidate for this technology , " said Tombroff .
But are we ready to control televisions with movements ?
And what about the privacy issues associated with pointing a connected camera at your living room , 24 hours a day ?
According to Intel , we 'll need this technology in part to deal with the fire hose of content streaming through our television sets , which will grow stronger as internet - delivered television becomes commonplace .
" By the year 2015 , it 's expected there will be billions of consumer devices delivering billions of hours of video content , music , videogames and web browsing , so naturally we 'll need much more sophisticated ways to organize and deliver content in interactive and intuitive ways , " said Intel marketing manager Mike Tyson in Softkinetic - Optrima 's statement .
In other words , once these systems evolve , gestures could prove more effective tools for finding content than our clumsy remotes and menus are today ( although TiVo has demonstrated many ways to improve over the interfaces used by most cable providers , which force users to search for the first word in a program 's title ) .
How It Works
The 3 - D camera Softkinetic - Optrima uses for these Intel - inside boxes ( prototype pictured above ) produces a depth map of the distance of each pixel from the camera .
These work more like radar than like a traditional two - lens stereoscopic camera ( like the one used by Earthmine to make more detailed maps than Google 's ) .
That 's because stereo cameras need visible light to make a 3 - D image , and people often watch television or play videogames in relative darkness .
Making matters worse , a purely optical solution can't distinguish between a white shirt and the white wall behind it .
Because you should n't have to turn on the light or change shirts just to switch the channel on your television , the current generation of 3 - D gesture - recognition cameras shine their own invisible , infrared light against their subjects and judge the distance of each point based either on the time it takes to return ( the " time of flight " method " ) or deformations in a projected grid .
Until recently , they were too expensive to be included in consumer devices , so SoftKinetic - Optrima focused on industrial uses , prior to its acquisition of Optrima , which makes the cameras .
As tends to happen with technology , the price of gesture - recognition cameras has dropped significantly over time , to the point where set - top box manufacturers can include them in standard cable or satellite boxes .
The company 's software analyzes 3 - D camera data at 50 frames per second , recognizing gestures and movements or recreating the bodies of one or more people in front of the camera on the television screen , like a lower - resolution version of the cameras - and - dots technique used to capture the movements of athletes for sports videogames .
In the case of 3 - D programming , it can place your avatar within the scene based on the size of the room , where you 're standing in it , your height , and so on , and allow you to grab objects that appear behind other objects .
Privacy Safeguards Apparently in Place , for Now
Today , advertisers and broadcasters pretty much guess at how many viewers they have because televisions do n't know when people leave the room , or how many people are plopped on the couch .
This technology could answer those questions .
The good news : Softkinetic - Optrima says none of the companies it is talking to have any plans to do so – initially , at least .
Television advertisements in some regions already allow voting and other interaction via remote control , according to Tombroff , " but it 's a decision whether they take part in that , by pushing a button .
Here , it 's different , because you are in front of your TV and you are passive , and you must be able to decide whether or not some other entity is watching you or not .
For that reason , since it's a very delicate subject , the default position of all the companies we 've talked with in the TV and set - top box companies is to say ' we wo n't allow that , ' at least for now . "
Cable companies in the United States operate under strict privacy rules , so if movement and presence data were to be sent upstream , users would have to opt-in to the system , and would have the right to see whatever data is being collected about whether they 're in the room , what they 're doing , and how many other people are there .
As viewers demand more interactive features , they could open themselves up to the positive sort of remote monitoring in the name of fun or fitness .
" We are exploring with [ France Telecom 's Orange ] and others ways to make the television experience richer .
Imagine watching a fitness program , and you decide to participate , and you become one of the avatars in the group … or watching a cartoon , and the kid becomes Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck . "
If this is the case , cable and satellite companies will have to offer transparent technologies that make it clear when the camera is on , and when it 's off , similar to the indicator that lights up on active webcams , among other privacy safeguards .
Greenscreen Mobile Teleconferencing on the iPad ?
It Could Happen
The focus of this deal is the set - top box , but Intel also makes computer processors , of course .
Tombroff pointed out that a computer with recipes in the kitchen could benefit from touchless , gesture - based controls , and said he's in talks with a casino game manufacturer about making slot machines that can be played with gestures , in addition to military and medical device manufacturers .
This technology could also improve mobile teleconferencing .
As of now , the cameras are too large , but Tombroff said he expects cheaper , smaller , more power - efficient versions to appear in cellphones and other battery - dependent devices eventually .
By mashing depth data from a 3 - D camera with visual data from a webcam , software can create an artificial backdrop , or include only video of the caller 's face .
Not only would this cut down significantly on the bandwidth required for mobile teleconferencing by eliminating nonessential visual data , but it would let people take business calls without the party on the other line knowing that they 're at their kid 's soccer game .
Set - top boxes with Intel 's CE4100 chip will ship to Orange customers later this year or early next year , and there could be some kinks to work out before U.S. manufacturers decide to integrate the gesture - recognition feature .
For instance , there 's the issue of how the television knows when to take instruction , versus when you 're reaching for a pretzel or gesturing because you want your team 's running back to dodge right .
" You could raise your hand or shake your hand to capture the remote , " said Tombroff .
" It 's also about controlling who in the family is the remote , if you have three people watching TV . "

Update - Apparently Flyfire is a secret still , since it looks like MIT has pulled the video , plus the website , just an hour or so after we posted this .
Weird …
By Evan Ackerman
The problem with true three dimensional displays ( displays that you can walk around ) is that they require pixels to be floating in space .
This has been done with lasers and plasma , but such technologies are super expensive and limited in many ways .
MIT ’s SENSEable City Laboratory in collaboration with ARES Lab ( Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory ) has hit upon the idea of creating huge free form three dimensional displays out of individual “ smart pixels ” made up of micro helicopters carrying LEDs :
Gigantic 3D displays made up of swarms of micro helicopters that can be released into any open space …
How awesome is that ?
More , after the jump .
We ’ve talked about the benefits of swarm robotics before over on BotJunkie : it ’s relatively cheap because the individual robots are simple , if any one robot breaks it ’s easy to replace , and it ’s easily scalable since you can just toss more bots into the mix .
You can even use swarms to compensate for things like batteries : if you initially launch your robots in waves , you can have a whole other group of standby robots that dynamically replace the performing robots as their batteries run out , flying up with their LEDs off to switch places without anybody noticing .
The tricky part , of course , is getting everything to work together .
MIT has big plans for the system , though …
The Flyfire canvas can transform itself from one shape to another or morph a two - dimensional photographic image into an articulated shape .
The pixels are physically engaged in transitioning images from one state to another , which allows the Flyfire canvas to demonstrate a spatially animated viewing experience .
Flyfire serves as an initial step to explore and imagine the possibilities of this free - form display : a swarm of pixels in a space .
You could even play an HD movie on system …
Let me see , to play a movie in 1080 p ( trying to get it to do 1080 i with half the number of bots would be pretty interesting but probably impossible , unless you could get them to do barrel rolls at 60 Hz or something to form the interlacing ) you ’d need over 2 million micro copters to form the base screen , plus however many more are required to swap out for recharging .
Fun to think about , but maybe it would be better to just stick with standard def , since you ’d only need about 350,000 bots .
While the video is a rendering , the robots are real enough , and hopefully we can expect to see some live demos of the entire system sometime soon .

I 'd heard that MooseX : : Method : : Signatures incurred a substantial runtime performance hit .
I wanted to test if that was true so I tried converting Hailo to use it .
The result : Yes , it 's slow :
Here 's how long it takes ( real time ) to train Hailo with a new brain , the command is :
time hailo -- brain megahal.brn -- train /tmp/fortune.trn -- no-progress
The results :
Without MX :: MS : 11.37s
With MX :: MS : 52.09s
With MX :: MS + no type checking : 52.84s
Interestingly
If I do n't do any type checking , I.e. just :
method foo ( $ one , $ two ) { ... }
Instead of just :
method foo ( Str $ one , Str $ two ) { ... }
MX :: MS does n't become any faster , even though it looks like it also has to check that the argument list is of a certain length and that none of the arguments are undef .
These tests can be reproduced by going to hailo's repository on github and checking out either the master , mx-ms and mx - ms - no - validate branches .
Check out version f9786122a08 of master for the most accurate comparison .
Note that Hailo makes a lot of method calls so it's a somewhat biased comparison compared some other programs , but in the future I 'm going to be careful before I use some of the more sugary MooseX modules .
Also it 's unfair to compare 100 % sugar everywhere with 0 % sugar everywhere .
those 12s would probably go to 13s instead of 50s if I had used MX : : MS for all but the most hot code in the application , although in the case of Hailo hot code is a pretty large part of the application compared to some others .
There are also modules like Method : : Signatures : : Simple which have a much smaller performance hit but give you the sugar , but not the type checking .
It 's pretty clear though that to get sugar + type checking + speed we 're going to have to hack up perl 's guts to support that in some way .
Titan ’s hydrocarbon lakes , seen here in radar images , boast life - friendly chemistry ( Image : NASA / JPL )
Saturn ’s frigid moon Titan may be friendlier to life than previously thought .
New calculations suggest Titan ’s hydrocarbon lakes are loaded with acetylene , a chemical some scientists say could serve as food for cold - resistant organisms .
At about - 180 °Celsius , Titan ’s surface is far too cold for liquid water .
But two pairs of scientists proposed in 2005 that alien organisms might live instead in bodies of liquid hydrocarbons on the frigid moon .
They suggested such organisms could eat acetylene that falls to the surface after forming in the atmosphere , combining it with hydrogen to gain energy .
Since then , Cassini has spotted dozens of lakes on Titan ’s surface , thought to be made of a mixture of liquid ethane and methane .
But since no probe has directly sampled them , no one knows how much acetylene they might contain .
Advertisement
An estimate made in 1989 suggested bodies of liquid hydrocarbons on Titan would contain a few parts in 10,000 of acetylene .
But an updated estimate based on data from the Cassini - Huygens mission to Saturn now suggests the lakes contain much more food for any hungry alien life - forms that might be present .
The new calculations were made by a team of scientists led by Daniel Cordier of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Renne , France .
Right temperature
Data from the Cassini spacecraft and the Huygens probe , which parachuted to Titan ’s surface in 2005 , helped Cordier ’s team re-calculate the lakes ’ likely composition .
This depends on factors like a lake ’s temperature , which affects how easily chemicals will dissolve in it , and the rate various chemicals are produced in the atmosphere and rain onto the surface .
The team found that acetylene would be hundreds of times as abundant as the previous estimate , making up one part in 100 of the lake ’s content .
“ Having about a per cent of acetylene is potentially interesting from the life point of view , ” says team member Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
The idea of acetylene - eating organisms on Titan is “ highly speculative ” but intriguing , he says .
Separate layers
“ I think the results are very exciting and further support the possibility for life on Titan , ” says Dirk Schulze - Makuch of Washington State University in Pullman , one of the scientists who proposed the possibility of acetylene - eating life in 2005 .
“ Titan should be one of the two top targets for future astrobiology missions , the other being Mars . ”
But Tetsuya Tokano , a Titan researcher at the University of Cologne in Germany , says the exact amount of acetylene may be less important than other properties of the lakes that remain unknown , such as the existence of currents to keep them well - mixed .
Tokano pointed out in a recent study that without mixing , hydrogen and acetylene would stay in separate layers of the lakes , limiting reactions between them that might otherwise power exotic organisms .

Amy Williams won Britain 's first solo Winter Olympics gold medal for 30 years with victory in the women 's skeleton .
The Bath slider , 27 , broke her own track record on the way to Team GB 's first medal of the Vancouver Games in a time of three minutes 35.64 seconds .
German Kerstin Szymkowiak was 0.56 seconds behind in silver with her team - mate Anja Huber taking bronze , while GB's Shelley Rudman finished sixth .
A Canadian complaint about the helmet worn by Williams was rejected .
It was the second complaint against the aerodynamics of her helmet after the United States issued a similar protest following the opening two runs on Thursday .
But Williams shrugged off the fuss surrounding the design of her headgear as she capitalised on a 0.30 - second overnight lead .
She eclipsed the track record of 53.83 seconds , set in the first of her two runs on Thursday , by 0.15 seconds to open up a 0.52 - second advantage over Canada 's pre-race favourite Mellisa Hollingsworth .
The pressure told on Hollingsworth , who faltered on her final slide and fell away to fifth , while Huber produced the second quickest time on the final run to move up from fifth to third .
Rudman , who was seventh overnight , recorded her two quickest slides , including the overall fastest of 53.82 seconds on the final run , but could only reach sixth .
Williams was last to slide and a solid run of 54.0 seconds was enough to hold off the German challenge and take the title .
She is Britain 's first individual champion since figure skater Robin Cousins won gold in Lake Placid in 1980 .
ROB HODGETTS BLOG Golden girl Amy Williams completed her coronation as Olympic skeleton queen in much the same way she raced here in Whistler .
Smoothly , cheerfully , coolly .
" It 's crazy , " Williams , the first British woman to win individual gold at a Winter Games since 1952 , told BBC Sport .
" I did n't think I 'd be standing here , it 's all such a blur , I can't remember most of the last run .
" I came out at the bottom and saw our performance director Andi Schmid smiling , so I thought it must be good .
" Before the race I was OK , it was a bit weird as I was on my own in the changing room and did n't know when to go out .
" I was a bit nervous before it but I thought I 've got nothing to lose so I thought I 'd just go out and enjoy it and it was great . "
Her achievement is all the more remarkable as Britain does not have a full skeleton track to train on , apart from a dry starting section near Bath .
GB WINTER GOLD MEDALLISTS 2010 : Amy Williams , skeleton 2002 : Women 's curlers 1984 : Torville & Dean , figure skating 1980 : Robin Cousins , figure skating 1976 : John Curry , figure skating 1964 : Dixon & Nash , bobsleigh 1952 : Jeanette Altwegg , figure skating 1936 : Men 's ice hockey 1924 : Men 's curlers Williams was a reserve in Turin four years ago when Rudman won silver and was used as a commentator on the event by BBC Radio 5 live .
She is set to receive her gold medal in a ceremony due to take place at about 0300 GMT on Sunday .
" Never in a million years did I think I 'd come here and win gold , " she added .
" I do n't think it will sink in for weeks and weeks .
" It 's amazing to do this for my country .
I had nothing to lose here and I just went for it .
I enjoyed every minute .
" I 've done everything I possibly could in the last four years to get here and to put in my best performance . "
The United States lodged a complaint , supported by five other nations , against Williams ' helmet after Thursday 's two runs but it was dismissed by skeleton 's international governing body .
The US had claimed ridges on Williams ' helmet gave her an illegal aerodynamic advantage .
Complaints about the ridges in Williams ' helmet were rejected International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation ( FIBT ) jury president Wolfgang Strauss said the helmet 's manufacturer confirmed the ridges , or spoilers , " are an integral part of the helmet " .
Canada then lodged a second complaint after Williams ' winning run on Friday but that too was thrown out .
Williams ' gold is Britain 's first at a Winter Olympics since Scot Rhona Martin led the curling team to victory in 2002 , and the nation 's ninth gold in total .
Sir Steve Redgrave , who won five Olympic gold medals at the Summer Games , said the victory would prove inspirational for Team GB , which has waited until day seven of the Games for its first 2010 medal .
" It 's a huge boost , " he said .
" All the British athletes in the village were buzzing that we were going to get a medal here and for that medal to be a gold one is very , very impressive .
" They 're going to be thrilled but they 're also going to be thinking , ' Well , why can't I do that ? '
We 've got a couple more chances but it was much needed for morale . "
The gold continues a fine run of British skeleton sliding since the sport was reintroduced to the Winter Olympics at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games .
Alex Coomber won bronze eight years ago , and Rudman secured silver in Turin in 2006 .

In addition to Gary Cass of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission and Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association , we can now add Wiley Drake to the list of those siding with Pat Robertson in the wake of his Haiti “ swore a pact to the Devil ” comments :
Evangelist broadcaster Pat Robertson attracted criticism last week when he said that Haiti was “ cursed ” because it made “ a pact with the devil . ”
But that has n’t stopped Buena Park Pastor Wiley Drake , a Southern Baptist , from saying he shares Robertson ’s view .
“ I do n’t know that God brought that earthquake or not , ” Drake said .
However , the misfortunes of the country – including its extreme poverty , ongoing political turmoil and frequent natural disasters – could be repercussions of the alleged deal with Satan , he said .
…
“ They said , ‘ If you ’ll help us , we ’ll dedicated ourselves and our government to Satan , ’ ” said Drake … While the devil pact was set to expire in 2004 , then - President Jean - Bertrand Aristide approved Voodoo as an officially recognized religion , renewing the deal , according to Drake associate David Fox , a missionary in Haiti .
However , the subsequent ouster of Aristide prevented that renewal from taking effect , Fox says .
I asked Drake how the current devastation could be attributed to an expired pact :
“ The pact may not be there , but the results of it may be , ” he said .
Melvin Chelsky was riding the 103 Mount Pleasant north bus Monday morning when he — and the entire bus — felt a bump .
The driver got out to investigate , only to discover that a 60 - year - old woman had been hit and killed instantly .
“ I almost thought she was a child — she looked about 80 or 90 pounds , ” Chelsky said .
The woman , who police say lived in the area , was walking to work at about 7 a.m. when she was struck while crossing Eglinton Ave. at a light , from the northwest to southwest corner .
It is unclear if the light was green .
The bus had been southbound on Mount Pleasant Ave. and was turning west onto Eglinton when it hit her , police say .
She was pronounced dead at the scene .
Her identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin .
Const .
Hugh Smith of traffic services said that visibility was a likely factor in the collision .
The woman was wearing dark clothing , he said , and nearby buildings block some driver visibility .
Smith said police hope to speak to more witnesses .
Chelsky said another passenger stayed behind with the bus driver who “ was in shock .
He was totally wiped out at that point . ”
The police investigation shut down the intersection for the rest of the morning .

The tiny community of Lampuuk in northern Indonesia was almost totally destroyed by the Boxing Day tsunami five years ago .
It used to be a popular tourist destination , but since the tsunami Sharia Law has been more rigorously enforced and police patrol the beaches to ensure visitors are appropriately dressed and acting in a demure way .
Tsunami : 5 Years
On will be broadcast on Wednesday , 27 January , at 2100 GMT on BBC Two .
Or catch - up afterwards on BBC iPlayer ( UK only ) .
So yesterday we hopped up to Oxford to see the Steampunk show at the Museum of the History of Science .
Both Oxford and Cambridge have such museums , and they ’re both a short day trip from London .
And to have a show on Steampunk — the first museum show on the subject , we ’re assured .
How cool is that ?
So for the unenlightened , what is Steampunk ?
It ’s a genre of sf ( which can be either science fiction , or speculative fiction , although when I use the latter term , people usually look a little confused , so then I have to explain that it ’s what a lot of people call science fiction these days , since the term “ science fiction ” barely encompasses the breadth and depth of the genre any more — but that ’s another post ) .
Anyway , Steampunk ( or , more properly , the Steampunk revival ) got its start with The Difference Engine , in which William Gibson and Bruce Sterling married hardcore sf with a Victorian world .
Originally set in the 19th century , Steampunk novels and stories morphed quickly into indeterminate worlds , with some common denominators .
Steam , obviously .
Everything – or nearly everything – is powered by steam .
And not just steam .
Because the great thing about any really serious , successful sf is taking a particular idea and running with it , ensuring that the world that gets built up has a consistency with the original notion .
So to have steam , you need energy sources , which may or may not be real ones ( coal , of course ) or something else , like Ian MacLeod ’s ether .
And of course pipes , lots of pipes .
And valves .
A whole lot of valves .
And punchcards , if there are computers .
And brass , lots of brass .
It ’s a mechanical world — there ’s often electricity , but never electronics .
Everything that requires some sort of process entails a mechanical process .
And , of course , dirigibles .
There ’s a whole vast literature out there waiting for you to discover it .
Like everything else , there ’s good stuff , and there ’s not so good stuff .
Me , my favorites would include Tim Powers ( The Anubis Gates ) , Ian R. MacLeod ( The House of Storms and The Light Ages ) , and the Stephen Hunt Jackelian novels ( three so far , and another one just published two weeks ago ) .
A lot of Alan Moore ’s work fits in here too .
But there ’s a whole raft of good stuff , and a good way to survey the field is through the excellent anthology edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer called , funnily enough , Steampunk .
There ’s a good website run by Hunt — in fact , there are a lot of them , and they ’re worth tracking down .
If you ’re on Facebook , you can get on Hunt ’s mailing list for all sorts of interesting stuff .
Because the thing about Steampunk , aside from the fact that it ’s produced some genuinely excellent and thrilling fiction , as that ’s it ’s visual in a way that most fiction is not .
There are a whole raft of movies , and even some TV shows , that have all sorts of Steampunk themes and gadgets .
Pretty much any Terry Gilliam movie , especially Brazil and Baron Munchausen .
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea .
The original Wild , Wild West ( and , I suppose , even the horrible movie . )
And especially The City of Lost Children , which is like Steampunk heaven .
And then there ’s just plain old stuff .
Steampunk glorifies machinery , luxuriates in it–and artists have caught on .
It just lends itself to lots of physical description .
It ’s all familiar stuff , like tubes and valves and watches and meters all encased in brass or whatever .
It ’s all stuff we know , just rearranged .
And this has led to is a design explosion , of really cool stuff .
You might think that it ’s as simple as taking something and throwing a little brass on it , and you ’re there .
But no .
It ’s a real Arts and Crafts thing .
William Morris and John Ruskin would be impressed with a lot of this stuff .
The level of , yes , craftsmanship of some of the stuff that ’s been created is astonishing .
How about a Steampunk blunderbuss ?
Or a Steampunk clock ?
Or a Steampunk motorcycle ?
There has been a literal explosion of design and art around Steampunk , and that ’s what the Oxford show is all about .
And there is some very cool stuff there , made by a number of artists and designers , organized by British artist Art Donovan .
The group represented is truly international — from America , Britain , Australia , the Netherlands , and France .
And the objects are all wonderfully conceived and carefully made , and stunning for the most part .
Like this extraordinary air pump :
Or this clock :
Or this doll :
Or the church tank :
And quite a few of them embody a great sense of fun and droll humor as well , like the “ eye- pod ” :
Or these eyeglasses , with the tea strainer hoods :
Or the Steampunk pet :
The show itself is in the basement of the museum , one of Oxford ’s little treasures , which is conveniently lighted so that you do n’t need your flash , which is a good thing , since you ’re not allowed to use it .
Is n’t that a courteous thing for a museum to do ?
They end the show with a room full of the real thing — large 19th century brass microscopes , strange gauges , and even a portion of the real Charles Babbage Difference engine , or one of Babbage ’s attempts to construct one .
Brilliant .
This is all great fun .
In fact , that ’s perhaps the best thing about Steampunk — it ’s pure fun , especially in the hands of accomplished and visionary artists and craftsmen .
The show runs through 21 February , just one more week , and the link at the top will lead you to bios of the artists , and a raft of stuff about Steampunk .
Worth the trip !

Editorial teams were " up all night " checking through entries
It was once billed the " Patriarch of the Library " but Encyclopaedia Britannica has proven to have a less than orthodox view of the Irish Civil War .
A concise version of the reference work first published seven years ago says the 1922 conflict was between Catholics in the south and Protestants in the north .
As any Irish schoolchild , or indeed anyone who has seen the film Michael Collins knows , it was in fact a conflict fought by those in favour of the 1921 Anglo - Irish treaty and those opposed .
The war was fought among Catholic nationalists in the south .
Northern Protestants had no involvement .
The glaring blunder was carried on a hand - held device first sold six or seven years ago but was only spotted this week .
Ian Grant , managing editor of Encyclopaedia Britannica , said the mistake was " rare " and may have been caused by an editor attempting to condense complex history .
He added that they may have confused the Irish Civil War with the troubles in Northern Ireland .
Confident Mr Grant added that editorial teams in London and Chicago were confident that online databases , which are updated regularly , do not carry other mistakes on Irish history .
He said they had been " up all night " checking through entries .
He added : " It 's important to get this thing right .
If there is a mistake Britannica will always admit it and correct it . "
Encyclopaedia Britannica contains about 64 million words of text from 4,500 contributors around the world and is put together by about 100 editors .
Their offices can receive up to a dozen complaints or queries each week mainly concerning dates .
The Department of Education in the Irish Republic announced last month that the country 's 4,000 schools would have free access to Encyclopaedia Britannica online databases as part of an e-learning initiative .

Reason # 327 : EMDR is some heavy shit
Filed under : February 24 , 2015 , 3:25 pmFiled under : Uncategorized
So I began EMDR therapy a few months ago .
Holy shit is it ever some hard stuff !
Unlike ‘ normal ’ therapy where you go into the therapist ’s office and talk about whatever you feel like that day , this is a very trauma - focused therapy .
The idea is that you focus specifically on the trauma until you come to resolution , and then you do n’t have PTSD anymore .
Voila !
The first session was a get - to - know - you .
The second session she said “ Ok , tell me all about what happened to you .
Tell me your trauma( s ) . ”
So I told her everything .
The babysitter .
My Dad .
My brother .
The sexual abuse .
The physical abuse .
The marrying the love of my life that we both thought was a man who ended up actually being a woman on the inside , and now on the outside too .
It was nice getting it all out with the therapist in the very beginning .
No sitting there wondering when I am supposed to tell her all this shit .
She spent the next few sessions after that ‘ strengthening me ’ .
Those were her words .
Basically , she had me imagine the little girl part of me and begin to establish conversations with her in a safe affirming way .
Also , she began helping me understand how everyone has parts of themselves , but the adult part is the one that should be running the show .
Session 5 was when we started some actual EMDR .
It ’s some heavy heavy shit .
We started with a thing that happened when I was 3 or 4 : me witnessing my dad hitting my brother because my dad was mad at himself because he accidentally dislocated my arm .
He did n’t know how to handle it , because that ’s my dad , and when I got home from the hospital , he picked a fight with my brother and hit him .
I have felt guilty about my role in that my whole life .
I worked it out with her in EMDR .
While we were working on it , I was crying and I felt so terrible .
And then I came to resolution and it has n’t bothered me since !!!
Is n’t that amazing ???
The next thing though was my new memory of my dad sexually abusing me when I was 5 .
This is way harder than the thing above , because it is so multi-faceted .
Unlike the incident where he hit my brother , that only had one facet for me ( my own guilty about it ) .
But sexual abuse is never one facet ; it ’s a multi- faceted web of betrayal that takes a while to uncover , figure out , and resolve .
We have now spent 4 sessions on it so far , and while I have gained some clarity as to the memory , I have not come to resolution about it yet .
It ’s a difficult treatment .
Remember that episode of the Office , where Michael Scott fucks everything up by trying to resolve employee complaints out in the open ?
He compares it to shiatsu massage , and he – wait – let me just link to it here
So anyway , it ’s like that .
It ’s really painful and it ’s really hard but at the end , hopefully , I will feel much better and stop being plagued by my own PTSD .
That ’s my hope , anyway .
36 years is a long time to be afraid .
Meanwhile I keep eating and eating .
I am a hot fucking mess .
Sleep is difficult .
Having to do this therapy sucks serious shit .
Not as bad as having to be sexually abused when I was a child , I suppose , but still sucks .
This is of course why you should n’t fuck kids .
I do n’t want to spend my time like this , going to therapy , crying , eating , etc .
I want to enjoy my sweet beautiful son , and learn to love and trust a man again , and enjoy my life , and go for walks , etc .
But right now , my life is this , and I accept that .
And I live it with hope for a better life to come .
The therapist has tried to impart two things to me , which I wanted to share with you guys , my loyal readers .
1 ) She said that when all that stuff was happening to me when I was a kid , I was alone and I was powerless .
I am neither of those things now .
While I am healing , I am not alone , and I am not powerless .
2 ) She said that I was a child when all this happened to me .
I am an adult now .
I have a whole range of choices open to me that I did n’t then .
All of that was news to me , and was so empowering that I thought maybe you wanted to hear it too .

Reason # 326 : EMDR
Therapy ?
Filed under : October 8 , 2014 , 2:52 pmFiled under : Uncategorized I had dinner with an old professor of mine .
She is someone I admire , mainly because when I was in her class she disclosed her own history of trauma .
After I graduated , we kind of became friends sort of – maybe more like acquaintances .
But anyway , we randomly meet for dinner once every few years .
I decided to take a chance and disclose what my life has looked like for real .
She already knew about my husband becoming my ex-wife , because she is on my holiday card list .
We send out a newsletter every year that discusses our situation , because we figure people are curious about our shit now .
During our dinner , I told her how I never would have predicted how the ex and I have come to such a happy place , where we are raising our child together and are close like sisters .
It ’s actually kind of cool living with my best friend / sister / ex - wife without there being a sexual component to things .
It gives me a chance to repair myself and make myself whole before attempting romance with a man again .
Anyway , I took a chance and told her about what my life has been like with C - PTSD ( complex post - traumatic stress disorder ) .
I told her about the hotel incidents .
I told her how if I did n’t have this disorder , how cool it would be if I could just take a walk outside if I felt like it .
( That right there – that is why you should n’t fuck kids .
We should get to enjoy nature and take walks outside without fear of our next rape . )
I told her that I guess this is my life , and I should stop trying to fight it .
I am obviously going to live in panic and fear forever .
She said “ Butterfly , you do n’t have to live like this .
There are gold standard treatments now for PTSD .
There is prolonged exposure therapy and there is also Eye- Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ( EMDR ) .
Both of those therapies cause people with PTSD to be asymptomatic .
Are you receiving either of those treatments from your current therapist ? ” I said “ No , but it took me like three years to even trust my therapist .
Plus it would be disloyal to her for me to seek out another therapist .
It would be like I am telling her she is n’t doing it right , when I think she is really great . ”
She said “ If your therapist is any good , she wants you to heal as much as you do .
Keep her for your life stuff , and see a trauma therapist for your trauma stuff . ”
I said “ You think I should see two therapists ? ? ”
She said “ Yes .
You still think you are going to get victimized again at any moment , and that ’s not the truth .
You need someone to do EMDR or exposure therapy with you for you to get through and past your PTSD symptoms .
Talk to your therapist , she will understand . ”
She gave me the number of a local person who does EMDR work .
The idea of sharing my shit with yet another new therapist is daunting , but I also hate living like this .
If my professor is at all right , I deserve the chance to give the new therapy a shot .
The idea of telling my current therapist about this is also really scary , but I am going to do it .
If there is even a chance that EMDR would be successful for me , even if it only meant a reduction in symptoms as opposed to the disappearance of symptoms – even that would make it all worth it .
I will talk to my therapist at my next session and I hope it goes well .

Reason # 325 : The Man in the Closet in the Hotel Room
Filed under : panic , panic disorder , phobia , PTSD , survivor of child sexual abuse September 16 , 2014 , 3:19 pmFiled under : Uncategorized | Tags : fear I had to go away to a conference again , and this time I went with someone from my new job .
A new friend who seems very nice , but kind of plays her cards close to the chest .
I have told her a tiny bit about my childhood , opened up a little bit to share my world .
She has been safe to confide in so far .
I have n’t ever said anything about my PTSD though , because it ’s work and I do n’t want work people to know that I am so fucked up because then they will think I ca n’t do my job , and so far I have been able to do my job no matter what .
If anything , my job has always been the only place in my life where I have experienced success .
So anyway , we had to stay in a hotel for this conference .
Remember how I had to stay in a hotel for that conference a few years ago with the woman who used to cut herself , and I got scared of the imaginary man behind the curtains ?
So this time I remembered to check the fucking curtains .
We settled into the hotel room , we both got changed for bed , talked for a long time , and by midnight we laid down in our respective beds .
We turned the lights out except for the bathroom light .
You know , now that I think about it , my friend was the one who left the bathroom light on and the door opened .
I wonder if she does n’t like sleeping in the dark too ?
Or I wonder if it was her way of being kind to me ?
So I laid down in my bed and I went through a mental checklist .
I had already made sure that the door was locked in every possible way , and I checked behind the curtains .
We were on the first floor , which is inherently unsafe , but I could n’t control that .
I did n’t check under the beds .
I shifted in the bed so I could see under her bed .
It was way too low to fit a human being under there .
THE CLOSET .
I did n’t check the fucking closet .
I started panicking .
He could be in there right now , waiting for us to fall asleep so that he can rape us by surprise .
I tried to talk to myself in a soothing way .
There ’s no one in there , Butterfly .
There ’s no one in the closet .
I had such a strong vision of a man hovering over me in bed , breathing on me , me paralyzed with fear .
He ’s here .
He ’s waiting for me to relax and lose my attention on him and then he will pounce on me .
I can’t .
I ca n’t go to sleep like this , knowing he is in there .
I just can’t .
I leap out of bed and check the closet .
I am breathing heavy and scared , and I hurriedly open the closet door .
There ’s no one in there , thank G -d .
I walk back to my bed and I see that my friend is staring at me with a WTF expression on her face .
I am too tired to make something up .
I explain that I have to check the closet or I would n’t sleep all night .
Her face changes a little bit , but it ’s an unreadable expression , and I ca n’t tell what she thinks .
It almost seems to confirm something for her , but I ca n’t be sure .
I do n’t care .
I am just so grateful that I was able to check the closet and that no one was in there and that I can go to sleep already .
This kind of humiliating shit is why you should n’t fuck kids .

Reason 322 : Weighty issues
Filed under : father - daughter incest , Louise Hay , survivor of child sexual abuse , survivor of incest May 26 , 2014 , 9:28 pmFiled under : Uncategorized | Tags : affirmations
So my job ended recently .
I knew it was coming to an end , and I was grateful for it .
It was a planned thing , because it was kind of a contract position .
I have a bunch of new little contracts in the Fall .
It was time for that door to close so that new ones can open .
A party was thrown for me to celebrate a successful end to that job , and that boy that I like was there ( which makes sense , since he was one of my co-workers ) .
In all of his emails to me , he signs them with the word “ Best ” .
But in a card that he and my co-workers gave me at the party , he signed it “ All my love ” .
Is n’t that interesting ?
I do n’t know what to make of that .
And since the party , we ’ve had little to no contact .
Even if that is the end of us , it ’s still fun to think about him .
As my therapist says “ It ’s a safe crush . ” I woke up from another rape dream today .
I keep contemplating ( and failing miserably ) at losing weight .
The night before last I prayed to the Universe for clarity regarding my weight loss efforts .
I prayed for knowledge on the right way for me to lose this weight that I am carrying around .
I woke up the next morning with a very clear memory of an instance of sexual abuse from my father when I was 5 .
It was something I have been suspecting for a while , and now I am sure .
The whole thing saddened me , as I had always considered him my last perpetrator .
Now I have reason to think he was probably my first .
I am not sure what to do with that knowledge , but I find it interesting that it came after I prayed for clarity in my weight loss efforts .
Apparently I am not going to lose this physical weight that I am carrying until I lose the emotional weight of what has happened to me first .
And maybe that is okay .
Maybe I can deal with these memories without batting them away like flies that are bothering me .
Maybe I can work through the memories until they become something that happened to me , not something that is still happening to me .
I reminded myself the other day ” I am a 40 year old woman .
I am not a little girl anymore .
I am strong and powerful . ”
I believe the first two sentences ; I am having trouble with the last one .
Louise
Hay said that when we say positive affirmations , we are stating things the way we want them and then leaving it up to the Universe to work out the details .
I like that .
I will continue saying I am strong and powerful , and let ’s see what happens .
I heard a lovely quote the other day : “ The Universe is conspiring towards my highest good . ” I think that is true .
I have always said that the Universe takes care of us , in spite of ourselves .

Reason # 321 : My First Kiss
Filed under : father - daughter incest , first kiss , panic , survivor of child sexual abuse April 7 , 2014 , 3:34 pmFiled under : Uncategorized | Tags : brother - sister incest Last night I found myself thinking about my first kiss .
I was fifteen , almost 16 .
I had been kind of dating my friend for a while .
I think he felt that at a certain number of dates ( 3 ? 4 ? ) that we should be kissing .
So on our third or fourth date , we came back to my house , and he leaned in and kissed me .
My reaction to this kiss was – not good .
I pushed away from him , got up and ran into the bathroom and locked myself in there until he left my house .
He was a nice guy , not a rapist .
He thought I was into it , and he kept apologizing .
He was so upset .
I was so upset .
It was a hot mess .
It sure was embarrassing too .
At the time , I understood enough to know that my reaction to all of this was weird , but I was n’t exactly sure WHY I reacted this way .
I figured it probably had something to do with my dad or my brother .
At that time , I did n’t even know I had a third abuser ( the babysitter ) – I found out about her like four years later .
It ’s been 25 years since my first kiss .
I now understand why I reacted that way to such an intimate act .
This is what happens when you fuck kids .
A beautiful innocent act like our first kiss becomes a complete hot mess because it ’s not our first go - round with intimacy .
I had already experienced my brother ’s head between my legs when I was way younger , but I did n’t want that experience .
Even now , the memory of what he did to me – it ’s painful .
This is why you should n’t fuck kids .
What should be beautiful and pretty and sweet and innocent – like first boyfriends and first kisses and ‘ I like you ’ – becomes a whole other thing fraught with rape potential in our heads .
We ca n’t separate who you are with who has already used our bodies .
Even though we want you – the ones we have chosen – we can’t figure out if you are like the ones who have already hurt us .
The piss is – we want to figure it out .
We are just like all the other girls and boys ; we too want healthy beautiful romantic tangible love that we can feel with our hands and our hearts .
But we ca n’t get there because of what has already happened to us .
I went to sleep thinking about my first kiss last night .
This morning I woke up from a terrible rape dream .
That ’s why you should n’t fuck kids .

Reason # 320 :
The sexual abuse defines me
Filed under : incest , moving , safety , survivor of child sexual abuse March 11 , 2014 , 5:39 pmFiled under : Uncategorized | Tags : fear
My therapist once told my Mom , about me : “ The sexual abuse does n’t define her . ”
My therapist has been right about a great many things in my life so far , but she was way off on this one .
I think the whole problem with me is that the sexual abuse DOES define me .
It ’s why I keep a blog detailing the reasons you should n’t fuck kids .
It has defined every fucking thing about me so far , from my choice of jobs to my choice of husbands to the way I do n’t leave the house to every other fucking detail .
Right down to the dream I had the other night about being in a room with serial rapists .
It ’s almost as if it were wishful thinking .
If we say “ it does n’t define her ” , maybe it wo n’t define her .
But it did before she said it , and it still does afterwards too .
I think the goal of therapy is to get to the point where it DOESN ’T define me .
Where I am no longer the victim , but the victor .
Where I did n’t merely survive it , but thrived in spite of it .
I would like to get there , but I do n’t know how .
I am 40 fucking years old , and I need to sleep with the lights on because I am afraid of the dark .
Her saying that it does n’t define me is like me saying I do n’t like to curse .
It ’s nice to hear but in the end it ’s complete bullshit .
As my longtime readers know , my husband became a woman and my marriage ended .
We still live together .
We live like sisters and raise our son .
It is safe .
My job is coming to an end , and I have a choice about what kinds of jobs to take next .
The safe choice is to stay here and take the job that allows me to stay here .
The risky choice is to apply for jobs elsewhere and leave safety .
I wish I had the courage to leave safety , but I do n’t .
This .
This is why you should n’t fuck kids .

After a decade of waiting , the Apple tablet is finally here , and reactions across the Internet are mixed , to say the least .
Sure , there 's always a bit of widespread deflation after a launch with so much hype behind it ; nonetheless , the range of attitudes toward the iPad goes from " it 's a great tablet , but I 'll have to wait and see about the ' revolution ' part , " to " I 'm so disappointed that it 's just a giant iPod touch . "
Missing is the near - universal " Apple has changed the game " sentiment that followed the launch of the iPhone .
None of this is to say that the iPad wo n't fundamentally change the game .
It 's just that this launch is closer to that of the original iPod — the idea itself is n't exactly new , competing offerings seem arguably better in some respects , and Apple will have to set itself apart from the pack by delivering a superior user and e-commerce experience .
In other words , the iPad is n't going to waltz in and just change the world the way that its smaller predecessor , the iPhone , did .
It 'll have to fight its way to the top , like the iPod .
As was the case in the wider tech community , reactions to the device at Ars HQ were mixed .
During the launch event , tensions ran high , fights broke out over issues like Flash support and the e-book experience , chairs were thrown , and the server melted down from the incredible load of a legion of tech geeks dying to get a glimpse of the Next Big Thing .
Now that we 've had time to get the site back together and collect our thoughts , we 've put together the following , quick reactions to the iPad .
All of the usual caveats apply — opinions are subject to change , your mileage may vary , and so on and so forth .
Now , on to our take on the Apple tablet .
Jon Stokes , Deputy Editor
I thought I would have a lot to say about the iPad , and perhaps I will in the coming weeks .
But as of this moment , the following feature matrix essentially sums up the whole of my thinking on the iPad .
Note that this is not a complete list of features and capabilities for current phones or tablets .
Rather , it 's just a list of stuff that I personally care about in a mobile device , and it reflects my expectation of what 's coming this year based on my time at this past CES .
Your mileage may vary .
i Pad Leading Smartphones
A bazillion other tablets in 2010 Buy & watch video X X X Buy & play music X X X Buy & play games X X X Buy & read e-books X X X App Store X X X Use non-Apple media stores ( e.g. , Netflix , Amazon MP3 ) X X Use office apps ( word processor , spreadsheet , slides ) X X X Surf Web X X X E-mail / IM X X X Multi-task X X Multi - touch X X X 3G X X X Wi -Fi X X X Integrated SD card slot X X Flash support X X Integrated webcam X 10 hrs battery life X X ?
0.5 inches thin , 1.5 lbs X X ?
$ 500 starting price X X ?
Given that matrix , it 's hard to see how the iPad is really the no-brainer upgrade over everything else in the world the way that the iPhone was when it was announced .
Yes , I 'd rather own an iPad than , say , either the HP slate or the 10 - inch Tegra 2 - and Android - based tablet prototype that MSI showed at CES .
But , at least in the case of the MSI tablet , I 'd have to do a little more homework first before making a final decision .
It 's certainly true that with many of the items above , Apple 's implementation will be superior to the competition , and in some cases dramatically so .
But there are also places where Apple 's iPad will be inferior , so the end result is that buyers will end up making a tradeoff based on the same kind of " what matters to me " feature grid that I 've given above .
I honestly was n't expecting to have to do that .
Take the custom 1GHz SoC that powers the device , for instance .
Given the PA Semi team 's reputation for miracles , this is probably a fantastic little part .
But even if it 's stupendously , amazingly awesome , you can't break the laws of physics , so it 's very hard to imagine that it has even a 20 percent performance / watt advantage over a comparable SoC from Qualcomm , TI , or Freescale .
( Before you get out the flame gun : 20 percent is about the performance advantage that Intel is able to get from non-process - related design innovations alone from one generation to the next .
So Intel , a very large , very old chipmaker , full of very smart people , puts the full weight of its collective design know - how into getting that 20 percent boost .
That 's why , if PA Semi's ARM implementation beats the competition 's ARM implementation by over 20 percent in performance per watt on the same process , I 'll eat your hat . )
Or , take battery life : 10 hours is amazing , but is it really that much more amazing than , say , the 8 hours that a Linux - based competitor might achieve ?
For my purposes as a power - user and professional gadget freak , you could take either Google 's Android or Palm 's webOS , put them on a similarly - sized tablet that 's designed by , say , HTC , and you 'd have a credible iPad competitor that is inferior in a many areas but possibly superior in a few critical respects .
For instance , I can easily imagine an Android - based tablet that 's designed by HTC , powered by NVIDIA 's Tegra 2 , does 1080 p video ( vs. iPad 's 720 p maximum resolution ) , and has much better 3D gaming performance , but at the cost of two hours of battery life .
And if someone made such a thing , I would rather buy it than an iPad .
I 'd even pay over $ 500 for it .
Given the number of Android and ARM - based devices I saw at this past CES , and the amount of design talent that 's going into many of them , I expect to see at least one non-embarrassing Android - based competitor to the iPad by at least the second half of the year , if not earlier .
In the end , Apple has done something with the iPad that I did n't think they were capable of : made it worth my while to look around , or possibly even wait , for a better , more open alternative .
I 'm ready to buy an ARM - based , thin - client tablet computer — I 'm just not ready to buy this one .
All of the above being said , I 'll buy an iPad anyway because it's my job to be up on this kind of thing .
It 'll probably also be the first time that I " jailbreak " a device .
That 's because Apple 's closed ecosystem is feeling less and less like an exclusive resort and more like Big Love 's Juniper Creek compound .
If the company does n't figure out this whole Internet thing , soon , they 're ultimately destined to go the way of the once - mighty AOL .
And if you 're itching to retort that Apple really does " get " the cloud , as is clearly evidenced by the amazing MobileMe service , then congratulations — you 're now ready to buy yourself some prairie garb and take that second wife you 've been eyeing .
“… , Palm with 6.1 percent share ( down to - 2.2 percentage points ) , and Google with 5.2 percent share ( up 2.7 percentage points ) .

2009 : Second Warmest Year on Record ; End of Warmest Decade
2009 was tied for the second warmest year in the modern record , a new NASA analysis of global surface temperature shows .
The analysis , conducted by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York City , also shows that in the Southern Hemisphere , 2009 was the warmest year since modern records began in 1880 .
Although 2008 was the coolest year of the decade , due to strong cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean , 2009 saw a return to near - record global temperatures .
The past year was only a fraction of a degree cooler than 2005 , the warmest year on record , and tied with a cluster of other years — 1998 , 2002 , 2003 , 2006 and 2007 — as the second warmest year since recordkeeping began .
" There 's always an interest in the annual temperature numbers and on a given year 's ranking , but usually that misses the point , " said James Hansen , the director of GISS .
" There 's substantial year - to - year variability of global temperature caused by the tropical El Niño - La Niña cycle .
But when we average temperature over five or ten years to minimize that variability , we find that global warming is continuing unabated . "
January 2000 to December 2009 was the warmest decade on record .
Throughout the last three decades , the GISS surface temperature record shows an upward trend of about 0.2 °C ( 0.36 °F ) per decade .
Since 1880 , the year that modern scientific instrumentation became available to monitor temperatures precisely , a clear warming trend is present , though there was a leveling off between the 1940s and 1970s .
The near - record temperatures of 2009 occurred despite an unseasonably cool December in much of North America .
High air pressures in the Arctic decreased the east - west flow of the jet stream , while also increasing its tendency to blow from north to south and draw cold air southward from the Arctic .
This resulted in an unusual effect that caused frigid air from the Arctic to rush into North America and warmer mid-latitude air to shift toward the north .
" Of course , the contiguous 48 states cover only 1.5 percent of the world area , so the U.S. temperature does not affect the global temperature much , ' said Hansen .
In total , average global temperatures have increased by about 0.8 °C ( 1.5 °F ) since 1880 .
" That 's the important number to keep in mind , " said Gavin Schmidt , another GISS climatologist .
" In contrast , the difference between , say , the second and sixth warmest years is trivial since the known uncertainty — or noise — in the temperature measurement is larger than some of the differences between the warmest years . "
Decoding the Temperature Record
Climate scientists agree that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap incoming heat near the surface of the Earth and are the key factors causing the rise in temperatures since 1880 , but these gases are not the only factors that can impact global temperatures .
Three others key factors — including changes in the Sun 's irradiance , oscillations of sea surface temperature in the tropics , and changes in aerosol levels — can also cause slight increases or decreases in the planet 's temperature .
Overall , the evidence suggests that these effects are not enough to account for the global warming observed since 1880 .
El Niño and La Niña are prime examples of how the oceans can affect global temperatures .
They describe abnormally warm or cool sea surface temperatures in the South Pacific that are caused by changing ocean currents .
Global temperatures tend to decrease in the wake of La Niña , which occurs when upwelling cold water off the coast of Peru spreads westward in the equatorial Pacific Ocean .
La Niña moderates the impact of greenhouse - gas driven warming , lingered during the early months of 2009 and gave way to the beginning of an El Niño phase in October that 's expected to continue in 2010 .
An especially powerful El Niño cycle in 1998 is thought to have contributed to the unusually high temperatures that year , and Hansen 's group estimates that there 's a good chance 2010 will be the warmest year on record if the current El Niño persists .
At most , scientists estimate that El Niño and La Niña can cause global temperatures to deviate by about 0.2 °C ( 0.36 °F ) .
Warmer surface temperatures also tend to occur during particularly active parts of the solar cycle , known as solar maximums , while slightly cooler temperatures occur during lulls in activity , called minimums .
A deep solar minimum has made sunspots a rarity in the last few years .
Such lulls in solar activity , which can cause the total amount of energy given off by the Sun to decrease by about a tenth of a percent , typically spur surface temperature to dip slightly .
Overall , solar minimums and maximums are thought to produce no more than 0.1 °C ( 0.18 °F ) of cooling or warming .
" In 2009 , it was clear that even the deepest solar minimum in the period of satellite data has n't stopped global warming from continuing , " said Hansen .
Small particles in the atmosphere called aerosols can also affect the climate .
Volcanoes are powerful sources of sulfate aerosols that counteract global warming by reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space .
In the past , large eruptions at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines and El Chichón in Mexico have caused global dips in surface temperature of as much as 0.3 °C ( 0.54 °F ) .
But volcanic eruptions in 2009 have not had a significant impact .
Meanwhile , other types of aerosols , often produced by burning fossil fuels , can change surface temperatures by either reflecting or absorbing incoming sunlight .
Hansen 's group estimates that aerosols probably counteract about half of the warming produced by man-made greenhouse gases , but he cautions that better measurements of these elusive particles are needed .
Data Details
To conduct its analysis , GISS uses publicly available data from three sources : weather data from more than a thousand meteorological stations around the world ; satellite observations of sea surface temperature ; and Antarctic research station measurements .
These three data sets are loaded into a computer program , which is available for public download from the GISS website .
The program calculates trends in temperature anomalies — not absolute temperatures — but changes relative to the average temperature for the same month during the period of 1951 - 1980 .
Other research groups also track global temperature trends but use different analysis techniques .
The Met Office Hadley Centre , based in the United Kingdom , uses similar input measurements as GISS , for example , but it omits large areas of the Arctic and Antarctic , where monitoring stations are sparse .
In contrast , the GISS analysis extrapolates data in those regions using information from the nearest available monitoring stations , and thus has more complete coverage of the polar areas .
If GISS did n't extrapolate in this manner , the software that performs the analysis would assume that areas without monitoring stations warm at the same rate as the global mean , an assumption that does n't line up with changes that satellites have observed in Arctic sea ice , Schmidt explained .
Although the two methods produce slightly different results in the annual rankings , the decade - long trends in the two records are essentially identical .
" There 's a contradiction between the results shown here and popular perceptions about climate trends , " Hansen said .
" In the last decade , global warming has not stopped . "

AUSTIN , Texas – Jobs were clearly the biggest issue at the Texas AFL - CIO Committee on Political Education ( COPE ) meeting here , Feb . 6 - 7 . Labor leaders from across the vast state gathered to discuss the issues and candidates leading up to the state ’s March 2 primary and the November general elections .
They also took some time for vital educational workshops :
* Jobs , Jobs , Jobs
* Labor at Center Stage — The 2010 Elections in Texas
* Religion and Labor – Labor Economics in the Pulpit
* The Role of Labor Representatives on Workforce Boards .
The jobs crisis brought the most attention and the most applause when speakers talked about government action to end sky - high unemployment .
Mike Cavanaugh , an AFL - CIO staffer from Washington , outlined the problem clearly : “ Unemployment is going to be sky high for the foreseeable future . ”
He brought a big - screen presentation of the AFL - CIO ’s five - point plan of government intervention to deal with the problem .
It begins with extension of unemployment benefits , then calls for the same kind of financial commitment that Congress has already devoted to bankers and big corporations .
Cavanaugh brought the message that such a plan will not happen without a gigantic labor - led fight that involves all segments of the population .
He said the AFL - CIO Executive Committee would be laying out specific plans at their next meeting toward the end of February .
In his speech and in his workshop , the AFL - CIO rep asked for input from all Texas unionists .
Among the seven resolutions passed at the end of the conference , two were specifically about jobs .
Resolution number one ended , “ Be it resolved , that the Texas AFL - CIO calls for a national policy to remedy under - employment of youth .
Youth employment is a key predictor of future success for the individual and the community , and directly correlates with youth violence and school dropout rates . ”
Resolution number six called strongly for government action : “ Now therefore be it resolved , that the delegates to the Texas AFL - CIO COPE Convention call on Congress to support the AFL - CIO program to return Americans to work ; and be it further resolved , that the delegates endorse quick action on job creation – which is not to be confused with blind subsidies to employers who do not follow through on job creation promises .
America needs good jobs now . ”

Alcohol consumption in the U.S. has been steadily rising since the end of Prohibition in 1933 , peaking in the early 1990s .
Not surprisingly , more Americans over the years have been treated for alcoholism .
But where is the line between heavy drinking and clinical alcoholism ?
A study in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) journal Preventing Chronic Disease says it is n't where you think it is .
The researchers found a distinction between drinking too much and being alcohol dependent .
They say 9 in 10 Americans who drink too much should n't be classified as alcoholics .
“ This study shows that , contrary to popular opinion , most people who drink too much are not alcohol dependent or alcoholics , ” said Dr. Robert Brewer , Alcohol Program Lead at CDC and one of the report ’s authors .
“ It also emphasizes the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to reducing excessive drinking that includes evidence - based community strategies , screening and counseling in healthcare settings , and high - quality substance abuse treatment for those who need it . ”
But heavy drinking is a problem
But just because someone is n't classified as “ alcoholic ” does n't mean they are n't doing real damage physically and socially .
In recent years binge drinking has been a growing concern , especially among young adults .
Binge drinking is defined as 4 or more drinks on an occasion for women , 5 or more drinks on an occasion for men .
Consuming 8 or more drinks a week for women or 15 or more drinks a week for men also falls within the binge drinking definition .
And it turns out millions fall into that category .
The study found that nearly 1 in 3 adults is an excessive drinker , and most of them binge drink , usually on multiple occasions .
That , in itself , is a big problem .
Death toll
The researchers say excessive drinking is responsible for 88,000 deaths in the U.S. each year and only 3,700 of those deaths are linked to alcohol dependence .
Putting a dollar figure on all this imbibing , the tab came to $ 223.5 billion in 2006 .
The alcohol - related deaths tracked by the study were due to health effects from drinking too much over time , such as breast cancer , liver disease , and heart disease .
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) reports that 48 % of all cirrhosis deaths in 2009 were alcohol related .
There were also serious health effects from drinking too much in a short period of time , such as violence , alcohol poisoning , and car accidents .
What to do
This may be timely information , coming at the beginning of the holiday season when alcohol flows with abandon .
To get through the next few weeks without over indulging , specialists at the University of California Davis Health Center offer these tips :
Think about how much alcohol you will consume before arriving at a party , then stick to your budget
Do n't pressure anyone to have another drink
If you 're the host , offer a wide selection of non-alcohol beverages
If someone is intoxicated , do n't serve them another drink and , by all means , do n't let them drive home
Are there ways to reduce the growing tendency to drink to excess ?
The Community Preventive Services Task Force has recommended increasing alcohol taxes , regulating alcohol outlet density , and holding alcohol retailers liable for harms resulting from illegal sales to minors or intoxicated patrons .
Just for fun , I thought I ’d have a go at implementing a little Object Relational Mapper in PHP .
It has n’t got many features , but it ’s not a bad start and only ~200 lines of code .
Check out the full source here to see how it actually works .
As always , feedback is welcome . :-)

First of all , thank you for not stealing my stuff while I was asleep .
I woke up this morning and you were gone , but you left your North Face vest .
Email me with your name and we 'll figure out a way to get it back to you .
I'm also curious as to why both pockets are filled with beer bottle caps .
Are you going to glue them to a table top , or do you just hoard things ?
And I 'm still kind of mad at you for preventing us both from going home with that girl we were making out with .
I mean , that shit was in the bag til your drunk ass ruined it .
sigh .
Anyway , I 'm giving your vest away to the shortest girl I know if you do n't find this and message me .
Good luck !
If you liked my association technique mentioned below , you would also enjoy my tips on using imagination to memorize vocabulary , which are discussed in great detail with many other hacks in my book .
See the most popular posts on the right below for other interesting topics .
For those curious , this post discusses
Thai , but the ideas can equally be applied to other phonetic scripts such as Japanese ( but not as well for Chinese ) .
Just one week into the challenge of reading / speaking Thai in 8 weeks ( actually only about 5 hours total , since I 've been quite busy since I arrived , but I 've made time to learn on the skytrain / in restaurants / taxis etc. ) and I 've reached the first major milestone already .
I can read Thai .
The major thing still missing is tones , which admittedly are an extremely important part of this language that cannot be ignored and I will get to shortly ( Edit : Done !
Thai tone rules are n't that bad either ) , but in terms of phonetics I no longer need to rely on romanisation ( using the Latin alphabet to see how a Thai word is pronounced ) .
Based on recommendations from other learners , abandoning romanisation was a huge priority for me ; I did n't want to use that system as a crutch preventing me from having a more natural way of learning Thai from within the language .
Romanisation is a purely academic concept for Thai .
Interesting for studying the language , but not so great when you actually want to read it .
I do n't study languages , I learn them and speak them .
I needed to abandon romanisation quickly .
It was actually way easier than I expected .
From squiggly symbols to new letters
When first looking at Thai it reminded me of the language Frodo read on the One Ring that he threw into Mount Doom , well , it was actually Gollum , but you know what I mean :
เดอะลอร์ดออฟเดอะริงส์
เป็นนิยายแฟนตาซีขนาดยาว
ประพันธ์โดยศาสตราจารย์ชาวอังกฤษ เจ. อาร์. อาร์. โทลคีน เป็นนิยายที่ต่อเนื่องกับนิยายชุดก่อนหน้านี้ของโทลคีน คื อ
It 's a mess of incomprehensible symbols that would take possibly years to get your head around , right ?
This is exactly the attitude that seems to hold everyone back .
I can tell by talking to those who have given up on learning languages that they just see each aspect of a “ hard ” language as this insurmountable monster .
The reason for my success in languages has little to do with natural talent and a lot to do with attitude , especially in the early stages .
When you look at the letters as ‘ squiggly symbols ' it 's very hard to imagine them worming their way into your head .
How could you possibly even remember what each symbol means ?
Is months or years of practice the only way ?
I threw out this unhelpful concept immediately .
The technique used – image association
With a bit of imagination ( in the same style used for learning vocabulary ) you can very quickly associate each symbol with its corresponding sound .
There are 44 consonants , 15 vowels ( which combine into about 28 forms ) plus 4 tone marks , so let 's say there 's a total of about 75 “ symbols ” to learn .
If you use a good memory technique and devote an entire minute or two to each symbol , that 's just about two hours to learn the entire set .
Add in extra time for practising and testing yourself and it really is n't that much time , especially since there are patterns in some symbols you start to see that reduces the work for others .
If you are n't used to image association , then the first few will take more time but you 'll get the hang of it ( you were certainly imaginative as a child , it will come back to you ! ) and the rest will come much quicker .
In my research since arrival ( and thanks to commenters on this blog ) I 've come across Stu Jay Raj ; another polyglot who has had many many more achievements with languages than I have .
What most interested me is two short videos he made about remembering Thai vowels .
After watching them , I applied his suggestion and think immediately of “ ah ” when I see :
า
His amusing suggestion is to imagine the path taken by your pee as you relieve yourself against a tree , and the sigh you 'd make as you do it – more relevant for men of course !
His other suggestions were also very useful , and I 've applied the same concept to consonants myself .
For example when I saw
ท
and needed to associate it with ‘ t ' , I thought of a number of common words starting with t.
None of the first few looked anything like it , but then I got to toe !
The symbol looks pretty much like your big toe , with the circle representing the nail of the second toe ( if looking at your left foot ) .
It 's very easy to remember and very hard to forget !
Now I think of t instantly when I see that symbol .
It took time , but I 've come up with such an association for all symbols .
Some are funny , or nerdy , or related to sex , or something childish .
Some require a ridiculous stretch of the imagination to make it work .
Whatever did the job best to help me remember .
Practice makes perfect
Learning with image association is way more fun than pure repetition , but it still slows you down as you try to recall the association .
With very little practice it comes quicker and quicker and soon you can skip the association altogether as the sound comes naturally and quickly .
About half of the symbols are like this for me already ( such as the two mentioned above ) , and I no longer need to remember the association .
In my mind า is ah and ท is t.
Plain and simple .
Here in Bangkok , many signs are “ bilingual ” Thai + romanisation .
This can be extremely useful to learners of the language , and not just tourists who do n't speak Thai .
When it is a translated word like hospital you can use this to learn vocabulary , but this is not currently what I 'm focused on .
Instead , I look at untranslated words ( names of places etc. ) and see if I can pronounce it based on the Thai .
I do this with advertisements , road signs , notices inside a taxi etc. and all of this practice is giving me an idea of how to read the language .
The romanisation used by the Thai government does not help at all with tones , but it does help with confirming and checking pronunciation ; the focus for my first week .
Challenges
One thing I never even thought about , which confuses matters somewhat , is fonts .
You never even think of this when learning other languages that use the Latin alphabet , since fonts work the same for them as in English .
But there are completely different ways of writing a letter in formal announcements , casual advertisements / magazines , LED displays , handwriting , and within each one there are subsets of fonts or styles ( e.g. a versus a are quite different if you really look at them ) .
This means that the symbol is not exactly as I remember it .
I kept seeing an “ S ” for example when reading shop signs and could n't find it anywhere in my notes until I put two and two together and realized that it 's just the way that
ร
is rendered in that font .
Another issue is separating words ; finding out where one word ends and another begins is a challenge since there are no spaces , but it is still doable , as the order of vowels before or after consonants is consistent , so you know which one it is associated with .
Thai is extremely phonetic ( with a few exceptions ) , so reading it left to right as you see the symbols really is n't that bad .
The road ahead
I have started learning some basic vocabulary entirely through the Thai writing system with no romanisation .
i.e. to speak is พูด for me and it's clear how this is pronounced without referring to romanisation .
This will be important in how I continue to learn the language .
There are some surprises still incorporated in the writing so I definitely can't read perfectly yet , but I 'll continue to practise as I go on with other aspects of the language .
Something I 've said a few times this week to people is that I do not aim for perfection .
Reading “ pretty well ” is quite alright for me , even if there are several holes in it .
The rest will come as I progress with the rest of the language .
I do n't want to dwell on reading too much ; for the moment “ good enough ” is good enough !
This method could work just as well with any language that uses a phonetic writing system .
( I 'll deal with languages like Chinese some other time )
Right now , I still am not speaking much Thai beyond basic courtesies ; I feel that trying to do several things at once will slow me down a bit and result in me spreading myself too thin , so I am focusing on the building blocks that will take me to my objective .
I can now start to learn some key vocabulary , specifically to words I am likely to use in day to day encounters .
I 'm using the triage system as always , to prioritise what I learn , so if it 's something I can point to or mime then I do n't need to learn the word yet .
I 'm expecting to have an explosion of vocabulary and conversation when the time is right .
Until then , I need to continue building the foundations to make sure that that can happen .
For the purposes of this mission , I will try to have mini - goals that last for 1 - 2 weeks and the next couple of weeks will be focused on tones and learning vocabulary through the writing system ( both to practise it and to increase my communication ability ) .
The tone part can be subdivided into being able to decipher from the text which tone is involved , saying the 5 tones correctly , and of course distinguishing them when others speak .
In a follow up post , I mention a little of what I generally think of Bangkok ; my first window into Thai culture , before I traveled to Phuket .
There 's something that I feel holds many learners back from ever making progress ; focusing on what they do n't know .
I feel like this attitude may be the biggest block for learners to even get a good start on a language ( and the greatest fuel for sceptics of my method ) so I want to discuss it in another fun post : Is Your Language Half Full ?.
So , for example , anyone who meets me who speaks
Thai to me or tests my spoken
Thai will be greatly disappointed .
I do n't care .
I have a plan and I 'm sticking to it .
I know from experience that speaking does n't happen magically overnight , so not being able to have a casual chat in Thai for the next few weeks is not going to discourage me , since I 'll be working on making a structure out of my Thai and have a clear idea what I 'm aiming for .
When you have a well formulated plan , you should stick to it and not give in to pressure to change from that course . 😉
Did you learn
Thai's ( or another Asian language 's ) script this way or was it completely different for you ?
What do you think my mission to speak and read Thai in 8 weeks ?
Do share it with us in the comments and do n't forget to share this post with your friends !!

And finally ...
One of the best ways to learn a new language is with podcasts .

With Ray Emery 's status still unknown - he has n't been skating - and Paul Holmgren publicly showing confidence in Michael Leighton and Brian Boucher , I thought it interesting to look at how these two stack up compared to the rest of the Eastern Conference 's netminders .
As mentioned in the comments in a previous thread , there are n't too many advanced stats for goalies .
There 's very little information out there on shot location and difficulty , but save percentage is n't a bad place to start .
The preferred method of comparison , however , is a goalie 's even - strength save percentage .
Using only even - strength save percentage eliminates each team 's largely varied penalty killing abilities and discipline issues .
Further , it eliminates any breakdowns created while a team is on the man-advantage .
It is n't perfect , but even - strength save percentage is a better indicator of a goalie 's individual performance .
With that , jump to see how Leighton stacks up .
Some may notice ( and complain ) that I only looked at half of the league , but this was mainly for playoff implications .
Because it appears that Leighton will carry the load for the Flyers the rest of the season - and possibly into the playoffs - the comparison should show whether goaltender is the weakest link of this team .
If you want to check league - wide comparisons , all these stats were acquired from NHL.com .
Michael Leighton # 49 / Goalie / Philadelphia Flyers Height : 6 - 3 Weight : 186 Born : May 19 , 1981
GP MIN W L EGA GA GAA SA SV SV % SO 2009 - Michael Leighton 25 1365 13 7 62 2.73 655 593 .905 1
First , these stats include Leighton 's games with Carolina and Philadelphia .
Below are just those with Philadelphia .

2.19 491

.925 1
Clearly , his stats with Philadelphia are much better .
But what are they in comparison with the rest of the East ?
The minimum sample is 15 games started .
Yes it 's small - very small - but it's the minimum required to fit Leighton in .
Maybe that means these numbers do n't tell a whole lot - maybe that 's true - but it's what we have .
In full disclosure , Leighton 's combined even - strength save percentage is .906 .
This is largely because he had a .848 number in Carolina .
There are a few surprising things in this chart .
The Ottawa Senators are surviving with some pretty poor goaltending .
Currently leading the Northeast division , they have two of the four worst even - strength goalies .
Marc -Andre
Fleury is not having a good year .
At all .
Last year , he was at .922 .
This year , he 's sixth - worst in the East .
Tim Thomas is being severely out - played by Tuukka Rask and for those looking for a worse contract than Danny Briere , look at him .
Thomas is 35 years old and signed to a 4 year , $ 20 million contract .
Now Boston has a $ 5 million backup .
Despite outplaying Carey Price , Jaroslav Halak only recently began earning more playing time .
Entering the Olympic break , Halak has started 9 of the Canadiens ' past 12 games .
With both becoming Restricted Free Agents this offseason , it will definitely be interesting what they command on the market .
A great example of why these numbers are better indicators of performance is the Islanders ' crease .
Martin Biron ranks third in both save percentage and goals against average on the team , yet he leads in both even - strength save percentage and even - strength goals against per 60 .
Everyone knows how good Ryan Miller and Henrik Lundqvist are ( if you could have any goalie in the league , it would likely be Miller , Lundqvist , or Luongo ) but Tomas Vokoun is vastly underrated .
He 's currently leading the league in save percentage and 11th in goals against average , but if Florida never took a penalty , they would only need to score 2 goals a game to win .
That 's ridiculous .
Conclusion
Looking at Michael Leighton 's career numbers , or his combined Carolina and Philadelphia numbers , the Flyers would be in trouble .
But what he has done since coming over to Philadelphia is fantastic .
He is 9th in the Eastern conference with his even - strength save percentage , and 6th counting only playoff teams .
He 's behind Ray Emery , but he 's ahead of Martin Brodeur , Cam Ward , and Marc - Andre Fleury .
Two of those are on Team Canada .
If Leighton keeps playing like he has been , the Flyers do n't need to worry about their goaltending this season .
The problem is , can Leighton keep this up ?
Nothing has shown that he can , but the only two times he 's played 10 games or more , he 's put up even - strength save percentages of .909 ( 2003 - 04 , Chicago ) and .915 ( 2008 - 09 , Carolina ) .
He plays better the more he plays , so maybe it is n't a surprise that he 's having a career year .
As long as he continues this play , the Flyers are fine .
Hopefully he continues this play .
A person wearing scuba gear apparently tried to sneak two bundles of marijuana across the Mexican border through a sewer system on Friday , Border Patrol officials said .
Border Patrol agents operating infrared cameras noticed several individuals illegally crossing into the United States near a sewer outlet .
The Douglas Station 's bike patrol went to the sewer system and saw one person carrying two bundles that were suspected to be marijuana .
That person was wearing a wet suit and scuba gear and was wading through waist - high water with the bundles , officials said .
The person saw the agents , dropped the bundles and began wading back toward Mexico .
Apparently the other people spotted by the Border Patrol also fled , officials said .
The marijuana weighed 55 pounds and was estimated to be worth $ 44,000 .
The would - be smugglers were not found , according to Omar Candelaria , spokesperson for the Border Patrol .
Spy chiefs turn on President Obama after seven CIA agents are slaughtered in Afghanistan
Barack Obama was accused of double standards yesterday in his treatment of the CIA .
The President paid tribute to secret agents after seven of them were killed by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan .
In a statement , he said the CIA had been ‘ tested as never before ’ and that agents had ‘ served on the front lines in directly confronting the dangers of the 21st century ’ .
He lauded the victims as ‘ part of a long line of patriots who have made great sacrifices for their fellow citizens and for our way of life ’ .
Yet the previous day he had blasted ‘ systemic failures ’ in the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies for failing to prevent the Christmas Day syringe bomb attack .
Backlash : Agency officials are angry at the president 's about face
‘ One day the President is pointing the finger and blaming the intelligence services , saying there is a systemic failure , ’ said one agency official .
‘ Now we are heroes .
The fact is that we are doing everything humanly possible to stay on top of the security situation .
The deaths of our operatives shows just how involved we are on the ground . ’
But CIA bosses claim they were unfairly blamed at a time the covert government agency has been stretched further than ever before in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
They point to the murder of seven operatives at a remote mountain base in Afghanistan ’s Khost Province as an example of how agents are putting their lives on the line at the vanguard of America ’s far - flung wars .
The agents – including the chief of the base , a mother - of - three - were collecting information about militants when the suicide bomber struck on Wednesday .
The attack was the deadliest single day for the agency since eight CIA officers were killed in the 1983 bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut .
Deadliest :
In April 1983 terrorists targeted the US Embassy in Beirut with the loss of eight CIA officers
The base targetted by Wednesday ’s suicide bomber was a control centre for a covert programme overseeing strikes by remote - controlled aircraft along Afghanistan ’s border with Pakistan .
‘ Those who fell were far from home and close to the enemy , doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism .
We owe them our deepest gratitude , ’ CIA Director Leon Panetta said .
Some CIA officials are angry at being criticised by the White House after Abdulmutallab , 23 , was allowed to slip through the security net and board a US - bound flight in Amsterdam despite evidence he was a terror threat .
The president complained that a warning from the former London engineering student ’s father and information about an al Qaeda bomb plot involving a Nigerian were not handled properly by the intelligence networks .
But CIA officials say the data was sent to the US National Counterterrorism Centre in Washington , which was set up after the 9/11 attacks as a clearing house where raw data should be analysed .
Agents claim that is where the dots should have been connected to help identify Abdulmutallab as a threat .

Why AIDS propagandists cannot tolerate scientific questions
Answering the critics
AIDS propagandists are like global warming scientists
AIDS myths
( Natural News ) Brent Leung 's myth - shattering AIDS documentary , continues to roil conventional AIDS propagandists who cannot tolerate anyone questioning their " scientific " theories .
( They 're not exactly " scientific " if they can't stand up to a little questioning , are they ? )
Adding to the searing - hot debate , Brent Leung has released exclusive interview footage to NaturalNews that calls into question conventional thinking about so - called " AIDS tests " ( which do n't accurately detect HIV infections in the first place ) .
You can watch this exclusive , unedited footage here :
Here 's part of the exchange that takes place in this footage , in which Dr. Constantine tells filmmaker Brent Leung that the AIDS test he took is meaningless : " I 'm gonna ask you one last question that pertains to my HIV test that I took in Africa , " Brent Leung says .
" And you want this on air ? " asks Dr. Constantine .
Brent answers , " Yes .
I tested negative .
It 's okay . " " Now what if I tell you that the test you took was lousy and does n't mean a thing , does that make any difference for everybody to hear ? " replies Dr. Constantine .
Also in this clip , Leung interviews Dr. Robin Weiss who reveals the diagnostic failure of the so - called " Western Blot " test , which remains the mainstay " AIDS test " to this day .
" I do n't think the Western Blot is a useful diagnostic test , " says Dr. Weiss .
" I do n't think it 's worth doing .
Western Blots have been ... promoted into some sort of Holy Grail .
" This exclusive , unedited footage was released to NaturalNews in response to accusations leveled against Brent Leung by both of these scientists who claimed their words were taken out of context .
So Leung released this footage which contains the greater context of the conversation , demonstrating these scientiststaken out of context when shorter cuts were used in the film .
The conventional AIDS propagandists are predictably lashing out violently against Brent Leung 's myth - shattering documentary .
One critic , Jeanne Bergman , went so far as to accuse Leung of propagating " lies " about HIV even while she pressured ScienceDaily.com to retroactively change the headline of a story the website published in 2007 .
That story originally reported on a study in primates that showed a sudden loss of T cells isa trigger for AIDS
The original headline read , " Sudden Loss Of T Cells Is Not Trigger For AIDS , New Study Suggests " .
But after being pressured by Bergman , ScienceDaily changed the headline ( nearly two years after the original publication date ) to : " Progression Of SIV Infection In Monkeys Points To Differences Between Human And Simian Forms Of AIDS .
" That 's a fairly radical title change .
It repositions the entire store and takes away credibility from anyone who had quoted the story as a piece of evidence dismantling conventional AIDS theories .
That was the whole point of pressuring ScienceDaily to change their story , of course .
ScienceDaily even engaged in some fairly unusual back - pedaling with an editor 's note that was added to the story : " The purpose of the story was NOT meant to suggest that the sudden loss of T cells is not the trigger of AIDS in humans , nor was there any intent to support the erroneous belief that HIV somehow does not cause AIDS .
We regret any confusion that this may have caused .
" Gee , would n't want to challenge conventional AIDS theories now , would we ?
In support of thedocumentary , has published a response to Jeanne Bergman , which you can read here : http://theperthgroup.com/HON/PGBergmanHONNov...
They 've also published aof the idea of .
Just keep in mind that when you read this , you 're not supposed to question anything told to you by conventional doctors and scientists .
They already know everything , and the mere act of questioning their theories is blasphemous .
So read this link at your own risk : http://theperthgroup.com/HON/PGHONFakeQuesti...
The Perth Group , by the way , was founded by biophysicist Eleni Papadopulos - Eleopulos , emergency physician Valendar F. Turner and Professor of Pathology John Papadimitriou .
The group has published scientific papers on AIDS and two of its members were invited contributors to the Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel .
According to The Perth Group , HIV / AIDS experts have NOT proven : 1 .
The existence of a unique , exogenously acquired retrovirus , HIV.2 .
That " HIV " antibody tests are specific for " HIV " infection .
( This is a blockbuster realization right here .
It means all the so - called " AIDS tests " are basically quackery . ) 3 .
The HIV theory of AIDS , that is , that HIV causes acquired immune deficiency ( destruction of T4 lymphocytes =AID ) or that AID leads to the development of the clinical syndrome AIDS .4 .
That the " HIV genome " ( RNA or DNA ) originates in a unique , exogenously acquired infectious retroviral particle .
5 . That HIV / AIDS is infectious , either by blood , blood products or sexual intercourse .
6 .
That mother - to - child transmission of a retrovirus HIV or its inhibition with AZT or nevirapine .
The group also believes that AZT ( Big Pharma 's key AIDS drug ) cannot kill " HIV " and is so toxic that , in fact , it may actually cause some cases of AIDS .
I 've finally put the pieces together on this .
It turns out that AIDS propagandists are just like some of the global warming scientists :
They 've already decided what 's true and they viciously attack anyoneabout the validity of their so - called science .
We saw this with the leaked emails of the global warming scientists :
They were clearly conspiring to manipulate the data .
And yet that entire approach is n't scientific at all .
It 's dogmatic .
Many conventional AIDS scientists are just as dogmatic .
It does n't even matter whether they 're right or wrong -- theirobliterates any credibility they might have previously had .
A credible scientist , you see , is happy to answer questions or even critics .
Credible scientific study .
It can withstand scientific challenges and weather the storm .
But .
And why not ?
Because if an intelligent , evidence - based inquiry into conventional AIDS propaganda were to ever be conducted , the whole fraudulent system would collapse like , well , a .
( Hence the name " House of Numbers " for the documentary . ) But that can't be allowed to take place .
Much like we see with vaccines and cancer , too much money is riding on conventional AIDS mythology , and it 's too late to change their story .
So the myths about AIDS continue :
That a simple blood test can tell you whether you have AIDS , that AIDS is caused by HIV , that HIV is transmitted through blood , that AIDS has no cure , and so on .
These are allbecause they exist in the realm of conventional AIDS dogma that is utterly unwilling to field any questions or stand up to any scientific challenges whatsoever .
The mere mention of any intent to question conventional AIDS mythology brands you as an " AIDS denier " -- a vicious , derogatory term thrown about like a linguistic hand grenade in an attempt to instantly halt any intelligent conversation about HIV and AIDS .
You either agree with the conventional AIDS propagandists , or you 're a nut , it seems .
There is no room for questioning anything .
There 's no tolerance for those who might think for themselves instead of just swallowing the conventional theories as if they were scientific fact .
But then again , we should n't expect anything more than that from conventional medicine , should we ?
This is an industry steeped in scientific fraud and routine quackery .
It is a field of pseudo science that has become extremely proficient at rigging the data in order to fit whatever predetermined outcomes it wishes to support .
The AIDS industry is an outgrowth of this scientific quackery .
Fictions about AIDS have given rise to an entire for - profit industry that depends on the continuation of the mythology to keep its cash registers ringing .
That 's why the attacks against Brent Leung are so vicious :
He 's the guy who has dared to stand up and say , " The AIDS emperor wears no clothes !
" For daring to point that out , Leung is branded an " AIDS Denier . "
It 's the equivalent of calling him an " Emperor 's wardrobe denier " while pretending the emperor is wearing magnificent flowing robes sewn with golden thread .
It all just makes me wonder :
What 's the point of having aif the scientists are n't going to follow it ?
Watch the footage yourself here :
Check out this other exclusive footage fromand here :
Benjamin Patir called his son because he was lonely and , perhaps more important , because he had a quarter .
Robert J. Covelli called his son , too , to find out if , at some point during the more than 24 hours he spent in custody , he had become , for the first time , a grandfather .
Frank Federico , fresh from a courthouse jail cell , called his mother , who spared him any lectures and asked him if he needed a ride home .
The three men used the same curbside pay phone on a busy block of Queens Boulevard last week .
So did Carlos Luciano , who lent his cellphone to his wife .
And Alex Santana , who bought a banana to get change .
And Marvin McCain , a subway conductor trying to call in sick , and two men uninterested in giving their names or explaining why , at midnight on a neon - lit stretch of Kew Gardens , Queens , they had to make a call .
Everybody knows the public pay phone is dying , but nobody inclined to watch this one would believe it .
It sits across the street from Queens Criminal Court , on a patch of sidewalk facing Fast & Fresh Supermarket Deli & Grocery .
In the age of the iPhone and the BlackBerry , in a city where cellphones are cheaper and more plentiful than toasters , the pay phone outside Fast & Fresh is outdated , outnumbered , outperformed .
Yet this grimy phone — in a silvery booth that Superman would have skipped over , for it is doorless and not fully enclosed — survives and , in its own nickel - and - dime way , thrives .
In what critics are calling " musicblogocide 2010 " , Google has deleted at least six popular music blogs that it claims violated copyright law .
These sites , hosted by Google 's Blogger and Blogspot services , received notices only after their sites – and years of archives – were wiped from the internet .
" We 'd like to inform you that we 've received another complaint regarding your blog , " begins the cheerful letter received by each of the owners of Pop Tarts , Masala , I Rock Cleveland , To Die By Your Side , It 's a Rap and Living Ears .
All of these are music - blogs – sites that write about music and post MP3s of what they are discussing .
" Upon review of your account , we 've noted that your blog has repeatedly violated Blogger 's Terms of Service ... [ and ] we 've been forced to remove your blog .
Thank you for your understanding . "
Jolly as Google may be , none of the bloggers who received these notices are " understanding " in the least .
Although such sites once operated on the internet 's fringes , almost exclusively posting songs without permission , many blogs are now wined , dined and even paid ( via advertising ) by record labels .
After the success of blog - buzzy acts such as Arcade Fire , Lily Allen and Vampire Weekend , entire PR firms are dedicated to courting armchair DJs and amateur critics .
Despite the de facto alliance between labels and blogs , not all of the record companies ' legal teams have received the message .
In a complaint posted to Google Support , Bill Lipold , the owner of I Rock Cleveland , cited four cases in the past year when he had received copyright violation notices for songs he was legally entitled to post .
Tracks by Jay Reatard , Nadja , BLK JKS and Spindrift all attracted complaints under the USA 's Digital Millennium Copyright Act , even when the respective MP3s were official promo tracks .
As a publicist for BLK JKS ' label , Secretly Canadian , told Lipold : " Apparently DMCA operate on their own set of odd rules , as they even requested that the BLK JKS ' official blog remove the song . "
It 's not clear who " DMCA " is in this case , as the act does not defend itself .
" I assure you that everything I 've posted for , let 's say , the past two years , has either been provided by a promotional company , came directly from the record label , or came directly from the artist , " Lipold wrote to Google .
The company 's first official response came only late yesterday , as # Musicblogocide2k10 sped up Twitter 's trending charts .
" When we receive multiple DMCA complaints about the same blog , and have no indication that the offending content is being used in an authorised manner , we will remove the blog , " explained product manager Rick Klau . " [ If ] this is the result of miscommunication by staff at the record label , or confusion over which MP3s are ' official ' ... it is imperative that you file a DMCA counter - claim so we know you have the right to the music in question . "
The trouble with filing a formal , legal DMCA counter - claim is , that most bloggers do n't know how .
What 's more , many of Blogger 's DMCA notices allegedly omit the name of the offending song .
Bloggers are n't even sure what they are denying .
Take the case of Masala , co-founded by Guillaume Decouflet in mid-2005 .
Together with his partners , Decouflet has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to underground genres such as kuduro and funk carioca .
Masala 's writers were n't typical music bloggers , waxing lyrical about Neon Indian and the new Phoenix remix : mostly DJs , they shared South African electronica , Japanese dancehall , UK funky and Senegalese hip - hop .
" We have n't been posting any Whitney Houston or anything , " Decouflet explained .
He only recalls receiving one DMCA notice – ever – from Blogger .
As this email did not name the offending song , he says he does n't know what caused the complaint .
Masala 's bloggers responded to Google 's email , Decouflet insists , but never heard back .
That is , until their entire site – and more than four years of archives – were deleted this week .
" It 's just sad because we were documenting young people 's music from all around the globe , " Decouflet said .
" For a lot of people , it was music they would n't have been able to discover elsewhere . "
Decouflet is now trying to " salvage " the Masala archive , using Google 's own Reader tool to dig up old posts .
Other banished blogs have taken similar steps .
Living Ears ,
It 's a Rap and Pop Tarts have relaunched at new URLs , generally without any older material .
Not all music blogs are as innocent as I Love Cleveland and Masala .
Although the majority of bloggers share only single songs , showing particular affection for the obscure and out of print , some blogs are the most banal sort of pirates – offering links to download entire new releases .
However , these sites are ostracised by the blogging mainstream , left off aggregators such as the Hype Machine .
No one protests when Google quietly removes their Blogspot accounts and yet ironically , amid the " musicblogocide " , dozens of these still remain online .
The two largest Blogspot - hosted music blogs , Gorilla vs Bear and My Old Kentucky Home , show no sign of being affected , although they will still find these developments alarming .
" I do n't post anything that 's not approved , and obviously nothing on major labels , " said Gorilla vs Bear 's Chris Cantalini .
" But apparently that does n't matter in some of these cases . "
In a press release last year , Google seemed to recognise this distinction , announcing a new policy vis -a - vis music bloggers .
From now on , it wrote , DMCA notices would not result in the instant deletion of offending blogs .
Instead , individual posts would be temporarily removed , with a prominent notice to help bloggers respond to the allegations .
" Music bloggers are a large segment of our users – and we know that for those who 've received one or more DMCA complaints in the past , this may have been a frustrating experience , " Klau wrote in August .
Almost six months later , the experience does n't appear to have become any less frustrating .
Decouflet sounds weary .
" Google is treating bloggers like Big Brother , " he said .
" Shoot first , ask questions after . "
Labor Senator Kate Lundy has further refined her views on the Government 's controversial internet filtering plan and will seek to have amendments to the policy accepted by the Caucus when the legislation is unveiled in the next several weeks .
Senator Lundy has been a vocal about her misgivings about the mandatory ISP - level filtering plan , and says she will seek to have a " Mandatory Option " introduced - in which users must make an active choice about the level of filtering they want applied to their service .
Under Senator Lundy 's proposal , the Government 's proposed filter of ' Refused Classification ' material would be the default service where a subscriber does not make that actrive choice .
But ISPs would be required to offer an Open Internet service as one of the mandatory options , creating the ability for subscribers to opt out of the filters .
" I think mandating the provision of an Open Internet service in legislation for all ISPs also protects the civil libertarian principles of freedom of information and speech whilst not diminishing the ability of the authorities to tackle illegal content such as child pornography where is found , " she said .
Senator Lundy said some filter opponents had focussed their arguments on trying to limit the RC material that would be captured by a filter .
But an opt - out provision would address those concerns anyway , and would better safeguard the benefits of a free and open internet .
Senator Lundy will put her amendments to Caucus as soon as Communications Minister Stephen Conroy releases the draft legislation , which is expected in the next several weeks .
In the meantime , she plans to lobby her colleagues directly .
Getting the amendments adopted will be a challenge .
The mandatory ISP - level filtering policy is a Cabinet decision and an election policy .
And its an election year .
But the formation of the internet filter policy has been fraught from its beginnings , and there are many , many Senators on both sides of politics with serious misgivings about both its aims and its effectiveness .

Skylar Shafran , a turquoise headband on her brunette head and a pink princess shirt on her string - bean frame , is standing on a chair in her living room , shifting from left foot to right .
She has already gulped down a glass of orange juice and nibbled on some crackers ; she has also demonstrated , with extemporaneous grace , the ability to pick up Hello Kitty markers with her toes .
For more than an hour , she has been answering questions to a mock version of an intelligence test commonly known to New York parents as the ERB .
Almost every prestigious private elementary school in the city requires that prospective kindergartners take it .
Skylar ’s parents , Liz and Jay , are pretty sure they know where they ’re sending their daughter to school next year , but they figure it ca n’t hurt to get a sense of where she sits in the long spectrum of precocious New York children .
And so , although it was n’t cheap — $ 350 — they ’ve hired someone to find out .
Skylar has thus far borne this process with cheerful patience and determination .
But every 4 - year - old has her limits .
“ What is an umbrella ? ” asks the evaluator , a psychology graduate student in her mid-twenties .
“ To keep me dry . ”
“ And what is a book ? ”
“ Something you read . ”
“ What is a house ? ”
Skylar squirms , teeters a bit .
“ A house ? ” the tester repeats .
Skylar looks at her mother .
“ I have to go pee . ”
Later , when the evaluation is over , Liz confesses she ’s ambivalent about inviting a stranger into her home to assess her 4 - year - old and even more ambivalent about the idea of prepping her for a standardized test , should it turn out she needs preparation .
“ It ’s just that I want choices for her , ” she says .
“ It ’s an immigrant mentality .
You want what ’s best for your kid . ”
The beauty of a meritocracy is that it is not , at least in theory , a closed system .
With the right amount of pluck and hard work , a person should be able to become whoever he or she is supposed to be .
Only in an aristocracy is a child ’s fate determined before it is born .
Yet in New York , it turns out that an awful lot is still determined by a child ’s 5th birthday .
Nearly every selective elementary school in the city , whether it ’s public or private , requires standardized exams for kindergarten admission , some giving them so much weight they wo n’t even consider applicants who score below the top 3 percent .
If a child scores below this threshold , it hardly spells doom .
But if a child manages to vault over it , and in turn gets into one of these selective schools , it can set him or her on a successful glide path for life .
Consider , for instance , Hunter College Elementary School , perhaps the most competitive publicly funded school in the city .
( This year , there were 36 applicants for each slot . )
Four - year - olds wo n’t even be considered for admission unless their scores begin in the upper range of the 98th percentile of the Stanford - Binet Intelligence Scales , which costs $ 275 to take .
But if they ’re accepted and successfully complete third grade ( few do n’t ) , they ’ll be offered admission to Hunter College High School .
And since 2002 , at least 25 percent of Hunter ’s graduating classes have been admitted to Ivy League schools .
( In 2006 and 2007 , that number climbed as high as 40 . )
Or take , as another example , Trinity School .
In 2008 , 36 percent of its graduates went to Ivy League schools .
More than a third of those classes started there in kindergarten .
Thirty percent of Dalton ’s graduates went to Ivies between 2005 and 2009 , as did 39 percent of Collegiate ’s , and 34 percent of Horace Mann’s .
Many of these lucky graduates would n’t have been able to go to these Ivy League feeders to begin with , if they had n’t aced an exam just before kindergarten .
And of course these advantages reverberate into the world beyond .
Given the stakes , it ’s hardly a surprise that New Yorkers with means and aspirations for their children would go to great lengths to help them .
Rather , what ’s surprising is that a single test , taken at the age of 4 , can have so much power in deciding a child ’s fate in the first place .
The fact is , 4 is far too young an age to reach any conclusions about the prospects of a child ’s mind .
Even administrators who use these exams — indeed , especially the administrators who use these exams — say they ’re practically worthless as predictors of future intelligence .
“ At information meetings , ” says Steve Nelson , head of the famously progressive Calhoun School , “ I ’ll often ask a room full of parents when their children started to walk . ”
Invariably , their replies form a perfect bell curve : a few at 9 and 10 months , most at 12 or 13 , a few as late as 15 to 18 .
“ And then I ’ll ask : ‘ What would you think if you were walking down the street , and you saw a parent yanking a 1 - year - old child up from the sidewalk , screaming , ‘ Walk , damn it ? ’ ” The same , he says , is true of a system that insists a child perform well on a test at 4 years of age .
“ Early good testers do n’t make better students , ” he tells me , “ any more than early walkers make better runners . ”
Let ’s start with the most basic problem : School starts in kindergarten .
No matter how a child is doing at that moment , no matter where that child is in the great swoop of his or her developmental arc , that ’s when parents send their kids off to school .
Given this very concrete constraint , standardized tests seem as fair a means as any to find gifted 4 - year - olds — if not the fairest , considering the city ’s tremendous cultural and socioeconomic diversity .
That one test - taking experience may be the sole experience all kids share , and their scores the sole application datum that ’s neither prejudicial ( like a family ’s net worth ) or subjective ( like recommendations from nursery schools ) .
Unfortunately , not all city schools use the same tests , which means that first - time parents , already overwhelmed by the usual formalities of school enrollment , are forced to cut through a smog of acronyms .
New York City public schools use the Otis- Lennon School Ability Test , or OLSAT , to help determine which students are eligible for their gifted - and - talented programs .
The private schools use a modified version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence , or WPPSI - III , pronounced “ whipsy . ”
( Yet because the Educational Records Bureau administers it — for a cost of $ 495 — it is still better known to some parents as the ERB . )
Hunter , because it operates under the auspices of Hunter College rather than the Department of Education , uses the fifth edition of the Stanford - Binet Intelligence Scales , or SB - 5 , to narrow down its first round of applicants .
How these tests differ is mainly a question of emphasis and style :
The OLSAT looks much more like an actual school exam — it ’s administered by a licensed teacher , answered in multiple - choice bubbles in a workbook , and a bit more biased in content toward school readiness , like following verbal directions — while the WPPSI and SB - 5 are IQ tests , interpreted by psychologists and more biased toward abstract reasoning .
But the truth is , all three are pretty similar , at least at this level .
As W. Steven Barnett , co-director of Rutgers ’ National Institute for Early Education Research , notes : “ Odds are they ’re all going to have kids do something with triangles . ”
Those who are bullish on intelligence tests argue they ’re “ pure ” gauges of a child ’s mental agility — immune to shifts in circumstance , immutable over the course of a lifetime .
Yet everything we know about this subject suggests that there are considerable fluctuations in children ’s IQs .
In 1989 , the psychologist Lloyd Humphreys , a pioneer in the field of psychometrics , came out with an analysis based on a longitudinal twin study in Louisville , Kentucky , whose subjects were regularly IQ - tested between ages 4 and 15 .
By the end of those eleven years , the average change in their IQs was ten points .
That ’s a spread with significant educational consequences .
A 4 - year - old with an IQ of 85 would likely qualify for remedial education .
But that same child would no longer require it if , later on , his IQ shoots up to 95 .
A 4 - year - old with an IQ of 125 would fall below the 130 cutoff for the G&T programs in most cities .
Yet if , at some point after that , she scores a 135 , it will have been too late .
She ’ll already have missed the benefit of an enhanced curriculum .
These fluctuations are n’t as odd as they seem .
IQ tests are graded on a bell curve , with the average always being 100 .
( Definitions vary , but essentially , people with IQs of 110 to 120 are considered smart ; 120 to 130 , very smart ; 130 is the favorite cutoff for gifted programs ; and 140 starts to earn people the label of genius . )
If a child ’s IQ goes down , it does n’t mean he or she has stopped making intellectual progress .
It simply means that this child has made slower progress than some of his or her peers ; the child ’s relative standing has gone down .
As one might imagine , kids go through cognitive spurts , just as they go through growth spurts .
One of the classic investigations into the stability of childhood IQ , a 1973 study by the University of Pittsburgh ’s Robert McCall and UC–San Diego ’s Mark Appelbaum and colleagues , looked at 80 children who ’d taken IQ tests roughly once a year between the ages of 2 ½ and 18 .
It showed that children ’s intellectual trajectories were marked by slow increases or decreases , with inflection points around the ages of 6 , 10 , and 14 , during which scores more sharply turned up or down .
And when were IQs the least stable ?
Before the age of 6 .
Yet in New York we track most kids based on test scores they got at 4 .
( And we may not even be the worst offenders : As Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman note in their new book , NurtureShock , there are cities with preschools that require IQ tests of 2 - year - olds . )
“ How can you lock children into a specialized educational experience at so young an age ? ” asks McCall .
“ As soon as you start denying kids early , you penalize them almost progressively .
Education and mental achievement builds on itself .
It ’s cumulative . ”
Most researchers in the field of childhood development agree that the minds of nursery - school children are far too raw to be judged .
Sally Shaywitz , author of Overcoming Dyslexia , is in the midst of a decades - long study that examines reading development in children .
She says she could n’t even use the reading data she ’d collected from first - graders for some of the longitudinal analyses .
“ It simply was n’t stable , ” she says .
I tell her that most New York City schools do n’t share this view .
“ A young brain is a moving target , ” she replies .
“ It should not be treated as if it were fixed . ”
Complicating matters further , IQs are least stable at the highest end of the spectrum no matter what age they ’re assessed .
The explanation for this is simple :
There ’s more room to fall the higher you go , and hence a greater likelihood that the score will regress toward the mean .
Chance figures more prominently into high scores — a good night ’s sleep , comfort with the tester — and lucky guesses on tough questions are worth more points than answers to midrange questions .
In 2006 , David Lohman , a psychologist at the University of Iowa , co-authored a paper called “ Gifted Today but Not Tomorrow ? ” in the Journal for the Education of the Gifted , demonstrating just how labile “ giftedness ” is .
It notes that only 45 percent of the kids who scored 130 or above on the Stanford - Binet would do so on another , similar IQ test at the same point in time .
Combine this with the instability of 4 - year - old IQs , and it becomes pretty clear that judgments about giftedness should be an ongoing affair , rather than a fateful determination made at one arbitrary moment in time .
I wrote to Lohman and asked what percentage of 4 - year - olds who scored 130 or above would do so again as 17 - year - olds .
He answered with a careful regression analysis : about 25 percent .
The implications of this number are pretty startling .
They mean that three quarters of the seniors in a gifted program would no longer test into that program if asked to retake an IQ test on graduation day .
So I wrote Lohman back : Was he certain about this ?
“ Yes , ” he replied .
“ Even people who consider themselves well versed in these matters are often surprised to discover how much movement / noise / instability there is even when correlations seem high . ”
He was careful to note , however , that this does n’t mean IQ tests have no predictive value per se .
After all , these tests are better — far better — at predicting which children will have a 130 - plus IQ at 17 than any other procedure we ’ve devised .
To have some mechanism that can find , during childhood , a quarter of the adults who ’ll test so well is , if you think about it , impressive .
“ The problem , ” wrote Lohman , “ is assigning kids to schools for the gifted on the basis of a test score at age 4 or 5 and assuming that their rank order among age mates will be constant over time . ”
Appelbaum , McCall ’s co-author , puts an even finer point on the stakes .
“ No university I know , ” he says , “ would think of using a 4 - year - old ’s data to decide who to admit . ”
A January 5 thread from the parenting website DCurbanmom :
Can anyone offer advice on whether I should by [ sic ] Aristotle Circle ?
I ’m in a time crunch .
Thanks !

My sister - in - law bought Aristotle Circle workbook and showed it to me .
As a child psychologist , the workbook is so close to the real thing , I think it is cheating .
That said , my nephew aced the test …

It is so sad that we have to do this — but what to do ?
[ dear child ] is at a disadvantage if everyone else is prepping and we are not .
11:09
There was a time , not that long ago , when few parents attempted to prep their 4 - year - olds for kindergarten - admission exams .
But then a few more began to do it , and then a few more after that , and then suddenly , normal - seeming people with normal - seeming values began doing it , too , and an arms - race mentality kicked in .
Responding to parents ’ anxieties and fears , some of the fancier preschools began subtly prepping their students — giving them similar exercises to do with blocks , introducing them to the concept of analogies .
Expensive test - prep kits suddenly began to appear on the market .
And high - end education consultancies began to bloom , like Aristotle Circle .
Founded in 2008 by an M.I.T. graduate and former Wall Street analyst named Suzanne Rheault , it provides tutors , advisers , and — most important — prep books for apprehensive and even merely conscientious parents .
“ I can understand people getting offended by 4 - year - olds getting tutoring for these exams , ” says Rheault when we meet in her Soho conference room .
“ But I ’m not the one making them take them . ”
She dumps a bag of blocks onto the conference table .
They ’re essentially the same ones used on the WPPSI , except hers are white and blue rather than white and red .
Then she plops down her meticulous , brightly designed prep book , which she just completed last August .
She opens to the “ Vocabulary ” section , illustrated by a former cartoonist for Disney .
“ Any vocabulary the child needs , ” she tells me , “ is in this book , ” whether it ’s to complete picture analogies or understand questions that are asked of them .
Then she flips to a section of the types of questions the children will be asked aloud —
What is a villain ?
What is a liquid ?— and a few pages after that , she gets to what she believes is the “ core intellectual meat ” of the exam : “ Concept groupings , ” or pages of pictures organized by how the objects in them are linked .
Containers : picnic baskets , suitcases , matchboxes .
Things that open and close : zippers , eyes , locks .
Measuring instruments : hourglasses , watches , thermometers .
“ Any of the abstract groupings the child needs to understand are also here , ” she tells me .
How does Rheault know all this ?
I ask her , incredulously .
Has she seen one ?
You have to be specially registered with the publisher to buy the WPPSI .
Like most IQ tests , it is updated only periodically , which makes it coveted by parents — if you ’ve seen one lately , you ’ve likely seen the version your child will take .
“ I ’m not going to talk about it , ” she replies .
“ But the people who helped us develop the workbook are psychologists who ’ve seen them . ”
But copies of this test are obviously floating around .
Skylar ’s mother , for instance , says she was offered a copy of the WPPSI by a fellow mom .
Type a few key search words on Urbanbaby.com , and within 30 seconds you ’ll find this post :
Have WWPSI - III to sell .
Excellent condition .
Complete set .
E - mail me if you are serious and discreet .
No questions asked .
Cost is $ 3,000 .
( An e-mail address follows . )
This past fall , a parent admitted to a psychologist who administers SB - 5 tests for Hunter that he ’d purchased a copy of the exam right off the publisher ’s website .
“ The type of tests we sell are primarily for special education , so it ’s never been an issue for us in the past , ” says Elizabeth Allen , the director of research and development of Pro-Ed Inc. , which only recently acquired the rights to the Stanford - Binet .
“ When I heard , I was like , ‘ You ’re kidding me !
Some parent paid a thousand dollars so they could get their kid into a gifted program ?
Wow . ’ ” ( The company has since fixed the problem ; now only licensed professionals can buy them . )
There are some who insist that studying for these exams can’t possibly budge a child ’s scores .
“ I do n’t know how prepping could help on the OLSAT , ” says Anna Commitante , head of the Gifted and Talented programs for the city ’s Department of Education .
But Rheault can’t believe there ’s still any debate about the subject .
“ The psychologists we work with , ” she says , “ say that 50 to 60 percent of the material is learnable . ”
Yes , her point of view may be colored by her commercial interests — her WPPSI prep books go for $ 500 , and she ’s now completing a workbook for the OLSAT and will shortly start one for the SB - 5 .
But she ’s hardly alone in her beliefs .
“ When people say this stuff is n’t really coachable , I always scratch my head and say , ‘ Yeah , except for the parts that are , ’ ” says Jonathan Plucker , director of the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy at Indiana University .
“ I understand the nature / nurture debate .
It ’s a complicated relationship .
But to say that families with greater means and more interest in education can’t influence test outcomes — I ca n’t understand that reasoning .
It ’s common sense . ”
The practice of prepping can run families into the thousands of dollars , posing a clear disadvantage to those who ca n’t afford it .
But the truth is , even without coaching , children coming from economically and culturally rich backgrounds do far better on these tests .
And that ’s a far more urgent reason to challenge the widespread reliance on them .
“ An analogy people use a lot for this is planting corn , ” says Barnett , from Rutgers .
“ If you want to know about the properties of different kinds of corn , you have to plant it in land that ’s well fertilized and well irrigated .
If you plant it in soil that ’s dried up and rocky , you wo n’t know , because nothing will grow . ”
The same , he explains , goes for children .
How can one possibly know anything about their minds if they ’ve spent their first four years in unstimulating environments ?
“ People have the idea that with these tests you can cancel out socioeconomic background and get to some real thing in the kid , ” agrees Nicholas Lemann , dean of the journalism school at Columbia and author of The Big Test , a history of the SAT .
“ That ’s a chimera .
If you ’re a 4 - year - old performing well on these tests , it ’s either because you have fabulous genetic material or because you have cultural advantages .
But either way , the point is :
You ’re doing better because of your parents . ”
Rather than promoting a meritocracy , in other words , these tests instead retard one .
They reflect the world as it ’s already stratified — and then perpetuate that same stratification .
“ Instead of giving IQ tests , you could just as easily look at Zip Codes and the education levels of the parents to determine who gets the better schooling — you get a very high correlation between IQ and socioeconomic status in the first seven or eight years of life , ” says Samuel J. Meisels , assessment expert and president of Chicago ’s Erikson Institute , the renowned graduate school in childhood development .
“ Giftedness is a real thing , no question .
But giftedness can be extinguished , and it can be nurtured . ”
He mentions a New York Times education analysis from 2008 , which noted that after the city streamlined its G&T program , requiring specific cutoff scores for the OLSAT , the percentage of white students had shot up from 33 to 48 percent , while the percentage of black and Hispanic enrollment had fallen .
“ Sometimes , ” he says , “ you look at a big city ’s decisions to do this and wonder if it ’s about nurturing giftedness or if it ’s about keeping middle - class families in the city limits . ”
Skylar is allowed her potty break .
She returns and stands on top of her chair .
“ Okay ! ” says her evaluator , smiling .
“ So … what is a house ? ”
“ I already know .
A home . ”
She gives Skylar a playful look and tips her head .
“ And what ’s a home ? ”
Skylar mirrors her tipped head .
“ A house ! ”
She laughs .
“ What ’s a bird ? ”
Skylar picks up her Hello Kitty pen and bounces it on her tester ’s arm .
“ Look , a hopping marker ! ”
Her tester smiles .
“ What ’s a bird — ”
Skylar races the pen up and down .
“ Vrooooooooom !
Magic marker !
Vroom vroom ! ”
Watching this exchange is a reminder of something any parent knows : Four - year - olds , no matter how smart and delightful they may be , have obvious limits as test takers .
Many , especially boys , ca n’t sit still for the full duration of an exam ; others ca n’t stay awake or concentrate for that long , choosing at some catastrophic point to crawl under their desks and give up .
Nor is the context in which these tests are administered exactly relaxing for young children .
Both IQ tests require that they sit alone in a room with a tester they probably have n’t seen before .
In the case of the WPPSI , the tester often is n’t allowed to prompt the children to give more complete answers , even if it ’s clear they ’re capable of delivering them ( and would score better if they did ) .
In the case of the OLSAT , the testers ca n’t even repeat the questions .
“ What is a pet ? ”
“ An animal .
I have pet goldfish . ”
Her tester decides to play along this time .
“ Do they have names ? ”
“ Zoe and Tangerine . ”
Skylar plants her marker next to a rectangular - shaped sticker she ’d gotten as a reward for a previous exercise and admires the shape she ’s just made .
“ Look ! A flag ! ”
Stephen J. Bagnato , a professor of pediatrics and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh , is fond of quoting Head Start co-founder Urie Bronfenbrenner , who in 1977 famously wrote , “ Much of contemporary developmental psychology is the science of the strange behavior of children in strange situations with strange adults for the briefest possible periods of time . ”
It ’s hard not to think about that observation in the context of intelligence - testing 4 - year - olds .
The script is so rigid , the tasks are so narrow and precise .
Skylar did extremely well on her evaluation .
Yet to me , the loveliest and most intellectually revealing moment was when she blew off all rules and made that whimsical little flag .
If it were a real exam , the tester would n’t even have written it down .
“ Well , right , ” says Bagnato .
“ When the examiner can only say certain things to these kids , and the child can only say certain things back , of course it ’s too confining .
We know that the way kids display their skills best is through creative play and everyday interactions at home and at school . ”
As it turns out , intelligence tests miss lots of things , not just creativity .
And perhaps that explains why IQs alone are not especially good predictors of excellence .
In the twenties , for instance , Lewis Terman , a psychologist and deep believer in intelligence testing — it was he who revised Alfred Binet ’s original test and came up with the Stanford - Binet model — started a now - famous longitudinal study of nearly 1,500 California children with extremely high IQs .
He grandiosely called it “ Genetic Studies of Genius , ” and his hope was to show that these children , whom he called “ exceptionally superior , ” would one day form the backbone of the nation ’s intellectual and creative elite , making crucial advances in sciences and public policy and the arts .
But as David Shenk , author of the forthcoming The Genius in All of Us , points out , his subjects only grew less and less remarkable as time wore on .
None won Nobel Prizes , though two who were specifically rejected for the study — William Shockley and Luis Alvarez — did , both in physics .
None became world - renowned musicians , though two other rejects — Isaac Stern and Yehudi Menuhin — did , for their virtuosic violin - playing .
In Outliers , Malcolm Gladwell makes a similar point , noting that one ’s IQ need n’t be super - high to succeed ; it simply needs to be high enough .
“ Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120 , ” he writes , “ having additional IQ points does n’t seem to translate into any measurable real - world advantage . ”
In Genius Revisited , Rena Subotnik , director of the American Psychological Association ’s Center for Gifted Education Policy , undertook a similar study , with colleagues , looking at Hunter elementary - school alumni all grown up .
Their mean IQs were 157 .
“ They were lovely people , ” she says , “ and they were generally happy , productive , and satisfied with their lives .
But there really was n’t any wow factor in terms of stellar achievement . ”
So what do psychologists and educators think makes the difference between good and exceptional ?
Opportunity , connections , mentors .
Perseverance and monomaniacal devotion , or what the psychologist Ellen Winner calls “ the rage to master . ”
Creativity , a willingness to fail .
Nelson , the head of Calhoun , can go on at urgent , passionate length about this .
“ I want a school full of kids who daydream , ” he says .
“ I want kids who are occasionally impulsive .
I want kids who are fun to be with .
I want kids who do n’t want to answer the questions on those tests in the way the adult wants them to be answered , because that kid is already seeing the world differently .
In fact , ” he adds , after thinking it over for a moment , “ I want kids who are cynical enough at age 4 to know that there ’s really something wrong with someone asking them these things and think , ‘ I ’m going to screw with them in the process ! ’ ”
Granted , Calhoun is an unusual school , a place where kids do n’t even get test scores until they ’re freshmen .
But one need n’t be particularly subversive to appreciate Nelson ’s philosophy of educating 4 - year - olds , or his frustration with current practice .
“ You have to play with blocks , ” he says .
“ You have to make up stories .
You have to muck around .
Arithmetic and decoding language are n’t life — they ’re symbolic representations of other things .
And education is being diverted into focusing on these symbolic representations of the very experiences kids are being denied . ”
Nelson says he ’s considering scrapping the WPPSI as an admission requirement for Calhoun ’s lower school , possibly starting as early as next year .
As it is , he barely takes a kid ’s score into account .
One of the most compelling reasons to get rid of it , he notes , is n’t because the test is intellectually pointless .
It ’s because it ’s emotionally insidious .
“ When we resort to any kind of measure of kids that ’s supposed to be qualitative at a young age , ” he says , “ no matter how cheerfully we do it , no matter how many lollipops we hand out to de-stress the process , young children are extraordinarily discerning .
They absorb their parents ’ anxiety about it , they absorb the kinds of judgments people are making about them .
So there ’s a process of organizing kids in a hierarchy of worth , and it ’s beginning at an age that ’s criminal . ”
The irony is that doing well on these exams can be just as damaging as doing poorly on them .
“ Gifted ” is an awfully uncomfortable label for some children to wear .
It can cripple their thinking , make them terrified of risk .
“ It ’s not entirely inaccurate to observe that more and more high - achieving students go off to university and do n’t care about anything , ” says Nelson .
“ They do n’t ask questions , they do n’t have original ideas .
And it ’s not because there ’s anything wrong with them , but because they were conditioned to believe that learning is about giving back the right answer . ”
Nelson knows it ’s heresy to say this , but he wonders if it ’s true .
“ These tests , at 4 , start that long process of conditioning , ” he says .
“ Right then , children start to believe that learning means pleasing the powerful adult in whose presence you are . ”
It ’s unlikely that most city schools will follow Nelson ’s lead and stop testing 4 - year - olds .
But it is possible that these tests could earn less and less weight in the selection process as they become tainted by excessive prepping and anxiety .
That does n’t mean , however , that the selection process will become more democratic .
“ I ’m afraid schools will be judging the child in ways that are n’t any better , ” says Emily Glickman , founder of Abacus Guide Educational Consulting .
“ There ’ll just be more weight on the school report , and what the nursery - school director says about the child verbally .
And often kids who come from expensive , high - cachet nursery schools have elaborate evaluations written about them , because the preschool directors themselves have a high stake in the class ’s placement success . ”
And in the case of private schools , she notes , even more emphasis may be given to a family ’s socioeconomic status :
“ The kindergarten - admission process has always been about openly judging a 4 - year - old and secretly judging the parents ’ wealth , connections , and likeliness to give . ”
Giving less weight to these tests does n’t guarantee that the selection process would become more sensible , either , or more sensitive to finding those children who ’d profit from an enriched education .
After all , what mechanism should schools use ?
This is the hardest question .
Most education researchers can tell you just what ’s wrong with intelligence - testing 4 - year - olds .
But few can tell you what should emerge in its stead .
“ Before we adopted the OLSAT , ” says the Department of Education ’s Commitante , “ we had 32 different school districts using a huge … a tremendous variety of assessments . ”
Some , she says , relied on expensive IQ tests ; others required teacher evaluations .
The result was a hodgepodge of arbitrary standards — ones that , the city believed , worked against children who spoke English as a second language ( the OLSAT is given in eight languages ) or had lower incomes ( the city gives the OLSAT for free ) .
Given his druthers , Meisels , at Erikson Institute , says he ’d try to get a more comprehensive picture of the child .
“ And that can only be found through watching children in classroom situations , ” he says .
“ And looking at the products of their work .
And getting to know them .
And that can be done through observational assessments . ”
I try to interrupt him , but he anticipates my objection .
“ It ’s not very practical , I know , ” he says .
“ It means teaching teachers how to do it .
It ’d be more expensive .
But you could do it .
And then you ’d get the right kids into these differentiated programs . ”
Many researchers agree with him — and will add , as Meisels later does in our conversation , that kids ought never to be evaluated just once .
“ If one believes that kids do learn and improve , ” says McCall , “ then a few new kids should be eligible for gifted programs each year . ”
If you ’re looking for practical answers though , Plucker , of Indiana , has a modest proposal .
He suggests that schools assess children at an age when IQs get more stable .
And in fact , that ’s just what City and Country , one of Manhattan ’s more progressive schools , does .
Standardized tests are n’t required of their applicants until they ’re 7 or older .
“ That way , the kids are further along in their schooling , ” explains Elise Clark , the school ’s admissions director .
“ They ’re used to an academic setting , they can handle a test - taking situation , and overall , we consider the results more reliable . ”
Even then , she says , her school still does n’t weight IQ scores very much .
“ If we did , what we ’d have is a group of kids with good test - taking skills and … I do n’t know what else . ”
But my money ’s on the marshmallow test .
It ’s quite compelling and , apparently , quite famous — Shenk talks about it with great relish in The Genius in All of Us .
In the sixties , a Stanford psychologist named Walter Mischel rounded up 653 young children and gave them a choice :
They could eat one marshmallow at that very moment , or they could wait for an unspecified period of time and eat two .
Most chose two , but in the end , only one third of the sample had the self - discipline to wait the fifteen or so minutes for them .
Mischel then had the inspired idea to follow up on his young subjects , checking in with them as they were finishing high school .
He discovered that the children who ’d waited for that second marshmallow had scored , on average , 210 points higher on the SAT .
Two hundred and ten points .
Can Princeton
Review boast such a gain ?
Maybe our schools ought to be screening children for self - discipline and the ability to tolerate delayed gratification , rather than intelligence and academic achievement .
It seems as good a predictor of future success as any .
And Mischel ’s test subjects , too , were just 4 years old .
Dube tried to put it in perspective .
" I do n't give our officers an objective .
I just say to them , 'if someone asks you for a service that is not part of your normal duties , let them know that our commercial unit may offer the service , " he said .
As a nomenclatural note , even obvious term variants like " pictures " ( plural ) and " picture " ( singular ) would be treated as different search terms by a dumb computer , so we also include these types of relationships within our umbrella of synonyms .
Pictures / picture are typically called stemming variants , which refers to the fact that they share the same word stem , or root .
The same systems that need to understand that " pictures " and " photos " mean the same thing also need to understand that " pictures " and " picture " mean the same thing .
This is something that is even more obvious to a human but is also still a difficult task for a computer .
An example of how this is difficult are the words " animal " and " animation , " which share the same stem and etymology , but do n't mean the same thing in standard use .
Another tricky case that is very dependent on the other words in the query is " arm " vs. " arms . "
Arms might seem like the plural of arm , but consider how it might be used in a search : [ arm reduction ] vs. [ arms reduction ] .
Google search is smart enough to know that the former is about removing fat from one 's arm , and the latter is about reducing stockpiles of weaponry , and that arm / arms are dangerous synonyms in that case because they would change the meaning .
These subtle differences between words that seem related is what makes synonymy very hard to get right .
Here are some other examples of synonyms we thought were interesting : song words ] , " lyrics " is bolded for " words " .
what state has the highest murder rate ] , " homicide " is bolded for " murder " .
himalayan kitten breeder ] , Google knows that " cat breeder " is the same as " kitten breeder " .
dura ace track bb axle njs ] , Google knows that " bb " here means " bottom bracket " .
software update on bb color id ] , " blackberry is bolded for " bb " .
bb cream dark ] , Google knows here that bb means " blemish balm " .
southeastern usa bb fitness & figure ] , " bodybuilding " is bolded for " bb .
" Lastly , language is used with as much variety and subtlety as is present in human culture , and our algorithms still make mistakes .
We flinch when we find such mistakes ; we 're always working to fix them .
One of the best ways for us to discover these problems is to get feedback from real users , which we then use to inspire improvements to our computer programs .
If you have specific complaints about our synonyms system , you can post a question at the web search help center forum or you can tweet them with the hash tag # googlesyns .
You can also turn off a synonym for a specific term by adding a " + " before it or by putting the words in quotation marks .
A U.S. - based philanthropy that funds human rights groups in Israel is under fire amid accusations that its recipients provided the bulk of evidence to a U.N. commission that issued a report highly critical of Israel ’s Gaza Strip war a year ago .
Leaders of the Washington - based New Israel Fund , whose recipients include several groups that promote Palestinian rights , said Sunday that they are being unfairly targeted by conservatives in Israel seeking to silence opposing viewpoints .
“ It ’s an attempt to stifle dissent , ” said Daniel Sokatch , chief executive of the fund , which donates about $ 15 million annually to human rights and civil society groups in Israel .
The group ’s donations were the focus of a Jan. 29 report by Im Tirtzu , a self - described centrist Zionist group that alleged 92 % of the material collected inside Israel by the United Nations ’ Goldstone Commission originated with New Israel Fund grantees .

Last fall , the U.N. panel , headed by South African jurist Richard Goldstone , accused Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas of committing war crimes during Israel ’s 22 - day assault in Gaza , which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007 .
The Israeli offensive , launched in response to Palestinian rocket fire , killed about 1,400 Palestinians .
Thirteen Israelis died during the assault .
The Israeli military has condemned the findings as biased and inaccurate .
The Goldstone report accuses the military of using disproportionate force and deliberately targeting civilians .
Many Israelis fear the report has tarnished their nation ’s reputation .
Im Tirtzu leaders say the New Israel Fund and its recipients were instrumental in assisting the U.N. inquiry , with which Israel refused to cooperate .
Im Tirtzu founder Erez Tadmor accused the fund of financing a “ propagandist campaign ” aimed at “ de- legitimizing Israel , negating its right to exist and its right to self - defense . ”
In a media and advertising campaign , Im Tirtzu and its supporters labeled the New Israel Fund and the groups its supports as unpatriotic .
A lawmaker is calling for an investigation .

“ In the end , ” one leading newspaper columnist wrote , “ they serve the agenda of Iran and Hamas . ”
Fund President Naomi Chazan , a former lawmaker , was depicted in newspaper ads with a horn sprouting from her forehead .
The Jerusalem Post newspaper canceled her regular column .
“ This atmosphere is bordering on McCarthyism , ” said Melanie Takefman , spokeswoman for the Assn. for Civil Rights in Israel .
“ There is increasing nationalism and a feeling that more and more things have become taboo . ”
In the aftermath of the Goldstone report , some critics have accused Israel of attempting to crack down on foreign aid workers , journalists and charities working in the Palestinian territories or perceived as supporting Palestinian causes .

Fund officials acknowledge that some recipients cooperated with the Goldstone inquiry , but they estimated that the materials provided account for 14 % of the total evidence collected , according to fund spokeswoman Naomi Paiss .
She said human rights groups were just doing their jobs .
“ This is what human rights group do , ” she said , noting that the fund did not necessarily endorse their positions .
“ They are supposed to monitor and report . ”

MOSCOW  Viktor A. Semenov was growing lettuce on a collective farm outside Moscow in 1990 when a representative of McDonald ’s stopped by .
The company had just opened a restaurant .
Could he sell it a few boxes of lettuce each week ?
Mr. Semenov ’s assistant turned it down .
One restaurant was too small an order .
“ I said , ‘ My friend !
You see how many McDonald ’s there are in the West ? ’ ” Mr. Semenov recalled recently .
“ I said , ‘ Sell them lettuce at any price .
It ’s our new strategy . ’ ”
With that , Mr. Semenov started a company that has all but cornered the market on packaged fresh vegetables in Russia .
With a buy - one - get - one - free deal on hamburgers and a traditional Russian accordion band , McDonald ’s celebrated on Monday the 20th anniversary of the opening of its first store in the Soviet Union , a restaurant that drew long lines .
Women hoard £ 200 worth of clothes they can no longer fit into
Nothing to wear :
The average woman 's wardrobe contains at least 10 items of clothing that do n't fit
They are the guilty secrets squirrelled away in the wardrobe by most women .
The pair of jeans that used to fit perfectly , the top which is flattering in all the right places , the suit that will definitely fit again one day .
Apparently 80 per cent of women have items of clothing hidden in the wardrobe which are testament to the days when they were that bit thinner .
They keep the clothes in the hope that one day they will fit into them again .
Instead the items of clothing collect dust and just act as a reminder of the size they once were .
Researchers have found the average woman has £ 200 of unworn clothes in her wardrobe .
That means women have spent an estimated total of £ 32,186,000 on clothes that do not , and have never , fitted .
A survey by diet company Slim Fast found that nearly 50 per cent of women have 10 or more items of clothing in their wardrobe they cannot bear to throw out .
On average this includes four pairs of jeans , two little black dresses , two bikinis , a skirt and a boob tube .
The most unworn item of clothing is jeans - as women keep pairs that just do n't fit anymore .
The survey also found that 53 per cent of women have clothes in their wardrobes that span three or more different dress sizes .
And one in four people have lied to their friends and partners about what size they are .
Nutritionist Fiona Hunter said : ' The weight of a lot of women yo yos .
They lose weight , gain it then loose it again , so they have their fat clothes and their thin clothes .
A lot of the problem is that women choose inappropriate diets and once they lose weight they can't stick to that weight .
' But we are optimistic so we keep clothes which used to fit us .
And the problem with yo yo dieting because if you have lost weight once , you think you will be able to do it again .
' If a woman has a favourite dress or something that brings good memories to them , they would like to think they would be able to wear it again . '
More than a quarter of the 2,000 women surveyed said they had purposely bought clothes that do not fit as an incentive to diet , but have never reached their target so the clothes remain unworn .
Slim Fast spokesperson , Tracey Wilson , said : ' Hopefully this survey will show us that we are not alone in hoarding our clothes and that there are many other women out there , who cling on to clothes that no longer fit .
The overall cost of unworn clothes is phenomenal !
We want to tell the public it need n’t be a challenge to slim into our dream outfits . '
Evidence shows British women are getting bigger , taller and rounder .
The average female waist has increased from 27.5 in 50 years ago to 34in , according to the National Sizing Survey .
Hips are 1.5 in wider five decades later at 29in , while bust size has increased by the same amount to 38.5in .
To reflect this , most fashion stores provide larger sizes to reflect the reality of their customers .
As long ago as 2005 , Topshop chiefs admitted they had been forced to inflate sizes to cope with young women ' blossoming ' .
Its standard size ten and 12 were ' super - sized ' to cope with changing body shapes , an executive revealed .
Marks & Spencer has made a virtue of changing its sizes , which included moving its standard from size 12 to 14 .
The firm 's Per Una fashion range goes up to an 18 .
Updated IBM reseachers have made a breakthrough in the development of ultra- high - speed transistor design , creating a 100GHz graphene - based wafer - scale device .
And that 's just for starters .
The transistor that the researchers have developed is a relatively large one , with a gate length of 240 nanometers - speeds should increase as the gate length shrinks .
The field - effect transistor that the IBM team developed exploits what a paper published in the journal Science understates as the " very high carrier mobilities " of graphene , a one - atom - thick sheet of carbon atoms grown on a silicon substrate .
This extraordinarily thin sheet is grown on the silicon epitaxially , meaning that it 's created in an ordered crystaline structure on top of another crystaline structure - in this case , good ol ' garden - variety silicon .
The graphene sheet has a hexagonal , honeycombed structure .
A long gate length means plenty of room for speed improvements
Graphene has been known for some time to have exceptional electron mobility , but it has remained stubbornly resistant to the creation of band gaps - the electron - free zones necessary for transistors to funtion as on / off switches .
Among the IBM research team 's breakthroughs was the creation of these band gaps in a graphene - based transistor .
In an IBM Research statement , Dr. T.C. Chen , vice president for science and technology , said : " A key advantage of graphene lies in the very high speeds in which electrons propagate , which is essential for achieving high - speed , high - performance next generation transistors .
The breakthrough we are announcing demonstrates clearly that graphene can be utilized to produce high performance devices and integrated circuits . "
Key to the breakthrough is what the paper calls a " interfacial polymer layer " that separates the graphene sheet from its metal gate dialectric .
And although the gate length is a hefty 240nm , IBM notes that there is " plenty of space for further optimization of its performance by scaling down the gate length . "
But even at this gate length and at this early stage of their development , IBM 's graphene transistors can already achieve speeds of 250 per cent of those achievable by " state - of - the - art " silicon metal - oxide semiconductor FETs of the same gate length , which the IBM paper says top out at around 40GHz .
Also notable is the fact that the graphene transistor 's 100GHz performance was at room temperature .
When chilled , even higher performance is to be expected . ®
Update
This article did not note that the cut - off frequency , or switching speed , of an individual transistor is faster than the clock rate of a microprocessor composed of such transistors , which is typically an order of magnitude or more lower .
The Reg regrets the lack of clarity .
PUEBLO – Colorado State University ’s Board of Governors voted unanimously this morning to ban concealed weapons at its campuses in Fort Collins and Pueblo .
The resolution passed with no comments from the board members .
Prior to the vote critics of Colorado State University ’s proposed gun control ban — which includes licensed concealed weapons — said this morning that the new policy would increase crime and draw lawsuits .
Schools that have banned concealed weapons on campus , including the University of Colorado , have seen crime jump because of the restriction , CSU history major Brady Allen told the CSU Board of Governors this morning .
By comparison , major crime at CSU — where concealed weapons are allowed — has been low or virtually non-existent , Allen said .
“ This risk is not with the concealed weapons holder but with those who want to commit crime , ” Allen said .
Gun rights groups had threatened to sue the university if the policy is passed .
The policy bans all firearms on campus , including guns held by people with concealed weapons permits .
It includes items such as handguns , shotguns , rifles , bows , crossbows , Tasers , stun guns , pellet guns , machine guns , grenades and blasting caps .
The policy is effectively an extension of the current policy that prohibits weapons in residence halls .
The policy extend those regulations to the entire campus with some exceptions .
CSU is one of the few colleges in the United States that did not have a concealed weapons ban .
CSU parent Brad Deats told the board this morning , CSU can expect to spend a lot of money defending the new policy if it passes .
“ We should ask the state how much it will cost to defend CSU if this policy is enacted , ” Deats said .

Editor ’s note :
This marks the launch of Climate Change and Food Culture , a series of posts by Gary Nabhan about how climate change threatens to stamp out some of the globe ’s most celebrated foodstuffs , and along with them the farming and cooking cultures that created them .
Most Turks live on the water ’s edge in the far western reaches of their vast country .
But many of the spices that perfume the air in Turkey ’s famous urban bazaars come from the nation ’s southeastern farming areas of Sanliurfa and Kahramanmaras .
In fact , spices from this region rank among the most highly prized condiments and herbs you can find in any spice emporium anywhere .
As I wandered through the Misir Carsisi Spice Bazaar in Istanbul , and the Kemeralti Bazaar at the western terminus of the Silk Road in Izmir , I could see the chile powders , pastes and dried fruits from Sanliurfa and Kahramanmaras proudly and prominently displayed .
Urfa and Maras peppers from Turkey have the same international fame that Aleppo ( Halaby ) peppers do from Syria , Tabascos do from Louisiana , or Habaneros do from the Yucatan .
But their prices are soaring and supplies are becoming scarce–not merely because of international demand , but because of drought and agricultural water scarcity triggered by global climate change .
The same climate - driven pressures are affecting the survival of the Halaby pepper and its traditional farmers near Aleppo , Syria .
In the past three years , 160 Syrian farming villages have been abandoned near Aleppo as crop failures have forced over 200,000 rural Syrians to leave for the cities .
This news is distressing enough , but when put into a long - term perspective , its implications are staggering : many of these villages have been continuously farmed for 8000 years .
As one expert puts it , this may be the worst long - term drought and most severe set of crop failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile Crescent many millennia ago .
The thousands of tourists and residents who purchase Urfa and Maras chiles in Istanbul ’s Spice Bazaar may not yet realize it , but their access to these world class spices is being disrupted by climate change .
Since 2007 , rains in some forty Turkish provinces , northern Syria and eastern Iraq have been 30 percent to 40 percent of their normal levels .
The drought in southeastern Anatolia has reduced harvests by 80 percent .
In Syria , 60 percent of the agricultural lands have been affected by these droughts .
In Iraq , 2 million rural residents have been left without water .
Many irrigation canals remain dry , as the only water reaching rivers like the Euphrates is being usurped by cities upstream .
Downstream on the Tigris - Euphrates delta , saltwater intrusion is making domestic water unpotable .
Between the three countries , perhaps five million people have been directly affected .
Peppers are perhaps the most widely - used spice , condiment and vegetable in the world , but the devil is in the details .
Many folks cannot tolerate the heat of a Bhut Jolokia or Habanero , but prefer the milder , smokier aroma of a Urfa or Chilpotle .
And yet , we can no longer take unrestricted globalized access to such culinary treasures for granted .
Our own patterns of consumption and proliferation of greenhouse gases are endangering the very things that give us pleasure .
Think about it .
The loss of farmers from Saliurfa , Kahramanmaras and Aleppo–far away places you may have never heard of before –is our own plight .
Our food security and access to treasures of world food culture are linked to their water and land security .
One heirloom chile pepper blinking out may not be all that great of a loss , but the cumulative loss of food biodiversity driven by climate change will touch us all .
And you thought Harry Reid was in trouble BEFORE this weekend .
The Senate Democratic leader -- already looking at a tough re-election bid in Nevada -- faces Republican calls to step down after reports that in 2008 he said he thought that Barack Obama could win the presidency because he was " light - skinned " and did not use a " Negro dialect , unless he wanted to have one . "
" It 's an old mind - set when you 're using language in 2008 that harkens back to the 1950s and ' 60s , " said Republican Party Chair Michael Steele on Fox News Sunday .
Reid apologized Saturday to President Obama , who issued a statement in support of the Senate majority leader who is shepherding his health care bill and other items through Congress .
" I accepted Harry 's apology without question because I 've known him for years , I 've seen the passionate leadership he 's shown on issues of social justice , and I know what 's in his heart , " Obama said in his statement .
" As far as I am concerned , the book is closed . "
It was a book that disclosed Reid 's comments -- Game Change , a chronicle of the 2008 campaign by journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin .
Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine cited Obama 's acceptance of Reid apology in downplaying the incident on Fox News Sunday .
" If you look at those comments , they clearly were in the context of praising Sen. Obama , " Kaine said , predicting that Reid would stay on as Senate majority leader .
" I do n't think this is an issue that 's going to affect his leadership at all . "
Steele and other Republicans such as Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona cited what they called a " double standard " when it comes to racial comments by Democrats as opposed to members of the GOP .
Both cited the case of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , who lost his leadership post after his 2002 comments .
" I 'd like to see the same standard applied to both " parties , Kyl said , also on Fox News Sunday .
Kaine , who also appeared with Steele on NBC's Meet The Press , said Lott 's comments appeared to support segregation , while Reid was trying to praise Obama 's ability .

( Cloverdale , CA ) – More trademark battles . . . in this middleweight bout , Bear Republic Brewing takes on Central City Brewing over “ Red Racer . ”
The Boston IP blog posted the details about the Bear Republic lawsuit over the weekend .
California - based Bear Republic is suing British Columbia - based Central City over alleged trademark infringement on its “ RACER 5 INDIA PALE ALE and BEAR REPUBLIC RICARDO ’S RED ROCKET ALE ” marks .
Bear Republic takes issue with Central City ’s Red Racer product line which hit cans and U.S. distribution for the first time last year .
The brewery sent a cease and desist in mid-December to which Central City responded in early January , rejecting Bear Republic ’s claims .
In the lawsuit , which is available in full here ( pdf ) , Bear Republic says that at this year ’s GABF , a representative was approached by two different people asking about its Red Racer beer in cans .
Bear Republic also points to an article penned by Massachusetts - based beer columnist , Norman Miller , in which he repeatedly confuses the Red Racer and Red Rocket names .
The article , for which Google ’s cached result is still available , has since been removed .
The lawsuit was filed in late January with a Massachusetts court , a state where Central City and Bear Republic products are both available .
The lawsuit also notes that it was an ( unnamed )
Ohio brewery owner that phoned Bear Republic , mentioning the similarities between the two breweries ’ marks as well as “ the similarities of words , fonts and colors ” used between them , that first made the brewery aware of Central City Red Racer products .
The suit seeks , among other things , “ an award of damages in the amount of Defendant ’s profits . ”
This is where I need a legal team to look at this .
Does that mean just the profits from the allegedly infringing products or all of the company ’s profits ?
Bear Republic has always and will continue to make award - winning beer .
What this does though is shine a spotlight on Central City Brewing , a brewery I had admittedly never heard of before this incident .
Central City Red Racer IPA has earned awards and critical praise from the beer rating community , and actually has a chance to make it into the top 10 American IPAs on Beer Advocate .
Central City beers are imported through Klassen Wines ; they appear to be available in Maine and California ( and others ? ) in addition to Massachusetts according to Beer Advocate ’s Beer Spy feature .
Infringing items are to be seized if Bear Republic wins the lawsuit so if you want to try these beers , you may want to snatch them up quickly .

Turns out one of them was a super rare collectors dream game , so it went for around $ 13,000 ! "
Up for auction is an original Nintendo NES gaming system with 1 hand control .
There are 5 games with it .
They are , Family & Fitness Stadium Events in the original box with the dust jacket inside of the box , Major League Baseball in the original box with the dust jacket inside of the box , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 the arcade game in the original box with the dust jacket inside of the box , Super Mario 3 in the original box with the dust jacket inside of the box and the original game , Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt .
I have had this stored in the closet for years for my kids to play but the way that electronics come & go and change from one year to the next they wanted all of the new hot items of their own now and now it 's time to get rid of things that are no longer being used or wanted .
This system worked perfect when i stored it but somehow over the years , we have managed to misplace the AC cord & the television hook up .
I am listing this and selling without hook up but it I find them , i'll send them along with the rest at no additional charges to you .
Please keep in mind though that any ac cord will work with this and the hook up from a VCR would hook it up just as well as the original cords !

Guyana and Norway yesterday hailed a historic agreement that will see the Scandinavian country invest $ 250 m ( £ 150 m ) to preserve the rainforests of the Latin America nation .
With world leaders warning that no legally binding agreement will be possible at the climate summit in Copenhagen next month , the two comparative minnows completed one of the biggest forest conservation deals ever signed .
Both sides signalled their intention to " provide the world with a working example of how partnerships between developed and developing countries can save the world 's tropical forests , " they said in a joint statement .
The former British colony , sandwiched between Venezuela and Brazil , is home to fewer than a million people but it also boasts an intact rainforest larger than England .
In 2007 Guyana 's president Bharrat Jagdeo made an unprecedented offer to to place its entire standing forest under the control of a British - led international body in return for a bilateral deal with the UK to secure development aid and the technical assistance needed to switch to a low carbon economy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Despite a number of false starts and assurances that it was considering the offer – first publicised in The Independent – Downing Street failed to make any concrete progress , leaving the way clear for oil - rich Norway to seize the opportunity .
Speaking yesterday during a visit to London , President Jagdeo said that public pressure was vital on rich , polluting countries to " help progressive politicians to deliver results on climate change " .
While avoiding criticism of the UK government , the Guyanese leader thanked those who had brought the country 's rainforest offer into the international arena .
" The Independent was key to getting our original message to the public , and this kind of campaigning journalism will be vital in the years to come , " he said .
Countries like Guyana , whose capital Georgetown is extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels , have contributed next to nothing to the heat - trapping gases in the atmosphere that cause global warming .
Yet they will be among the first victims of a changed climate and have been seeking ways to preserve the vast carbon sinks of their tropical forest without sacrifcing development in a country where many live in abject poverty .
Under the terms of the agreement with Norway , Guyana will accelerate its efforts to limit forest - based greenhouse gas emissions and protect its rainforest as an asset for the world .
Norway will provide financial support of up to $ 250 m over five years in line with the Jagdeo administration 's success in implementing limiting emissions and halting deforestation .
" Through this partnership , we are building a bridge between developed and developing countries , " said Norway 's Minister of the Environment and International Development Erik Solheim .
" We are giving the world a workable model for climate change collaboration between North and South .
It 's not perfect , but it 's good , and it will be improved upon as we learn and develop together . "
The accelerating destruction of the rainforests that form a cooling band around the earth 's equator is recognised as one the main causes of climate change .
Tropical deforestation accounts for one - fifth of all carbon emissions , more than the entire transport sector – including the aviation industry .
The landmark Stern Review concluded that forests offer the single largest chance for cost - effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions .

We all know Alexander Graham Bell ( known as AGB in the Deaf community ) as the inventor of the telephone .
That makes him a good guy , right ?
Creating a way for man to effectively communicate across long distances ?
Not so much .
Bell was an innovator and educator .
However , he was also an oppressor , and this side of him is n’t usually discussed .
His Helpful Side
Alexander Graham Bell ’s “ helpful side ” is what is usually written in his biographies .
He was born in Edinburgh , Scotland in 1847 .
Ever since he was young , he always had an interest in hearing and speech .
Alexander Melville Bell , his father , was the creator of a series of symbols that that showed speech - the position and movement of the lips , throat , and tongue when making sounds .
This was called “ Visible Speech ” and was used to teach deaf people how to speak .
Bell helped his father with public demonstrations of Visible Speech in 1862 until 1869 when he became his father ’s partner .
Bell had been experimenting with acoustics and wanted to find a way to improve the telegraph so that it can transmit sounds .
Many inventors before Bell had unsuccessfully attempted this .
In 1870 , Bell ’s brothers died of tuberculosis , and his family moved to Brantford , Ontario , Canada .
In Boston , he opened a school for teachers of the deaf in 1872 .
During his work there , he became friends with attorney Gardiner Green Hubbard .
Hubbard ’s daughter , Mabel , had been struck with scarlet fever as a child and became deaf .
Bell began to write specifications to patent a device that could carry speech by wire .
This was the telephone .
He was issued the patent for the telephone on March 7 , 1876 .
He transmitted speech successfully for the first time only three days later .
He married Mabel Hubbard the same year .
Bell founded the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf in 1890 .
This is now known as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf .
Bell died in 1922 at the age of seventy - five .
His Harmful Side
Alexander Graham Bell ’s “ harmful side ” is very surprising , but is not usually discussed .
First , while Bell was the first to patent the telephone , he was not the first to come up with the idea for the telephone .
There is a lot of controversy around who actually invented the first telephone .
Some even say that Bell stole the idea from Elisha Gray , who was a professor at Oberlin College , and beat him to the patent office .
But even worse – Bell believed that deafness was a horrible curse to the person who suffered from it .
That is a pretty awful thing to think , and for someone with so much influence , a terrible thought to spread .
There are several reasons why Bell would have this thought about deafness .
One is that he grew up with a value for speech , and as an educator of the deaf , he saw how difficult it is for a deaf child to acquire knowledge through spoken and written language .
He also did not come in contact with those Deaf people who were part of the Deaf community and who had successfully found happiness within it .
So , therefore , without this exposure , it ’s not hard to see how Bell would have seen deafness as only a handicap .
However , Bell also saw deafness as a threat to the social order .
He thought that deaf people weakened society .
In the 1880s , when Bell was rather wealthy and had a lot of time on his hands , he became worried about the numbers of deaf people in America and how they were increasing .
He thought this was weakening the country and was determined to find a way to stop it .
Because deafness seemed as though it were incurable , Bell wanted to find a way to prevent the birth of deaf children .
He examined data from many American schools for the deaf and wrote a paper entitled Memoir upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race .
Bell read his paper at the American Academy of Sciences at New Haven , Connecticut in 1883 .
Then , in 1884 , he read it to the Conference of Principals of American Schools for the Deaf .
Bell ’s thought and conclusions were shocking .
To justify his findings , he documented three significant facts about deaf Americans :
The tendency of deaf people to marry other deaf people
The numbers of deaf people marrying other deaf people increased during the nineteenth century
This increase would continue into the future unless drastic steps are taken to stop it
Bell stated that this tendency of deaf people marrying deaf people would eventually lead to a creation of a deaf race and “ would be a great calamity to the world . ”
His reasons for the tendency of deaf people marrying other deaf people were as follows :
Residential schools for the deaf deaf associations and organizations deaf newspapers education in sign language writing in sign language erroneous ideas about deaf people deaf people ’s desire to create a deaf state
Numbers 5 - 7 were of no importance and made no sense .
Sign language writing does n’t really exist , his erroneous ideas were that deaf people could not be taught to speak well enough to carry a conversation , and a deaf state would never be established because of lack of support for the deaf community .
His first four reasons , though , were very valid and true .
If he successfully eliminated these things , the American deaf community would be non-existent .
And that is what he wanted to do .
Without the cultural links and socializations of deaf people , they would be isolated and more integrated into the hearing society .
Bell had two ideas for keeping deaf people from marrying .
One was to enact laws that would forbid the congenitally deaf people from intermarrying .
This , however , Bell though , would lead to immoral actions and illegitimate children .
It is also difficult to tell when a deaf person became deaf .
His second idea was to eliminate residential schools , prohibit sign language use in deaf education , and forbid deaf teachers from teaching deaf students .
Bell thought these measures would encourage deaf people to use their oral skills and become more integrated into the hearing society .
These measures could be “ hidden ” and seen as education reforms .
Bell ’s thoughts and findings did not lead to the end of deaf marriage , but it did instill fear and anger in many deaf people and spark debates .
To gain support , Bell printed his Memoir and sent it to members of Congress , the principals of schools for the deaf , and other people involved in deaf education .
They were not impressed .
The truth came out .
Those involved in deaf education knew that most of their students had hearing parents .
Deaf children are rarely born to deaf parents .
Bell wanted to take away everything Deaf people had - their schools , their organizations , their newspapers , and even their language .
Thankfully , he was unsuccessful .
Deaf people are still people .
There is nothing wrong with them , and they most definitely do not pose a threat to the human race .
This information may come as a shock to you , and it should .
There are two sides to every story , and this is one side that most people do not know about - Bell and his fight for eugenics against the deaf .
Were Alexander Graham Bell ’s contributions to society more helpful or harmful ?

Who is your favorite person from Deaf history ?
Alexander Graham Bell
by Erika ( Salt Lake City , Utah ) | February 2 , 2014
My favorite person from Deaf History is Alexander Graham Bell because he gave the deaf population something to fight for .
Every story needs a great villain and quite often the villain does not seem so villainous on the surface .
Every great story where good triumphs over evil the villain makes the hero stand up and fight for something , anything .
While I will readily admit that Bell was most likely a villain out of ignorance he was still a villain nonetheless .
The push he made to force oralism gave the deaf community a reason to remember how proud they were of a language they had created .
Had Bell not pushed for oralism it is quite possible that ASL would never have seen the realization that it has today .
Now recognized as its own language and taught in most colleges , including hearing schools , ASL has become a force to be reckoned with .
It is always nice to see a group stand together to defend something they are proud of .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Kathleen Sweeney | December 7 , 2016
My favorite contributor to the deaf community is Alexander Graham Bell .
Bell ’s work was highly influenced by his wife and mother being deaf .
He is most known for his invention of the telephone .
Bell ’s central interest lied in deaf education and teaching .
His father was a researcher of speech and he too took interest in the physiology of speech .
Bell utilized his fathers method called “ visible speech ” to teach deaf students .
Bell also published a paper analyzing the culture of the deaf community .
He expressed that deaf people often socialized together , within the community .
He was an extreme supporter of oralism and believed the speech was the superior way for dead individuals to thrive .
Later on , Graham expressed the universal language for the deaf community was established and should be recognized .
Later on the use of sign in the classroom became more prevalent and was known as the “ natural language ” for individuals who are deaf .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Audrey Jacobs | January 11 , 2017
Alexander Graham Bell was an educator , a scientist and an inventor during the late 1800s and early 1900s .
Born in Edinburgh Scotland , on March third , 1847 , he did all his studies in Europe going to a private high school , Edinburgh Royal High School .
His first portion of college was at Edinburgh University , later transferring to The University of London , where he completed his studies in visible speech .
His father and grandfather both studied communication for the deaf , his mother was almost completely deaf , this rooted his inspiration to find forms of speech .
Shortly after establishing a practice in London , his two brothers became sick with tuberculosis and the whole family moved to America to become healthier .
Though he was n’t happy about his transportation , he continued studying the human voice .
In 1871 , he started working on telegraph transmissions for several messages using different frequencies on wires .
He later gained support from people who found promises in his products to fund his experiments .
Thomas Sanders was a wealthy businessman and also offered Bell a place to stay , and Gardiner Hubbard was an American lawyer , financier , and philanthropist .
After many failed attempts in 1876 , he succeeded and invents the first telephone .
This was n’t his first invention , from the time he was twelve , while working the the wheat factory he invented a way to use paddles to turn over the grains .
When he was sixteen , he started working with his dad and sparked his interest in deaf communications .
After furthering his inventions he went back to his original passion of helping the deaf .
He pushed towards Oralism , where the deaf learn to speak instead or Manualism , that supports the use of ASL .
In 1890 , where he established the American Association to promote the teaching of speech to the deaf .
He believed that oral education would decrease deaf marriages , decreasing the possibility for deaf children .
Increase the opportunity for the deaf community for education and employment .
My Least Favorite
by Dianna Hudson ( Ohio ) | March 8 , 2013
I have to say the Alexander Graham Bell is my least favorite historical figure in the Deaf community .
I saw details of his work in the documentary film , “ Through Deaf Eyes ” .
It also stated that he did n’t feel deaf people should marry another deaf person , as this may produce a deaf child and he was against that .
I do n’t know how he could take this form of thought , I believe his mother and / or wife were deaf as well .
I do n’t agree with the oralism argument in educating the Deaf , and I think it hinders and is a waste of time more than it helps .
Abbe de ‘ Epee is a favorite for taking the time to learn to communicate with the deaf to teach them .
Last but not least would have to be Heather Whitestone .
I think I remember when she won the pageant , and I think that she made a positive influence in the history of the Deaf and the history of America as a whole .
William Stokoe is another one you have to love .
I wonder if he had any idea what his dissertation would do for the Deaf community .
I think ASL is a beautiful language .
I ’m so glad that it has successfully evolved for the Deaf culture , and I appreciate each and every person who has a positive influence in Deaf history , giving the Deaf something to be proud of .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Jamie Saults | May 18 , 2016
I am writing about Alexander Graham Bell because I thought it interesting that he fought so hard for the deaf community and even married a deaf person , yet also thought that deaf people weakened society .
His beliefs led to a debate in the form of communication used by the deaf and to a ban on the use of ASL that lasted for one hundred years .
Bell had had an interest in hearing and speech since he was a young boy .
He had been exposed to the deaf community through his parents .
His mother was deaf and his father had created the symbols for visible speech , which was used to teach deaf people how to speak .
Years later , Bell opened for a school for teachers of the deaf in Boston .
His associations there , including meeting his wife , compelled him to begin his work on the telephone .
He founded the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf in 1890 .
This is now known as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf .
It is believed that Bell thought deaf people posed a threat to the social order .
As a result , he tried to find a way to prevent the birth of deaf children .
He also wanted to stop American Sign Language as the means of communication for the deaf and instead use oralism because he thought it would be a better way of communication for the deaf to assimilate into mainstream society .
His influence against manualism or ASL led to a century long ban of ASL in schools .
The debate of manualism vs. oralism exists today , but fortunately ASL is no longer banned .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Hanna England | September 15 , 2016
My favorite person from Deaf History is Alexander Graham Bell .
Graham was born on March 3 , 1847 , and later died on August 2 , of 1922 .
Although Bell is mainly known for his invention of the telephone , he also is known as the father of oralism in Deaf history .
Alexander grew up with a deaf mother , and a father who was centered on deaf education .
His father developed an alphabet known as the “ Visible Speech . ”
Bell ’s main interest in his life was deaf education .
For most of his life , Alexander studied the physiology of speech .
Later on , Bell started teaching the alphabet , invented by his father , to deaf students .
He then opened a school that would educate teachers on how to teach deaf children .
Years later in 1884 , “ Upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race ” was put into the world , it was about how the deaf community was rising .
They were becoming a society of their own , they were communicating with each other and socializing with each other .
As Brain Greenwald stated , “ Society in general views Alexander Graham Bell as an American hero , as the inventor of the telephone .
He was famous , wealthy , and influential .
His own Mother was deaf .
He was always associating with the Deaf community and he was a teacher of deaf children .
He had his own day school in Boston .
He was very familiar with the Deaf world . ”
Alexander Graham bell was most importantly known as the inventor of the telephone , however being less known for aiding the deaf community , which was also one of his main accomplishments .
Bell was a strong influence on the deaf community .
Alexander Graham Bell a Villain ?
by Christi ( Charleston , WV ) | November 21 , 2011
Your history of sign language article was very interesting to read .
I would have to say my favorite person is Abbe de L’Epee .
In reading his story I can see that he truly was a follower of Christ .
Christ is our example and Christ became a servant to mankind and gave his life that we could be saved .
Abbe de L’Epee must have truly sacrificed his life in order to accomplish all that he did for the deaf .
He became a servant to the deaf .
His life would be a good example to anyone that feels a call to deaf ministry .
I somewhat disagree with your statements regarding Alexander Graham Bell .
Perhaps it is my positive attitude but to say he really tried to damage the lives of deaf people is a bit slanderous .
Surely he must have thought he was doing something good for the deaf .
Mr. Bell did not have a clear understanding of the deaf which can easily happen when you are outside looking in .
That is why deaf people need deaf representatives or at the very least a hearing person that will truly “ hear ” them .
Also , to say oralism is wrong for all deaf people is a very broad statement .
Some very successful deaf people have used oralism which probably somewhat contributed to their success .
Although I would imagine learning with the oralism method would be very difficult for a deaf person .
If I had a deaf child I would want them to have every access to education possible and considering that they are in a hearing world that speaks English ( if you live in America ) any method that would allow them to understand the English language would be beneficial .
I do agree however that to deny the deaf the use of sign language is tragic .
ASL is a beautiful language and a very efficient means of communication .
I really enjoyed the article and the chance to share my opinion .
This is just my opinion from the outside looking into a fascinating culture .
Comments :
by Anonymous : I looked the definition for an “ Audist ” and I was disappointed to hear the negativity about deafness .
I totally agree that if a person can be helped in oralism that they should go for it .
But at the same time those who are deaf should be given credit for what they have accomplished .
Being deaf in a hearing world is difficult as it is .
That is why I am all for total communication which includes oral and sign language .
With the high rate of hearing loss and the high cost of hearing aids is it any wonder that people are perplexed about which way to go .
With the large number of those who have hearing loss that are not getting much benefit from hearing aids , sign language goes a long way in helping to improve one ’s lifestyle .
In many schools , learning a second language is mandatory .
Why not let sign language be that second language ?
Sign language can be taught to those who are still in the cradle .
We need to face up to the fact that this world in in need of Sign Language Interpreters .
What better way to begin than right at the cradle .
by Michelle Jay :
Thank you for your great submission !
I really enjoyed reading it .
I just wanted to clear up a couple things :
1. Did you read the article on Alexander Graham Bell ?
You can access it here : https://www.startasl.com/alexander-graham-bell.
I suggest reading that article .
It explains what he did and even acknowledges what you said about him being on the outside looking in .
2 . The article does n’t say oralism is wrong for all deaf people .
You ’re right , that would be incorrect .
The article states , “ [ The NAD ] gained a lot of support and maintained the use of sign language as they argued that oralism is n’t the right educational choice for all deaf people . ”
This is saying that oralism is n’t right for ALL deaf people – which is what oralism supporters believed .
However , it may be the right choice for some .
I guess the English could be a little more clear .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Anonymous
He is not my favorite .
He is the one most interesting to me .
He is interesting because he had a deaf parent , married a deaf individual , and had deaf children yet he was so against the development of the deaf community .
I often wonder why he spent his whole life fighting to get rid of something that was a part of his life –his whole life .
My theory is , with his invention of the phone , and him growing up among deaf individuals , he feared the hearing community would become extinct and his invention of the phone would become useless .
Regardless of the negative approach towards the deaf community , his negative behavior turned out to be positive overall .
The deaf community now teaches oralism and ASL .
The deaf community now has the NAD .
The deaf community now has TTY or video phones and much more .
On top of that the deaf community now has on record a foundation to learn and continue to grow from .
There is a saying in a rap song I love : “ let ya haterz be your motivators . ”
That ’s exactly what the deaf community has done and continues to do .
Alexander Graham Bell
by Heather ( Liberty , MO , USA )
I know that Alexander Graham Bell is a very controversial figure in Deaf culture , understandably .
I can also see how his invention isolated an already oppressed people group –the entire deaf community for many years .
However , I think it is amazing how his invention has come full - circle .
Without the invention of the telephone , we would have no telephone .
With no telephone , there would be no texting .
Both of which are vital in connecting the Deaf community with the others , both hearing and non-hearing .
I must admit , that the article on Alexander Graham Bell was one of the first I have read that described him as a foe .
This is also the first time I have heard it posed that he intentionally tried to damage the lives of Deaf people .
While , I intend to investigate this further , I am baffled that he would be seen so villainously despite the fact that he was married to a deaf woman .
Certainly , it is not assumed that he was preventing her from marrying another deaf person and bringing deaf children into the world ?
One would have to be quite cynical to believe that he did not want what was best for her , albeit as misguided as it was .
As I said , I need to do more research .
However , I am delighted that the Deaf community has so much access to information and online community through the internet and texting … which is also giving me , and others like me , that chance to study ASL and better communicate with the deaf .
Mabel Gardiner Hubbard Bell
by Alan ( Sodus , New York )
Yes , Bell – the deaf wife of Alexander Graham Bell .
She met “ Alec ” as a 15 year old medically deaf student in his oralism school .
And the story begins in Make a Joyful Sound , the authorized biography of Mabel and Alec by Helen Elmira Waite .
I fear this history has painted Mr. Bell with a biased brush .
One of the most influential books I have ever read ; it drove me to his museum in Baddeck , Nova Scotia on two separate trips .
Mr. Bell connected Anne Sullivan with Helen Keller .
He , and others were pioneers of ‘ sound ’ research and the book tells this story .
This is a wonderful love story and a biography of the lives of both Mabel and Alexander .
Their children , Elsie May and Marian and their grandchildren were also very accomplished members of society .
Gilbert Grosvenor married Elsie May and started the National Geographic Society .
Graham Bell personally taught Mabel to lip read and to refine her speech so no one could tell that she was totally deaf .
As a ‘ test ’ of his oralism method he invited her to a formal society party with his critics and his friends ( none of whom knew she was deaf ) .
I wo n’t ruin it for you to read – you can guess , she stole his heart .
I hope you can find this old book .

Oh the Ringing Irony
by Rebeca ( Redding , California )
I do not find Alexander Graham Bell to be inspirational or admirable in this case , and yet I must say he is my favorite historical figure .
Mr. Bell ’s futile attempts to make the deaf community conform was condescending and ignorant .
His interest in “ helping ” the deaf of his time was , in my opinion , “ phone-y ! ”
If he were alive today , he would have to eat his own telephone cord .
It ’s refreshing to see a useful invention morph into a useful tool for those who were wrongly oppressed for so many years .
I am referring to the IP ( relay phone ) .
Inventions are sometimes misused or turned into hurtful objects .
In this case , the telephone has become a supporter of sign language .
It is sweet victory for the deaf community and for all of us by extension !
What a shame it would have been if sign language would had been wiped out .
But , ring ring , hello ?
Sign language is one of those unique languages that is impossible to wipe out .
Even if Mr. Bell and his cohorts had succeeded to a certain degree at that time , sign language would have simply taken a slightly different route , but still would be alive and well today .
It ’s not like some of the ancient tribal languages that have died away never to be recovered .
For centuries , the deaf have communicated by signs .
How a man like Alexander Graham Bell , with all his intelligence and patience for such an intricate and delicate machine , could not understand the importance of sign language , is a mystery to me .
Much like my cell phone … ironic , is n’t it ?
The Robinsons have said they will try to save their marriage .
The wife of Northern Ireland 's first minister , Peter Robinson , has said she tried to kill herself while suffering depression after she had an affair .
Mr Robinson , leader of the DUP , said they would try to save their marriage .
Iris Robinson announced in December she was stepping down from politics due to ill health .
The couple were married in 1970 and have three grown - up children .
Mr Robinson who has been first minister since June 2008 , said he will continue in his job .
In an interview on Wednesday , he said he first learned of the affair on March 1 2009 , the night Mrs Robinson attempted suicide .
Mr Robinson , who appeared close to tears , said he had been " deeply hurt " and that his immediate impulse had been to walk away from the marriage .
' Ashamed '
However , he said he had set the affair against 40 years of a loving relationship and had forgiven his wife .
Mrs Robinson said in a statement that she was " completely ashamed and deeply embarrassed " by the affair which had " devastated " her life and the lives of those around her .
She said she began the brief affair while she was supporting a man who had suffered a bereavement .
She said she had also encouraged friends to help him by " providing financial support for a business venture . "
Mrs Robinson used the statement to publicly apologise to her husband , her wider family and friends .
She said she would " pay any price on earth " to take back the wrong she had done .
She added : " I do not deserve a second chance but I have been given one . "
Mrs Robinson said she believes she has been forgiven by God.

Mr Robinson insisted that the revelations would not undermine his role as first minister .
He said he would be back at work on Thursday morning , ready to meet the Sinn Fein deputy first minister , Martin McGuinness .
The development comes as the power sharing arrangements in Northern Ireland are under pressure in a dispute over the timing of devolution of policing and justice .
Financial Sinn Fein said the powers should be devolved immediately while the DUP say more must be done to build confidence among the unionist community before devolution happens .
During his interview Mr Robinson was also asked if his financial affairs were under investigation .
Nobody watching the interview by Peter could fail to be moved by the obvious hurt and pain being experienced by the Robinson family
Martin McGuinness
A long day
When the personal becomes political
In reply he said he had always acted " in the most professional and ethical way . "
He also confirmed he had received a letter from the BBC which he said contained no allegations against him but " asked questions which are easily answered . "
The BBC Spotlight programme has confirmed it has been investigating matters involving Iris Robinson for some time .
In a statement the BBC added that allegations have been put to the Robinsons and their response is awaited .
Reaction
In a statement on Wednesday evening , Mr McGuinness said he wished the Robinsons well .
He said : " Nobody watching the interview by Peter could fail to be moved by the obvious hurt and pain being experienced by the Robinson family .
" Despite Peter 's public role he is entitled to privacy as he and his family seek to deal with this matter .
I wish them well as they seek to rebuild relationships away from the public glare . "
And in a statement issued on behalf of the DUP , deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that supporters of the party were " deeply moved " by Mr Robinson 's interview .
He added : " On behalf of the members of the DUP , I want to extend to Peter and the Robinson family our heartfelt prayers and support at this incredibly difficult time .
" I know that rank - and - file members and supporters of our party , in common with the wider community in Northern Ireland have been deeply moved by Peter 's statement today .
He has demonstrated a level of bravery and courage that very few in public life possess .
" Peter Robinson 's contribution to the unionist resurgence in Northern Ireland over recent years has been immeasurable .
He is the undisputed leader of unionism and we all offer our full and total support at this time . "
Secretary of State Shaun Woodward said the Robinsons should be given space to deal with their issues .
He also welcomed Mr Robinson 's pledge to return to work .
" We have got to understand there is a need to distinguish between what is genuinely of public interest and what is interesting to the public , " he said .
" I think the public must respectfully decline any further interest because it 's none of their business .
" On public policy , I think people should welcome what the first minister has said and of course that continues the work that he has been doing with Martin McGuinness . "

8 Powerful Awk Built - in Variables – FS , OFS , RS , ORS , NR , NF , FILENAME , FNR
This article is part of the on - going Awk Tutorial Examples series .
Awk has several powerful built - in variables .
There are two types of built - in variables in Awk .
Variable which defines values which can be changed such as field separator and record separator .
Variable which can be used for processing and reports such as Number of records , number of fields .
1. Awk FS Example : Input field separator variable .
Awk reads and parses each line from input based on whitespace character by default and set the variables $ 1 , $ 2 and etc .
Awk FS variable is used to set the field separator for each record .
Awk FS can be set to any single character or regular expression .
You can use input field separator using one of the following two options :
Using -F command line option .
Awk FS can be set like normal variable .
Syntax : $ awk - F ' FS ' ' commands ' inputfilename ( or ) $ awk ' BEGIN{FS = " FS " ; } '
Awk FS is any single character or regular expression which you want to use as a input field separator .
is any single character or regular expression which you want to use as a input field separator .
Awk FS can be changed any number of times , it retains its values until it is explicitly changed .
If you want to change the field separator , its better to change before you read the line .
So that change affects the line what you read .
Here is an awk FS example to read the /etc / passwd file which has “ : ” as field delimiter .
$ cat etc_passwd.awk BEGIN { FS= " : " ; print " Name\tUserID\tGroupID\tHomeDirectory " ; } { print $ 1 " \t " $ 3 " \t " $ 4 " \t " $ 6 ; } END { print NR , " Records Processed " ; }
$ awk -f etc_passwd.awk /etc / passwd Name UserID GroupID HomeDirectory gnats 41 41 /var/lib/gnats libuuid 100 101 /var/lib/libuuid syslog 101 102 /home / syslog hplip 103 7 / var/run/hplip avahi 105 111 /var/run/avahi-daemon saned 110 116 /home / saned pulse 111 117 / var/run/ pulse gdm 112 119 /var/lib/gdm 8 Records Processed
2. Awk OFS Example : Output Field Separator Variable
Awk OFS is an output equivalent of awk FS variable .
By default awk OFS is a single space character .
Following is an awk OFS example .
$ awk - F ' :' '{ print $ 3, $ 4;} '
/etc / passwd 41 41 100 101 101 102 103 7 105 111 110 116 111 117 112 119
Concatenator in the print statement “ , ” concatenates two parameters with a space which is the value of awk OFS by default .
So , Awk OFS value will be inserted between fields in the output as shown below .
$ awk - F ' :' ' BEGIN{OFS= " = " ;} {print $ 3 , $ 4;} '
/etc / passwd 41=41 100=101 101=102 103=7 105=111 110=116 111=117 112=119
3. Awk RS Example : Record Separator variable
Awk RS defines a line .
Awk reads line by line by default .
Let us take students marks are stored in a file , each records are separated by double new line , and each fields are separated by a new line character .
$ cat student.
txt Jones 2143 78 84 77 Gondrol 2321 56 58 45 RinRao 2122 38 37 65 Edwin 2537 78 67 45 Dayan 2415 30 47 20
Now the below Awk script prints the Student name and Rollno from the above input file .
$ cat student.awk BEGIN { RS = "
" ; FS = "
" ; } { print $ 1 , $ 2 ; } $ awk -f student .
awk student.
txt Jones 2143 Gondrol 2321 RinRao 2122 Edwin 2537 Dayan 2415
In the script student . awk , it reads each student detail as a single record , because awk RS has been assigned to double new line character and each line in a record is a field , since FS is newline character .
4. Awk ORS Example : Output Record Separator Variable
Awk ORS is an Output equivalent of RS .
Each record in the output will be printed with this delimiter .
Following is an awk ORS example :
$ awk ' BEGIN {ORS= " = " ; } { print ; } ' student - marks Jones 2143 78 84 77 =Gondrol 2321 56 58 45=RinRao 2122 38 37 65 =Edwin 2537 78 67 45 =Dayan 2415 30 47 20 =
In the above script , each records in the file student - marks file is delimited by the character “ = ” .
5. Awk NR Example : Number of Records Variable
Awk NR gives you the total number of records being processed or line number .
In the following awk NR example , NR variable has line number , in the END section awk NR tells you the total number of records in a file .
$ awk '{print " Processing Record - " , NR;}END {print NR , " Students Records are processed " ; } ' student - marks Processing Record - 1 Processing Record - 2 Processing Record - 3 Processing Record - 4 Processing Record - 5 5 Students Records are processed
6. Awk NF Example : Number of Fields in a record
Awk NF gives you the total number of fields in a record .
Awk NF will be very useful for validating whether all the fields are exist in a record .
Let us take in the student - marks file , Test3 score is missing for to students as shown below .
$ cat student - marks Jones 2143 78 84 77 Gondrol 2321 56 58 45 RinRao 2122 38 37 Edwin 2537 78 67 45 Dayan 2415 30 47
The following Awk script , prints Record ( line ) number , and number of fields in that record .
So
It will be very simple to find out that Test3 score is missing .
$ awk ' {print NR , " -> " , NF} ' student - marks 1 -> 5 2 -> 5 3 -> 4 4 -> 5 5 -> 4
7. Awk FILENAME
Example : Name of the current input file
FILENAME variable gives the name of the file being read .
Awk can accept number of input files to process .
$ awk '{print FILENAME} ' student - marks student - marks student - marks student - marks student - marks student - marks
In the above example , it prints the FILENAME i.e student - marks for each record of the input file .
8. Awk FNR Example : Number of Records relative to the current input file
When awk reads from the multiple input file , awk NR variable will give the total number of records relative to all the input file .
Awk FNR will give you number of records for each input file .
$ awk '{print FILENAME , FNR ;} ' student - marks bookdetails student - marks 1 student - marks 2 student - marks 3 student - marks 4 student - marks 5 bookdetails 1 bookdetails 2 bookdetails 3 bookdetails 4 bookdetails 5
In the above example , instead of awk FNR , if you use awk NR , for the file bookdetails the you will get from 6 to 10 for each record .

Derfor stilte curlingstjernen opp i trusa
( VG Nett ) Danske Madeleine Dupont ( 22 ) kastet klærne før OL for å reklamere for curlingsporten .
Det angrer hun ikke på .

- Hvis et bilde av meg i truse kan få flere til å se på oss på tv , er det bra , sier Madeleine Dupont ( 22 ) Aftonbladet .
I forkant av OL ga Det europeiske curlingforbundet ( ECF ) ut en kalender med 26 mer eller mindre avkledde curlingkvinner for å promotere sporten sin .
Samleside : Alt om OL i Vancouver
Den danske OL - deltageren Madeleine Dupont er en av jentene som stiller opp i kalenderen , som VG Nett omtalte tidligere i vinter .
På bildet har hun kastet alle klærne unntatt en rosa truse , og hun viser usjenert frem det ene brystet .
- Pengene går til en god sak og om folk ser på curling på grunn av bildene av meg , er det bare positivt , slår hun fast .
Dupont er kalenderens « Miss January » , men sier at man neppe kommer til å få se flere slike bilder av henne i fremtiden .
- Ikke regn med å se meg på fronten av et herreblad .
Det er ikke noe jeg en gang ville vurdert .
Og en modellkarriere er også helt utenkelig .
Jeg har rett og slett ikke utseendet til det , sier 22 - åringen .
I går hadde curlingspilleren vesentlig mer klær på seg da hun og resten av Danmarks OL - lag spilte og tapte 6 - 5 mot Sverige i Vancouver .
- Det føltes som om vi hadde kontroll .
Men dette er curling .
Det er små marginer , sier Dupont .
Også de norske curlingherrene har fått mye oppmerksomhet på grunn av klesvalget , men i motsetning til Madeleine Dupont er det hva de har tatt på seg og ikke av seg , som er i fokus .
Curlingherrene har ikledd seg de samme « klovnebuksene » som den skandaleomsuste og fargerike golfspilleren John Daly tidligere har stilt opp i .
PS !
De norske herrene spilte sine to første kamper i OL i går kveld og i natt , norsk tid .
Mot Canada ble det et knepent tap , men USA ble slått i en ny thriller .

What They 're Really Saying When They 're Saying What They 're Saying
Lest you think we ’re all - iPad all - the - time here , allow us to bring you news about Apple ’s last revolutionary device .
On Tuesday , the company released iPhone OS 3.1.3 , which includes a few minor improvements , security patches , and bug fixes for the iPhone and iPod touch .
The update is available via iTunes when you plug in your device .
Among the embarrassment of riches that iPhone OS 3.1.3 brings is better accuracy for the battery level on the iPhone 3GS , a problem where third - party programs would sometimes not launch , and a bug that could cause an application to crash when using the Japanese Kana keyboard .
There are also a few security patches in the release , such as a CoreAudio fix to guard against maliciously crafted MP4 files , an ImageIO patch that similarly protects against malicious crafted TIFF images , improved handling in certain USB control messages to prevent someone with physical access to the phone from accessing private data using the device 's recovery mode , and a pair of patches for WebKit that deal with HTML Mail messages and maliciously crafted FTP servers .
As always , Apple ’s use of full disk images for iPhone OS updates means you ’ll have to download a big ol ’ 291 MB file .
It ’s worth noting — and I apologize in advance for bringing the dreaded iPad into this story — that Apple ’s newest device is currently running iPhone OS 3.2 , and that the iPad SDK recently released to developers does not run on the iPhone .
So , if you ’re looking for conspiracy theories , there ’s your opening .
Digging the Scorched Earth by Heather Pringle
Archaeologists reveal the legacy of brutal Civil War tactics in Missouri
Sometime between four and five o'clock on the morning of August 21 , 1863 , a sandy - haired Confederate officer , William Clarke Quantrill , led 450 heavily armed men through the streets of Lawrence , Kansas , an abolitionist stronghold .
Quantrill and his raiders headed straight for the center of town , with revolvers and rifles in hand .
They rousted all males capable of carrying a gun and shot them in the streets .
As the women wept and pleaded , Quantrill 's men plundered homes , forced merchants to open safes , and set fire to Lawrence 's finest houses and buildings .
Four hours later , they rode out of town , their horses festooned with fine silk dresses and other loot .
Some 150 men and boys lay dead .
This metal wedge , found in the burned remains of a home , was part of an 1850s or ' 60s Colt - pattern revolver , the type used during the Civil War. ( Courtesy Ann Raab )
Excavators in Bates County , Missouri , uncover a stone pier that was part of a house foundation .
Archaeologist Anne Raab believes the house was razed by Union troops in 1863 .
( Courtesy Ann Raab )
The commanding officer of Union forces in the region , General Thomas Ewing , Jr. , received the news at his Kansas City , Missouri , headquarters .
He immediately resolved to fight fire with fire .
To deprive Quantrill 's guerillas of food and shelter , Ewing -- the foster brother of General William Tecumseh Sherman , who brought scorched - earth warfare to Georgia a year later - - ordered the mass deportation of all Confederate sympathizers from the better part of four Missouri counties along the Kansas border .
Then he selected a detachment of troops , many of them from Kansas , to carry it out .
Burning for revenge , the men interpreted General Order No. 11 as a scorched - earth policy .
They expelled under threat of death Union and Confederate supporters alike from the region , shot male resisters , and reportedly burned all houses , shops , and farm buildings to the ground .
When the soldiers were finished , Bates County , the epicenter of the violence , had become , in the words of one local historian , " a tenantless wilderness ... the haunt of wolves , dogs , and an occasional outlaw seeking refuge . "
The story of how the Union Army reduced nearly 2,500 square miles of Missouri --a Union state -- to a wasteland known simply as " the burnt district " has been largely forgotten .
Few of the 20,000 people who were deported left written accounts of their experiences , but a new archaeological project in Missouri is uncovering this long - lost history .
Over the past three years , a team led by Ann Raab , a PhD student at the University of Kansas in Lawrence , has excavated two major sites in Bates County where buildings were obliterated during the expulsion .
Amassing both archaeological and historical evidence , Raab is now analyzing the detritus of war -- from scorched ceramics to charred building foundations -- and documenting for the first time the tragic consequences of General Order No. 11 .
For the residents of Bates County , Raab 's work is focusing public attention on one of the darkest chapters of their past .
" When a place is completely destroyed and all the farms and towns burned , all you are left with are the stories , " says Peggy Buhr of the Bates County Historical Society and Museum in Butler , Missouri .
" And eventually the stories become folklore , a little like fishing stories .
What Ann 's project is doing is verifying our history . "

A woman can be seen on the deck of the QM2 , with the QE2 behind A trawlerman is trying to trace the owner of a digital camera after it was hauled from the Atlantic seabed in his nets with the photos still intact .
Benito Estevez believes the camera was dropped overboard from the QM2 cruise liner in the middle of the Atlantic .
The camera 's memory card revealed five photographs , including a woman posing on the deck of a ship , with the now out - of - service QE2 in the background .
Mr Estevez , of Spain , is now trying to trace the people in the pictures .
US tourists
The QE2 made its last ever voyage to Dubai in November 2008 .
BBC South Transport Correspondent Paul Clifton says the ship the woman is posing on is the QM2 , and the two liners sailed together from Southampton to New York in October 2008 .
The couple may have been US tourists returning home after visiting Britain
It was the QE2's last ever transatlantic round trip between the two cities .
Mr Estevez caught the camera in his nets off the west coast of Europe , so the camera was probably lost in the early days of the crossing .
It may be that the couple are from the US , as one picture shows a man wearing a woolly tourist hat from Oxford .
Cunard , the shipping company that owns the QM2 , said no - one had reported a lost camera and the firm had not been able to trace the people in the pictures .

Norman Eastwood was told to drive 105 miles home to get his passport A man has received an apology from the Home Office after his ID card was refused as he tried to board a ferry to Rotterdam .
Norman Eastwood , from Salford , and his wife Jeanette were planning to travel from Hull on P&O Ferries on Saturday .
The new ID card , introduced in Manchester , can be used instead of a passport across Europe - but the travel firm said it did not know this .
A Home Office spokesman said it " seems to be an isolated experience " .
P&O ferries added that from now on ID cards will be accepted .
Mr Eastwood , however , said he " felt like a second - class citizen " and it was " humiliating " when he was told that he could not board the ferry .
" My wife was devastated too , she was really looking forward to doing some Christmas shopping over in Rotterdam , it was meant to be a festive treat . "
Instead , the pair were left with no option but to turn around , abandon their plans and drive the 105 miles back to Greater Manchester .
We are speaking to P&O to understand why this happened and ensure that there can be no repeat of it
A spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) Mr Eastwood said : " When I approached check - in and flashed my ID card , the two girls on the desk looked at each other and said : ' We can't accept that ' .
" It was like they had never seen one before .
I saw a group of Dutch people using one , and I pointed at them and asked why were they being let through and why not me ?
" They just said you 're not allowed .
They even suggested I drive all the way back and pick up my passport , we did n't have time because the ferry was leaving in less than three hours . "
The Home Office has said they will refund him the travel costs and the price of the ferry tickets .
A spokesman for the Home Office 's Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) said : " We are sorry to hear of Mr Eastwood 's experience .
" People have made numerous journeys around Europe using their identity cards and this seems to be an isolated incident .
" We have a standard and well established process for informing border agencies and carriers around the world of any change to international travel documents , which we followed in this case .
" We have spoken to P&O and they were notified of the UK National Identity Card 's design and security features along with all international carriers in August and October . "

Torture is revolting .
A man can retain his human dignity in front of a firing squad or on the scaffold : not in a torture chamber .
Torturers set out to break their victim : to take a human being and reduce him to a whimpering wreck .
In so doing , they defile themselves and their society .
In Britain , torture has been illegal for more than 300 years .
Shortly after torture was abjured , we stopped executing witches : all part of a move away from medieval legal mores and their replacement with the modern rule of law .
Until recently , at least in the UK , torture and witch - finding appeared to be safely immured in a museum of ancient atrocities .
Yet men can not live like angels .
However repugnant we may find torture , there are worse horrors , such as the nuclear devastation of central London , killing hundreds of thousands of people and inflicting irreparable damage on mankind 's cultural heritage .
We also face new and terrible dangers .
In the past , the threat came from other states .
If they struck at us , we knew where to strike back .
Now , we can almost feel nostalgic for mutually assured destruction .
In the Islamic world , a religious revival is taking place , analogous to the Reformation and Counter - Reformation .
In that era , there was no shortage of volunteers for martyrdom .
Today , failed states produce hate - filled young men , who appear to believe that Allah smiles on the suicide bomber .
If you are going to destroy yourself , why not inflict maximum damage upon the enemy ?
Admittedly , there is no evidence that the terrorists are in a position to produce dirty bombs yet , let alone fully nuclear devices .
But we know one thing about technology .
It spreads .
Difficult processes become easier .
Today 's remote possibility becomes tomorrow 's imminent danger .
There have been frequent objections to the use of the term " war on terror " .
None has been cogent .
All of them give the impression that those who object to the phrase do not want to face the reality .
It is a reality .
For the foreseeable future , we will be engaged in such a war .
It is unlike any other conflict we have ever faced , for there is no straightforward route to victory .
Nor is there a certainty of success .
In any war , there are two desiderata : appropriate strategies , and allies .
In this case , the principal strategic resource is self - evident : intelligence .
We have no easy way of establishing who the enemy is , where he will gather his forces or how he will strike at us .
We also have to deal with the enemy within .
All this requires an enormous intelligence effort .
As other countries are facing a similar threat , they will be making a similar effort .
It would be insane not to pool resources and share information .
We and the Americans have long - established methods of intelligence co-operation , which are now even more important than they were in the Cold War .
It also makes sense to work with other threatened nations , such as Pakistan , where a brave political elite is bearing a disproportionate burden , and receiving few thanks for doing so .
But there is a problem .
It seems likely that Pakistani interrogators use torture .
Although we find torture repulsive , it does not follow that those who are tasked with governing Pakistan could safely dispense with it .
Our enjoyment of Shakespeare and Elizabethan madrigals is not blighted by Walsingham 's rack - masters in the Tower of London .
We lament the premature death of Robert Southwell , but despite Tyburn and the rack , we would still speak of Elizabethan civilisation .
So let us be more generous to the Pakistani authorities .
Their difficulties are at least as great as those faced by Francis Walsingham and Robert Cecil in the 1590s .
Can we blame the Pakistanis for employing some 1590s methods ?
When our intelligence services were invited to share the harvest reaped by the Pakistanis , there appears to have been no hesitation .
Nor should there have been .
We needed the information .
Perhaps we should have offered the Pakistanis some advice on interrogation techniques which do not involve knife - work on suspects ' genitals .
It may be that we have indeed done so , in private .
But Pakistan is a sovereign state and an embattled ally ; a far more attractive state and a far less dubious ally than Russia was in the Second World War .
We should be grateful for the Pakistanis ' efforts on our behalf .
We should also be grateful to the Americans .
But we should insist , again in private , that if they did torture suspects , they were wrong to do so .
As they are in a stronger position than Pakistan , their interrogation doctrine should be strongly post - Walsingham .
Some of the problem may have arisen from Dick Cheney , arguably the most formidable Vice - President of all time .
Mr Cheney combines the neo- Conservatives ' moral certainties and the realpolitik school 's ruthlessness .
This means that he shoots with both barrels .
It also creates the risk of overkill .
Even so , there is one benefit from the Americans ' experiments with robust interrogation methods : water - boarding .
Christopher Hitchens wanted to demonstrate that it was absurd to demonise water - boarding and that it was only girlie - man 's torture .
So he subjected himself to it .
He cried off after seven seconds .
That is comforting , and not only to Mr Hitchens 's critics .
Thus far , there has been no need for either the UK or the US to consider torture , because neither of us has been confronted by a ticking bomb .
As a result of the Hitchens trial run , we know that we have something which could work .
That might sound frivolous .
But there would be nothing frivolous about a ticking bomb .
Cobra , the Cabinet 's emergency committee , is in permanent session somewhere under Whitehall : the intelligence chiefs , grey and drawn from lack of sleep , inform the Prime Minister , ditto , that it seems almost certain that a nuclear device is primed to explode in the next few hours .
There is a man in custody who probably knows where it is .
They are ready to use whatever methods are necessary to extract the information ...
Before 9/11 , in front of some serious lawyers , I once argued that if there were a ticking bomb , the Government would not only have a right to use torture .
It would have a duty to use torture .
Up sprang Sydney Kentridge , one of the great liberals of our age and a fearless defender of unpopular causes , from Nelson Mandela in the old South Africa to fox - hunting in modern Britain .
I prepared to receive incoming fire .
It came , in the form of a devilish intellectual challenge .
" Let 's take your hypothesis a bit further .
We have captured a terrorist , but he is a hardened character .
We can not be certain that he will crack in time .
We have also captured his wife and children " .
After much agonising , I have come to the conclusion that there is only one answer to Sydney 's question .
Torture the wife and children .
It is a disgusting idea .
It is almost a tragedy that we even have to discuss it , let alone think of acting upon it .
But there is nothing to be gained from refusing to face facts , in the way that the Master of the Rolls , Lord Neuburger , did last week .
His Lordship wrapped himself in a cloak of self - righteousness , traduced an entire security service , showed no understanding of the courage which its officers routinely display : no understanding , indeed , of anything beyond courtroom niceties .
Ida Hammer has been writing The Vegan Ideal for several years as a way to examine and deconstruct overlapping oppressions .
Her work centers on undoing transphobia in vegetarian and ecofeminist communities .
Ida was kind of enough to speak with me recently about how cissexual privilege undermines a lot of ecofeminist writing and how she has carved safe space for herself in a sometimes very anti-trans movement .
A number of ecofeminist writers have written in deeply offensive , often terribly misguided , ways about trans people and have done a lot of damage to the movement 's credibility as open , accepting , and working for the liberation of all people .
Why do you think transphobia persists and continues to come up again and again in ecofeminist rhetoric and activism ?
In order to understand why transphobia and cissexism persist and are continually perpetuated throughout feminist communities , particularly the vegetarian - ecofeminist community , it is important to consider the origins of anti-trans advocacy as a conscious project of prominent , elite White feminists in the 1970s .
In the late sixties and early seventies , trans people were very active in the women 's and queer liberation movements .
The Compton 's Cafeteria and Stonewall rebellions of the sixties are evidence of that , as are women like Beth Elliot of the Daughters of Bilitis , Sandy Stone of Olivia Records , and Stonewall veteran Silvia Rivera who was a founding member of the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance .
So it 's important to keep in mind that trans women , and trans people more generally , were an integral part of the early women 's liberation movement .
But in the mid- to late - seventies , there was a transphobic backlash within feminism to systematically remove and exclude trans people , explicitly transsexual women , from the women 's and queer movements .
For example , Rivera was targeted and physically attacked by cissexist women separatists at a gay rights rally .
Elliot was targeted by Robin Morgan and separatists at a lesbian women 's conference .
Stone was targeted by Janice Raymond and forced out of Olivia Records with threats of a boycott .
And Gloria Steinem of Ms. magazine openly attacked trans women .
Over the last couple decades , there has been an increase in organizing and activism by trans people , yet we continue to be the targets of a systematic backlash from elite feminists .
So - called " women - born women " policies are still used to exclude transsexual women from participating in our own movement .
And while trans women are disproportionately targeted by homelessness , prisons , and sexual and physical violence , an alliance between anti-trans feminists and the state has been used to circumvent human rights laws in order to bar us from many vital women 's facilities and services .
Trans women have even been forced out of women 's services organizations they helped create .
I should also note that while The Sexual Politics of Meat by Carol J. Adams is in many ways considered the book for a feminist approach to nonhuman animal advocacy , it can't be separated out from the anti-trans hatred and purge that started in the seventies .
The roots of The Sexual Politics of Meat come out of Adams ' relationship with Mary Daly , who was her teacher and mentor in the mid-seventies .
This relationship , which Adams credits with the genesis of her book and activism , took place at the same time Daly was writing her hateful , anti-trans book Gyn / Ecology .
It was also the same time Daly was advising Raymond , another student of hers , on the dissertation that became the book The Transsexual Empire .
So the origins of what currently stands as the primary source for a feminist approach to nonhuman animal advocacy has its origins in a milieu that was the epicenter of anti-trans sentiment in the seventies .
In the preface to The Sexual Politics of Meat , Adams begins her book with what she calls a " quiet homage to Mary Daly 's early support of my work as well as her ongoing biophilic vision . "
What is unacknowledged is that Daly's " biophilic vision " called for the elimination of transsexuals , people whom Daly described as " necrophilic " and therefore outside of and counter to the vegetarian - ecofeminist worldview .
Basically , trans people were never meant to be included in ecofeminism .
While a new generation of cissexual ecofeminists may simply not think about trans people due to our forced absence , the erasure and invisibility of trans people within ecofeminism cannot be seen as a mere oversight .
Most of the prominent figures in vegetarian - ecofeminism have at some point consciously thought about trans people and actively supported our exclusion — this includes those pseudo - allies who might say they 're supportive of trans people in private , yet actively support our erasure when they ignore our oppression while publicly praising the work of their more unapologetically transphobic colleagues .
When challenged on the existing cissexist state of affairs , anti-trans ecofeminists will often insist we agree to disagree and leave it at that .
But since the exclusion of trans people has already been well established , agreeing not to press the issue simply keeps trans people invisible and the status quo just the way it is .
It is easy to ignore an oppressed group of people once they have been systematically shut out of and alienated from a movement they rightfully belong in .
Had trans people not been forcibly exiled from the women 's movement throughout the seventies and subsequently blocked from returning — at times with state supported exclusion from human right protections — things would be entirely different right now .
The cycle will only be broken when cissexual feminists take responsibility for cissexism and hold themselves and their colleagues accountable .
This includes following the lead of trans people on trans issues , specifically trans women when it comes to our exclusion from feminist communities .
It 's also important to recognize that not all trans people have been targeted in the same way .
Too often women 's events or services claim to be " trans - inclusive " but are restricted to cissexual women , trans men and female - assigned genderqueers only , thus continuing the ongoing legacy of specifically excluding transsexual women .
In light of the treatment trans people have received in ecofeminist communities , what are some of the ways you have worked to combat cissexist stereotypes and find safe space in so - called anti-oppression circles ?
Acknowledging and challenging how writing and advocacy around a feminist approach to nonhuman animal advocacy has become dominated by the vegetarian - ecofeminist erasure of trans people is , for me , an important first step in creating a safe space for trans people to come out and practice feminism and nonhuman animal advocacy .
I did a lot of feminist - based nonhuman animal advocacy before coming out as trans .
During that time I was aware as a closeted transsexual women that acceptance as a feminist advocate for nonhuman animals meant staying closeted and passing as a cissexual man .
Stated another way , taking a feminist approach to nonhuman animal advocacy was very much a privilege of passing for cissexual , which required me to internalize the ways vegetarian - ecofeminism was perpetuating anti-trans oppression .
My work on The Vegan Ideal has really been my primary outlet for challenging anti-trans ideology and creating a safe space for myself to explore anti-oppression advocacy , particularly as it relates to nonhuman animals .
My posts on how cissexism is interwoven into vegetarian - ecofeminism have been part of my own struggle to affirm myself as a woman , a feminist , and an advocate for nonhuman animals .
I now refuse to accept any approach to advocacy or anti-oppression work that would have me or anyone else deny a part of who we are and internalize our oppression in order to participate .
President Hugo Chavez and his Bolivarian Bozos are determinedly moving the deck chairs on the Titanic to create the illusion that the regime can reverse the collapse of the national power grid and keep the foundering revolution afloat .
Chavez issued a decree on 8 February 2010 declaring a national power emergency , less than a month after he sacked former electrical Energy Minister Angel Rodriguez amid furious presidential assurances that Venezuela ’s power crisis was caused by El Nino , by the political opposition and by US - driven Imperialist global warming .
But “ it ’s not my fault , ” Chavez whined plaintively .
The “ national power emergency ” will last 60 days , during which new Electric energy Minister Ali Rodriguez Araque ( aka Comandante Fausto during his youthful adventures in the early 1960 ’s as a failed Communist guerrilla backed by Havana ) will have “ special powers ” to do whatever is necessary to end the power crisis .
Chavez immediately followed up that decree by chaining the nation ’s television stations at 11 p.m. Caracas time to the first emergency session of the Electricity Joint Chiefs of Staff ( “ Estado Mayor Conjunto Eléctrico ” ) in Miraflores Palace , presumably so that all Venezuelans could see their feckless leader leading the committee in charge of moving the Titanic ’s deck chairs .
Chavez assured the nation ’s television viewers that his regime will commission 60 MW of generation capacity in February , another 540 MW in March and a further 665 MW in April .
He also said that some of the new generation equipment is being imported from Houston , Texas .
It appears , based on Chavez ’s remarks , that he is counting desperately on “ gringo ” manufacturers and suppliers of power generation equipment to bail his butt out of the pit he dug himself into after 11 years of sustained Bolivarian corruption and incompetence .
As always , Chavez lashed out at private companies , accusing them of being the “ large consumers of electricity ” in Caracas , which “ demonstrates the damage caused by the capitalist model . ”
He also announced a new power rationing plan for Caracas that will explicitly target “ high residential … and commercial … industrial consumers . ”
High residential consumers , which according to Chavez constitute 24 % of the capital city ’s residential power users , must reduce consumption immediately by 10 % or else they will be required to pay a 75 % surcharge .
Any residential consumers that increase power consumption by 10 % over the average consumption during the previous year will pay a surcharge of 100 % of their power bill , and if they increase consumption by 20 % the surcharge will rise to 200 % .
However , any residential consumers who reduce power use between 10 % and 20 % will be rewarded with a 25 % discount , and if the power savings exceed 20 % the discount will be 50 % .
All commercial activities , industries and offices that consume 25 KVA will be levied a 20 % surcharge on their power bills .
And anyone who exceeds their power consumption quotas or is found to be using too much electricity will have power supplies cut off for periods of 24 - 48 hours .
If initial sanctions do not work , then power supplies will be suspended “ permanently . ”
Minister Rodriguez Araque said that his ministry will deploy “ inspectors ” to every residence and business establishment in Caracas to ensure the new power consumption quotas are obeyed .
Chavez also said there are over 8,000 high power consumption clients in Caracas , and that a list of these wasteful electricity consumers will be published soon .
But it was n’t immediately clear if Chavez was referring to business consumers or residential consumers .
The “ special powers ” that Chavez granted to “ Comandante Fausto ” include designing and executing the “ necessary and urgent strategies ” to ensure that private and public consumers of electricity pay their outstanding debts to the state - owned power utilities .
However , since the only deadbeats are government entities , it remains to be seen how Rodriguez Araque intends to collect the billions of dollars owed to Corpoelec and its affiliates by the basic industries , the state and municipal governments , and the various ministries that are controlled by the Chavez regime .
By one estimate , chavista - controlled local / state governments and other revolutionary public entities owe Corpoelec over $ 2 billion .
Of course , it ’s to be expected that opposition - controlled municipal and state governments will have power supplies cut off even if they pay their power bills on time .
It ’s also to be expected that middle class Venezuelans who do not live in the “ barrios ” will see power supplies suspended too .
Presumably , this will confirm Chavez ’s whiney lamentations that the power crisis is not his fault .
Essential public services including schools , hospitals , security companies , etc. will be exempted .
The government also plans to reduce the work - day at all government offices to five hours , or 25 hours per week .
Not that it will matter all that much , since government employees usually do not work a full eight hours and should not be expected to do more work in a five - hour day than in eight hours .
This presidential decree supposedly will accelerate the process of importing electricity generation equipment from countries like Russia , China , Belarus , Japan and Germany , among others including the much - hated Gringos .
Chavez says that his presidential decree also will allow the “ immediate development ” of maintenance plans to salvage Venezuela ’s deteriorated electricity grid , which collapsed as a direct result of the Chavez regime ’s failure to maintain the existing grid or complete even 25 % of planned generation and transmission projects that were launched in 2002 - 2003 .
It ’s not clear how a piece of paper will accelerate anything after 11 - plus years of less progress than a constipated snail .
But all the presidential noise , smoke , mirrors and circus entertainment is all about moving the deck chairs on a sinking revolution which cannot be refloated .
And here ’s where the revolutionary arithmetic becomes perhaps deliberately – mindboggling and confusing .
The electrical emergency decree is supposed to speed up the expenditure of $ 14 billion through 2015 to add 14,000 MW of new generation capacity to a national grid which has a rated capacity of over 23,000 MW , although over 7,000 MW of that existing capacity is inoperative .
These $ 14 billion , presumably , would be in addition to the more than $ 16 billion which Rodriguez Araque claims were spent in the electricity sector since Chavez came to power , although the results are not readily visible anywhere in Venezuela .
Presumably , this presidential decree also will accelerate the arrival of “ technical advisers ” from Cuba , Russia , China , Brazil , Belarus , Argentina and other strategic “ friends ” of the Bolivarian regime .
Chavez already declared that Cuba will receive $ 2.5 billion in payment for the advisory services of Ramiro Valdes , a Havana hatchet man best - known for killing unarmed innocent people and Internet censorship in Cuba .
Ali Rodriguez Araque also says that the regime plans to add 4,000 MW of new generation capacity in 2010 at a cost of $ 4 billion .
In addition , he says the regime will build new solar and aeolic ( wind ) generation plants , and install 2,000 MW of generation capacity at a cost of $ 1 - 2 billion , consisting of small generation plants with an average capacity of 5 - 10 MW each .
Finally , the new electrical Energy Minister , who knows next to nothing about electricity , says the regime may purchase ( or lease ) floating power generation plants that would be anchored on the coast of states like Miranda and Vargas ( i.e. Caracas ) .
The reported cost of these floating generation plants is about $ 4 billion , according to published reports .
However , this presidential decree – like everything else the Chavez regime has said or done in relation to the national electricity crisis – is bullshit .
The Chavez regime cannot end the power crisis before the end of 2010 as pledged only a week ago by Rodriguez Araque .
In fact , Chavez admitted two Sundays ago that the power crisis will be worse in 2011 than in 2010 , although Edelca has forecast “ national collapse ” by end - May 2010 .
It is a fact that Venezuela will suffer a power crisis that will continue well after the next presidential elections at end -2012 .
While the Chavez regime wildly tosses out investment numbers that do not add up , a few serious economists are trying to figure out just how much the power crisis will cost Venezuela .
VenEconomy ’s Robert Bottome , one of Venezuela ’s most respected economists and forecasters , estimates very conservatively that the power crisis will cause a cumulative GDP contraction of at least 18 % spread over 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , including an 8 % loss in 2010 , 6 % in 2011 and 4 % in 2012 .
But when Caracas Gringo remarked in a telephone chat with Mr. Bottome that Chavez is already saying 2011 will be worse than 2010 , VenEconomy ’s CEO conceded that he is being deliberately very conservative .

Feb . 5 , 2010  --
When Alexandra Janelli approaches the corner of Barclay Street and Broadway in New York , she knows she 's almost home .
But it has nothing to do with the world famous Woolworth building up ahead or the rare city park across the street .
It 's because her iPhone suddenly picks up on the fact that she 's reached the part of cyberspace where the " attorneys at war " and " divorce filers " Wi -Fi hotspots exist side by side .
Over the past five months , the Manhattan native said she 's uncovered a whole new way to navigate the city , and it does n't rely on street signs or famous places but on wireless signals and network names .
All it takes is a Wi-Fi-enabled smart phone or computer to rout out the wacky names people choose for their personal networks .
" I'm under your bed , " was spotted by Janelli in midtown .
" Beforethevows " came from Brooklyn .
" taco breath 2 " appeared on the Upper West Side .
" It 's like a whole other sublayer of the city , " Janelli said .
" People are really hiding behind their routers . "
Wi -Fi Sleuthing Becomes ' Almost Addictive '
Though many Internet users choose the simplest names for their personal hot spots ( or never even swap out the default name ) , the 28 - year - old environmental consultant said she 's become a collector of the names are funny , raunchy , poignant or just plain bizarre .
" I dubbed myself a Wi -Fi detective , " she said .
" Once you find a really funny Wi-Fi name , it becomes almost addictive . "
It started at a bar in New York 's East Village , Janelli said .
She went to check something on her phone 's Web browser , and when the list of available Wi-Fi networks popped up , the ironic option " alcoholic shut - in " appeared among them .
" [ It ] was so funny , " she said .
" I wondered if it was the bar or someone else . "
Since then , she 's walked along New York 's streets , iPhone in hand , watching as the threatening ( " Nancy do n't mess with this again " ) , religious ( " Jesus is Coming " ) , political ( " Obama please save us " ) and lustful ( " Boobz " ) messages pop up .
" When I take cabs home now , I notice landmark Wi -Fi names .
I know where I am , " she said .
Sociologist : People Create Digital Identities
And she said that she 's noticed that different neighborhoods represent themselves differently .
The younger the population , she said , the more outrageous , personal and cryptic the messages get .
Karen Sternheimer , a sociologist at the University of Southern California and editor of the Everyday Sociology Blog , said the phenomenon shows that people are staking out their digital space .
" It 's like a really low - frequency radio station , " she said .
" In some ways , it 's your electronic space and people are tuning into your electronic space , so it 's a way of constructing your identity through that space . "
Although it 's similar to choosing screen names or Twitter account names online , she said that the added layer of anonymity gives people a bit more freedom of expression .
To see someone 's Wi-Fi network , you need to be physically close to their home , she said , but it 's very difficult for the average person to match the individual to the network .
Wi -Fi Names Like Gargoyles to Ward Off Potential Hackers
" It 's another avenue for free speech in a way that people might be too embarrassed to express in another arena , " she said , hence the sometimes violent or overtly sexual messages .
But she also pointed out that in some ways the threatening messages are like gargoyles , serving to warn people against hacking into their wireless network .
" It 's also a way to shock someone who might be invading your digital space , " she said .
" It may be a way to scare off potential hackers or identity thieves . "
Though people can exercise creativity over the networks anywhere in the world , she said it 's more likely to occur in urban areas where people are congested enough to be aware of overlapping networks and digitally connected enough to be constantly searching for an available hotspot .
John Fischer , a 27 - year - old who lives in New York 's stereotypically hip Williamsburg section , said he 's " guilty of it " himself .
" Especially in a dense urban area where your Wi-Fi name reads like your address , it 's a clever way to be a little unexpected , " he said .
In a " little literary dig " at his neighborhood , his network is " Skinny Jeans and All " and he said his friends nearby go by " WEB and Da Boys " ( as in W.E.B Du Bois ) .
Wi -Fi Names Send Messages to Others Close By
Technology writer and co-author of the " geek humor gone wild " site eSarcasm , Daniel Tynan , said someone once changed his own Wi -Fi name on him .
When he failed to secure his own Wi -Fi network or alter the default password , he said someone went in and changed it to " Wide Open Please Come Hack Me . "
Tynan has penned a book on security and said , " I was mortified about that gaffe and immediately took steps to fix it . "
Janelli said she learned of someone using her Wi-Fi name to disclose a crush on a neighbor .
Another , she said , used it to passive - aggressively reveal that " fat man on 7fl is douche . "
But regardless of the circumstances surrounding the messages ' origins , Janelli said that once discovered , the unusual Wi-Fi names seem to provide a great deal of amusement .
Since she started collecting the names , she 's posted one day on WTFwifi.tumbler.com , but as the site 's popularity has grown , she is planning to migrate the content to a full - featured site in the coming weeks .
With a growing team of other " Wi - Fi detectives " and a graphic designer , she hopes the site shows people that the Wi-Fi names are like an entertaining " graffiti art . "
" I hope what people get from my site is that it 's just a break from the daily routine .
It just makes you laugh , " she said .
" Everyone needs a little bit of funny in their life . "
This is one of the most amazing Xbox 360 mods I have ever seen , and it makes me wonder why no one thought of modding an Xbox inside a Transformers All Spark before .
I do n’t know about any of you , but this combo simply makes sense … connecting two powerful Geek worlds together .
There are many Transformers fans and probably just as many ( if not way more ) Xbox 360 gamers out there , so this new Xbox 360 Mod bringing the two worlds together is definitely something they could literally go crazy about !
As every Transformers fan is familiar with the All Spark Cube , so has every Xbox gamer seen some crazy and amazing Xbox 360 modification .
In this latest mod , GivenTats created an Xbox that is encased inside the All Spark Cube ( to a larger size of course ) .
The details of the All Spark Cube are amazing as the Transformers Hieroglyphics and language ( hand - etched ) are maintained on the cube for all to see .
Moreover , the Decepticons logo is also added for the evil feature , and perhaps to remind Geeks that although it looks cool , the cube is rather evil .
As in performance , it is just like any Xbox 360 you are familiar with , but the CD comes out of a special compartment from within the Transformers PC .
If these kind of mods are what you can really appreciate , then you should definitely check the huge collection of the Coolest Mods of 2009 which include Apple and PC Computer mods , Xbox 360 mods , Nintendo Wii and also PS3 Mods .

Five soldiers at Ft. Jackson , S.C. , have been investigated on suspicion of making threats against fellow service members , but officials have found no substantive evidence of misconduct , U.S. military spokesmen said Friday .
The Christian Broadcasting Network , founded by evangelist Pat Robertson , has reported that soldiers were suspected of plotting to poison the food supply at the Army base .
The report said the soldiers were part of an Army translation program that included Arabic speakers .
Army investigators have been conducting an inquiry since December , but “ we have not found any credible information to substantiate the allegations , ” said Christopher Grey , a spokesman for the Army Criminal Investigation Command .
It is unusual for the agency to comment on the preliminary findings of an ongoing investigation .

A statement released by authorities at Ft. Jackson also said no credible evidence had been found to support the allegations .
“ At no time was there any danger to the Ft. Jackson community , ” the statement said .

We just got a note from our friends at HTC with some details on a new OTA update that Google is pushing out to the Nexus One starting today .
We have all heard of the 3G issues that the Nexus One is having with T - Mobile ’s 3G network .

The Nexus One OTA update also includes Google Maps 3.4 which syncs your starred location from maps.google.com , gives search suggestions based on your browser map history , and introduces a night more for Google Maps Navigation .
For good measure , Google has also decided to throw in Google Goggles to that their new visual search app will be displayed prominently in the app launcher on every Nexus One .
It ’s a bit perplexing to see Google roll out pinch - to - zoom less than a month after the launch of the Nexus One .
My only thought it that they simply did n’t have the new versions of the three apps ready at launch .

A Cornell University professor analyzed 150 of the highest grossing movies of the last 70 years .
The more recent the movie , he found , the closer it adhered to the mathematical formula that describes the human attention span .

In the 1990s , researchers at University of Texas in Austin determined that our attention spans could be described by the 1/f fluctuation , a pattern representing the ebb and flow of our concentration over a period of time .
In a new study , professor James Cutting found that the more recent the blockbuster , the more closely the length of its shots followed that same fluctuation .

Whereas Detour , made in 1945 , has shots that only vaguely correspond to the 1/f fluctuation , the 2005 King Kong remake stays surprisingly snug with the attention span wave .
As Cutting explains , this increasing correlation means that films " resonate with the rhythm of human attention spans , " but just because movies are increasingly pleasing to our subconscious minds does n't mean that we will necessarily like them more : the Star Wars prequels strictly followed the formula .

Mental health professionals have long - known that gay , lesbian and bisexual ( GLB ) teens face significantly elevated risks of mental health problems , including suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts .
However , a group of McGill University researchers in Montreal has now come to the conclusion that self - identity is the crucial risk - factor , rather than actual sexual behaviours .
Their results were published in February in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry .
The researchers administered a detailed , anonymous questionnaire to nearly 1,900 students in 14 Montreal - area high schools , and found that those teens who self - identified as gay , lesbian or bisexual , or who were unsure of their sexual identity , were indeed at higher risk for suicidal ideation and attempts .
However , teens who had same - sex attractions or sexual experiences – but thought of themselves as heterosexual – were at no greater risk than the population at large .
Perhaps surprisingly , but consistent with previous studies , the majority of teens with same - sex sexual attraction or experience considered themselves to be heterosexual .
" This is the first study that has separated sexual identity from sexual attractions and behaviours in looking at risk for poor mental health outcomes , " said corresponding author Dr. Brett Thombs , of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research ( LDI ) at the Jewish General Hospital .
" It 's important to realize that a large proportion of people who have sex with or are attracted to people of the same sex do not identify themselves as gay , lesbian or bisexual .
They consider themselves heterosexual . " added co-author Dr. Richard Montoro of the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) .
" Those students were not at all at risk of worse mental health outcomes . "
" The main message is that it 's the interface between individuals and society that causes students who identify as gay , lesbian , or bisexual the most distress , " said study first author Yue Zhao , a McGill University graduate student working with Dr. Thombs ..
" Sexual orientation has three different components .
The first is identity , which is dependent on the society in which one lives ; the second is attraction or fantasy ; and the third is behaviour .
Previous studies have not addressed which of those components may explain why GLB youth are at risk . "
" What this all means is that clinicians need to look not just at individuals and their sexuality , they really need to assess the environment they are coming from and how they see themselves within it , " said study co-author Dr. Karine Igartua .
Igartua and Montoro are co-directors of the McGill University Sexual Identity Centre ( MUSIC ) , the first gay and lesbian mental health centre in Canada .
" Our findings also clearly suggest that further study of the link between anti-gay sentiment and suicidality need to be undertaken , " added Thombs .

( The Frisky ) -- Valentine 's Day is coming !
And with it the usual traditions that include an outrageous price hike in roses , an outrageous price hike in restaurant dining , and the well - timed rom-com .
The role of the latter belongs to a flick to be released on Feb. 12 , " Valentine 's Day . "
( What a clever title , eh ? )
In the same mold as last year 's V - Day movie , " He 's Just Not That Into You , " " Valentine 's Day " is a compilation film that jams as many familiar faces into a cast of characters with different story lines that occasionally intermix .
The film includes performances from sexy actors Bradley Cooper , Ashton Kutcher , Patrick Dempsey , and Eric Dane .
However , from the posters and trailers for the film it is hard to know that the infamous " McSteamy " is in the film .
Dane 's name appears on the movie posters , but , unlike the rest of the cast , his face is not present on the actor - compiled heart .
In the trailers for the film Dane is not shown in any of the scenes extracted from the movie , he is just shown alongside his name .
So what is Dane 's role ?
Narrator ?
Nope .
In reality Dane is a victim of advertisement editing that eliminates the trace of homosexual relationships in a film , even though they are central to the storyline .
In other words , the film 's advertisements have been " de - gayed . "
( And yes that means that Dane 's character is shacking up with another one of the male desirables in the film . )
In " Valentine 's Day , " Dane plays Bradley Cooper 's closeted football - player boyfriend .
Would learning this info from the trailers and posters for the film have made you more or less interested in seeing it ?
Unfortunately , regardless of your reaction , those in charge of marketing have already decided for you .
Instead of playing on the publicity of a dreamy Cooper and Dane partnership ( " Brokeback Mountain , " anyone ? ) , the advertisers of the film have decided to disguise it .
Whether it is out of fear , ignorance , greed , or something else , " Valentine 's Day " is another example of the " de - gaying " of movie marketing .
The Frisky : Notes from Sundance : " Teenage Paparazzo " is a must - see
How does one " de - gay " film advertisements ?
By putting a heterosexual relationship in its place of course !
In " Valentine 's Day , " this substitute relationship is fulfilled with scenes of Cooper and Julia Roberts smiling coyly at each other on an airplane .
Another victim of this guy - girl swap was the marketing for Tom Ford 's " A Single Man , " a film that is centered on a man ( Colin Firth ) remembering and overcoming the loss of his male lover ( Matthew Goode ) .
In the trailer , on the other hand , the film seems to be about a romantic relationship between Firth 's character and Julianne Moore's .
Moore and Firth are seen crying , dancing , fighting , and kissing , like all normal couples .
Any shots of Goode are limited to him standing alone or amongst a crowd , but his absence does n't end there .
The actor 's name is not included in the trailer and his face is absent from the film posters .
The Frisky : The Jersey Shore nickname generator
In a brief defense of " A Single Man , " the film also deals with the friendship and old romantic relationship that once existed between Moore and Firth 's characters .
But the reason that Firth 's character is " a single man " is because his long - term boyfriend died , not because he and Moore 's character broke up .
The marketing for the film should give this dominating plot point , and poor Matthew Goode , some recognition .
The Frisky : Goodwill wants your relationship baggage
I am happy to see the acceptance of gay couples in the fictional film world .
But for this transition to be truly meaningful and complete , this acceptance needs to trickle down to marketing as well .
To alter the impression of a film plot through advertising in order to conceal the presence of a gay love story is wrong .
And besides , who would n't be interested in Dane and Cooper being a couple ?
Come on , milk that !

Gov. Mark Sanford ( R - S.C. ) is requesting his state 's share of an education grant authorized as part of last year 's stimulus -- a $ 787 - billion pot of money Sanford in part once declined .
The Republican governor spent much of Thursday meeting with Education Secretary Arne Duncan in Washington , according to media reports , pitching his state 's application for " Race to the Top " — a billion - dollar , highly competitive grant program designed to encourage schools to innovate .
ADVERTISEMENT
State officials believe South Carolina is a prime competitor for those education dollars , the first awards of which will be announced in March .
But Sanford 's trip this week to lobby on his state 's behalf is chiefly noteworthy because of the governor 's stalwart opposition to other stimulus programs in the past .
The South Carolina governor announced shortly after federal lawmakers approved the $ 787 billion Recovery
Act that he would not take most of his state 's allocated stimulus funds , though he has previously signaled an interest in the Race to the Top program .
The state 's Supreme Court ultimately overruled Sanford , forcing him to follow state lawmakers ' wishes and apply for the roughly $ 700 million he once rejected .
Still , Sanford — among a handful of other Republican governors — maintained his vocal opposition to the Recovery Act , stressing it would saddle his state with crippling debt once the money spigot dried up .
" In essence what we have right now is an export of Washington 's financial recklessness to states across the country , " he told Fox News shortly after the court 's decision .
" And I think we will see it ultimately met with not jobs , but frankly , disastrous consequences in terms of this country 's finances and , frankly , in terms of state 's finances across the country . "
By contrast , Sanford 's office told The State newspaper on Friday that the governor was no longer interested in fighting the stimulus — a pledge Sanford 's trip to Washington this week to campaign for Race to the Top dollars seemed to solidify .
After learning of the meeting , Rep. James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , who has publicly lambasted Sanford for turning down other stimulus programs , praised the governor 's latest call .
" I am pleased to see that the governor is finally taking an interest in South Carolina 's public schools , " Clyburn 's spokesman told The State .
" After going to court last year to prevent stimulus funds from coming to South Carolina , his meeting with Secretary Duncan appears to be the governor 's admission that the stimulus was not only necessary but effective .
I hope this is an indication he is willing to move forward together . "
They say that you never forget your first love .
And with the exception of yours truly , who would rather stick his tongue in a bear trap than even think about his high school girlfriend , many look back on their first romances with fond feelings .
Although not everyone thinks of that relationship for more than a passing moment or so , some must wonder what it would be like to rekindle the romance they had when they were teenagers or college - aged .
Suppose for a minute that you could .
What would that be like ?
As of 2003 , Dr. Nancy Kalish had studied over 2,000 “ lost love ” relationships herunterladen .
She said that three - quarters of first loves who reunite years later decide to stay together , even when the reunion begins as an adulterous affair .
Normally , most marriages that begin as affairs terminate .
How are these people reconnecting and why would the relationship work at a later date ?
The web , of course , is where most of these meetings begin .
When Dr. Kalish was doing her research in the early 2000 ’s , the most popular site for finding people from the past was Classmates.com .
At that time , the site found that 36 percent of respondents had used the net to look up or contact a former significant other office pro plus herunterladen .
And Dr. Kalish stated in an interview with the Boston Globe that while many people begin their search as simple curiosity , affairs can escalate quickly *.
The interviewer , Carey Goldberg , noted an anonymous respondent from Dr. Kalish ’s research to highlight this point :
“ It ’s like you ’re falling in love all over again , ” she said .
Her first boyfriend found her on the web , and before she knew it , she was obsessed , and then lying to her husband , and then sexually unfaithful , and then caught by her husband – who , to her continuing gratitude , stuck with her instead of divorcing her ebook downloaden wie geht das .
Dr. Kalish brings up a very interesting point : “ therapists tend to underestimate the powerful nature of such old loves , especially first loves .
As a result , they tend to tell such patients that their feelings for their re-found loves are based on fantasy and that they can find the same feelings in their own marriages if they only try .
But that fails to take into account that reunited lovers really do know and love each other , and a first love , in particular , remains unique .
This is not about sex , it is not about the spouse or the marriage , it is not a midlife crisis , ” she said windows 7 for free .
“ The reunion is a continuation of a love that was interrupted . ”
Carey Goldberg notes some research indicates that a teenager may attach specifically to a first lover in much the same way as a baby attaches to a mother .
This hypothesis was given by Dr. Linda Waud , a Psychologist who wrote her dissertation on three reunited couples .
“ There is an actual neurological attachment that happens between these individuals , ” she said , “ and that ’s why it ’s enduring and it never leaves your mind .
It ’s there forever and ever . ”
Interestingly , Dr. Waud herself reconnected with a long - lost love after 35 years apart .
In her in - depth interviews of the three couples , she noted that they had unusually intense sexual connections , which made her posit that sexual attachment may work with the same kind of specificity as baby - mother attachment play store apps kostenlosen .
Although a dissertation with only three couples makes generalization extremely difficult , she is onto something .
I ’ve made the very mistake that Dr. Kalish pointed out : that the former love is simply a fantasy and that one ’s current relationship can satisfy this new need .
And this is coming from someone who is not only a product of divorce , but someone who also spends most of his days thinking about why marriages fail , so I obviously thought I had some weight behind my advice .
After I was wrong not once but three times with clients who ultimately chose to leave their marriage for their high school sweethearts , I had to rethink my position current movies for free .
There ’s a possibility for a permanent footprint in your brain when it comes to your first love .
What does this mean for current relationships ?
With Facebook now in complete control of the human race , more and more people are reconnecting .
Many will get back in touch with old flames , possibly their very first romance .
Depending on how those conversations go – and yes , of course many of them will be simple hello’s and good - bye’s – casual chat may turn into flirtation , then a discussion about status and availability herunterladen .
And when the relationship moves from Facebook to IM to text to telephone and then to personal contact , the attachment that Dr. Waud talks about has perhaps manifested itself in a true rekindling of the romance , with much more backing than any affair could produce .
For some , decisions will need to be made .
If married , do I leave for what might be really ‘ the one ? ’
Or do I stay and honor what I ’ve agreed to while relinquishing what my mind had perhaps bonded to years ago ?
Unfortunately I do n’t have the answer to that question and I ’m pretty sure that we could get a 50/50 breakdown if we asked enough people ccleaner 64 bit deutsch download kostenlos .
Every person in this spot will need to answer it , however .
And from what I ’ve seen in my practice , it ’s an agonizing choice , especially when the current relationship is at least somewhat satisfying .
So essentially I ’m along for the ride as people decide what is in their best interests as well as the other parties involved .
This can take months , perhaps years , to weigh out the pros and cons , the practical and emotional changes involved in life - altering decisions like these , the risks involved in making the ‘ wrong ’ choice .
In other words , watching a client grapple with a problem like this is very difficult to watch .
Even if you think you know the right choice , you ca n’t give it to the client datei mit putty downloaden .
He or she truly has to come to it via the self .
It ca n’t be spoon fed .
Some will leave their families and begin new lives with a former love , usually with a large amount of guilt .
Others will stay put and feel that permanent imprint tugging at them .
Either way , it ’s not a particularly envious position in which to be .

During the Rose Garden signing ceremony in August 1996 of his landmark welfare reform law , President Bill Clinton told a welfare - to - work story that had inspired him to join with Congressional Republicans and pursue reforms to break the difficult cycle of dependency .
The Washington Post reported Clinton describing how a decade earlier he had asked Lillie Hardin , a former welfare recipient in Arkansas , what the best thing was about being off welfare .
Ms. Hardin replied , “ When my boy goes to school and they say , what does your momma do for a living ?
He can give an answer . ”
For too many Californians , the heartbreaking truth is that their son or daughter has been left with no good answer .
That is because while other states have made progress in reforming welfare , California has been left behind .
The numbers tell a bleak story .
In 1996 , California had 21 percent of the nation ’s welfare cases .
Today , 32 percent of all welfare cases in the United States are in California , even though we only represent 12 percent of the total U.S. population .
Consider this troubling comparison ; California is nearly twice as big as New York state , but we have five times as many welfare cases .
Despite being a state famous for opportunity and promise , California lags much of the nation when it comes to moving people from welfare to work , according to the federal government .
Only 22 percent of welfare recipients in California who are required to meet federal work minimums are working .
According to the Public Policy Institute of California , our state is one of only nine that does not unconditionally enforce the federal government ’s five - year lifetime limit on cash welfare assistance .
These flaws in our welfare system , coupled with a monthly cash check that is almost 70 percent higher than the national average , work against the goal of helping more welfare recipients leave welfare for a life of greater independence and dignity .
California simply cannot afford this kind of failure any longer .
The good news is we do n’t have to .
Michigan , which enacted sweeping welfare reform in the 90’s , is a good example .
When adjusted for population , Michigan has half the incidence of welfare dependency as California , despite a higher unemployment rate than ours .
A 2009 study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that if there were stricter sanctions on adults who fail to meet work requirements here in California , the state ’s caseload would be substantially lower and its work participation rate would be significantly higher .
Everybody would be better off .
My campaign for governor is focused on creating jobs , fixing public education and controlling Sacramento ’s enormous appetite for wasteful spending .
A common sense welfare reform plan can help achieve all three goals .
First , we need to send a strong message that welfare in California is a temporary helping hand , not a permanent way of life .
We can do this by replacing the seldom enforced , five - year time limit with a strictly enforced two - year limit .
Second , we can require the able - bodied to work , perform community service or achieve a GED .
Lastly , we will utilize modern technology to much improve the collection of child support and hold absent fathers accountable for meeting their legal and ethical responsibilities .
Over the past decade , California has spent more than $ 1 billion in fines because we could not put together an efficient computer system to collect child support payments .
That extra money could help struggling families reduce – or even end – their reliance on welfare .
There are now more than 1.3 million people trapped in California ’s ineffective welfare system .
It is costing the state ’s ailing budget billions of dollars while doing too little to help welfare families break free from a vicious cycle of dependency .
Applying long overdue common sense reforms to welfare will relieve stress on the state budget and is the right thing to do for our communities .

SPRINGFIELD , Mass . 
In most elections , a politician calling himself the Tea Party candidate would cheer Democrats , raising hopes that he would siphon votes from Republicans by attracting some of the disaffected anti-Washington , anti-Obama electorate .
But when the election is being held to fill a seat that was left vacant by the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy , and the Tea Party candidate happens to be named Joe Kennedy , things get a little murkier .
Democrats here are concerned that some uninformed voters might confuse him for a member of the better - known , well - loved Kennedy clan , which he is not .
And Mr. Kennedy ’s libertarian positions make him even more of a wild card in the last days of the race : some could appeal to the right , like his call to abolish the federal Department of Education , while others could appeal to the left , like his call for immediately ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The underfinanced , little - publicized campaign of Mr. Kennedy , 38 , is not likely to get many votes on Tuesday .
But if the race between the major - party candidates  Martha Coakley , a Democrat and the state ’s attorney general , and Scott Brown , a Republican state senator  is as tight as some polls suggest , Mr. Kennedy could play a key role by drawing just a few percentage points from either of them .

The U.S. government is currently creating one of the most colossal monuments in the history of the world .
It is the U.S. national debt , and it threatens to literally destroy the American way of life .
For decades now , this generation has been recklessly spending the money of future generations and has been convinced that they have been getting away with it .
Americans have been enjoying an obscenely high standard of living , but the party is almost over and the day of reckoning is fast approaching .
It has been a great party , but it was fueled by the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
As many of us know , it can be extremely fun running up a huge credit card bill , but it can be even more painful to pay it off .
Now our national “ credit card bills ” are starting to arrive and nobody really seems to know what to do .
The U.S. national debt will forever be a lasting reminder of the greed and recklessness of this generation .
The truth is that the United States is NOT the “ richest and most powerful nation ” in the world .
Rather , we are a spoiled , bloated , greedy nation that has run up a debt so big that words simply do not do it justice .
In fact , the U.S. national debt is so bizarre that it is hard to know whether to laugh about it or cry about it .
For today at least , we will have some fun with it .
The following are 14 fun facts about the U.S. government ’s massive debt problem … .
#1) As of December 1st , 2009 , the official debt of the United States government was approximately 12.1 trillion dollars .
#2) To pay this 12.1 trillion dollar debt would require approximately $ 40,000 from every single person living in the United States .
#3) Now the U.S. Congress has approved an increase in the U.S. government debt cap to 14.3 trillion dollars .
to pay this increase off would require approximately $ 6,000 more from every man , woman and child in the United States .
# 4) The U.S. government ’s debt ceiling has been raised six times since the beginning of 2006 .
#5) So how hard is it to spend a trillion dollars ?
If you spent one dollar every second , you would have spent a million dollars in twelve days .
At that same rate , it would take you 32 years to spend a billion dollars .
But it would take you more than 31,000 years to spend a trillion dollars .
#6) When Ronald Reagan took office , the U.S. national debt was only about 1 trillion dollars .
# 7 ) The U.S. national debt has more than doubled since the year 2000 .
#8 ) Barack Obama ’s most recently proposed budget anticipates $ 5.08 trillion in deficits over the next 5 years .
# 9 ) The U.S. national debt on January 1st , 1791 was just $ 75 million dollars .
Today , the U.S. national debt rises by that amount about once an hour .
# 10 ) The U.S. national debt rises at an average of approximately $ 3.8 billion per day .
# 11 ) In 2010 , the U.S. government is projected to issue almost as much new debt as the rest of the governments of the world combined .
# 12 ) The U.S. government has such a voracious appetite for debt that the rest of the world simply does n’t have enough money to lend us .
So now the Federal Reserve is buying most U.S. debt , and the only reason they can do that is because they basically create the money to lend us out of thin air .
# 13 ) A trillion $ 10 bills , if they were taped end to end , would wrap around the globe more than 380 times .
That amount of money would still not be enough to pay off the U.S. national debt .
# 14 ) As if all of the above was not bad enough , according to the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , which is an official United States government report , the total liabilities of the United States government , including future social security and medicare payments that the U.S. government is already committed to pay out , now exceed 65 TRILLION dollars .
As a software developer , you certainly have a high - level picture of how web apps work and what kinds of technologies are involved : the browser , HTTP , HTML , web server , request handlers , and so on .
In this article , we will take a deeper look at the sequence of events that take place when you visit a URL .
1 . You enter a URL into the browser
It all starts here :
2 . The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name
The first step in the navigation is to figure out the IP address for the visited domain .
The DNS lookup proceeds as follows :
Browser cache –
The browser caches DNS records for some time .
Interestingly , the OS does not tell the browser the time - to - live for each DNS record , and so the browser caches them for a fixed duration ( varies between browsers , 2 – 30 minutes ) .

If the browser cache does not contain the desired record , the browser makes a system call ( gethostbyname in Windows ) .
The OS has its own cache .

Recursive search – Your ISP ’s DNS server begins a recursive search , from the root nameserver , through the .com top - level nameserver , to Facebook ’s nameserver .
Normally , the DNS server will have names of the .com nameservers in cache , and so a hit to the root nameserver will not be necessary .
Here is a diagram of what a recursive DNS search looks like :
One worrying thing about DNS is that the entire domain like wikipedia.org or facebook.com seems to map to a single IP address .
Fortunately , there are ways of mitigating the bottleneck : Round - robin DNS is a solution where the DNS lookup returns multiple IP addresses , rather than just one .
For example , facebook.com actually maps to four IP addresses .

Load - balancer is the piece of hardware that listens on a particular IP address and forwards the requests to other servers .
Major sites will typically use expensive high - performance load balancers .

Geographic DNS improves scalability by mapping a domain name to different IP addresses , depending on the client ’s geographic location .
This is great for hosting static content so that different servers do n’t have to update shared state .

This is great for hosting static content so that different servers do n’t have to update shared state .
Anycast is a routing technique where a single IP address maps to multiple physical servers .
Unfortunately , anycast does not fit well with TCP and is rarely used in that scenario .
Most of the DNS servers themselves use anycast to achieve high availability and low latency of the DNS lookups .
3 . The browser sends a HTTP request to the web server
You can be pretty sure that Facebook ’s homepage will not be served from the browser cache because dynamic pages expire either very quickly or immediately ( expiry date set to past ) .
So , the browser will send this request to the Facebook server :
GET http://facebook.com/
HTTP/1.1 Accept : application / x- ms- application , image / jpeg , application / xaml+xml , [...]
User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 8.0 ; Windows NT 6.1 ; WOW64 ; [...]
Accept - Encoding : gzip , deflate Connection : Keep - Alive Host : facebook.com Cookie : datr=1265876274- [...]
; locale=en_US ; lsd=WW [...] ; c_user=2101 [...]
The GET request names the URL to fetch : “ http://facebook.com/”.
The browser identifies itself ( User - Agent header ) , and states what types of responses it will accept ( Accept and Accept - Encoding headers ) .
The Connection header asks the server to keep the TCP connection open for further requests .
The request also contains the cookies that the browser has for this domain .
As you probably already know , cookies are key - value pairs that track the state of a web site in between different page requests .
And so the cookies store the name of the logged - in user , a secret number that was assigned to the user by the server , some of user ’s settings , etc .
The cookies will be stored in a text file on the client , and sent to the server with every request .
There is a variety of tools that let you view the raw HTTP requests and corresponding responses .
My favorite tool for viewing the raw HTTP traffic is fiddler , but there are many other tools ( e.g. , FireBug )
These tools are a great help when optimizing a site .
In addition to GET requests , another type of requests that you may be familiar with is a POST request , typically used to submit forms .
A GET request sends its parameters via the URL ( e.g. : http://robozzle.com/puzzle.aspx?id=85).
A POST request sends its parameters in the request body , just under the headers .
The trailing slash in the URL “ http://facebook.com/” is important .
In this case , the browser can safely add the slash .
For URLs of the form http://example.com/folderOrFile, the browser cannot automatically add a slash , because it is not clear whether folderOrFile is a folder or a file .
In such cases , the browser will visit the URL without the slash , and the server will respond with a redirect , resulting in an unnecessary roundtrip .
4 . The facebook server responds with a permanent redirect
This is the response that the Facebook server sent back to the browser request :
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Cache - Control : private , no - store , no - cache , must - revalidate , post - check=0 , pre-check=0 Expires : Sat , 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT
Location : http://www.facebook.com/
P3P : CP=" DSP LAW " Pragma : no-cache Set- Cookie : made_write_conn=deleted ; expires =Thu , 12 - Feb-2009 05:09:50 GMT ; path=/ ; domain=.facebook.com ; httponly Content - Type : text / html ; charset=utf - 8 X- Cnection : close Date : Fri , 12 Feb 2010 05:09:51 GMT
Content - Length : 0
The server responded with a 301 Moved Permanently response to tell the browser to go to “ http://www.facebook.com/” instead of “ http://facebook.com/”.
There are interesting reasons why the server insists on the redirect instead of immediately responding with the web page that the user wants to see .
One reason has to do with search engine rankings .
See , if there are two URLs for the same page , say http://www.igoro.com/ and http://igoro.com/, search engine may consider them to be two different sites , each with fewer incoming links and thus a lower ranking .
Search engines understand permanent redirects ( 301 ) , and will combine the incoming links from both sources into a single ranking .
Also , multiple URLs for the same content are not cache - friendly .
When a piece of content has multiple names , it will potentially appear multiple times in caches .
5 . The browser follows the redirect
The browser now knows that “ http://www.facebook.com/” is the correct URL to go to , and so it sends out another GET request :
GET http://www.facebook.com/
HTTP/1.1 Accept : application / x- ms- application , image / jpeg , application / xaml+xml , [...]
Accept - Language : en-US User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 8.0 ; Windows NT 6.1 ; WOW64 ; [...]
Accept - Encoding : gzip , deflate Connection : Keep - Alive Cookie : lsd=XW [...]
; c_user=21 [...] ; x-referer= [...]
Host : www.facebook.com
The meaning of the headers is the same as for the first request .
6 . The server ‘ handles ’ the request
The server will receive the GET request , process it , and send back a response .
This may seem like a straightforward task , but in fact there is a lot of interesting stuff that happens here – even on a simple site like my blog , let alone on a massively scalable site like facebook .
Web server software
The web server software ( e.g. , IIS or Apache ) receives the HTTP request and decides which request handler should be executed to handle this request .
A request handler is a program ( in ASP .
NET , PHP , Ruby , … ) that reads the request and generates the HTML for the response .
In the simplest case , the request handlers can be stored in a file hierarchy whose structure mirrors the URL structure , and so for example http://example.com/folder1/page1.aspx
URL will map to file / httpdocs/folder1/page1.aspx .
The web server software can also be configured so that URLs are manually mapped to request handlers , and so the public URL of page1.aspx could be http://example.com/folder1/page1.

A request handler is a program ( in ASP .
NET , PHP , Ruby , … ) that reads the request and generates the HTML for the response .
Request handler
The request handler reads the request , its parameters , and cookies .
It will read and possibly update some data stored on the server .
Then , the request handler will generate a HTML response .
One interesting difficulty that every dynamic website faces is how to store data .
Smaller sites will often have a single SQL database to store their data , but sites that store a large amount of data and / or have many visitors have to find a way to split the database across multiple machines .
Solutions include sharding ( splitting up a table across multiple databases based on the primary key ) , replication , and usage of simplified databases with weakened consistency semantics .
One technique to keep data updates cheap is to defer some of the work to a batch job .
For example , Facebook has to update the newsfeed in a timely fashion , but the data backing the “ People you may know ” feature may only need to be updated nightly ( my guess , I do n’t actually know how they implement this feature ) .
Batch job updates result in staleness of some less important data , but can make data updates much faster and simpler .
7 . The server sends back a HTML response
Here is the response that the server generated and sent back :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache - Control : private , no - store , no - cache , must - revalidate , post - check=0 , pre-check=0 Expires : Sat , 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT P3P : CP=" DSP LAW " Pragma : no-cache Content - Encoding : gzip Content - Type : text / html ; charset=utf - 8 X- Cnection : close Transfer - Encoding : chunked Date : Fri , 12 Feb 2010 09:05:55 GMT 2b3
������� �T�n�@���� [...]
The entire response is 36 kB , the bulk of them in the byte blob at the end that I trimmed .
The Content - Encoding header tells the browser that the response body is compressed using the gzip algorithm .
After decompressing the blob , you ’ll see the HTML you ’d expect :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " id =" facebook " class= " no_js " > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < meta http-equiv=" Content - language " content = " en " /> ...
In addition to compression , headers specify whether and how to cache the page , any cookies to set ( none in this response ) , privacy information , etc .
Notice the header that sets Content - Type to text / html .
The header instructs the browser to render the response content as HTML , instead of say downloading it as a file .
The browser will use the header to decide how to interpret the response , but will consider other factors as well , such as the extension of the URL .
8 . The browser begins rendering the HTML
Even before the browser has received the entire HTML document , it begins rendering the website :
9 . The browser sends requests for objects embedded in HTML
As the browser renders the HTML , it will notice tags that require fetching of other URLs .
The browser will send a GET request to retrieve each of these files .
Here are a few URLs that my visit to facebook.com retrieved :
Images
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z12E0/hash/8q2anwu7.gif
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zBS5C/hash/7hwy7at6.gif
…
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z12E0/hash/8q2anwu7.gif
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zBS5C/hash/7hwy7at6.gif … CSS style sheets
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z448Z/hash/2plh8s4n.css
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zANE1/hash/cvtutcee.css
…
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z448Z/hash/2plh8s4n.css
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zANE1/hash/cvtutcee.css … JavaScript files
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/zEMOA/hash/c8yzb6ub.js
http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/z6R9L/hash/cq2lgbs8.js
…
Each of these URLs will go through process a similar to what the HTML page went through .
So , the browser will look up the domain name in DNS , send a request to the URL , follow redirects , etc .
However , static files – unlike dynamic pages – allow the browser to cache them .
Some of the files may be served up from cache , without contacting the server at all .
The browser knows how long to cache a particular file because the response that returned the file contained an Expires header .
Additionally , each response may also contain an ETag header that works like a version number – if the browser sees an ETag for a version of the file it already has , it can stop the transfer immediately .
Can you guess what “ fbcdn.net ” in the URLs stands for ?
A safe bet is that it means “ Facebook content delivery network ” .
Facebook uses a content delivery network ( CDN ) to distribute static content – images , style sheets , and JavaScript files .
So , the files will be copied to many machines across the globe .
Static content often represents the bulk of the bandwidth of a site , and can be easily replicated across a CDN .
Often , sites will use a third - party CDN provider , instead of operating a CND themselves .
For example , Facebook ’s static files are hosted by Akamai , the largest CDN provider .
As a demonstration , when you try to ping static.ak. fbcdn.net , you will get a response from an akamai .
net server .
Also , interestingly , if you ping the URL a couple of times , may get responses from different servers , which demonstrates the load - balancing that happens behind the scenes .
10 .
The browser sends further asynchronous ( AJAX ) requests
In the spirit of Web 2.0 , the client continues to communicate with the server even after the page is rendered .
For example , Facebook chat will continue to update the list of your logged in friends as they come and go .
To update the list of your logged - in friends , the JavaScript executing in your browser has to send an asynchronous request to the server .
The asynchronous request is a programmatically constructed GET or POST request that goes to a special URL .
In the Facebook example , the client sends a POST request to http://www.facebook.com/ajax/chat/buddy_list.php to fetch the list of your friends who are online .
This pattern is sometimes referred to as “ AJAX ” , which stands for “ Asynchronous JavaScript And XML ” , even though there is no particular reason why the server has to format the response as XML .
For example , Facebook returns snippets of JavaScript code in response to asynchronous requests .
Among other things , the fiddler tool lets you view the asynchronous requests sent by your browser .
In fact , not only you can observe the requests passively , but you can also modify and resend them .
The fact that it is this easy to “ spoof ” AJAX requests causes a lot of grief to developers of online games with scoreboards .
( Obviously , please do n’t cheat that way . )
Facebook chat provides an example of an interesting problem with AJAX : pushing data from server to client .
Since HTTP is a request - response protocol , the chat server cannot push new messages to the client .
Instead , the client has to poll the server every few seconds to see if any new messages arrived .
Long polling is an interesting technique to decrease the load on the server in these types of scenarios .
If the server does not have any new messages when polled , it simply does not send a response back .
And , if a message for this client is received within the timeout period , the server will find the outstanding request and return the message with the response .
Conclusion
Hopefully this gives you a better idea of how the different web pieces work together .
A Wisconsin teenager was sentenced to 15 years in prison Wednesday for an extortion scheme that had him tricking male classmates into sending them nude photos of themselves , then blackmailing them with exposure if they did n't have sex with him .
In 2008 , defendant Anthony Stancl , who was 18 at the time , posed as a girl on Facebook and tricked more than 30 male classmates into sending him photos of themselves .
According to court documents ( .pdf ) , authorities found 300 photos of underage males on his computer as well as video of some of the victims exposing their genitals and masturbating ; some of the victims were 15 years old .
The photos were stored in 40 folders on Stancl 's computer , each of which was named after a victim whose photos were in the folder .
In one case , police found 24 pictures of a single victim .
The scheme occurred for about a year from November 2007 to November 2008 , when victims came forward .
At least seven of the victims said that Stancl , posing as a girl , threatened to post their nude pictures on the internet or send them to their friends unless they engaged in sexual activity with a male friend of " hers . "
When the victims met with the male friend , who was Stancl , the perpetrator performed oral sex on the victims and took a photo of the activity with his cellphone .
One of the victims , who was 16 at the time , reported that after allowing Stancl to perform oral sex on him , the girl " Kayla " said it was n't enough and threatened to post the oral sex pictures online if the victim did n't have anal sex with Stancl .
After this occurred on two occasions , " Kayla " demanded the victim send her a nude photo of his brother as well .
The victim then went to his parents , who contacted police .
Stancl told the victims that he was an extortion victim himself and was being forced to have sex with them and photograph it in order to prevent other photos of himself from being exposed .
His attorney , Craig Kuhary , says that Stancl 's activity was prompted by anxiety over his sexual orientation and the alienation he felt after he was humiliated and outed by another student .
Stancl claimed he had been sexually assaulted by an upperclassman during his sophomore year .
He 'd been attracted to the student and when they met , Stancl says the student forced him to have oral sex .
After this , other students began spreading rumors about him and doctoring photos of him to suggest he was gay .
His attorney says he lost a number of friends over this and became a loner .
" He had a strong desire to fit in with everyone , " Kuhary told Threat Level .
" I think that was why he went to the great length he did to appear that he was n't gay and was just a victim [ of extortion ] like they were ....
He was never comfortable with the fact that he was bisexual so he came up with an elaborate scheme to cover that to appear to be a normal heterosexual teen . "
Stancl 's illegal activity , however , was n't limited to sex crimes .
He was expelled from New Berlin Eisenhower High School for allegedly making a bomb threat in November 2008 .
On Nov. 12 , two students found a note written on the wall of a men's bathroom that read " Bomb 11/14/08 . "
Law enforcement conducted a sweep of the school but found no explosives .
The next day , two school administrators and a science teacher received an e-mail that read in part : " Good luck tomorrow .
Boom .
It wo n't be your average one either .
It will be one that is manned .
Not by me , but by those who follow me . "
Officials traced the e-mail to the New Berlin Public Library and ultimately to Stancl , who admitted he sent the e-mails .
He denied writing the note on the bathroom wall , however , and said he sent the e-mails the next day only to " make it a better story . "
The sexual allegations only came to light after Stancl was already being investigated for the bomb threat .
Stancl was charged with soliciting sex from minors , possessing child pornography and making a bomb threat .
He pleaded no contest in December to two Wisconsin felonies – repeated sexual assault of the same child and third - degree sexual assault .
At his sentencing , according to the Associated Press , he apologized , saying he understood the distress his victims experienced .
Kuhary says the statement included an apology to each of the victims , the school district , Stancl 's classmates and his family .
He added that Stancl faced a possible sentence of 30 years but that the goal was to " attempt to salvage this young man 's life so that he would have a good number of years left whenever he completed his sentence . "
The district attorney in Waukesha County , where the case was brought , did not immediately respond to a call for comment .

The devoted threw a party fit for a prince :
There were dancers , singers and synchronized swimmers , not to mention unnamed foreign dignitaries -- all celebrating the 68th birthday Tuesday of Kim Jong Il , North Korea ’s “ Dear Leader . ”
In Pyongyang , state - run media lauded a national hero “ praised by mankind as the most outstanding political elder and the peerlessly brilliant commander of the present era . ”
Outside the isolationist state , though , the take on Kim ’s milestone was a bit less breathless as analysts questioned his physical and mental health following a suspected stroke in 2008 .
In a South Korean journal article published this month , a senior analyst wrote that many North Korean officials did not expect Kim to live more than another five years .
Cheong Seong - chang , a senior analyst at the private Sejong Institute think tank , says Kim regularly undergoes kidney dialysis due to complications from diabetes .
Citing what the report called reliable sources , Cheong wrote that Kim suffered from depression and was psychologically unstable .
“ Kim Jong
Il is known to have shed some tears when bodyguards were with him , unlike in the past , ” according to the journal report .
Choeng says
Kim ’s failing health has led him to hasten his search for a successor .
Rumors persist that Kim last year named his third son , Kim Jong - un , to succeed him .
One anonymous South Korean intelligence expert told the Associated Press that Kim had forsaken Western medicine for expensive , hard - to - find remedies such as bear gall - bladder , rhinoceros horn and musk -- much of it imported from China .
But Kim is still walking .
Government - run media often release undated photos documenting his personal inspections of factories and military compounds .
“ Kim Jong Il seems to be doing well in governing .
He is working on foreign relations and going out for field guidance , ” said Yang Moo-jin , a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul .
“ And it ’s likely he ’ll visit China soon . ”
North Korea recently completed an investment deal with China that equaled half its annual economic output , according to Seoul ’s Yonhap news agency .
Meanwhile , Pyongyang threw a party on a day that ’s considered North Korea ’s most poignant national holiday .
Performing before unnamed foreign guests , synchronized swimmers “ depicted beautiful frost flowers carrying boundless reverence ” for Kim as they swam to such nationalistic North Korean tunes as “ Let ’s Meet Each Other on the Front ” and “ Let the Soldiers Be Heroes , ” according to state media .
The nation ’s Social Youth League also gave a performance that included a rendition of the song “ Thunder Over Jong Il Peak . ”
“ There are festivities in cities and provinces , including lots of athletic games , performances , gun salutes and contests , to enhance the North Korean people ’s solidarity , ” said Yang .
“ Everything is to emphasize King Jong Il . ”
But there were also cracks in the propaganda onslaught .
North Korea has in recent months been beset by a deepening cash shortage and even internal unrest following U.N. sanctions and a misguided move to devalue its currency that almost brought its already - anemic economy to a standstill .
A report by North Korea ’s Central News Agency pointed out that all the nation ’s children usually received gifts from Kim to commemorate his birthday .
Not this year .
The agency cited “ abnormal climatic conditions ” and “ blocked sea routes ” to explain why that would not happen this year .
Still , the Dear Leader was lauded : “ Presents were transported by helicopter for a small number of children , ” the release reported , “ a measure taken by Kim Jong Il . ”

Most Lebanese , that I know , are surprised when I tell them that Lebanon is one of the most densely populated countries of the world .
Most cannot even accept it since they often associate , wrongly , such countries as China , India , Nigeria and Belgium with high density .
Officially Lebanon ( 404/sq. km ) is the 25th most densly populated political entity in the world .
But if one is to keep very special and small entities such as The Vatican , Gibraltor , Guernsey , San Marino and Nauru out of the rankings then Lebanon can easily become the 10th or the 15th most populated country in the planet .
India has a population density of 358 per sq. km while China stands at 139 .
If the current population density of Lebanon is become the global average then the population of the world would have to rise to a mind numbing 60 billion individuals .
One does not need to be a Neo Malthusian to recognize that there comes a point when human population growth becomes highly undesirable to say the least .
If the projected 10 billion humans by 2050 are not enough then what is ?
Is it another doubling to 20 billion or maybe a further doubling still to 40 billion ?
Does Lebanon have the right to complain about the rapid rate of growth in global poulation when it is one of the biggest abuser of this metric ?
Most , and possibly all , of those that have looked into this issue and investigated the potential limits seriously have concluded that we are already beyond any metric of sustainability .
This only means that we have overshot the carrying capacity of the ecosystem and as a result we have to take measures that will reverse our current course .
Lebanese dependence on the rest of the world for its food , energy , capital , employment opportunitiesand energy is so clearly visible to all that no one will question it .
Yet we keep on growing by increasing our dependence on other ecosystems .
Is that responsible behaviour ?
But what is it that needs to be done if we are to reduce fertility substantially ?
Surely we cannot stand by as idle spectators and hope that humans will decide to change their behaviour drastically just because that is good for the ecosystem ?
Had this been the case then they would have done so a long time ago .
So what we are left with is the absolute certainty that human population must stop growing and preferably even start to decline .
Studies have shown that if the world population is to adopt the lifestyles and diet of the West then we need six planets when we have only one .
Forty Lebanons will be needed if we are to apply the same standard to the resources of Lebanon .
This clearly shows that we have exceeded our limited carrying capacity and thus the current state of affairs is not sustainable .
If it is deemed to be too risky to count on a voluntary change in behaviour then the only other alternative to reduce the rate of fertility would be a direct and sustained government policy aimed at achieving lower fertility rates .
There are a number of actions that the government can adopt that will act to internalize the negative externality of high fertility such as taxes , social expenditures and even outright strict limits on the number of successful pregnancies per female .
But is the world ready to deal with this most basic and challenging problem ?
Is Lebanon ready to adopt a meaningful population policy ?
I will not hold my breath .
A few weeks ago , a rumor spread that Minnesota offered Al Jefferson for Indiana 's Danny Granger and got turned down .
It did n't matter if the rumor was true .
What mattered was the concept itself .
Would you trade Al Jefferson straight up for Danny Granger ?
This was an old - school basketball trade , almost like two GMs flipping cards in a school yard .
Trades are never this simple anymore .
Fast - forward to All - Star Weekend , when the Wizards and Mavericks consummated what passes for a typical NBA trade these days : a seven - player swap in which Dallas acquired two starters ( Caron Butler and Brendan Haywood ) , along with an unsavory salary ( DeShawn Stevenson ) in return for expiring contracts .
Strangely , Butler was n't even much of a cap burden , making only $ 20.3 million through 2011 .
Washington was so desperate to break up the Arenas Era Wizards that it was n't even rational ; it would be like NBC dumping Conan , then trading " Saturday Night Live " to prove they were serious about blowing up late night .
Um ... what ?
These trades happen all the time now :
Teams making lopsided deals to clear cap space so they can overpay other players .
Last season , Detroit gave away Chauncey Billups so it could spend $ 95 million on two bench players .
This season , Washington turned two of its top four and the No. 5 pick of the 2009 draft into a slew of expiring 2010 contracts .
Right now , Phoenix is reportedly mulling over a trade in which it would turn Amar'e Stoudemire into J.J. Hickson , Zydrunas Ilgauskas ' expiring contract and the 30th pick in the 2010 draft , or as Suns fans call it , " The Poop Bouillabaisse . "
Every deal is the same : Team A wants to save money ;
Team B will only take on money if it pillages Team A in the deal .
That 's how we knew the Granger - Jefferson rumor was fake .
Teams do n't make old - school trades in the National Basketball Association any more .
The threat of a 2011 lockout hangs over everything .
It 's inevitable .
It pretty much has to happen .
The owners need to be saved from themselves ; the players need to realize that they failed to deliver on too many mammoth , long - term contracts , and that one or two clunkers can destroy a franchise for half a decade or more .
In the spirit of Clemenza , the two sides will have to go to the mattresses to resolve it .
Only this time , David Stern has a trump card in his pocket -- the memory from the 1999 lockout that so many of these millionaire players , as amazing as this might sound , lived paycheck to paycheck .
The owners could survive a lockout .
The players ?
That 's another story .
The owners will win .
They always do .
Man , I need to be cheered up .
( Thinking . )
You know what could do the trick ?
The official YouTube clip of America 's favorite running column gimmick : " Who has the highest NBA trade value ! "
Let 's go to John Tesh playing the old NBA on NBC song while wearing a pirate 's blouse in Catalina .

Can you feel it ?
Can you feel it ????
CAN YOU FEEL IT ???????????
For a quick refresher of the " trade value " rules , check the sidebar .
Here 's a list of 2008 - 09 incumbents who could n't crack this season 's list or honorable mention : Hedo Turkoglu ( No. 39 last year ) roped Bryan Colangelo into a $ 53 million " if this does n't work out , I 'm getting fired , anyway " deal ... Devin Harris ( 38 ) got sprayed by the Nets ' skunk ... Andris Biedrins ( 37 ) got sprayed by the Warriors ' skunk ... Amar'e Stoudemire ( 36 ) can grab barely two rebounds per quarter but wants a max deal ... LaMarcus Aldridge's ( 31 ) $ 65 million extension was Reason No. 214 why the owners need to be saved from themselves ... Caron Butler ( 29 ) got salary dumped ... Greg Oden ( 25 ) was surpassed in fame by his own penis ... Manu Ginobili ( 16 ) is n't overqualified to be a sixth man anymore ... and when we start calling Yao Ming ( 7 ) " Yao Ming 's Expiring Contract " in five months , I 'd like to spell it with Chinese letters .
Our toughest 2010 omissions go from " not so tough " to " agonizingly tough " :
[+]
Enlarge Brian Babineau / NBAE / Getty Images KG is averaging 14.3 points per game , his lowest total since his rookie season .
Kevin Garnett ( No. 11 last year ) :
And probably untradable this year .
Even worse , he drew this e-mail from Noel in Washington : " Is it me or is KG turning into a caricature of himself ?
Did you see his reaction after the East won the All - Star Game ?
Breaking out the fist pumps and crazy eyes for a game with no defense ?
Baffling . "
How did we get here ?
Andrew Bogut :
It 's tough to leave off anyone who bought 100 lower - level seats for every game , created something called Squad 6 , then auditioned for fans who would cheer like crazy and set the tone for everyone else in the building .
Even better , it works !
Only an Australian would come up with that idea .
I love Australians .
Danilo Gallinari : Current ceiling : " A poor man 's Dirk Nowitzki , only if Dirk ran like a guy who once had a broken back . "
And yet , I like him .
Paul Millsap : Two - time winner of " the best tweener / banger " award , easily edging out Chuck Hayes , Taj Gibson , Glen Davis , Craig " The Rhino " Smith , Brandon Bass and the 283 - Pound Guy Who Ate Jason Maxiell .
We need a name for tweener / bangers .
My vote ?
" Sliders . "
You know how sliders can be better than cheeseburgers sometimes , even though they are n't the same size ?
Kinda like Paul Millsap and Carlos Boozer , right ?
The cheeseburger ( Boozer ) might be bigger and more expensive , but sometimes the slider ( Millsap ) hits the spot and you do n't feel as full afterward .
Hasheem Thabeet : Just kidding .
Chris Kaman : Every once in awhile my son will take a marker and start drawing on one of our walls like a graffiti artist .
My wife has to use Magic Cleaner to get it off , and while she 's cleaning she makes the same face at my son that Baron Davis makes every time Kaman sails an outlet pass over his head into the third row .
So yeah , Kaman is having a solid year .
But he still has those magic marker moments and should never , ever , not ever , not in a million years , play in an All - Star Game unless all 12 Western guys come down with food poisoning the night before .
I can't rank him higher than this .
Nene :
The most properly paid player in the league .
For this season and the next two , he makes $ 32.4 million total .
Perfect .
Monta Ellis :
Should we say he 's putting up big stats because he 's playing for a crummy team , or should we be impressed that he 's only 24 and averaging a 26 - 5 - 4 right now ?
Tough call .
I trust the collective intuition of Warriors fans as much as any NBA fan base -- it 's between Warriors fans , Raptors fans and Knicks fans in any " most realistic about their own players " contest -- and even they seem perplexed by Monta .
Let 's marinate on him for another year .
( As for the " least realistic about their own players " contest ...
I think it 's a battle to the death between two fan bases and two fan bases only .
They know who they are . )
( Funniest part of that last paragraph :
The fans from those two fan bases are going to send me e-mails saying , " Look , I 'm the last person to get oversensitive about this stuff , and I think you 're totally wrong , but I know you were talking about us so BLEEP YOU YOU BLEEPING BLEEPFACE ! " )
Andrea Bargnani : Memo Okur 2.0 , with the added bonus that he started a Miami Vice Beard Club with Jose Calderon .
Still , I like my starting centers to grab eight rebounds a game .
Hell , I 'd settle for seven .
Anthony Randolph : A top - 40 lock on nearly any other team .
NBA Cares should launch a program rehabbing the mental state of Warriors fans .
What an insane team to root for .
You should n't have to go online every morning hoping that this was n't the day your team stupidly traded a potential 24 - 10 - 5 guy who 's 20 years old because your overpaid , mailing - it - in , hoping - to - get - canned - so - he - can - move - back - to - Hawaii curmudgeon of a coach did n't " like the way he looked at me at practice today . "
Find this team a real owner and clean house .
Kevin Martin ( 30 ) : My favorite possibly available trade piece -- great contract , proven scorer , high hoops IQ , someone who'd thrive on a veteran team that protected him defensively and ran plays for him .
Right now he 's playing on a glorified pickup team with Tyreke Evans , who thinks " point guard " means " I get to dribble over midcourt . "
Not gonna fly .
Someone like Martin is a luxury .
You pamper him .
You set him screens .
You hook him up on slash - and - kicks .
You go to him after games and say , " Hey , what 's the best place to deliver the ball for you -- chest high and a little to the right ? "
He could absolutely be a contender 's No. 1 scoring option like Reggie Miller or Rip Hamilton once upon a time .
Stay tuned .

Enlarge Ron Turenne / NBAE / Getty Images Jennings started off hot , but his shooting percentages have dropped each month .
Brandon Jennings : I remember watching that 55 - point game live and thinking , " Crap , I hope this is n't the worst thing that could have happened to him . "
His shooting percentages by the month : 51.6 , 42.0 , 37.6 , 32.4 , 30.3 .
His overall percentage of 37.6 would be fine in the 1950s , but not in 2010 .
The good news :
He 's only 20 .
Joakim Noah : The new Laimbeer : Love him if he's on your team , hate him if he 's playing against you .
Carlos Boozer : Gets a Trade Value DNP because he 's a free agent - to - be .
I can't tell if the Jazz would trade him , or if anyone wants him .
You know what else this means ?
For the first time ever , no Blue Devils in the top 40 !
Woohoo !
Suck it , Duke !
This never would have happened if Mike Krzyzewski was still alive .
All right , let 's dive into the top 40 in reverse order .
Group J : " I Can't , People Will Know I Have No Clue What I'm Doing "
40 . Ricky Rubio
If you have the No. 5 and No. 6 picks in what turned out to be a quality draft , and you turn No. 5 into an asset that can't be realized for THREE YEARS because your No. 6 pick was n't nearly as good as the No. 7 pick and also managed to drive your No. 5 pick to a foreign country , how is that anything other than an abject disaster ?
Bumbling GM David Kahn told Minnesota fans last week , " I do n't expect to be a playoff team for at least two years . "
Great , just in time for the lockout and a new - wave NBA world with lower salaries and shorter contracts that 's going to make Ricky say , " You know what ?
I think I 'll just stay here for a couple more years and make three times as much money unless you trade me to a big - market team . "
In fact , I thought about making Kahn the following bet :
If Ricky Rubio plays even one minute for the Timberwolves , I will drive from Los Angeles to Minnesota for his first game while wearing a T - wolves jersey that says " KAHN " on the front and " No. 1 " on the back .
( It 's an 1,835 - mile trip .
I looked it up . )
But I do n't want to root for the T - Wolves fans to lose Rubio ; they 've suffered enough .
I hope I am wrong .
I do n't think I am .
( Follow - up story : Another NBA team sent someone to Spain to watch Rubio play for FC Barcelona a few weeks ago .
The individual ran into one of Rubio 's advisers and asked him how many times someone from Minnesota had come to see Rubio this season .
The answer ?
Zero . )
39 . Zach Randolph
Round of applause to Z - Bo for his historic vault from last year 's " Worst 25 Contracts " list to No. 39 this year .
If you need two points at the end of a tight game , and you could throw it inside to any low - post player , he 's the pick this season .
It 's true .
Maybe NBA head cases are like difficult Hollywood actors : pure hell in the early part of their careers , seemingly unable to escape their baggage , and then they mature just enough that their talent is allowed to flourish .
Z - Bo's 2010 stats are n't any different than his 2004 stats , or even his 2009 stats , but HE seems different .
More ... serene .
No different than Rasheed Wallace that first Detroit spring , C - Webb upon arriving in Sacramento , Big Dog on the 2001 Bucks , Hakeem ( yes , The Dream was a head case once upon a time ) on the 1993 Rockets , Barkley on the 1993 Suns .
Eventually , things calm down , they learn from past mistakes and talent wins out for a year or three .
You hope .
It happened for Z - Bo and Robert Downey Jr. ; it did n't happen for Isaiah Rider and Tom Sizemore .
You never know .
38 . Tony Parker
Followed a career year with a ho - hum one .
Even his Us Weekly stats are down .
( Unrelated :
Do you realize we 're one more French guy away from being able to put together an entire team of French guys ?
Starters : Parker , Mickael Pietrus , Nicolas Batum , Boris Diaw , Joakim Noah .
Bench : Ronny Turiaf , Rodrigue Beaubois , Yakhouba Diawara , Johan Petro , Alexis Ajinca , Ian Mahinmi .
How is this possible ?
This is the same country that gave us Frederic Weis !!!!
This is the same country famous for four things and four things only : wine , cigarettes , cheese and B.O. I do n't get it .
Eleven French NBA players ?
Eleven ? )
37 . Al Jefferson
About 82.7 percent back from 2009 's knee injury .
The bigger issue : Residual damage from a 116 - 265 stretch ( and counting ) in Minnesota and Boston .
At some point , all that losing can turn you into an actual loser .
It 's like a girl who keeps inadvertently dating jerks and eventually loses her self - esteem .
By the way , Jefferson has two juicy career what - ifs : " What if the Celts had landed the No. 1 or No. 2 pick in 2007 ? " ( they would have taken Durant in either spot and built around Durant , Jefferson , Rondo , Pierce and a bunch of draft picks and expiring contracts ) , and " What if Minny had n't screwed up this Rubio thing ? "
Both went against him .
Maybe he 's just unlucky like Hugo Hurley .
( FYI : I was referring to the original Hurley , not Alternate Reality Hurley from Season 6 of what 's threatening to become the most confusing and far - fetched show in the history of television .
If they change the course of the 2004 baseball playoffs , I 'm out .
You hear me , Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse ?
I 'm out .
Do n't go there .
Do n't you dare .
Do n't even THINK it . )

Enlarge ESPN.com illustration The Mokeski Trophy !
36 . David Lee
A quality offensive player and world - class rebounder who improved from " defensive abomination " to " defensive semi-abomination " this season .
I remain confused why Portland or Detroit did n't throw $ 40 - 45 million his way last summer .
Regardless , he 's a mortal lock for my Mokeski Trophy , given annually to the best American white guy of the season .
Look at it to the right .
Is n't it magnificent ?
I want one for my office .
35 . Chauncey Billups
Thirty years from now , when the Pistons have finished their 30th straight losing season and officially switched places with the Lions in the Detroit landscape , someone will write a " Curse of Chauncey " book for which Joe Dumars will refuse to be interviewed .
34 . Rudy Gay
If you 're my best perimeter guy and can't make 3s , then you better be dropping 24 - 26 a night easy , and he can't do it .
He 's headed for Iguodala / Deng / Granger territory -- someone who gets paid like a franchise player but is n't one ( a recipe for NBA disaster ) .
If I 'm a Knicks fan , my Summer of 2010 Worst - Case Scenario is Amar'e and Rudy .
That 's taking me to a 6 - seed every spring .
( You know what 's really sad ?
Every Knicks fan just said , " A 6 - seed every spring ?
I 'll take it ! " )
Group H. " Cost - Effective Building Blocks "
33 . David West
So woefully underpaid ( $ 9.1 million this season , then dropping to $ 8.2 million next year and finishing at a paltry $ 7.5 million for the 2011 - 12 lockout - er , season ) that I actually looked up his agent , Lance Young , to see if the guy had been disbarred .
Nope .
Somehow he reps Chris Paul , Stephen Curry and ... ( wait for it ) ... Rudy Gay !
I take back everything in the previous paragraph about Rudy and the Knicks ; maybe they can get him for half - price .
32 . Stephen Curry
Even more sophisticated offensively than we hoped .
Defensively ... ugh .
But offensively ?
Wow .
His January stats ( 15 games ) : 19 -4-5 , 48 percent FG , 48 percent 3FG , 89.2 percent FT .
For the season , assuming he bumps his scoring to 17 PPG post - All - Star break and everything else stays the same , he 'd finish with 16 PPG , 120 - plus 3s and 42 percent shooting from 3 .
According to Vincent Masi of ESPN Stats & Information , no rookie came close to hitting those numbers except for Ben Gordon in 2004 - 05 ( 15.1 PPG , 134 3s , 40.5 percent ) .
Elias reports that 21 players have done the 16 - 120 - 42 thing since 2000 - 01 ; only three were younger than 26 ( Ray Allen , Leandro Barbosa and Gordon ) , and none were younger than 23 .
( Did I mention that the T - Wolves could have had Rubio AND Curry ?
I mentioned that , right ? )
31 . Eric Gordon
30 . Russell Westbrook
Our co-MVPs of this year 's Table Team , for the young player who brings the most to the table while also taking a fair share of stuff off it .
Gordon 's strengths :
He 's a physical finisher with a gorgeous jumper who doubles as a surprisingly effective / fiesty one - on - one defender ( as Kobe Bryant found out a few weeks ago ) .
His warts :
He 's too streaky of a shooter , has a horrible handle in traffic and suffered through two truly messed - up coaching situations already ( Kelvin Sampson at Indiana , followed by two years of the Dumbleavy Era ) , and if that 's not enough , he plays for the worst franchise in sports .
It 's 50/50 he makes it when the odds should be 85/15 .
This is what happens when your owner does n't do enough mitzvahs .
As for Westbrook , he 's running a precociously young playoff team , he 's exciting as hell , he 's capable of the occasional 17 - 12 - 14 line , and he seems like a great teammate ( like everyone else on the Zombies , actually ) .
These things outweigh his lack of point guard instincts , carelessness with the ball and gawdawful shooting .
( On an excellent site called hoopdata.com , they break down shooting by zones and Westbook is shooting 47 percent at the rim , 39 percent from inside 10 feet , 32.7 percent from 10 - 15 feet , 36 percent from 16 - 23 feet and 27.3 percent from 3 . That 's Lindsey Hunter / Montresor - level bad . )
With that said , the Zombies could absolutely win a title some day with Durant as their No. 1 and Westbrook as No. 3 .
They just need a No. 2 . Not to be confused with the No. 2 that Clay Bennett took on Seattle .

Enlarge Garrett Ellwood / NBAE / Getty Images Kevin Love 's all - around game is one thing Minnesota fans can cheer .
29 . O.J. Mayo
28 . Kevin Love
I never thought Mayo would accept his destiny this early : third scoring option , solid 3 - point shooter and quality perimeter defender on a winning team .
The over / under was the year 2017 ... and I had the over .
Still , I 'd rather have Love .
We 're two to three years away from Love leading the league in rebounding while shooting 40 percent from 3 and dishing out Unseld - esque outlets .
One of my favorites .
Lock him down for multiple Mokeskis some day .
27 . Marc Gasol
A lock for the " 2009 - 10 Most Improved Player " award unless he gets accidentally shot by Jamaal Tinsley outside a strip joint between now and April .
This was someone who , as recently as a year ago , was basically Pau Gasol 's fat brother who got thrown into Frank Stallone / Don Swayze / Ozzie Canseco / Roger Clinton jokes .
Then he dropped 30 pounds and turned into a legitimate NBA center -- to the point that we can't even call 2008 's Lakers / Grizzlies trade the most one - sided deal of the decade , although it remains reprehensible that Chris Wallace did n't shop for a better offer up until the deadline .
Whatever .
( Note : I was trying to imagine what Frank Stallone could have done in the late ' 80s to match Marc Gasol 's improbable career turnaround this year .
Maybe it 's this :
Us remembering 1988 as the year Frank launched a successful action movie franchise about a crime - fighting lounge singer called " Iron Pipes . "
Which , by the way , should have happened unhypothetically .
I absolutely would have paid to see " Iron Pipes " with Frank Stallone in 1988 .
Alas . )
Group G : " We'll Discuss Him , But You Can't Tell ANYONE "
26 . Danny Granger
Starting to worry that he 's a classic franchise player who looks great on your fantasy team , but if he 's the No. 1 guy on your real team , you 're going 32 - 50 and that 's that .
( Cut to the last remaining 3,500 Pacers fans nodding impassively . )
25 . Gerald Wallace
One of the season 's craziest revelations :
You can become a semi- dangerous Round 1 opponent if your best two players are Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson .
Who knew ?
I 'm already having nightmares about a Celts - Bobcats series , with the Bobcats out - toughing the 2008 champs , Wallace and Jackson attacking the rim , Larry Brown treating Doc Rivers like an SEC football game Porta - Potty , KG dragging his leg around like Anton Chigurh but claiming he 's fine , and Rasheed decomposing from the 3 - point line but somehow still managing to brick five of them a game .
Shoot me .
( PS : I kept Wallace here despite a head - scratching All - Star Weekend in which he followed a uber - lifeless dunk contest performance by winning the coveted Antoine Walker Award for " Worst Showing in the All - Star Game . "
It almost looked like he had been roofie'd on Friday night .
In fact , I 'd advise him to come out and claim that .
Like , right now . )
24 . Joe Johnson
Our best - case scenario for Rudy Gay 's career .
And since he 's fleeing Atlanta this summer , it seems like the perfect time to mention that I 'd renew my seats for a Kaman - Griffin - Johnson - Gordon - Baron starting five next season .

William Rex Fowler , 58 , at first to believed to be the victim in a Dec. 30 shooting at his Adams County office , has been arrested and charged with the murder of his former business partner .
Investigators say Fowler shot Tommy Ciancio , 42 , three times in the head with a 9 mm Glock handgun when Ciancio came to Fowler Software Design to collect $ 9,900 in severance .
Ciancio , who was Fowler Software ’s chief operating officer , resigned Nov. 23 , 2009 in a dispute over the way the company was being managed .
On Dec. 29 , 2009 , he agreed to a settlement and to sign a waiver of release in exchange for the payment , company CEO Laura Zaspel told investigators .
Employees of the software company , which reportedly had suffered financial difficulties since 2008 , related in part to the transfer of as much as $ 200,000 to a church or charity by Fowler , told investigators that Ciancio arrived around 10 a.m. Dec. 30 to collect his check .
After greeting former colleagues and asking them about their New Year ’s Eve plans , he asked to speak to Ubaldo Ciminieri , the company ’s vice president of sales and marketing , who had stepped away from his desk .
Ciancio then went downstairs to Fowler ’s office .
According to the arrest affidavit , the employees told investigators the next thing they heard was gunshots .
Police were called by another tenant in the Elati Building near West 84th Avenue and Elati Street in unincorporated Adams County .
When officers arrived at the building , they saw Fowler coming out through the door , bleeding from the face .
Investigators said he took one step past the threshold , then walked back in .
Police rushed into the building , and escorted Fowler back out .
When Fowler attempted to speak to police , blood rushed out of his mouth .
They asked if Ciancio was still in the building and he shook his head up and down to say “ yes . ”
They asked if Ciancio shot him and Fowler did not respond , investigators said .
Fowler was loaded into an ambulance and transported to Denver Health Medical Center , where he underwent emergency surgery .
During the surgery , police said , Fowler ’s hands were bagged to protect evidence of gunshot residue , which was later collected by investigators .
Inside Fowler ’s office , police found Ciancio ’s body .
They said he appeared to have been sitting at a table when he was shot .
They also found the murder weapon and four 9 mm Luger shell casings .
They found a handgun magazine on the table , and another in a closet in the office .
Investigators say the gun was registered to Andrew Hyung Fowler , 26 , who lived at 1413 L. Ron Hubbard Way in Los Angeles , when it was purchased .
In interviews with police , Andrew Fowler said he gave the gun to his father for Christmas in 2007 .
Police also found a briefcase and a typed note , dated Dec. 30 and signed by Fowler , that advised there was nothing confidential in the satchel and that it should be given to his wife , Janet .
When Janet Fowler was interviewed by detectives , she told them she wanted the briefcase returned immediately .
“ It is important to me and my church .
It is religious material and I want it now , ” she said to investigators .
“ Even if you looked at it , and read it , you would not understand anything in it .
Because it is way above a normal person and you would not know what it meant .
I want it back right now . ”
Janet Fowler also reportedly told investigators that her husband “ is a Scientologist and would not have gone without a fight .
He would have grabbed a gun in a struggle and would not have let someone shoot him . ”
She also told investigators that Ciancio had sent e-mails to Rex Fowler , threatening to hire an attorney and sue over money he said was owed him .
Adams County officials said Fowler is in custody , but would not say where he is being held .
He was last at Denver Health Medical Center , but his name no longer appears on patient rosters .
David Sirota observes in his column this week the really ugly nature of Glenn Beck 's express hatred of progressives , embodied in his CPAC speech :
To wild applause , he labeled this alleged tumor of " community " the supposedly evil " progressivism " -- and he told disciples to " eradicate it " from the nation .
The lesson was eminently clear , coming in no less than the keynote address to one of America 's most important political conventions .
Beck taught us that a once - principled conservative movement of reasoned activists has turned into a mob -- one that does not engage in civilized battles of ideas .
Instead , these torch - carriers , gun-brandishers and tea partiers follow an anti-government terrorist attack by cheering a demagogue 's demand for the physical annihilation of those with whom he disagrees -- namely anyone , but particularly progressives , who value " community . "
No doubt , some conservatives will parse , insisting Beck was only endorsing the " eradication " of progressivism but not of progressives .
These same willful ignoramuses will also likely say that the Nazis ' beef was with Judaism but not Jews , and that white supremacists dislike African - American culture but have no problem with black people .
Other conservatives will surely depict Beck 's " eradication " line as just the jest of a self - described " rodeo clown " -- merely the " fusion of entertainment and enlightenment , " as his radio motto intones .
But if Beck is half as smart as he incessantly tells listeners he is , then he knows it 's no joke .
What he 's describing , of course , is the very subject of my last book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right :
What motivates this kind of talk and behavior is called eliminationism : a politics and a culture that shuns dialogue and the democratic exchange of ideas in favor of the pursuit of outright elimination of the opposing side , either through suppression , exile , and ejection , or extermination .
Rhetorically , eliminationism takes on certain distinctive shapes .
It always depicts its opposition as beyond the pale , the embodiment of evil itself , unfit for participation in their vision of society , and thus worthy of elimination .
It often further depicts its designated Enemy as vermin ( especially rats and cockroaches ) or diseases , and disease - like cancers on the body politic .
A close corollary — but not as nakedly eliminationist — are claims that opponents are traitors or criminals and that they pose a threat to our national security .
Eliminationism is often voiced as crude " jokes , " a sense of humor inevitably predicated on venomous hatred .
And such rhetoric — we know as surely as we know that night follows day — eventually begets action , with inevitably tragic results .
Beck actually has been engaging in eliminationist rhetoric in attacking progressives since June of last year , though he 's been recently ratcheting it down to new depths .
I compiled the video above with a sampling from the past nine months .
In it , you can see Beck call progressives a " cancer " ( multiple times ) , " the disease that 's killing us , " a " virus , " a " parasite , " " vampires " who will " suck the life out " of the Democratic Party , and claim that progressives intend the " destruction of the Constitution " and will strike it a " death blow " .
As Sirota notes , Beck is taking us down a certain path with this kind of rhetoric , and it always , as Beck himself puts it , " ends badly . "
NEW DELHI , India —
Once upon a time , the beaches of Goa were known for free love .
But as a string of high - profile sexual assaults on tourists culminated in the alleged rape of a 9 - year - old Russian girl last week , the idyllic strip of sand along the Arabian Sea is fast gaining a fearful reputation .
The answer ?
According to the state 's ministry of tourism , those cute pre-teens in two - pieces are asking for it .
“ You can't blame the locals ; they have never seen such women .
Foreign tourists must maintain a certain degree of modesty in their clothing .
Walking on the beaches half - naked is bound to titillate the senses , ” New Delhi's Mail Today newspaper quoted Pamela Mascarhenas , Goa 's deputy director of tourism , as saying Friday .
GlobalPost could not reach Mascarhenas for comment .
But a spokesman for the Goa tourism department confirmed that — far from marking a departure from official policy — the official 's remark echoed previous statements by the tourism minister himself .
( Opinion : Goa is no rape capital )
“ I have not talked to her [ Mascarhenas ] on this issue directly , ” said Swapnil Naik , director of the Goa tourism department .
“ But I think that sentiment has also been echoed by our minister in one or two statements .
There is a degree of cultural shock for our native population when they see certain type of dressing . ”
Goa has been on the boil since Jan. 28 , when a 9 - year - old Russian girl was allegedly raped by two Indian men .
Following close on the heels of the alleged rape and murder of Scarlett Keeling , a British teenager , in 2008 , the incident sparked an immediate media feeding frenzy , as local TV channels broadcast interviews with the victim 's mother and the 9 - year - old girl herself .
The ongoing story culminated Jan. 30 with a scare headline reading , “ No Bikinis On Goa Beaches . ”
Naik said that there is no plan to ban bikinis .
“ It 's totally false , ” he said .
“ There was no such statement made . ”
Earlier in January , Goa Tourism Minister Francisco Pacheco announced that the government would no longer feature women in bikinis in its advertisements .
The state has not barred other tourism organizations for promoting fun in the sun , and it has not yet made any noises about imposing a dress code on the state 's revelers .
But weeks before Mascarhenas ' remark , the minister 's statement irked many Indians , who felt it implied that rape victims invite assault by dressing in particular ways .
“ Goa is a family holiday destination and not a sex tourism destination , ” Pacheco said Jan .
7 . “ We will make sure that bikini babes do not symbolize Goa tourism in future . ”
“ In India they still morally land the responsibility on the victim if the victim is a woman , because of cultural conditioning , ” said 35 - year - old Anurashi Shetty , a resident of Donapaula Goa .
“ [ The impression is always that ] she must have done something to provoke it .
It 's a national mindset . ”
That mindset includes many government servants .
“ The general impression that the government felt is going out to the domestic tourists and others is that Goa is a place where you can dress whichever way you want , and that may be one of the reasons for the rape cases and security problems we have been having recently , ” Naik said .
On Jan. 29 , Goa police arrested Aman Bharadwaj , prime suspect in the alleged rape , in Mumbai .
The central government and Goa administration have reportedly both been under pressure from Russia 's embassy in New Delhi .
But the speedy apprehension of a suspect may not warm diplomatic relations for long as India 's glacial court system grinds down victim and accused alike .
After the incident , the embassy criticized the Goa police for failing to protect tourists and threatened to recommend that Russians — the second - largest group of visitors to Goa — avoid the state in the future .
" We are shocked and deeply outraged by the reports about the disgusting incident in India 's well - known resort in Goa when a 9 - year - old child from Russia became another victim of a rapist , " the Russian Embassy said in a statement .
Comments about the way the 9 - year - old victim may have been dressed will not be a balm on Goa 's troubled waters .

Facebook announced the release of HipHop for PHP today .
Since apparently , I was the first person to , I need to do penance by clarifying what HipHop is and what it means for PHP .
For those of you who do n’t have time to read the rest , here is what HipHop for PHP is :
HipHop is a PHP - to - C++ cross-compiler .
What this means is it takes PHP code and translates it into C++ code for further compiling .
It is not another language .
It is not a just - in - time compiler ( JIT ) .
HipHop will be open - sourced by Facebook under the same licensing as the respective PHP codebase it sets to mirror .
Facebook hopes that the community will improve HipHop and add extensions to HipHop that mirror PHP functionality .
Also , it hopes that future PHP core development will code features that would be more amenable to optimizations that HipHop does .
HipHop was the current survivor of a number of projects over the years at Facebook to improve the performance of the site .
Facebook , as the second largest trafficked website in the world , is built mostly on PHP .
HipHop is currently running side - by - side next to many LAMP PHP servers at Facebook and they are claiming an average of 2 x increase in performance on those machines .
of the site .
Facebook , as the second largest trafficked website in the world , is built mostly on PHP .
HipHop is currently running side - by - side next to many LAMP PHP servers at Facebook and they are claiming an average of 2 x increase in performance on those machines .
HipHop accomplishes this by surveying the entire codebase of your PHP - based application with a parser and then building out a C++ project based on it .
The C++ project then compiles and runs as its own web server .
Because of this , Apache and the PHP Zend engine are completely bypassed .
In order for this to work , some features of the PHP language are no longer supported .
Also , C - specific PHP extensions will need to be translated to HipHop C++ extensions in order for them to run .
The benefit in speed is mostly due HipHop ’s static analyzer which parses your PHP code looking for ways to optimize dynamic parts into static maps .
Because of this , your performance gain may vary — more structured code is rewarded with larger performance boosts .
What HipHop means
If you use some open - source PHP applications on your hosted website , the answer is nothing .
You do n’t have the ability to compile HipHop , you do n’t have access to server restricted ports , etc .
If you are developing a PHP application that currently can be run on two servers or less ( or virtual servers in the cloud ) the answer is nothing .
You do n’t have the scale for this to be worth your time .
If you do not have a separate development and deployment environment , do n’t have a developer who knows C/C++ , or use any PHP libraries where the source is not available ( thankfully the encoded scripting market is small to non-existent in the PHP world ) , then the answer is nothing .
You do n’t have the development model that can support HipHop .
Also note , HipHop has bugs , and — given the state of APC development as a model — will never have true compatibility with PHP .
You ’ll need some resources to either recode around those bugs or fix HipHop .
If you are a developer of an open - source PHP application , then the answer is not much .
Most PHP applications will be deployed in a shared - hosted environment .
They wo n’t be using HipHop .
If you are a shared hosting company , the answer is not much .
This is because the HipHop parser needs access to all the PHP in an application in order for it to create a working project .
The exception is if you provide software as a service that you maintain ( say a static build of WordPress , or a custom site tool written in PHP ) .
You can have HipHop optimize this and get the performance increase .
If PHP is not the operational bottleneck of your web application ( your app spends a lot of time waiting on the database , disk , a 3rd party Web API call , etc. ) , the answer is not yet .
At this time , there ’s no point in getting a performance gain in PHP .
If you do n’t know what I ’m talking about , your bottleneck is the database . 😉
If you have an application already scaled across many machines , a significant number of them running PHP in processor - intensive tasks , have separate development / deployment , have your entire PHP source code , have modest C/C++ resources , then the answer is possibly .
It would n’t hurt for a developer there to try a hand at cross -compiling the PHP into HipHop and seeing if it runs .
An operational deployment will return about 50 % of those machines to a pool for other uses or future growth — or , put differently HipHop will basically double that processing on the same hardware / power .
If you make a turnkey application based on PHP , the answer is somewhat .
These are rare , but now you can shrink - wrap PHP into a binary .
This is n’t the intended use of HipHop , so some development might have to be done to get this fully supported .
Also this is a true binary , not an op - code compile — it can not run across platforms .
If you are developing a PHP framework , the answer is some .
If your framework can compile and run successfully in HipHop , then it should be a good selling point to enterprises in case their application becomes bottlenecked on performance .
If you have highly - cohesive parts of your architecture that fall into above requirements and those parts are weakly - coupled ( via API ? ) to the rest of the system , then the answer is a lot .
Those parts can probably benefit from HipHop , and it should be relatively easy to try it .
If you are making a decision on which web language to build your site in , the answer is a heck of a lot .
Arguing against PHP for performance reasons no longer holds water .
PHP under HipHop will probably now out - benchmark Perl , Python , Ruby and possibly even Java and C# .
In practice , you can get the advantages of having a scripting language without operational costs .
Moreover , because the target is C++ which is more easy to integrate as a library , if you have a multi- language support , you can now provide C++ , Python , and other languages with access to components that have before only been written in PHP ( without resorting to a web API ) .
If you are making an argument to recode your entire site from PHP to some other language , the answer is you just lost that argument .
( I never bought the argument of recoding an entire site from another language to PHP . )
There are language features , for better or for worse , that PHP must support and HipHop must not .
Because of it ’s unique approach to compiling , HipHop will never replace the Zend Engine .
Because it does n’t supersede PHP user - space syntax , HipHop does not and will never change PHP development ( much ) .
HipHop is a showcase .
With it the PHP world can point to Facebook as being the busiest site built in a scripting language in the world .
Visiting Facebook
The rumors have been flying over what ’s going on over at Facebook headquarters .
The word has been that a PHP team was brought in and made to sign non-disclosure agreements before discussing a PHP project that has been in development for the past two years .
— ReadWriteWeb
Since I have known about HipHop since before it was a project , I was one of those people invited to a Facebook PHP Summit on .
( I note a tad bit offense that I did n’t receive an invite to it until after my advent article — making me the .
I guess I ’m — or something . )
And ReadWriteWeb is wrong , we were specifically not under an NDA .
We were just politely asked to not talk about it until Facebook ’s official release today and not record a small section of the presentation where Facebook revealed internal performance numbers which they had n’t decided to release yet — these numbers , anyway , were subject to change since HipHop was still under development .
I ’ll be covering the first day of the summit in the order it was presented :
Scaling Facebook PHP at Facebook ( before HipHop ) HipHop for PHP How HipHop works Roadmap
But before that , I want to address some myths about PHP and clarify some misunderstandings about HipHop .
Question :
You are give two red balls , two green balls and two yellow balls .
One ball from each color is heavier than the other one .
All the heavier balls weigh the same and all the lighter balls weigh the same .
You are only provided with a weighing balance .
How many tries would it take to identify which one is heavier and which one is lighter ?
Answer : Let ’s label the balls R1 , R2 ( Red ones ) , G1 , G2 ( Green ones ) and Y1 , Y2 ( Yellow ones ) .
First weigh R1 , G1 on one side and R2 , Y1 on the other .
If they are equal , we know that one of G1 or Y1 is heavy .
We can just weigh them both and find out which one is heavier .
If G1 is heavy , the heavier set is { G1 , R2 , Y2} and the others are lighter .
If Y1 is heavy , the heavier set is { G2 , R1 , Y1} .
If R1 , G1 is heavy , we know that either G1 is heavy or Y1 is light .
We proceed to weigh G1 , Y1 with G2 , Y2 .
If they are equal , G1 is the heavy one .
The heavier set is { G1 , Y2 , R1} .
If G1 , Y1 is heavy , G1 and Y1 are both heavy .
The heavier set is { Y1 , G1 , R1} .
If G2 , Y2 is heavy , G2 and Y2 are both heavy .
The heavier set is { R1 , G2 , Y2} .
If R2 , Y1 is heavy , we know that either Y1 is heavy or G1 is light .
This is similar to the case above .
Try to work it out yourself before continuing with the solution .
Weigh G1 , Y1 with G2 , Y2 .
If they are equal , Y1 is heavy .
The heavier set is { Y1 , R2 , G2} .
If G1 , Y1 is heavy , G1 and Y1 are both heavy .
The heavier set is { G1 , Y1 , R2} .
If G2 , Y2 is heavier , G2 and Y2 are both heavy .
The heavier set is { G2 , Y2 , R2} .
Therefore , in any of these cases , we only need two tries with the balance .
If you like this puzzles , please Digg it or Tweet it to help spread the word .
Look , we 've all had rough days .
Ones that we wish never even happened , in fact .
But we 've yet to be pushed to the brink where the only logical solution to blow off steam would be to take an aluminum baseball bat to nearly three dozen
TVs that were n't ours .
For whatever reason ( the accused is pleading the Fifth ) , Westley Strellis waltzed into a Walmart just outside of Atlanta yesterday , where he proceeded to lift a bat from the sporting goods section and then demolish the screens of 29 televisions in the electronics department .
Shortly after , he submitted to a pair of handcuffs and 29 counts of criminal damage to property in the second degree , and if the initial tallies are correct , he somehow managed to mar over $ 22,000 worth of goods .
Chin up , Mr. Strellis -- maybe you 'll end up in a cell next to this brainiac P.S. - Store footage of the rampage is after the break .
Those workers “ were making impossible demands ” for the company to secure green cards for them or to repay the high fees , Mr. Schnoor said .
They were “ taking workers away from their work and actually trying to get them to join some effort they were organizing , ” he said .
Mr. Schnoor and Darrell Snyder , a manager in the shipyard , where the Indians were living in a labor camp , said they had consulted with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement for “ guidance ” on how to fire the workers , following the rules of the H - 2B program .
Mr. Schnoor said the “ direction ” he received from an immigration enforcement agent was this : “ Do n’t give them any advance notice .
Take them all out of the line on the way to work ; get their personal belongings ; get them in a van , and get their tickets , and get them to the airport , and send them back to India . ”
Signal managers said they tried to carry out those instructions on March 9 , 2007 , putting several Indian workers into vans to take them to the airport .
They were prevented from leaving the shipyard by immigrant advocates gathered at the gates .
In an internal e-mail message 10 days later , Mr. Snyder reported that another immigration official had assured him in a meeting that day that the agency would pursue any Indian workers who left their jobs , “ if for no other reason than to send a message to the remaining workers that it is not in their best interests to try and ‘ push ’ the system . ”
Carl Falstrom , an immigration lawyer in New Orleans who is not associated with the Signal case , said there were rules for employers who fired guest workers .
They are required to provide return airfare to the workers ’ home countries , and they are supposed to notify the visa agency , Citizenship and Immigration Services , when workers are no longer employed .
But , Mr. Falstrom said , private companies cannot carry out deportations .
Saket Soni , director of the New Orleans Workers ’ Center for Racial Justice , which represents some workers in the lawsuit , said the managers ’ testimony showed that immigration enforcement agents had “ advised the corporation on how to retaliate against workers who were organizing . ”
An ICE spokesman , Brian Hale , said he could not comment on a continuing investigation .
But Mr. Hale said ICE agents were generally aware that a company that fires workers in the H - 2B program “ is prohibited from compelling individuals to get on the plane . ”
More than 60 others were also hospitalised as torrential streams of water and liquid mud swept through the capital , Funchal , destroying homes , overturning cars and felling trees .
The Atlantic island , which lies around 600 miles south - west of Portugal , is a popular destination for British holidaymakers and is thought to have been busy this week with half - term visitors .
Last night the Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation , althought there were no reports of foreign tourists being killed or injured .
Like so many Routt County residents , I treasure our beautiful open spaces , our abundant wildlife and our community — where I so often see friendly and familiar faces .
In small towns , individuals find a sense of belonging and confidence that they can make a difference .
Unfortunately , as planet Earth becomes increasingly crowded , places such as ours are becoming increasingly rare .
It is easy to take relatively unspoiled natural beauty for granted .
But with human numbers currently at more than 6.8 billion and growing , planet Earth is losing its wild places at an unprecedented rate .
As painful as it is to confront the need to voluntarily limit births , the consequences of failing to do so will be far worse .
Our efforts to tread lightly , conserve energy , maintain wildlife habitat , and protect the environment that sustains us are underminded as we require Earth to support about 75 million additional people each year .
Many here and throughout the U.S. are working to reduce their consumption of resources , but in order to make any real overall progress , each year we must consume enough less to more than compensate for the demands of the 2.6 million people added annually to the U.S. ranks .
Continued population growth forces us — like the Red Queen in “ Through the Looking Glass ” — to run fast just to stay in the same place .
To prevent our best conservation efforts from becoming mere holding actions , population stabilization must become a cornerstone of environmental stewardship .

Bones of bird wing .

A newly published study in the journal Ecology finds evidence that the wing shape of birds in North America has changed over the last 100 years as an adaptation to the loss of forest habitat .
Andre Desrochers from the Universite Laval looked at over 800 museum specimens of boreal and temperate forest songbirds .
He found that over half of the species he examined demonstrated changes over time with boreal birds developing more pointed wings and temperate birds developing rounder wings .
These results support the hypothesis that habitat isolation is spurring evolutionary changes in birds .
Boreal forests have suffered severe deforestation over the past century , and so Desrochers had predicted that increased distances between habitat patches would select for more pointed wings in birds .
Pointed wings are associated with more energy - efficient sustained flight .
Conversely , temperate forests have undergone extensive afforestation ( i.e. expansion of cover ) over the past 100 years after an earlier period of forest loss .
So Desrochers hypothesized that evolution would be spurring more rounded wings in these birds given that pointed wings can have higher energy costs for take off and foraging .
According to the results , 11 of the 21 studied species showed changes in wing shape over time with 10 of the changes consistent with those predicted by the hypothesis .
As a control , the study also measured bill length and found little change over time .
Desrochers concedes that other factors could be at work - for example , the changes could be partly non-genetic effects of environmental stressors - but the Habitat Isolation Hypothesis gives the strongest explanation .
Such a rapid species evolution in response to environmental change would be remarkable and has direct relevance to conservation .
Desrochers writes ,
" Birds ’ ability to adapt rapidly to forest loss and fragmentation may mitigate , without necessarily preventing , the risk of regional extirpation of extinction .
Further research should investigate the potential for rapid evolution in response to habitat fragmentation in other parts of the World , in particular the tropics , where recent decline in habitat area , as well as lack of dispersal ability in birds , are sometimes drastic . " ﻿

Olive ’s art combines the avant - garde with the “ do not try this at home ” .

It 's funny and oddly compelling .

The film is of an installation by a contemporary French artist called Celeste Boursier - Mougenot .
It 's very Marcel Duchamp , the French artist who started the conceptual art ball rolling nearly a hundred years ago .
Duchamp pioneered combining everyday materials , philosophical comment and humour , an idea that seeped into places like the 1960s pop group the Bonzo Dog Doo -Dah Band ( they wanted to call themselves the Bonzo Dog Dada band , but worried people would n't get it ) and Monty Python .
But Duchamp 's more radical idea was to introduce chance into the creation of art .
In 1913 - 14 he made 3 Standard Stoppages , a work of art that was the result of the random actions of mechanised contraptions .
At the time , he was largely dismissed as a crazy Frenchman , but he inspired an entire avant - garde movement in art as well as the music of John Cage and the choreography of Merce Cunningham .
Duchamp was not short of self - confidence , but the idea of adding chance to the creative process was rather humble .
" That 's so random " is a common refrain nowadays , referring to a supposedly non-logical thought or event .
It was also the clarion cry of the Dadaists , the anti-art , anti-rational early - 20th - Century art movement that argued that it was rational thought that led to World War I .
Duchamp was much loved by the Dada movement .
I wonder what Dadaists would have made of the internet .
It 's interesting that , as far as I am aware , no contemporary artist has yet harnessed this extraordinary technology to make a significant artwork .
Of course , maybe I 'm wrong and am missing something great - do you know of any net - based art works that are worth a look ?
Maybe you have made one ( an artwork made specifically for the medium , as opposed to a film such as the one above , which uses the net only as a means of dissemination ) ?
If you , like me , ca n't find any net - based art of note , why do you think that is ?
Why , when there 's been such a boom in contemporary art around the world , has no artist made the medium of the web his or her canvas ?
And if someone were to use the net as a medium , as opposed to making an image , or a video , or even an interactive Flash animation , what would the resulting art look , or sound , or feel like ?
Duchamp and the Dadaists would have had hours of artistic amusement creating spoof websites , unintelligible Wiki entries and general questioning of the status quo .
Perhaps that is what Celeste Boursier - Mougenot should do next after the installation of his 40 Finches work opens at London 's Barbican art gallery on 27 February .
Like Duchamp , he seems to understand the creative potential of random acts and non-directed participation .
He 's already proved in this artwork that while Keith Richards and Eric Clapton might be masters of the Gibson Les Paul , even they cannot play it like 40 wild birds - not a chance .
Update 5 Feb : On Tuesday I asked : if , like me , you can't find any net - based art of note , why do you think that is ?
It was a question that had the effect of chucking a large stick into a hornet 's nest , and some of those commenting here and around the web are aghast that I should even pose such question .
Many comments have included links to a wide range of internet - based art .
Some of the work I knew well ; others I did n't and enjoyed seeing .
Thanks to all those who provided links .
Thanks also to Roberta who made an interesting comment regarding the post generating a useful archive of some net - based art .
It 's a good point ; please continue to add links .
But my question was of eminence not of existence .
As the Turner Prize - winning artist Jeremy Deller said recently to Charlotte Higgins of the Guardian , " I 'm still waiting for someone to use the internet , really use the internet .
We 're still in a post - Warhol era .
We have n't got beyond it . "
Of course there is plenty of net - art about and has been for some time , and for the net - art cognoscenti there are stand - out works and practitioners .
But for some , which includes many museum curators as well as Jeremy Deller , there has n't been that moment of epiphany , where they feel they have seen a great work of art created using the medium .
That does n't make them wrong or ignorant ; it 's just the subjective nature of the arts .
And I do n't think they 're alone .
Why , when the internet has become such a central part of people 's everyday lives and at a time when there is enormous interest in contemporary art , is there not one net - based artist or artwork that , say , the layman would recognise by name or output ?
To ask that question is in no sense to belittle the often intelligent , thoughtful and fascinating nature of net - based art , and it is not about being unaware of the presence of that art - it is to generate a debate : why , to many in the art world and the public in general , is it " not of note " ?
Maybe it 's just a issue of timing .
It took a while for video - based art to gain real traction .
Curators have told me that it was not until the likes of Bruce Nauman in the 1970s that artists using video started to become relatively well - known .
Perhaps , just by having this debate , knowledge of net - art will increase in the public consciousness .
It certainly has in mine .

AFP contributed to this report
An unidentified Palestinian man approached the Gaza border fence withIsrael on Sunday morning , prompting an IDF tank to fire shells in hisdirection .
The IDF said there were no casualties on either side during the incident , which occurred on the border with northern Gaza .
Palestinian medics claimed , however , that five Palestinian day laborers were hurt by the shelling .
Muawiya Hassanein , the head of Gaza emergency services , said two of the wounded were in serious condition .
It came after a similar incident on Saturday when unidentified Gazans approached the border with Israel , drawing mortar and machine gun fire from the IDF .
Palestinian sources said three people were wounded in that incident .
The suspects were spotted by a Gaza Division lookout walking toward the electronic fence near Kibbutz Kissufim early on Saturday morning .
Golani Brigade soldiers on the scene fired mortar shells and machine gun rounds at the suspects in response .
A remote - controlled machine gun deployed on the border fencer was also used by the army to fire on the suspects , according to one report .
The IDF Spokesman ’s Office said it could not respond to that claim .
Army sources say terrorists are continuously attempting to plant explosives targeting IDF patrols along the fence , and that an upsurge in such attempts has been noted in recent days .
Conflicting Palestinian reports on the identity of the individuals appeared in the hours after the incident , with some identifying the group as gunmen , while others claimed that some of the injured were “ farmers .
” On Thursday , an IDF soldier was lightly injured by shrapnel from a bomb planted on the Gaza border fence .
He was taken to Beersheba ’s Soroka University Medical Center .
Also on Saturday , IDF soldiers in the Hebron area opened fire on a vehicle containing two Palestinian youths who tried to run them over .
The incident began when the army received a report that severalPalestinians were at a parking lot for seized vehicles , to steal thecars .
When soldiers arrived , the suspects fled in a number of cars , one of which tried to run down the soldiers .
Palestinian sources said the two youths were lightly injured .
WASHINGTON —
At a closed briefing in 2003 , the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee raised no objection to a C.I.A. plan to destroy videotapes of brutal interrogations , according to secret documents released Monday .
The senator , Pat Roberts , Republican of Kansas , also rejected a proposal to have his committee conduct its own assessment of the agency ’s harsh interrogation methods , which included wall - slamming and waterboarding , the documents say .
But Mr. Roberts , through a spokesman , denied having approved the destruction of the videotapes , which is under criminal investigation , and defended his record in overseeing the interrogation program .
His assertions were backed by his former staff director on the Intelligence Committee , William D. Duhnke , who said that while the senator had not objected to the tapes ’ destruction , he was “ in receive mode ” and was simply listening to get the facts about the interrogation program , which he was learning about for the first time .
" The Iranian nation , with its unity and God 's grace , will punch the arrogance ( Western powers ) on the 22nd of Bahman ( February 11 ) in a way that will leave them stunned , " Khamenei , who is also Iran 's commander - in - chief , told a gathering of air force personnel .

Well , of course it is n’t , really .
They do n’t sound alike on their outer layers .
And their audiences do n’t overlap .
From the evidence of hundreds of jazz shows I ’ve seen all over the country this past decade , a whole lot of Americans over 60 feel a tremendous fondness for jazz and help it survive .
Most of those same people , I ’d guess , would feel a virulent loathing for metal , if they ever were forced to encounter it .
Currently , making it in jazz means playing a circuit of sit - down supper clubs and comfortable midsize theaters booked by nonprofit arts presenters , and , in summer , at European festivals .
If you make it in metal , you play a circuit of decent - to - horrible stand - up clubs .
( And , in summer , at European festivals . )
The aesthetic ideals could n’t be more different : jazz is about subtlety and , one wants to say , beauty ; metal is about intimidation , alienation and assault .
But then again , over the last decade jazz and metal have become harder to reduce and easier to like , in a sum - total kind of way .
And in the process they ’ve generated more and more points of comparison .
Jazz stages and metal stages are places where a certain kind of experimentation happens : brainy and cabalistic , with a hint of a smile .
Both increasingly depend on educated virtuosos .
In both genres you can develop curious harmonic worlds , warp the tempos , brush against folkloric or conservatory music , play many notes very speedily and engage sturdy American grooves or a more studied system of fitting odd - number beats into even - number meters .
Pat Metheny , jazz guitarist , meet Paul Masvidal of Cynic ; Jeff ( Tain ) Watts , jazz drummer , meet Tomas Haake of Meshuggah .
Both forms seem to have a neatly divided audience : maybe two - thirds respectfully fixated on the music ’s past , one - third concerned about building paradigms for the future .
BT never gets stuck in a rut .
From his explosion on the electronic music scene with 1994 ’s Ima to his innovative 2006 masterpiece This Binary Universe , the musician has made a career of stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point .
When BT hit a wall in the creation of sound , he simply sat down and came up with new ways to make music .
Developing the stutter edit , granular synthesis and nano - correcting , BT has created a bold new subgenre of music outside the realm of general electronica .
LISTEN : BT interview with Wired.com http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2010/01/bt_interviewfull64.mp3
The enigmatic producer , composer and audio whiz recently joined Wired.com for a Skype interview to talk about his new record ( These Hopeful Machines ) , his passion for making music , text - based gaming and a general geek - out about musical technology .
“ I watched about 8,000 people in Finland dance to this piece of music , ” BT said during the 30 - minute interview ( audio file embedded left ) .
“ And when it began to convolve from 4 / 4 to 6/8 , I thought , ‘ OK , here ’s the moment where a wormhole eats the room or I wish that the floor would split in half and swallow me whole , ’ but people understood intuitively how to move their bodies to it !
It was so exciting for me to watch ! ”
After listening to the full interview , embedded left , continue below for a review of These Hopeful Machines , which was released Tuesday as two tracks on iTunes and Amazon.com .
These Hopeful Machines review
Throughout his career , BT has created albums that transcend the pigeonholing that befalls most electronica .
From the vivid trance effects of IMA to the pop-heavy Movement in Still Life to the composed and elaborate depth of This Binary Universe , BT has not been satisfied sticking to one method that works .
He has found many methods that work , and created his own methods to complement the foundation of the music .
These Hopeful Machines is the culmination of years of that type of meticulous and mathematical creation .
Before contemplating the music he makes , one must understand what makes BT tick and why he is n’t just another electronica artist or a simple DJ .
BT is what an avant - garde classical composer would be if he had access to cutting - edge software and technology , or even rudimentary software and technology ( as BT has been known to use older methods of recording to create distinctive sounds . )
To put it simply ( as one Tampa radio DJ did ) , BT is the “ MacGyver of electronica . ”
Math and invention are major parts of BT ’s process in making music , and the attention to detail is much more than stringing some catchy loops together over a backbeat .
On These Hopeful Machines , however , every past element BT has utilized is realized in new and imaginative ways .
With constant improvements to the software BT created to manipulate sound , These Hopeful Machines incorporates many elements of past albums , with near - perfect transition .
One might say that this attention to detail would create a stiff and robotic - sounding album .
One would be wrong .
Instead , it ’s an album of ultimate depth and movement .
With traditional elements of house and trance throughout These Hopeful Machines , the elements in between create a distinctive musical signature .
Mathematically placed edits and loops create a depth that is n’t reflected in most electronica , much less any other genre of music .
It ’s an electrical orchestration .
The minute of glitchy breakbeats before the first song and the addition of acoustic guitar within the intros and breaks , overlaid with heavy dance beats , create a lasting impression .
Starting off with the first single , “ Suddenly , ” a guitar - heavy track with BT doing the vocals as well , These Hopeful Machines slides through several musical transitions effortlessly .
While the album is split into 12 tracks that can be listened to singly , the intent of the album can only be compared to Jethro Tull ’s Thick as a Brick .
While not a concept album , These Hopeful Machines is best listened to in two pieces rather than one piece at a time here and there .
Personally , I listened to each half on my hour - long commute to and from work .
For the first time , BT includes a cover song on this album : “ The Ghost in You ” by The Psychedelic Furs .
Recorded on tape ( you heard that right ) and mainlined with BT ’s distinctive hooks , it retains its sentimental feeling while being refreshed at the same time .
These Hopeful Machines also features guest appearances by Rob Dickinson , Jes ( formerly of Motorcyle ) and The Police ’s Stewart Copeland , who lends a drum breakdown .
Instead of 12 individual tracks , BT chose the two - track method in order to give the listener the full experience of a collective piece .
Clocking in at about eight minutes shy of two hours , this double - disc album will not leave you lamenting about limited length .
It ’s such a well - composed album that it ’s almost necessary to listen to These Hopeful Machines in one sitting .
At some points , the signature BT sound disappears , only to rely on simple house beats and loops .
While mostly transitions or breaks , these sections remind the listener that no matter how innovative the music may seem at some points , it ’s not 100 percent new .
They do n’t distract from the album as a whole , but if you are track - skipping or fast - forwarding , the flow will be disrupted .
Spending the last several years on the record , BT ’s intent was to make the listening experience as deep and engaging as possible .
As BT puts it : “ There are so few things now that will engage us .
The intent of consuming music is usually to have an awareness or a feeling , to have a truly empathic connection to others .
My hope is to create something that makes people feel that they have consumed something that completes a void .
I want to create something lasting . ”
He has achieved his goal .
If you ’ve never liked electronica before , this is the release that could change your mind .
WIRED Generous mixture of BT ’s past musical themes ; extremely innovative approach to making music .
TIRED Electronica purists may not like BT ’s range and innovation .

The children 's commissioner for England says children should not be held in immigration detention centres - and conditions should be better if they are .
How does such detention affect children ?
For many detained children , their relationship with Yarl 's Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire begins with what is effectively a " dawn raid " .
Detention is not good for mental health
This can be a demoralising and even traumatising event , says Theresa Schleicher , referral manager at Medical Justice , a charity which offers independent advice to asylum seekers in detention .
" Enforcement officers come early in the morning , when often the parents and the children are asleep . "
They bang on the door and often there is a lot of shouting when they come into the house , she says .
" The parents have to sit down , they are not allowed to pack , so the children have to do that if they are old enough .
If not , the officers will do it .
" The Home Office now says that they always have an officer there for the children , but it 's still a load of officers coming into a house and telling people to get out and that they are being arrested . "
He just sat in the corner with his head in his hands
Dr Miriam Beeks Miss Schleicher says children do not always understand what is happening , and may think that they have done something wrong .
It is not always explained to them why they are being taken away from their home , she says .
This arrest process is the subject children complain about most consistently , according to the children 's commissioner , Sir Al Aynsley - Green .
He has published a progress report into conditions at Yarl 's Wood - saying while physical conditions have improved since his last report in 2009 , there are still issues around arrests , separation from parents and lack of information .
" Caged vans " are no longer used to transport children to the centre , he says - but this has the unintended consequence of separating young children from their parents at the point of arrest .
Miss Schleicher agrees with the children 's commissioner that this can be potentially extremely damaging for the child .
" There was a case recently of an already traumatised child , aged nine , being separated from his parents for several hours , " she said .
" This would make the child feel quite lost , make them feel their parents are not able to protect them - make them feel absolutely helpless . "
' So depressed '
Once in the centre , children are held for an average of 14 days , but a handful have been held for several months .
The longer they are there , the worse it is .
Dr Miriam Beeks is a volunteer doctor with Medical Justice , and writes medical reports for asylum seekers and their children held at Yarl 's Wood .
The Home Office says children at Yarl 's Wood are held in the best possible circumstances
One case particularly sticks in her mind .
" There was one child who had been detained before , he was extremely traumatised .
He had been having counselling with the Children 's Society .
" He was born in the UK and did n't know anywhere else .
" He just sat in the corner with his head in his hands .
He was extremely worried about his mother and kept saying : ' It 'll be OK . '
" He said he remembered them knocking on the door early in the morning and shouting , and the same thing had happened again . "
She also remembers an 18 - year - old mother being held there who was so depressed that she could barely talk .
" There was this toddler just hanging on to her , and she 'd lost about 20 % of her body weight in the previous month due to depression . "
She was also horrified to learn recently of a child aged 12 and a younger sister , both with advanced HIV , who were deported to a country where they were very unlikely to be able to get the drugs they needed to keep them alive .
" It was as good as a death sentence , " she says .
Closed doors Miss Schleicher acknowledges there have been improvements in the way Yarl 's Wood deals with children .
There is now a nursery for children , a new youth club and two classrooms - one for primary school age children and one for secondary school age children .
A place like that can never be nice for children
Former Yarl 's Wood detainee ' Lucy ' The Home Office insists that children detained at Yarl 's Wood are held in the best possible circumstances .
It does not recognise many of the criticisms in the children 's commissioner 's report , and it also points out that the centre 's nursery has been given a very good report by Ofsted .
But Miss Schleicher says some volunteers who work at the centre say what remains is the general culture of disbelief , where even medical needs can be dismissed as attempts to get out of deportation .
And being detained can still be a terrifying experience .
One recent detainee , Lucy ( not her real name ) says her three - year - old boy goes into hysterics every time he sees someone wearing black and white - the colour of the Yarl 's Wood uniform .
She feels that there will be a long - term consequence of the seven weeks she spent there with her two children , one of whom is only a year old .
" The treatment there is nasty - it is not very nice treatment at all .
A place like that can never be nice for children , " she says .
Miss Schleicher says the problem is that children simply do not understand what is going on .
" They have n't committed any crime , they can't imagine why their parents are being imprisoned for coming to this country .
" Sometimes the children think they must have done something wrong .
" Often detainees are being picked up in the night to be deported , and children can hear the screams and cries of the others being collected for deportation . "
Detention is n't good for anyone 's mental health , says Dr Beeks - least of all children .
When a visitor comes to see a child at Yarl 's Wood , the child will often make for the door to try to get out .
It is only natural , says Miss Schleicher .
" They see the door through which the visitor - the non-detained person - came as the way to freedom .
" They do not understand that there are other doors that they will have to get through to reach the outside . "

( CNN ) --
The United States and Mexico should both legalize marijuana in an attempt to break the power of the Mexican drug cartels and end the spiraling violence south of the border , a former Mexican foreign minister said Tuesday .
Jorge Castaneda , in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour , said marijuana " should be legalized in both countries , " and said it is ridiculous for Mexico to try to stop marijuana from entering the United States when it 's legally sold for medical purposes in California .
" The Drug Enforcement Administration says that 60 percent of the Mexican ( drug ) cartels ' profits come from marijuana .
If we start with that , it 's a big chunk , " he added .
" We can't do everything overnight ... and we can't do it in Mexico if the U.S. does n't do it at the same time . "
Castaneda strongly criticized Mexican President Felipe Calderon for declaring war against the drug cartels , a war that has cost as many as 17,000 lives since he took office in December 2006 .
In the past month alone , 900 people were killed -- a new monthly record , he said .
Sixteen students died in what 's thought to be a drug - related massacre in the border city of Juarez over the weekend .
" It 's hard for me quite honestly -- and I think for many Mexicans -- to accept that the more deaths we have , the more successful the strategy is , " he added .
" I think President Calderon rushed into this , and now we 're paying the consequences . "
Mexico 's consul general in New York , Ruben Beltran , who also served in the U.S. border states of California and Arizona , strongly disagreed with Castaneda 's assessment .
" Are we going to raise the white flag ?
Are we going to surrender ?
Are we going to surrender the ability of the government to look for the rule of law and secure the rule of law ? " he asked .
" I do n't think there 's an alternative , " he said .
" The monopoly of force -- use of force -- pertains to the state , and the state is the one who should use the force to secure the stability of the country . "
Calderon has sent 45,000 troops to help overstretched police departments fight the drug cartels .
" What we 're witnessing right now is maybe the peak of that violence , " Beltran said .
" Let me assure you that the Mexican government is not going to relinquish its duty to confront organized crime , and that 's what 's happening right now . "
Castaneda , however , said Mexico is paying an enormously high price because of the aggressive approach of the Calderon government .
He said the administration should be seeking to contain drug cartels , not destroy them .
" It 's not different from what 100,000 American troops are doing in Afghanistan with heroin .
Not one of those troops is combating the heroin traffic from Afghanistan .
They 're containing it because they have other priorities , " he said .
Beltran conceded it 's going to take more than one administration in Mexico City to defeat the drug cartels .
He also called on the United States to provide more help : " In order for Mexico to be successful in this war , we need increased cooperation with the United States to stem the flow of cash , weapons , and ammo from the United States to Mexico . "
Castaneda , however , said that on a recent trip across the border from San Diego , California , to Tijuana , in the Mexican state of Baja California , there was not the slightest inspection of any car crossing from north to south , on either the U.S. or Mexican side of the border .
" They can't do it .
It 's too expensive , " he said .
" The local communities do n't want it .
It backs up queues tens of miles north , the same way as in the south .
They 're not going to do it . "
Castaneda 's observation puts in question a promise by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano in March last year , when she said , " We 're sending technology to the border that will allow us to scan or do non-invasive X - rays to see whether cars are carrying assault weapons , other kinds of weapons , that are flowing into Mexico to fuel these drug cartels . "
The Peruvian pilot is heard on the tape saying he is sure the plane is a " bandito " but the CIA pilots then suggest they are not sure , wth one saying : " I think we 're making a mistake . "
Another says : " I agree with you . "
Three California men are being held on $ 1 million bond for allegedly hauling a ton of marijuana across Illinois .
And that 's not a figure of speech .
We mean an actual ton .
Two , actually .
" That 's a record for me , " said Douglas County State 's Attorney Kevin Nolan , who has been in office six years , in a press release .
" My previous big ones have been about 200 pounds . "
On Monday night , Illinois State Police stopped a semitrailer truck on Interstate 57 in Tuscola , a town about 30 miles south of Champaign .
A drug - sniffing dog found 4,400 pounds of cannabis tucked away among crates of vegetables .
That 's over two tons !
At that point , do you really need the dogs anymore ?
The three men— Jesus Guzman , 31 ; Eric Cabrera , 35 ; and Joshua Cornilllez , 32 — told police they began their long bong haul in San Antonio and Dallas and were on their way to Chicago .
A judge set bond at $ 1 million each on Tuesday .
The men are due back in court on February 23 .
Charges have not officially been filed yet , but Nolan says the trio will likely face cannabis trafficking , which carries a prison term of up to 60 years ( given the size of their loot ) .

My energy level is flying high , and I find I 'm needing fewer mid-day coffee pick - me-ups .

Very occasionally RPS runs development diaries from game development teams .
Most recently we received one from Sakari Games , who released cartoon combat game Foreign Legion : Buckets Of Blood in late 2009 .
Written by Pepijn Rijnders , the art lead of Sakari Games , this diary tells the story of how this commercially release game went from Global Game Jam experiment to full - time project for the Sakari team .
We think it might make interested reading for all your active or prospective game developers out there , or anyone interested in the indie game process .
Okay , over to Mr Rijnders …
Foreign Legion : Buckets of Blood is made with Blender and Unity3D .
When we started the project , the Unity3D engine was rather new to us .
We tried it at the Global - Game - Jam weekend in February 2009 , and had a nice experience with it .
Since we are a very small team and had to invest in the game ourselves we wanted to make a small but attractive game : something you could play to kill some time , and something that would run even on a low - end machine to keep our market as broad as possible .
We dug up an old game concept and made it – let ’s say – less politically sensitive .
The bottom line was that it should be a 3rd person 3d shooter so easy to play that even your mum could enjoy it .
The style for the game was developed by me , Pepijn .
It started with some rough sketches of the main character .
We wanted to make it look cartoonish but not childish .
Our reason to go for a cartoon style was that we could add a decent ( read : huge ) amount of blood and gore , like the exploding suicide bombers in the game , without us being marked for it in a bad way .
Like Tom and Jerry , which is very violent too but does n’t get the blame for kids being aggressive .
Another good thing about the style is that it works well with few polygons .
To us shape is more important than detail .
Because the entire world has the same level of detail the elements all blend - in nicely .
Next to shape comes shading .
We do n’t use any heavy stuff like normal - maps , or cell - shading .
We tried messing with it a bit but the result tended to look a bit flat , like we were using it to cover - up something .
In the end we noticed that with a little tweaking on the light - settings in Unity3D the atmosphere and the shadows came out really well .
Since we funded the development of this game ourselves and we only had enough budget for a couple of months , we planned the game really tight .
The basic game - design Merlijn made was only a couple of pages and from that we made a rough planning of all the assets in a Google doc , including props , characters , animations , sounds and so forth .
Merlijn and Pepijn made placeholders for all the objects so when Sander started coding he would n’t have to wait for artwork .
When all place holders where made the basic gameplay rules where implemented by Sander .
Once we had some thing playable , which came down to a moving character that could shoot other characters , which followed a path and disappeared when hit .
Merlijn started designing the level and working with the tools given .
In the mean while Pepijn started polishing the assets and animating all characters .
Getting the animations in the game was kind of tricky .
We planned the animation to be out sourced but there where few animators available at that moment and even fewer that could do it in Blender .
So Pepijn had that added to his to - do list .
In production we noticed that the animations in Unity did not really match the animation in Blender .
This really surfaced when we made the animation of the air - raid bomber .
It looked as if the plane hesitated in its flight .
The reason for this was the way the animation was sampled when converted to fbx .
Instead of being liniar or bezier for some reason it was set to stepped .
And that was than interpreted as curved in Unity .
Than something amazing happened , on Friday we send out an email to Campbell Barton who wrote the .fbx exporter for Blender .
And on Monday he send us a new exporter fixing our problem .
No not Monday a month after the the deadline , but the next monday .
3 days , weekend days … well you get what I trying to say .
So once again kudos for Blender ; the indie game developers weapon of choice
The animations where redone twice because we had to change the animation system a couple of times .
Since we worked on such a tight schedule and lost some time we took peace with animation system for now and Sander got to the million other things to implement : the hud , the controls , the menu , the special weapons , the pick - up system , the scoring system , the the implementation of the music system , tweakable game - play functionality .
Well , basically everything that is needed by the game´s logic .
We used a lot of dummy assets during development .
For instance our sound assets : at the start of the project we made dozens copies of a bleep sound file to allow the programmer to play the right sound file at the right moment .
Our sound engineer , Noel Wessels , would later on overwrite the sound files with the correct sound and could instantly hear his changes .
For the music we wanted to something dynamic , something that pushed the action but calms down when the pace of the game slows .
And on top of that we wanted a heavy metal ring to it .
This to emphasize the type of game we wanted it to be : not taking cover , but gun-blazing , full - frontal attacks .
For source control we used TortoiseSVN .
But that was maybe not such a wise choice .
Unity has a nice asset server we noticed later on after the project but we had to spare our dimes on food and water so TortoiseSVN is was .
The problem was mainly in the meta - data that Unity uses .
For that reason only one person could work on the scene at the time .
To make sure you would not submit your scene while some one else was working on it we used a physical wrech with the label “ lock ” on it .
The person that had it had to have it on his desk .
Once he submitted all his changes the lock was handed over in an almost ceremonial way so no data would be lost .
And still the data did hit the fan at more than one occasion .
Sander gladly knows his way very well with SVN but it felt un-natural to work this way .
After the project we bought the asset server for Unity and boy did we regret not getting it earlier .
Personally I prefer production teams to be as small as possible .
We mainly worked with an artist / animator , level - designer , coder combination .
Not an overkill on documentation and a global idea for the game - play that was clear to every one .
Knowing what you are supposed to do is very important in game development .
And if you end up off track it ’s great to just turn your head and ask if anyone is planning to start on a feature that needs your input somehow .
The master - plan with small games should always be : make the game fun to play .
Maybe this counts for big games too …
An other advantage of small teams is flexibility .
You do n’t have a chain of command for each decision to run through .
I think game - play tests are the best moment to decide rather you are on the right track or not .
You cant go from fps to rts but having the parameters to tweak exposed in your game - editer and even during the play - testing allows you to balance the game early on .
This was kind of a positive side effect of using Unity and having little time .
Sander just exposed anything we might want to tweak so he did n’t have to focus on those things while implementing other features .
Simple because we did not have the time for it .
At the end of the third month everything in the game needed to work properly and the visuals needed to look final .
At that moment a lot was in place , but not everything was finished yet .
Merlijn pulled it off to make it quite fun to play too .
The testers reaction so far were mainly : “ Can we kill the chickens yet ? ” , “ Are there more maps ? ” and “ Is there a multi- player version as well ? ” .
A week later the chickens could be killed and some game play issues where addressed .
But unfortunately , our budget was too small to accommodate the demand for more maps and a multi-player mode for the first release : we had to release soon .
So we made the promise on our blog that we will update the game with more maps for free and later on extend it with a multi-player .
Elise took care of the paper work and Sander dove into the integration of our game in the Steam Platform while Pepijn supplied the artwork for the achievements and needed media material .
On August 5th , 2009 , the game was published on Steam .
Now , we can look back at the past 4 months with a big smile , and we ‘re looking forward to a successful independent future .
We previously wrote about Buckets Of Blood here .
My stance on climate change is clear : the scientific evidence that we 're getting warmer is overwhelming , and the most likely cause is that it 's human - produced .
The first is fact , the second is a conclusion based on a lot of evidence .
Climategate showed us that the noise machine is in full swing ; nothing in those emails takes away from the fact that there are multiple and independent lines of evidence that we 're warming up .
And the talking heads on Fox and other right - wing media saying that the harsh winter is evidence against global warming shows how dumb of an argument they 're willing to make .
But it 's not just the stuffed shirts in the media making their own reality as they go along ; some people in the government are trying to legislate it .
Climate change deniers in both Utah and South Dakota have passed resolutions essentially condemning the science and reality of climate change .
In Utah it was just a broadside at the science ; in South Dakota it 's aimed at a " balanced teaching of global warming in the public schools . "
Yeah , sounds familiar , does n't it ?
Besides the creationist analogies , the South Dakota resolution sounds like something out of 1984 :
WHEREAS , the earth has been cooling for the last eight years despite small increases in anthropogenic carbon dioxide ;
Wrong !
The Earth has been warming overall , and the last decade was the warmest on record , with records going back to 1880 .
WHEREAS , there is no evidence of atmospheric warming in the troposphere where the majority of warming would be taking place ;
Wrong !
The troposphere is warming .
WHEREAS , historical climatological data shows without question the earth has gone through trends where the climate was much warmer than in our present age .
Yes , and the Earth went through a period of heavy bombardment from asteroids and comets a few hundred million years after it formed .
Just because something happened once does n't make it safe .
WHEREAS , carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but rather a highly beneficial ingredient for all plant life on earth .
Many scientists refer to carbon dioxide as " the gas of life " ;
Wow .
I mean , wow .
Let 's lock these guys in a room filled with CO 2 for an hour or two and see how much life is left in them .
And I love the " many scientists " line .
You know what ?
A whole lot more scientists call it a greenhouse gas .
Wow .
WHEREAS , more than 31,000 American scientists collectively signed a petition to President Obama stating : " There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , or methane , or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the earth 's atmosphere and disruption of the earth 's climate ... "
This petition has been thoroughly debunked before ; it 's nothing more than an attempt to muddy the waters by deniers .
However , my absolute favorite part of the South Dakota resolution is this next bit .
Are you sitting down ?
Good :
NOW , THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED [...]
( 2 ) That there are a variety of climatological , meteorological , astrological , thermological , cosmological , and ecological dynamics that can affect world weather phenomena and that the significance and interrelativity of these factors is largely speculative ; and
Wait , what ?
Did those guys in the South Dakota legislature actually say astrological ?
Geez , no wonder they can't figure out that global warming is real .
They think they 're reading their horoscopes !
It makes me wonder if they just want the planet to warm up so that their state has milder winters .
It angers me that the science of so many topics has been warped and mutilated by people with a political agenda .
I have no such agenda , except to speak the truth as I see it .
I make no money if global change is real , I get no power , no thrill .
In fact , the idea of a substantially warmer planet scares me , if not for myself , then for my daughter and everyone destined to live in that environment .
The politicians who would vote yes on these resolutions are doing so out of a near - religious belief that global warming is not real -- they 're the otter in that picture .
Contacting them probably wo n't help ; I suspect that if every last constituent they had contacted them , they would still cleave to their beliefs .
But I urge people to write their congressional representatives anyway .
And spread the word ; if these two states deny reality this blatantly , then others will follow .
Bet on it .
So :
And if other states follow suit , they may doom all of us .
NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit recorded this fisheye view with its rear hazard - avoidance camera after completing a drive during the 2,169th Martian day , or sol , of Spirit 's mission on Mars ( Feb. 8 , 2010 ) .
NASA 's hobbled Mars rover Spirit has made its last shortdrives of the season and is now parked for the Martian winter , which missionmanagers hope it will survive .
Spirit got stuck in a sand trap on Mars last April and NASA officialsannounced last month that they were putting a halt on the efforts to free thelong - lived rover .
Instead , NASA started a newmission for Spirit , one that will use the six - wheeled robot as a stationaryscience outpost .
The change for Spirit came after more than six years spentroaming the Martian surface .
Spirit landed on Mars in January 2004 a few weeks ahead of its twin Opportunity , which is working fine and roving to a giant crater on the other side of Mars .
The rover team is commanding Spiritthis week to make additional preparations for the Mars southern hemispherewinter season and does n't plan to tell the rover to move its wheels again untilspring .
" We have hope that Spirit will survive this cold , darkwinter that we have ahead of us and be ready to do more science comespringtime , " said Steven Squyres , the rover mission ? s principalinvestigator at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , when NASA announcedSpirit ?s stationary plan on Jan. 26 .
Stuck on Mars
Spirit 'slast drive before winter took place on Feb. 8 , when the rover changed theangle of its suspension system , but it did not produce a hoped - for improvementto the overall tilt of the solar array for catching winter sunshine .
The last set of drives , taken since Jan. 15 , have moveSpirit 13 inches ( 34 cm ) to the south - southeast .
But the rover has n?t been able to maximize its tilt to catchas much of the low winter sun 's rays as possible during and is left in aposition tilted 9 degrees to the south .
Spirit 's parking positions for itsprevious three Martian winters tilted northward .
Engineers anticipate that , due to the unfavorable tilt forits fourth Martian winter , Spirit will be out of communication with Earth forseveral months .
Robot hibernation
Spirit may enter a low - power hibernationmode within a few weeks , shutting down almost all functions .
The rover is expected to keep its master clock running and check its power status periodically until it hasenough power to reawaken .
It may go in and out of this mode a few times at thebeginning and at the end of an extended hibernation period .
This week the rover team is uploading schedules to Spiritfor when to communicate with Earth or with the orbiting Mars Odyssey during therest of this year and into 2011 .
Spirit will use these schedules whenever ithas adequate power to wake up .
Spirit will take a set of " before " images ofsurroundings from the parked position this week , for comparison with images inthe Martian spring to study effects of wind .
Images toward the south will also aid preparations forpossible future drives , although , with only four of its six wheels stillworking , the rover is not expected to move farther than short repositioningdrives .
Other preparations for winter will include putting therobotic arm into a position for studies of atmospheric composition when poweris available and changing the stow positions of the high - gain antenna andpanoramic camera to minimize shadowing of the solar panels .
The Making of a Movement
Sometimes I get asked how to develop a movement , mostly because I had the opportunity to lead a “ Youth movement ” in my denomination in the 1980 ’s and they ask me , “ how ’d you do it ” often when they take over a district or denominational job or launch a parachurch organization .
I do n’t know that I ’m any sort of expert on these things and something you ca n’t repeat things done in the past .
Nevertheless I ’m listing here my “ recipe ” of sorts based on my experience creating and leading the “ youth movement ” in the 1980 ’s ( and some subsequent research on other movements ) in case any of it applied today .
I do n’t know if any of this applies to a local church or not — but I have recently revised it for a headquarters person and a parachurch leader so I thought I ’d share it today .
While there is no guarantee mixing these elements will create a movement , these are still the most common characteristics of past movements .
The “ ingredients ” of a movement
1. Initiating Leader
Most movements are initiated by a man or women who feels compelled to “ call out ” that movement .
While you may not possess all the characteristics of “ movement leaders ” you should posses most , or at least be moving that way .
Some people have these characteristics by birth , others acquire them from their family as they are growing up ( which is why leadership often runs in families ) still others develop them by discipline and accountability .
Whatever , live with these characteristics every day and help God develop them in your life if you intend to start or lead a “ movement . ”
Anointed by God — the leader senses a “ chosen - ness ” for leadership .
Chance - Taker — not fearing failure .
not fearing failure .
Change - Agent — dissatisfaction with the present ; compelled to change things .
Commitment — eat , sleep , walk , talk , and dream about THE GOAL .
eat , sleep , walk , talk , and dream about THE GOAL .
Concentration — singleness of purpose ; “ This one thing I do . ”
thing I do . ”
Conviction — unswerving in living according to own standards .
Destiny– sense that you have come to the kingdom for this .
Drive — working harder and longer than most others .
Enthusiasm — so excited that others are attracted to follow .
Generous — the flow of leadership is to the people not the leader .
Goal - Driven — arranging day - to - day activities to achieve long range goals .
Imaginative — not limited by conformity ; drawn to new ways to do things .
Initiator — starts things , “ initiates initiatives . ”
Passionate — really cares about the cause ; spins like a “ small sprocket ” .
People - Person–regardless of my natural temperament .
Persistent — just wo n’t stop even when coming up against barriers .
Persuasive — you motivate , inspire , and challenge other people to action .
Positive–insist on seeing the brighter side of all situations .
Standing Alone — able to withstand the loneliness of leadership .
Vision — seeing what God wants to accomplish through your leadership .
Of course no one person has all these qualities — I ’m surely not .
But this should be the kind of leader you want to become in general .
We can develop many of them fairly well and all of them can be developed partially .
They at least should be our aim .
Some argue that there is no such thing as a movement — only movement leaders .
That is , they argue that this kind of person creates a movement naturally whatever they do and wherever they minister .
I ’m not sure about that but I have seen it happen .
At least many of these characteristics of “ movement leader types ”
Are good characteristics anyway — so consider setting up a plan for self - improvement so you become this kind of leader and perhaps the movement will grow out of who you are not just what you want to do .
2. Sacred Gathering
If you are a leader and have in mind what the movement should be , next plan a meeting .
Get ready to have this meeting at least annually , perhaps in regions or districts , or even zones if you are a denominational leader .
Most movements have a “ sacred place ” where they gather regularly — a retreat , a conference , a place where God moves and the people relate to others in the movement ; a place they return to year after year for refreshing , refueling , planning , strategizing , reunion , relationships , motivation , and to remember the cause .
Such a meeting should be :
Directed outward — the aim of the meeting should be directed toward the local church and not “ upward ” toward the headquarters or district or sponsoring parachurch organization .
“ F ortifying ” – the attendees need to be strengthened — coming back from your meetings better people , better equipped and with better resources and not just coming home talking about how great you or your organization or department is .
” – the attendees need to be strengthened — coming back from your meetings better people , better equipped and with better resources and not just coming home talking about how great you or your organization or department is .
Spiritual life change — life change should be in the center and the main event of your “ programming ” leaving strategy second — the primary problems of the church are not structural but spiritual .
When God moves on us His will gets done — even if the spiritual work of God seems “ unrelated ” to the cause ( of course no spiritual work of God is ever unrelated to the cause ) .
A meeting does not guarantee a movement , but without a meeting there will never be a movement .
The initiating leader ( # 1 ) plans the meeting — a “ sacred gathering . ” # 2 ) .
3. Worthy Cause
At the meeting call the people to the cause not yourself .
A movement cannot survive without a worthy cause .
Evangelism , reaching youth for Christ , discipling children , camping , itinerant speakers — whatever … the cause must be worthwhile .
At the meting the “ critical Mass ” or “ cadre ” of people “ catches ” the vision for the cause from the leader .
Vision is “ communicable ” to others — they “ catch it ” from us .
Gather your people and bombard them with the cause and the vision — let them “ catch ” your passion , let them “ join hearts ” with others and commit to the cause - vision - mission .
The mission or cause must be :
clear ,
repeatable ,
memorable ,
sustainable ,
reinforced constantly , and
supported with story and testimony .
Make sure the people know they are committed to a cause not a person .
You need to be a significant influence on the movement — but the movement cannot be about following you — it must be about the cause .
You will know you are effective at this when you leave this work — if they hardly notice you are gone and commitment to the cause continues or even increases then you have succeeded .
4. Frequent Contact
A cadre of people can gather with an anointed leader in September but if there is no contact within a month the movement will fizzle .
The initiating leader arranges for continued contact — at least monthly , probably more .
Now you are a leader of a group who has had a meeting and are excited about the cause .
You ’ve begun “ spinning plates ” but if you do not revisit those plates often they will soon run out of steam and crash to the floor .
The 2nd law of thermodynamics is at work — “ entropy . ”
So make frequent contact with your “ cadre ” to spin the plates again — the cause and calling of your movement .
Soon after the meeting you should circulate reports on what has changed since the meeting — including “ testimonies ” of personal life change with or without names attached .
When people recognize names of friends they made at the meeting they feel a part of something beyond their local church .
Recollection .
The leader constantly recalls the past meeting “ coming through the Red Sea ” and reports the present activity of the people .
They see something is happening –this was not “ just another meeting . ”

Create anticipation .
The leader also creates anticipation of the next meeting .
The recipients feel they are part of a group , a club , a “ cadre ” of people and the leader is connecting and communicating between them .
This is not about the leader doing their ego - therapy in mailings — but is it about the people , the grass roots , the “ cadre ” and what they have been doing .
But this is the easy part — to lead a movement you have to travel — more than you want to .

But this is the easy part — to lead a movement you have to travel — more than you want to .
Travel and speak .
You ’ll be traveling , speaking , visiting , staying in homes , listening , encouraging , taking walks with your people ’s kids , sending notes when you ’ve returned , showing up in their church unannounced , writing notes , cards , letters , making phone calls — in the building stage of a movement the leader must be virtually omnipresent .
The leader of a movement must “ show up ” in the life of the “ cadre ” — the key people in your movement — so much so that they become the primary leader to which that person relates .
Everyone has a primary leader - mentor in life — be that for your “ cadre ” or “ critical mass . ”
You cannot lead a movement from an office — you must lead it from the field and support it from the office .
5. Abundant “ appurtenances ”
Appurtenances are the materials and resources related to a movement — stickers , badges , embroidered shirts , tags — often called “ promotional items ” or even “ gimmicks . ”
Some say , “ appurtenances make the movement ” and of course that is only partly true — some leaders have scores of gimmicks and stickers and tactile memory - objects yet never create a movement .
However , though appurtenances do not guarantee a movement there are no movements without some appurtenances .
Materials may not create the movement they do sustain it .
Out of sight , out of mind is true .
A true movement cannot be “ program driven ” in the sense that we produce curriculum or materials and expect everyone to use them , but a movement always produces an abundance of materials : magazines , newsletters , stickers , CDs , videos , Curriculum ( often even resources that compete with themselves ) , pamphlets , jackets , pens , and a host of other “ stuff . ”
These things “ grow up ” with the movement however — and just creating them will not ignite to movement .
Bringing out too many too soon will only get you dismissed as a shallow huckster and a person who leads - by - gimmicks .
The best way to introduce appurtenances is gradually and the best place is at the “ sacred gathering ” — the people are then imbued with a sense of the sacred and the meaning of the gathering .
While materials will not create a movement — there is no movement that does not produce abundant materials .
6. Economic Resources
You cannot build a movement without money .
Do n’t be bashful about money — figure out in your organization how to get it , make it , spend it , and spread it .
Get it by figuring out how to get in the budget of your organization — and how to get more by spending it all , spending it well , and tying all the spending to the cause .
by figuring out how to get in the budget of your organization — and how to get more by spending it all , spending it well , and tying all the spending to the cause .
Make it by figuring out how to make a “ profit ” on events and materials — become a movement entrepreneur and develop your own revenue stream from youth camp , conferences , workshops , publications and any other way you can make money while at the same time multiplying ministry .
If you have a worthy product people will pay for it — and your movement can make a profit from it while at the same time doing the buyer a great favor when they buy and use it .
The church is far larger financially than General Motors or Microsoft — there are billions out there being spent by churches — get some by making it !

Spend it well so that you get the biggest bang for the buck .
Spend it on your cause not yourself and your buddies .
Plow your money back into the movement to make it grow .
This is nothing more than every small business does — if you want to ‘ clip coupons ” and benefit yourself and your family by paying your own way to conventions “ because we ’ve worked so hard ” do n’t expect to build much of a movement .
Sacrifice now and re-invest the money you make into the movement , not yourself and your cronies .

Sacrifice now and re-invest the money you make into the movement , not yourself and your cronies .
Spread it .
Once you have money spread it — it is like fertilizer — piled up it stinks and burns the lawn — spread around it does good to the entire crop .
We do n’t pile up the cash at headquarters or on the district level .
We ’re not a savings bank but a hose through which we pass money to bless our cause .
If you ’ve got unspent money left at the end of the year in your budget you should go run a credit union and not lead a church ministry !
Spread it around the entire church and it will grow such a huge crop you wo n’t be able to harvest it all — a crop of great results for the kingdom of God .
7. Multiplying levels
Almost all movements eventually grow large enough to produce “ levels ” of service .
When you start out there may only be one level of service — the “ cadre ” or the “ critical mass . ”
But if you are successful at starting a movement eventually your 20 will turn into 200 then maybe even 2000 , maybe even more that that .
As your movement grows start to structure in order to absorb a growing number of leaders not just followers .
You will have about as many leaders in your movement as you have leadership posts .
So , to get more leaders make more leadership posts .
Try to create a 10 % excess of leadership posts — 10 % more than you have leaders prepared for .
This creates a “ draft ” that sucks people into leadership and give them a chance to serve / lead .
After all , the best training for leadership is , well , leadership .
This means that in some ways having more conventions or conferences or camps , or meetings , or training sessions or newsletters , or programs is equally as important to the cause of developing leaders as it is to accomplishing the ( explicit ) goals of the meeting or publication .
This multiplication feeds on itself — the more leaders you deploy the more ministry will get done , the stronger and larger the movement will be , and the more leaders will rise from that movement , which will create more ministry , and so forth as the cycle continues .
Developing leaders is the core work of a leader of a mid-stage movement .
If you develop leaders and they care about the mission a greater movement will result .
You ca n’t jump directly to this “ developing leaders ” level however without mixing the first six ingredients .
While it is mostly true “ everything depends on leadership ” it is not true that “ thus we should start by developing leaders . ”
Developing leaders is the primary focus in the mid and later stages of a movement .
You are n’t ready to develop leaders without a meeting , a clear mission / cause , regular contact , materials and money — but once you have laid the tracks with these then do your primary task — leadership development and watch the movement take off !
— — — — ———-
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS :
Of course , no “ recipe ” can guarantee a movement but this is a good shot at putting together the “ ingredients ” of such a recipe .
There are , of course , external factors affecting a movement ’s success and these can block or enhance your efforts at creating a movement .
God ’s anointing may be there or maybe it is n’t there .
God ’s timing may be ripe or you may labor and see no fruit of your labor if the timing is not right .
Your cause may be “ in season ” or it could be “ out of season ” with the people .
You might have a “ protecting angel ” in power above you as a DS or GS or senior pastor , or you could have a detracting enemy who suspects your motives and tries cut you off at the pass and hamper your effectiveness at developing a movement .
Your district or denomination might have a great openness to strong leadership or it could have been burned by such leaders in the past and shut itself off from strong leadership .
Your organization may allow and encourage entrepreneurs and profit - making or it may have choked off innovation and profiting or centralized all the “ business ” into one entity .
Your budget may be expanding or it could be contracting .
Your organization may be open to the chaos that inevitably comes with a movement or the organizational ethos could be so bureaucratic and controlled that a movement will be strangled before it gets past the first meeting .
You could have nobody thinking you are a threat or competitor for their job or church , or you might be viewed with suspicion and powerful people might believe you are only using this cause as a ladder to move into other ( their ) positions of leadership .
There are a dozen other external factors that may influence your eventual success at leading a movement , but so what ?
What will you do ?
Whine about these factors you see present ?
Condemn everyone who is your barrier ?
Or , will you try your best to lead a movement because you know the cause is worthy ?
Will you even be willing to sacrifice progress in your future career just to get a movement rolling ?
Is it that important to you ?
Or , are you really only wanting to look like you are doing a good job and then get rewarded with some other job ?
If you are really serious about the cause and starting a movement then get about leading instead of whining .
See if God blesses your leadership .
If He does then thank Him and lead a movement that will contribute to His kingdom and be remembered for decades , maybe generations to come .
And , if God does not bless you , or the people do not join up , or somebody heads you off and sidelines you — so what ?
If you did your best for a worthy cause when you meet Christ he will say “ well done thou good and faithful servant .
And , after all , what more could you ask ?

With the clock ticking on tomorrow 's unveiling of the Nexus One , it seems most of the focus has been on the hardware and plan details ( see below ) .
But looking at the Nexus One as just another Android phone that Google happens to sell is to miss its potential significance as a hardware platform for Google 's increasingly popular software offerings .
Specifically , the Nexus One could have big implications for Google Voice and Google Apps .
One of the ways that a Google - branded phone makes the most sense is as a platform for the company to expand the functionality and user base of Google Voice .
With the Nexus One launch , we may see Google Voice open up to more users , and we might also see the introduction of long - awaited number portability to the service .
Right now , Google Voice is invitation - only , but that could change after the launch of the Nexus One .
Google will likely want Voice to be the primary way for Nexus
One users to place calls on the handset , and that would mean giving out a Google Voice number to everyone who buys a Nexus One and who does n't already have a Google Voice account .
Such a move would lay the groundwork for a future Google Voice transition from regular voice connections ( where the Google Voice app makes the connection in the background using the network 's voice side ) to SIP over the network 's data side , enabling Google to bill customers directly for VoIP services .
But given network bandwidth issues , such a combination of the newly acquired Gizmo5 SIP network and Google Voice will probably either not launch with the Nexus One , or it will be available only via Wi -Fi .
Once Google is finished rolling Gizmo5 into Google Voice , the resulting product on Nexus One will raise Google 's profile as a carrier - and network - independent provider of IP - based telephony services ( voice , voicemail , SMS , directory services , etc. ) .
With rumored support for up to five phones per Google Account , it 's not clear how Google Voice will handle multiple phones per user — will we get multiple Google Voice numbers that point to the same account ( sort of like having multiple e-mail aliases pointing to one inbox ) , or will we get multiple Google Voice accounts ?
Or will we get to choose between the two options on a phone - by - phone basis ?
The other question raised by Google Voice on Nexus One concerns number porting .
Google has n't enabled the public to port their existing numbers to Google Voice yet , but letting Nexus One buyers port numbers to Voice ( as opposed to just porting them to T - Mobile ) would seem logical .
We 'll find out tomorrow morning if Google will let us port existing numbers to Google Voice for use on the Nexus One .
Nexus One for My Domain ?
The other issue that 's worth thinking about is the Nexus One 's possible relationship to Google 's business offerings — specifically Google Apps for My Domain .
It seems likely that businesses that use Google Apps will at some point be able to purchase and administer the new phones centrally , with the phones and plans tied to the domain owner 's account .
In other words , as a Google Apps customer , I should be able to buy a Nexus One for each employee account on my domain , complete with a Google Voice number .
That way , I can cheaply and easily equip a workforce with centrally billed and managed mobile calendaring , IP telephony , messaging , contacts , etc .
I 'd be surprised if Google launches the Nexus One with this kind of Apps - based enterprise focus , but it does seem like the kind of thing it would add eventually .
And when it launches , it would be a low - cost alternative to RIM's Enterprise offerings .
People with generalized anxiety disorder , or GAD , have abnormalities in the way their brain unconsciously controls emotions .
That 's the conclusion of a new Stanford University School of Medicine study , and the study authors say the findings could open up new avenues for treatments and change our understanding of how emotion is regulated in everyday life .
The work is published online in this month 's American Journal of Psychiatry .
According to the National Institute of Mental Health , 18 percent of Americans have an anxiety disorder .
GAD in particular is marked by extreme feelings of fear and uncertainty ; people with the disorder live in a state of non -stop worry and often struggle getting through their daily lives .
" Patients experience anxiety and worry and respond excessively to emotionally negative stimuli , but it 's never been clear really why , " said Amit Etkin , MD , PhD , acting assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and first author of the study .
Etkin said clinical data have suggested that adult GAD patients initially register negative stimuli in a largely normal way , but have deficits in how they then control negative emotions .
He and his colleagues conducted their research to better understand these potential abnormalities and to shed light on two theories dating back to Sigmund Freud : that most emotion regulation is done unconsciously , and that a disturbance in unconscious emotion regulation leads to psychiatric symptoms .
For the study , Etkin recruited 17 people with GAD and 24 healthy participants and used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a behavioral marker to compare what happened when the two groups performed an emotion - based task .
The task involved viewing images of happy or fearful faces , overlaid with the words " fear " or " happy , " and using a button box to identify the expression of each face .
Not all the words matched up -- some happy faces featured the word " fear , " and vice versa -- which created an emotional conflict for participants .
The authors ' previous work involving the task has shown that it takes study subjects longer to identify the correct expression when the expression and word contradict one another .
But the slowdown in reaction time is lessened if the previous image was also incongruent , demonstrating that an emotion regulatory process kicked in to help the brain react faster to the conflicting emotional information .
" We can see through the reaction - time effect that people are adapting their emotional processing " from image to image , Etkin explained .

In the current study , Etkin and his colleagues found that both healthy participants and GAD patients were able to identify the expressions .
Healthy participants , as was expected , reacted more quickly to incongruent images when the previous image was also incongruent .
When later asked if they were aware of any pattern that might have helped or hindered their performance , the volunteers said they were not ; Etkin said this demonstrated that this process was carried out unconsciously .
However , the researchers found that in the GAD patients , the reaction - time effect seen in healthy patients was absent -- and in the most anxious patients , reaction time actually worsened when there were two incongruent images in a row .
" GAD patients had decreased ability to use emotional content from previous stimuli to help them with the task , " said Etkin .
He said the differences between the two groups were striking .
" By looking at reaction times alone , we could classify who was a patient and who was a control , " he said , adding that this represented the first solid demonstration that a psychiatric population has a deficit in a form of unconscious emotion regulation .
Earlier work from Etkin and colleagues had shown that when healthy subjects encountered the emotional conflict during this task , the pregenual anterior cingulate , a part of the brain 's prefrontal cortex , was activated .
That part of the brain then inhibited the amygdala , which acts to dampen or regulate negative emotion .
During this study , the brains of health participants reacted as expected .
But for patients with GAD , the pregenual anterior cingulate failed to light up and to inhibit the amygdala , showing something went awry with this circuit .
This has never been shown before , Etkin noted .
Understanding that the prefrontal cortex is an important site of abnormality could potentially lead to advances in more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment .
By targeting this region more directly , clinicians might be able to improve regulation function in GAD patients .
Etkin also suspects that a faulty pregenual cingulate - amygdala circuit during unconscious emotion regulation is involved in other psychiatric disorders , such as post - traumatic stress disorder , so the work could lead to a better understanding of those conditions .
Senior study author Alan Schatzberg , MD , the Kenneth T. Norris , Jr. Professor and chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences , noted that the findings bring new insight into the biology of psychopathology , as well as potentially the mechanisms underlying the response to psychotherapy .
They could , he said , provide a new way also to gauge the efficacy of therapy .
Etkin said he 'll continue his investigations in this area , and use these findings to identify brain signatures that differ among psychiatric disorders , as well as to track the effects of psychotherapy .
A grant from the national stimulus package , which was signed into law last year and included $ 8.2 billion in extramural funding for the National Institutes of Health , will help him continue and expand this work .
The study was funded by the NIH and the residency - research program of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System .
Co-authors include research assistant Katherine Prater ; Fumiko Hoeft , MD , PhD ; and Vinod Menon , PhD , associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences .

I have been thinking about the the forces distorting the global economy .�
In the long run , the distortions do n’t matter , because economies are bigger than governments , and eventually economies prevail over governments .�
Here are my dozen problems in the global economy .
1 ) China ’s mercantilism — loans and currency .�
The biggest distortionary force in the world now is China . �
They encourage banks to loan to enterprises in order to force growth . �
They keep their currency undervalued to favor exports over imports .�
What was phrased to me as a grad student in development economics as a good thing is now malevolent .�
The only bright side is that when it blows , it might take the Chinese Communist Party with it .
2 ) US Deficits , European Deficits —
In one sense , this reminds me of the era of the Rothschilds ; governments relied on borrowing because other methods of taxation raised little .�
Well , this era is different .�
Taxes are high , but not high enough for governments that are trying to create the unachievable “ permanent prosperity . ”
In the process they substitute public for private leverage , and in the process add to the leverage of their societies as a whole .
3 ) The Eurozone is a mess — Greece , Portugal , Spain , etc . �
I admit that I got it partially wrong , because I have always thought that political union is necessary in order to have a fiat currency . �
I expected inflation to be the problem , and the real problem is deflation . �
Will there be bailouts ?�
Will the troubled nations leave ?�
Will the untroubled nations leave that are the likely targets for bailout money ?
4 ) Many entities that are affiliated with lending in the US Government , e.g. , FDIC , GSEs , FHA are broke . �
The government just does n’t say that , because they can still make payments .
5 ) The US Government feels it has to “ do something ” — so it creates more lending programs that further socialize lending , leading to more dumb loans .
6 ) Residential real estate is still in the tank .�
Residential delinquencies are at all - time highs .�
Strategic default is rising .�
The shadow inventory of homes that will come onto the market is large .�
I ’m not saying that prices will fall for housing ; I am saying that it will be tough to get them to rise .
7 ) Commercial real estate — there is too much debt supporting commercial real estate , and too little equity . �
There will be losses here ; the only question is how deep the losses will go .
8 ) I have often thought that analyzing the strength of the states is a better measure for US economic strength , than relying on the statistics of the Federal Government . �
The state economies are weak at present .�
Part of that comes from the general macroeconomy , and part from the need to fund underfunded benefit plans . �
Life is tough when you ca n’t print your own money .
9 ) The US , UK , and Japan are force feeding liquidity into their economies .�
Thus the low short - term interest rates .�
Also note the Federal Reserve owning MBS in bulk , bloating their balance sheet .
10 ) Yield greed .�
The low short term interest rates touched off a competition to bid for risky debt .�
The only question is when it will reverse . �
Current yield levels do not fairly price likely default losses .
11 ) Most Western democracies are going into extreme deficits , because they can’t choose between economic stimulus and deficit reduction . �
Political deadlock is common , because no one is willing to deliver any real pain to the populace , lest they not be re-elected .
12 ) Demographics is one of the biggest� pressures , but it is hidden . �
Many of the European nations and Japan face shrinking populations .�
China will be there also , in a decade . �
Nations that shrink are less capable of carrying their debt loads .�
In that sense , the US is in good shape , because we do n’t discourage immigration .

A report published today by IT security and data protection firm Sophos has revealed an alarming rise in attacks on users of social networks , such as Facebook and Twitter , by cybercriminals .
Sophos 's " Social Security " investigation reveals that criminals have increasingly focused attacks on social networking users in the last 12 months , with an explosion in the reports of spam and malware :
57 % of users report they have been spammed via social networking sites , a rise of 70.6 % from last year
36 % reveal they have been sent malware via social networking sites , a rise of 69.8 % from last year
" Computer users are spending more time on social networks , sharing sensitive and valuable personal information , and hackers have sniffed out where the money is to be made , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for Sophos .
" The dramatic rise in attacks in the last year tells us that social networks and their millions of users have to do more to protect themselves from organized cybercrime , or risk falling prey to identity theft schemes , scams , and malware attacks . "
72 % of firms worried workers behavior on social networks is putting their business at risk
Sophos surveyed over 500 organizations , and discovered that 72 % are concerned that employee behavior on social networking sites exposes their businesses to danger , and puts corporate infrastructure - and the sensitive data stored upon it - at risk .
The " Social Security " survey is just one part of Sophos 's 2010 Security Threat Report , which explores current and emerging computer security trends .
It reveals that criminals identify potential victims on social networks , and then attack them , both at home and at work .
In Sophos 's opinion , many Web 2.0 sites are concentrating too much on growing their marketshare at the expense of properly defending their existing users from internet threats .
Facebook - the most feared social network ?
Survey respondents were also asked which social network they believed posed the biggest security risk , with 60 % naming Facebook :
1. Facebook : 60 %
2. MySpace : 18 %
3. Twitter : 17 %
4. LinkedIn : 4 %
" We should n't forget that Facebook is by far the largest social network - and you 'll find more bad apples in the biggest orchard , " explained Cluley .
" The truth is that the security team at Facebook works hard to counter threats on their site - it 's just that policing 350 million users can't be an easy job for anyone .
But there is no doubt that simple changes could make Facebook users safer .
For instance , when Facebook rolled - out its new recommended privacy settings late last year , it was a backwards step , encouraging many users to share their information with everybody on the internet . "
Sophos 's Threat Report also reveals that 49 % of firms allow all their staff unfettered access to Facebook , a 13 % rise on a year ago .
" The grim irony is that just as companies are loosening their attitude to staff activity on social networks , the threat of malware , spam , phishing and identity theft on Facebook is increasing , " said Cluley .
" However , social networks can be an essential part of the business mix today , and the answer is not to bar staff from participating in them but to apply some ' social security ' instead . "
LinkedIn - providing hackers with your company 's corporate directory
Although LinkedIn is considered to be by far the least threatening of the networks , Sophos advises that it can still provide a sizeable pool of information for hackers .
" Targeted attacks against companies are in the news at the moment , and the more information a criminal can get about your organization 's structure , the easier for them to send a poisoned attachment to precisely the person whose computer they want to break into , " explained Cluley .
" Sites like Linked In provide hackers with what is effectively a corporate directory , listing your staff 's names and positions .
This makes it child 's play to reverse - engineer the email addresses of potential victims . "

WHEN : Fri. February .
19 , 2010 , 10:00 - 11:00 AM
WHERE : Ground Zero , Manhattan ( in front of the PATH Station )
Actor Daniel Sunjata , and Author Sander Hicks , for AE911 Truth , will discuss the evidence and the significance of this petition with the public at Ground Zero , Bob McIlvaine , 9/11 family member
More than 1,000 independent architects and engineers world - wide now support the call for an independent investigation into the destruction of the three World Trade Center buildings ( 1 , 2 , and 7 ) .
These scientists have signed a 9/11 Truth Petition calling on Congress to launch a new investigation .
AE911 truth.org today calls for a Grand Jury probe into John Gross and Shyam Sunder , managers of the reports by National Institute for Standards and Technology ( NIST ) .
EVIDENCE :
The discovery of advanced explosive nano - thermitic material found in each of the WTC dust samples by top nuclear physicist Dr. Steven E. Jones , and a peer - reviewed panel of top international scientists .
Eyewitness testimony cited multiple experiences of secondary explosions , even before the first plane hit WTC 1 .
BACKGROUND :
9/11 Commission Chairmen Kean & Hamilton seriously criticized their own Commission in their book " Without Precedent . "
They complained their investigation was " set up to fail " and that they had been lied to by NORAD .
Their special counsel , John Farmer , recently wrote in his book " The Ground Truth " that " at some level of the government … there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened . ”
Note :
This NYC press conference is being held simultaneously with conferences in San Francisco and Denver .
A live webinar stream of AE911 Truth 's national press conference , is available at www.ae911truth.org ( 1 PM CST . )
TUCSON - A former Pima County Sheriff 's deputy has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and five years probation for criminal damage and extreme DUI .
According to court documents , Daniel Williams crashed his patrol vehicle last Sept. 2 on Arizona 86 near Kitt Peak and authorities say a case of beer was also found in the back seat of the vehicle .
Williams was off - duty at the time and on his way to his girlfriend 's house , but was fired within hours of the crash .
He was indicted on criminal charges after blood tests showed his blood - alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit for drivers in Arizona .
Williams worked for the Sheriff 's Department in the Ajo District .
He was sentenced Tuesday .
INSIDE HIGHER ED INSIDE HIGHER ED
For more breaking news , features and commentary from the world of higher education , visit : insidehighered.com .
As if the recession had not given community college advocates enough to worry about , some fear that the anti-tax sentiment stirred by Tea Party activists could endanger their federal , state and local funding .
One Tea Party group in New Jersey is questioning Warren County Community College 's plans to open a satellite campus , meant to accommodate the institution 's burgeoning enrollment in outlying areas and free up space on its main campus .
As required by New Jersey law , half of the $ 7.3 million bond to buy and renovate a commercial building for the new campus would be paid from an existing pool of state funds .
The remainder , officials say , would be paid for by leasing additional space in the renovated building to interested tenants .
At Inside Higher Ed: Taxes and higher education Cash - poor , bond - rich : Colleges struggle with state budget cutbacks
Though the plan for the new facility would not raise taxes or pass along any extra costs to area residents , some activists are still questioning the move , arguing that the college should simply expand its existing campus and that outlying students should make the drive if they want to attend classes .
Money " does n't grow on trees , " John Clemmer , founder of the Warren County NJ Tea Party Patriots , told The Express - Times , a local newspaper .
" We do n't print money .
It 's our money , no matter what you 're talking about doing . "
The argument in New Jersey has some national community college leaders taking notice of the Tea Party 's potential impact on community college funding — although dealing with anti-tax groups and advocates for restricted government spending is not a new task for many educators .
" The Tea Party is doing what many taxpayers ' associations have done in the past , questioning every use of taxpayers ' dollars " said George Boggs , president of the American Association of Community Colleges .
" When I was a ( community college ) president in California , there were always taxpayers ' groups questioning the approval of bonds and other measures .
They wanted to be convinced that these projects were worth it , wondering if sufficient numbers of students would be served by expansion and if it would help the local economy . "
In campaigns for bond referendums as president of Palomar Community College , Boggs said , he often reached out to taxpayer watchdog groups , offering economic impact data and other statistics to win their confidence that the spending was worthwhile .
He encouraged community college officials and Tea Party activists to take a similar approach if their thoughts differ on education and facilities spending .
" The anti-tax movement has become more prominent nationally , as many states are trying to close gaps in their budgets , " Boggs said .
" There are two ways to do this : one is to reduce spending , and the other is to raise taxes .
The latter has caused groups like the Tea Party to oppose taxes , and they are usually more in favor of cutting services .
I just hope , as states work through these budget shortfalls , they are able to preserve the right kinds of services . "
Other community college scholars agree that managing the anti-tax movement and combating public misunderstandings about two - year institutions are parts of a continuing battle that predates the emergence of the Tea Party movement .
" There 's a lack of a coherent level of understanding about the levels of funding community colleges receive and the value of these institutions , " said Davis Jenkins , a senior researcher at the Community College Research Center at Columbia University 's Teachers College .
" It threatens cuts at all levels .
We need to highlight these institutions and what they mean for people locally and for the economy . "
Many community colleges are funded primarily by tuition dollars , alongside supplemental state appropriations and local property tax levies .
But in some states , such as California , community colleges are precluded from taxing their district residents and rely solely on state funding , which has dwindled in many states amid the financial crisis .
As for the Tea Party 's potential impact on the two - year sector , some leaders note that recent history has in fact seen strong public support for their institutions .
" While it might be easy to assume that ( community college ) tax referenda , etc. , get caught up in the general resistance to new taxes or increased taxes , this is not always the case , " wrote J. Noah Brown , president of the Association of Community College Trustees , in an e-mail .
" Many ( community colleges ) have successfully won bond referenda and millage increases , even in tough economic times . "

Why Boat — by Wally Hermès Yachts
Wrote Nick Vinson in a November 13 , 2009 Financial
Times story , " It is more of a ' floating island ' or a ' house on the water ' than a mere yacht .
Why 's extraordinary triangular hull looks like nothing seen before : the 3,400 sq. metres of guest space has the interior and exterior volumes of a villa , is stable even in full swell and has an optimum cruising speed of just 12 knots .
" The most unusual thing about Why is its low - lying , almost triangular structure , 58 metres long with a 38 - metre - wide - beam , wider than that of a 300 - metre long cruise ship .
The accommodation is contained within the hull , with only the cockpit emerging .
" The bow has a 25 - metre U - shaped pool that follows the prow and a helipad .
A 130 - metre-long jogging track traces bow to stern and a 30 - metre long ' beach ' flanks its stern , as the boat ’s design creates a totally flat sea behind it when anchored .
The roof , made of photovoltaic cells , operates like a giant Venetian blind , following the sun or retracting completely to expose the terraces below .
" Unlike conventional yachts , the propulsion system is in the bow , as is the hold for the tender and ' toys ' garage ( it can take a 14 - metre Wally 47 tender ) .
" Accommodation is split over three levels , all primarily facing the stern , with further glazing on both sides .
At the top is the owners ’ deck , with a 200 - sq - metre apartment opening on to a private terrace .
Below this is the guest deck , offering five suites – two of 60 sq metres and three of 30 sq metres – plus a lounge / library and its own terrace .
A wide , sweeping staircase leads down to the 720 - metre main saloon deck , with living , dining , media and music rooms , a spa and gym , all leading to “ the beach ” .
Below this is accommodation for the 20 or so crew ( apart from the captain ’s and first officer ’s cabins , which are up top ) .
" Interiors , part inspired by prewar Nordic architecture ( think Alvar Aalto ) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe ’s Barcelona Pavilion , are by long - term Hermès collaborators Rena Dumas Architecture Intérieure .
Materials include paper , wood and leather ; textures are matt , colours are kept light and edges are softened for “ total comfort , elegance and relaxation for the eyes and the body ” , according to Denis Montel of RDAI .
He has also attempted to soften the characteristic hard light you normally get afloat : three patios pierce through the boat , the largest housing a tree and possibly a kitchen garden .
With their large picture windows , the patios enhance the relationship between the exterior and the interior and , with sliding screens , help break up the vast spaces into a human scale .
" Why ’s hull , plus the fact that its ideal cruising speed is just 12 knots , means that it requires less power than a traditional boat of equal size ( in volume terms that is a 100 - metre conventional yacht ) .
It uses a state - of - the - art diesel - electric propulsion system and the 900 sq metres of photovoltaic cells that cover the roof and sides provide about 20 per cent of the energy required to live on board .
There are high - efficiency batteries to store energy , optimised thermal insulation , a system to recover lost energy and a smart consumption management system . "
Though only a concept exists as a full - scale maquette in a boatyard in Ancona , Italy , they 're ready to build one for you .
€ 90 – €100 million ( $ 130 – $ 140 million ) .

TY Flautist !
I had forgotten how powerful and beautiful Jussi Björling was !
Also , I 've always been mesmerized by " angry sea " paintings , the titanic clash of the sea and sky with mortals caught in the twain .
The painting at 1:05 in the video , bravo !
I would love to see the original or a a larger view of it on the net !!!!
Milena , viewing it as a technology ( guy thing ) , your statement brings me to my senses , TY !

To be frank , its exterior looks heavy and ungraceful .
I 'm not sold .

It 's gorgeous , a real gem , amazing , and all that , but ... I 've always enjoyed being on the ocean - I mean it 's the OCEAN , for goodness sakes .
The heaving snot - green sea !
It seems strange to transplant the luxury environment .
Why not just stay in a huge swanky hotel or something ?
Ah well , different strokes .
Me , I 'll take this ( in my imagination - I would n't want to get wet or anything ) :

Is it me or do you think there should be a rail on the backside ???
" It is stable in a full swell " ( the sea was angry that day my friends ) ....
Yea , like me after the Superbowl party .
Where 's Fred ?

Terminalscope Serial Console
February 2010
Jan might have created a cool scope terminal , but I 've done him one better . ;-)
The Terminalscope is a full , bidirectional serial terminal that uses a PS / 2 keyboard for input and displays 54x24 - character output on an oscilloscope or XY display .
It can be connected to a PC via USB - to - TTL adapter or directly to another microcontroller .
Features include :
7 - bit ASCII character set plus box - drawing characters
Flicker - free 60 Hz picture
Most ANSI / VT100 escape sequences interpreted
Reverse video attribute supported
All your favorite ncurses terminal programs ( vi , nano , top , links , mc , irssi , etc. ) display fine
Graphical configuration menu
Selectable baud rate ( 2400 - 38400 ) , data bits , parity , and stop bits
Two configuration profiles ( stored in EEPROM ) quickly selectable with an external switch

Terminalscope is connected to a Linux box as a serial console .

hardware
A great thing about the Terminalscope is its simplicity .
Other scope projects require an expensive DAC or an inaccurate R - 2R ladder .
Rather than draw each character with individual strokes , op - amps are used to generate a raster scan across the screen ( like a TV ) and the Z axis ( beam intensity ) is modulated directly by the microcontroller .
Two op - amps are used as integrators to generate the X and Y linear ramps .
A high slew rate , single - supply chip like the MC34074 works .
( A TL3474 might work as well . )
Since the op-amps are single - supply , a 2.4V zener diode is used to create a virtual ground .
To generate the positive - going sweep for the X axis , a constant voltage slighly below virtual ground is fed into the X integrator .
( Remember , the output of an integrator is inverted . )
To generate the negative - going sweep for the Y axis , a constant voltage slightly above virtual ground is fed into the Y integrator .
The two trimpots controlling these voltages can be adjusted to change the size of the image or even flip it .
Due to the virtual ground , the output of the integrators has a significant dc offset .
To compensate for this , large ac - coupling capacitors are placed inline with the X and Y outputs .
The video generation and serial communication is handled by an ATmega328P .
( 1296 bytes of RAM are required for a 54x24 character matrix , but if you 'd like a lower - resolution display , an ATmega 168 would work just fine . )
The microcontroller sends horizontal and vertical " sync " pulses to a 4066 quad bilateral switch ; closing a switch discharges the respective integrating capacitor , resetting the sweep .
Since the timing of the video generation is critical , the ATmega328P can't read asynchronous events from the keyboard without mangling the picture .
So an ATtiny45 is used to read the PS / 2 keyboard lines .
It converts scancodes to ASCII values ( and non -ASCII keypresses to special values ) and stores them in a queue .
After the ' mega is done outputting a frame , it pulls the typed characters out of the ' tiny 's buffer over SPI .
software
The time - critical display routine is written in assembly language .
The ATmega328P outputs one pixel every 5 clock cycles .
It runs at 20MHz , thus the pixel frequency is 4MHz .
Thus , your scope or monitor must have at least 4MHz of Z - axis bandwidth .
The rest of the code , including a fairly complete video library , is written in C .
It emulates " most of " a VT100 ; that is , enough escape sequences are implemented so that Unix console applications display correctly .
I 've made the code available at the bottom of the page , and it might be useful for anyone looking to implement their own terminal .
Escape sequence handling are pretty much a nightmare .
connecting to a linux box
With a USB - to - TTL serial adapter ( I use the one made by SparkFun ) , the Terminalscope can be connected to a computer .
In Linux , you can talk to it using screen , like this :
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400
/etc/init/ttyUSB0.conf
start on stopped rc RUNLEVEL = [ 2345 ] stop on runlevel [ ! 2345 ] respawn exec / sbin / getty - L 38400 ttyUSB0 vt100
sudo start ttyUSB0
( assuming the adapter is at / dev/ttyUSB0 and the Terminalscope is set at 38400 baud , 8 data bits , no parity , 1 stop bit . )
If you want to give Terminalscope a login process , so you can shell into your machine from it , you 'll have some configuration files to tweak .
In Ubuntu ( Karmic and newer ) , paste the following intoYou can now start the login process with the command
One last thing .
When you log in , Linux will think the terminal is 80 columns wide ( it 's really 54 ) and will assume it supports UTF - 8 ( which it does n't ) .
To fix this , you should add the following to your .
bash_profile ( assuming you use bash ) :
if [ " $ TTY " == ' / dev/ttyUSB0 ' ] ; then stty cols 54 stty rows 24 export ROWS= 24 export LINES=24 export COLUMNS=54 export LANG=POSIX fi
making your own
Be warned if you 're going to make your own : your mileage may vary .
A big XY monitor will probably work better than an oscilloscope .
I have n't been able to get a clean picture on my Tektronix 464 , but there may be something wrong with its Z axis .
Some things to note :
Due to the large ac coupling capacitors , the image will take a few seconds to position itself on the screen .
It 's probably possible to eliminate the dc offset with more op - amps , but this seems to be simple and good enough .
I considered a dual - supply design using an ICL7660 to get - 5 V , but it generates ripple on the negative rail that 's quite noticeable at these low voltages .
You might have to add RC networks to eliminate noise on the lines .
I put a trimpot in series with each signal lead to eliminate ringing artifacts .
( This has something to do with transmission lines , but honestly I do n't know much about that stuff .
It was mainly trial and error . )
If your display has a positive - blanking Z axis input , and the picture is inverted , ( dark characters on light background ) you can use the configuration menu to reverse the image .
The receiving of characters from the USART is still interrupt - driven , so the display will probably jump a bit when a character is received .
I think it 's " good enough " the way it is , but you 're welcome to modify the software to poll the USART .
code
The code is on GitHub and is released under the msarnoff.org license .
Includes a Makefile for avr -gcc .
The firmware for the ATtiny45 keyboard buffer is in the keybuffer / folder , and the display font ( as well as a Ruby script to create your own font from an ASCII .pgm image ) is in the fonts / folder .
Feel free to use parts of it in other projects ; I 've written a fairly complete escape sequence parser that might be useful for other terminal projects .
The code is released under the " do whatever you want with it , but if you make something cool , let me know and give me credit " license .

May require custom symbols from my symbols directory .
pcb
The Terminalscope is now officially off a breadboard and on a PCB .
It 's a dual layer board , but the top layer is entirely a ground plane .
The circuit would probably fit fine on a single - sided board .
Here are some things I 've noticed :
The three 10 k trimpots are actually not needed at all on the PCB .
They are just set to 0 ohms .
I 'd guess it 's because the BNC connectors provide the necessary impedance , and the parasitic capacitance present on the breadboard is no longer there .
It actually works with my Tektronix oscilloscope .
The image is very faint , though .
An XY monitor is still your best bet .
The X and Y sizes are derived directly from ground and the supply voltage .
This means that any fluctuations in the supply will cause the image to bounce .
It 's not really an issue with a regulated power supply .
I have n't tried powering it over USB yet , though current draw does n't seem like it would be a problem .
( As long as you do n't connect a beast of a keyboard like a Model M ! )
The power and signal connector is just a 4 - pin header .
For ease of connection to a PC , I should have used the 6 - pin FTDI connector ( for easy connection to a SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout , which I do n't have . )
Aside from that , it 's not too bad for a first prototype .

Once you ’ve had three Thanksgiving meals in three different cities , you enter a zone where your next meal needs to be the complete and total opposite of turkey and dressing .
A light palette cleanser , perhaps ?
Maybe a crisp , refreshing sorbet ?
Oh , HELL no .
When you ’re serious about hitting the reset button on your palette and your appetite , you ’ve really got to go with something like a Philly Cheesesteak .
Something packed with beef and onions and peppers and , yes , Cheez Whiz .
DON ’T YOU JUDGE ME .
I ’m not a huge fan of processed foods , either , but an authentic cheesesteak requires an ample slathering of the orange stuff .
‘ Tis the season .
When in Rome .
Oh , just do it .
We do n’t have a griddle , so Jeff and I double - teamed the sandwiches using two cast - iron skillets .
I sauté the onion and green pepper slices in Skillet 1 , while Jeff slices and cooks the steak in Skillet 2 .
The process takes a little more than five minutes .
Once the steak is done , I transfer the vegetables to Skillet 2 , toss everything together , and pile the mixture into two warm sandwich rolls ( split in half vertically , like hot dog buns ) .
Then Jeff dips a spatula in the Cheez Whiz and runs it over the meat and vegetables .
And that ’s not a euphemism .
After bellying up to untold casseroles and sweets , taking that first bite of gooey , peppery cheesesteak was something to be thankful for , indeed .
If only the pilgrims had had Cheez Whiz .
Admiral Ackbar -- the Supreme Commander of the Rebel Alliance fleet -- is one step closer to becoming the new on - field mascot for the University of Mississippi .
Ole Miss is in the middle of a movement to replace their old mascot -- Colonel Reb -- after the school decided they wanted to update their image .
Tuesday , the students voted in favor of crowning a new mascot to represent Rebel Nation ... and the favorite so far is none other than the most famous Mon Calamari in the entire universe .
Several pro-Ackbar websites have recently emerged -- making the Admiral the heavy favorite .
The University tells us the decision on the mascot is entirely in the hands of the student mascot committee .
The University will hold a vote in the near future -- we 'll keep you updated .
May The Force be with you .
I 've been writing for years that the core Republican value boils down to this : cheap , disposable labor .
They want the workforce battered to the point where they will be grateful for any kind of work , no matter how badly paid or how poor the working conditions - and they want you stripped of any rights in the workplace that might slow them down while making money .
I was reminded of that this basic truth this morning when I read George Will 's latest column :
Today 's unemployment rate is 10 percent ; the underemployment rate — the unemployed , plus those employed part time , plus those discouraged persons who have stopped looking for jobs — is 17.3 percent .
Almost 40 percent of the unemployed have been so for seven months or more — which is not surprising : Congress continues to extend eligibility for unemployment benefits , apparently oblivious to the truth that when you subsidize something you get more of it .
He 's not talking about the Wall Street Bankers who got us into this mess , of course .
He 's chiding people who are on unemployment for not taking anything they can get , under any conditions .
He bemoans the fact that I can still pay my rent .
And here , I 've been thanking the lucky stars that had me accept a job across the bridge in New Jersey , where the reasonable benefits are generous enough to still cover my rent and food .
( I suppose I could get find a job doing manual labor at minimum wage somewhere , but the medical bills would n't be worth it . )
I feel like I 've let George down , somehow .
The fact that the few jobs that are still available do n't pay enough to live on makes the decision to stay on unemployment the only sane one - sort of like how George 's banker friends decided to take their own version of government support .
I guess I 'm supposed to feel ashamed .
After all , if I 'd picked the right parents who would have sent me to the right schools , why , I 'd probably be George Will right now !
My magical DNA and Ivy League alumni network would have been enough to save me from life 's travails , someone 's father would have given me a protected job with a fat paycheck , and this point would officially be moot .
It never ceases to amaze me , how they think down there in Cocktail Party Land .

Leading youth mental health expert Professor Patrick McGorry has been named the Australian of the Year .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the announcement this evening at a celebration in front of Parliament House in Canberra .
Professor McGorry , from Victoria , has been working to help mentally ill young people for nearly 30 years .
He says he is thrilled with the award .
" It 's a tremendous honour and as I 'm learning and feeling , it 's a great responsibility I can foresee as well , " he said .
" You obviously have the opportunity potentially to do some good , to try to make a difference . "
Professor McGorry is the executive director of Orygen Youth Health ( OYH ) and a director of the National Youth Mental Health Foundation , which is also known as Headspace .
And he told the 7.30 Report that his award was a " coming of age of the mental health field " .
Mr Rudd paid tribute to Professor McGorry 's work and thanked him for raising awareness of youth mental illness in Australia .
" The incredible influence of his work , the number of young Australians and their families whose lives have been improved , and the value of his contribution to the nation cannot ever fully be measured , " he said .
" With this award , we recognise that we have in Professor McGorry a leader whose drive , compassion and commitment to understanding and treating youth mental illness has helped shaped not only lives , but our national approach to mental health intervention , prevention and treatment .
" He is truly a worthy recipient and I congratulate him on being named Australian of the Year 2010 this evening . "
Professor McGorry was a finalist for the honour alongside Jon Dee , Chris Sarra , Ralph Martins , Julian Burton , Bruce Englefield , Patricia Eastheal and Warwick Thornton , and replaces last year 's winner , Indigenous campaigner Mick Dodson .
Young Australian of the Year
The first Australian soldier to be awarded a Victoria Cross in 40 years , Trooper Mark Donaldson , has been named the Young Australian of the Year .
The 30 - year - old Western Australian was awarded Australia 's highest military honour in 2009 after he drew enemy fire towards himself to protect wounded soldiers in Afghanistan .
" I 'm just full of pride and honour to get this award , " he said .
" General Australians have decided a solider is deserving of this honour and amongst the great people up on stage with me in that arena it was just amazing to be able to honour that as a soldier . "
Trooper Donaldson says he also wants the award to recognise his fellow soldiers .
" I 've been singled out for something , but every day they 're fighting day in day out ... and that 's why I want it to be a collective award as well , " he said .
Trooper Donaldson was also praised for running 80 metres across exposed ground to rescue a wounded coalition force interpreter and carry him to safety .
" Training and instinct kicks in , " he said .
" I would n't say fear does n't come into it because it definitely does , but it 's just a matter of getting on with the job .
" I joined up to be a soldier and I just wanted to give something back to the country . "
The National Australia Day Council said his bravery " saved lives " and won him the " highest respect " .
Trooper Donaldson replaces last year 's Young Australian of the Year winner , victims support worker Jonty Bush .
Senior Australian of the Year
South Australian cook and restaurateur Maggie Beer was named Senior Australian of the Year .
The Australian culinary icon co-hosted ABC cooking program The Cook and the Chef , and hopes her love for food will inspire others to appreciate what they eat .
Ms Beer says she was overcome with emotion upon receiving the award .
" I 'm so emotional I cried , " she said .
" It gives me a platform to spread the things that I believe in , and that is that how much of a better food life is in everyone 's grasp if we think about it and share our knowledge with those who do n't have knowledge
" But it 's more than just the food , it 's the sharing , getting them to think about growing their own .
It 's that whole sum of the parts .
" It is about enriching and cherishing knowledge and finding out from all our multicultural neighbours and finding out about their food .
" Everyone should be empowered to cook and look after themselves and have joy and have fun . "
Ms Beer described her perfect Australia Day meal , saying it would be eaten down at the beach .
" Blue swimmer crabs straight from the pot having caught them ourselves and some beautiful fresh ciabatta bread - simple food to suit the climate , " she said .
Australia 's Local Hero
And NSW food rescuer Ronni Kahn was named Australia 's Local Hero for collecting surplus food from restaurants , cafes and events and delivering it to charities as part of her organisation OzHarvest .
Ms Kahn says since OzHarvest started , it has delivered 4,698,000 meals from food that would otherwise have gone to waste
" I feel truly honoured and so privileged , " she said .
" I feel that I will be a role model , I will do my best - one , for Australia ... and two , to make a difference to the world .
" That 's my job and I urge each and every one of you to do the most you can to give back to this extraordinary country
More than 2,500 nominations were received from the public for the 2010 awards and nominations are already being accepted for the 2011 Australian of the Year .
" For the past 50 years , the Australian of the Year Awards program has honoured those among us who inspire us and do us proud as a nation , " Mr Rudd said .
" This year I am again awed by the achievements and contributions of the award recipients , who demonstrate that greatness comes in many forms and all Australians have the potential for greatness within us . "
In its final installment of the Big Think 's " Went Went Wrong " Series on the financial crisis , they interviewed Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) .
Much of the interview was predictable : Frank mostly explained what anyone closely following the financial regulation push in Congress already knew .
But there was one fascinating gem in discussing where Fannie and Freddie went wrong .
Frank views ushering the poor to own homes as a mistake and believes they should rent instead .
Frank was responding to the question about how Fannie and Freddie could be structured to avoid moral hazard and a too cozy relationship with the regulators .
After stating that we should separate the liquidity creation function from the subsidy objective ( which we already knew he supported ) , he said :
I think the answer is you separate out the function of providing the equity in general for the mortgage market and doing some subsidy and in my judgment , the subsidy again , as I said before , should be focused on affordable rental housing , not in pushing low income people into owning homes that they can't afford .
Can I get an " Amen ! " ?
If someone cannot afford a house , they should not be encouraged to purchase a house .
The logic could n't be simpler .
And yet , over the past decade it was utterly ignored .
I 've never understood why renting is viewed as so shameful or low class .
I 've rented my entire adult life .
I once had a supervisor pushing 50 - years - old with a wife and two kids that probably made over a million - dollars - per - year , and he still rented .
Not to say there 's anything wrong with owning a home either .
There may be reasons why some individuals would prefer buying over renting , despite the fact that buying a home is often not a very good investment .
But I think people need to get past the view that you can't have a successful life without one day owning a home .
It 's a bizarre psychological barrier that , frankly , helped lead us into the worst financial crisis in about 80 years .
For low income people , the argument for owning gets even thinner .
By definition , they will have trouble purchasing a home , since in most markets it 's more expensive to buy the same property you could rent -- especially when you have to worry about homeowner 's insurance , risk - based interest rates and maintenance .
Sometimes , these individuals also have a more irregular income stream , which can lead to trouble paying on - time each month , leading to foreclosure and wrecking their credit .
They would also be better off having better labor mobility , which is provided if you can more easily pick up and leave a rental .
So it 's perfectly acceptable if someone in a low income band wishes to try to buy a home .
That 's certainly their right .
But the government should n't be subsidizing it .
If it really wants to help Americans with relatively lower incomes , it would be better off focusing on affordable rental housing , as Frank suggests .
From his lips to President Obama 's ears .

Jason Kidd registers triple - double , draws one incredible foul [ video ]
Jason Kidd posted 19 points , 17 assists and 16 rebounds in the Mavs ’ impressive 111- 103 overtime win in Atlanta .
I ’m not a huge Kidd fan , but I absolutely LOVE this play he made late in the fourth quarter …
It drives me nuts that coaches are always standing on the court and I think it ’s great that Kidd took advantage of that to get his team an extra point , which eventually forced overtime .
I do n’t know what Woodson is yelling about .
He looks like a complete idiot .
Get off the court !

Why I am here and why I am writing ?
The answer to this question is so simple , of course to make money .
Years ago , I was thinking it impossible to make a huge amount of income by writing .
But the passing years taught me that I was not right .
I was really at fault when I underestimated the power of my fingers and my mind .
I took a big journey in the word of worlds and met new ones in years .
In the earlier stages of my work , words were just a way to jump from one life to another .
Every word I wrote is like a world where I was born in .
As if I was playing different roles in a scenery of mysterious letters .
As soon as I met new people and make new friends , I felt more comfortable and powerful .
In time , I saw that each word returned me pennies and dollars .
Most of you probably ponder on what I do to make a great income .
No hurry .
I will divulge all my experience as a combination of rules .
Rule 1 : Choose your program to write for .
You should always write for honest programs .
To my experience and observations , there are several sites really trusted .
By name , Triond , Factoidz , Helium , Associated Content , E-how , Hubpages and Bukisa are great .
Rule 2 : Choose the best rating sites .
The payment rates for unique article is important factor while selecting you site .
Triond is good but for more qualified writers .
Factoidz is best .
Bukisa is also good rates as much as $ 3.50 for each 1000 clicks .
Rule 3 : Write as much as possible
The more you write , the more money you make .
The simple rule of nature .
Rule 4 : Be descriptive and choose a good title
You should always be descriptive and clear in your articles .
Giving examples and quotes make your articles understandable , readable and elite .
Titles are the critical points of articles because the reader first contacts with title .
Good title makes your work popular in the field of competition .
Rule 5 : Use as much words as possible
Good readers look for different words and styles .
For the reader , every writer has a unique style .
Words are always there , but writers align and combine them in completely different ways .
This determines the style .
Rule 6 : Use proper punctuation
Punctuation is crucial in determining the quality of an essay or article .
Improper punctuation causes misunderstandings of content .
It perplexes the readers ' mind .
Rule 7 : Insert related images into your content
Gorgeous photos or slides inserted into the content make it eye catching and intriguing .
Now , we have content in our hands and it is ready to be published .
We completed the first stage of freelance writing job .
The second stage is as much impossible as the first stage .
Without promoting , our work is nothing .
There are many ways of promoting but the most popular ones are social book marking and social networking sites .
Stumbleupon , Digg , Mixx , Reddit and Propeller are enough to promote your work .
Of course you are free to add your link to many others .
Stumbleupon and Digg give much more traffic to your link if stumblers and diggers approve that it is well qualified .
If your link is somehow moved to the frontpage of Digg , this will in turn give you back thousands of clicks and perhaps hundreds of dollars .
Facebook , Myspace , Friendfeed and Twitter are favorable social networking sites .
Via these , you may make a great traffic .
This totally depends on popularity of you in these services and the number of your followers .
A quality article may give you thousands of clicks at the end of the day .
Forums , search engines and directories are other traffic sources .
However , they are not as popular and powerful as networking and book marking sites .
In a nutshell , it is not difficult to make money by simply writing but also not easy either .
Making money requires effort , discipline and devotion .
Honda has been dealing with the airbag problem since 2008 Honda has added 437,700 cars , mainly in North America , to its existing global safety recall over airbag inflation problems .
It broadens a recall announced in late 2008 for less than 4,000 Accord and Civic sedans , then expanded in mid-2009 to cover another 510,000 vehicles .
The latest announcement also covers Japan , Mexico , Taiwan and Australia .
The fresh blow to Japanese carmakers came as Toyota recalled nearly half a million hybrid cars over faulty brakes .
Toyota has already had to bring millions of other vehicles back to dealerships amid accelerator and floormat problems .
We cannot be completely certain the airbag inflator will perform as designed
Honda statement
Toyota in global recall of Prius Toyota fights back Mardell 's America : Toyota 's woes
The scale of Toyota 's recalls will be of particular interest to other car manufacturers , according to David Leggett , editor of the website Justauto.com .
" Toyota have been keen to cut costs by increasingly using common parts in different models .
If a part goes wrong in one model then other models will need to be recalled , " he said .
" I 'm sure lots of other car manufacturers will be keeping a very close eye on what 's happening with Toyota . "
Recalls within the car industry , however , are not uncommon .
" They happen pretty regularly , " said Jay Nagley , an industry analyst with Redspy Automotive .
" At the moment they are in the news because of what 's happening with Toyota , but if Honda had done its recall months ago no would have heard about it .
" Everyone 's looking for the next recall , but it 's business as usual for carmakers despite what 's in the news . "
Airbag inflator Honda - Japan 's second - biggest carmaker - said the defective airbags can overinflate and burst , spraying potentially deadly metal shards .
The carmaker said the inflators were at risk of rupturing , " resulting in metal fragments passing through the airbag cushion material and possibly causing injury or fatality to vehicle occupants " .
The fault has already been linked to 11 injuries and one fatality .
Honda said in a statement : " We can not be completely certain that the driver 's airbag inflator in the vehicles being added to this recall at this time will perform as designed . "
Its shares fell in Japan after the announcement .
The recall will apply to 2001 and 2002 model - year Accord , Civic , Odyssey , Pilot , CL , CR - V and 2002 Acura TL vehicles , the firm said .
The company says owners should take their vehicle to an authorised dealer as soon as they receive notification from Honda .
The carmaker 's latest recall affects 378,000 cars in the US and 41,000 in Canada .
It extends to 4,000 vehicles in Japan and 13,000 from other countries , including Mexico ( 9,000 ) , Taiwan ( 1,300 ) and Australia ( 700 ) .
HONDA RECALLS Nov 2008 : Airbag propellant problem reported in US .
Recall of 4,200 cars June 2009 : Similar airbag problem reported , recall widened to 508,000 cars mainly in US July 2009 : Japan recalls 1,532 cars Feb 2010 : 419,000 recalled in US and Canada ; 17,000 in Japan and other countries The Japanese - only models are Inspire , Saber and Lagreat .
Just last month , Honda had to recall 650,000
Fit hatchbacks worldwide to fix a switch defect that could cause a fire .
It said the fault could allow water to enter the power window mechanism , making components overheat .
The Fit is sold as the Jazz and City in other countries .
That recall affects Asia , Latin America , Europe , South Africa and North America .
For Toyota , the problems continued as a US Congressional committee cast doubts on its plans to fix accelerator problems .
A memo to lawmakers cited " substantial evidence " of redesigned floormats failing to stop the pedals sticking .
On Tuesday , Toyota recalled 436,000 hybrid vehicles worldwide , including its latest Prius , to fix brake faults .
That comes on top of more than 8 million Toyotas recalled since last October for problems with slipping floormats and sticking accelerator pedals , linked to crashes that have killed at least 19 people .
Toyota 's UK centres begin repairing the accelerator pedals on 180,000 vehicles on Wednesday .
They have the capacity to fix 6,000 cars a day , meaning it will be a month before the process is complete .

' No scan , no flight ' at Heathrow and Manchester
Electromagnetic waves are beamed onto passengers to create a 3D image Some passengers at Heathrow and Manchester airports will have to go through full body scanners before boarding their flights under new rules .
It is now compulsory for people selected for a scan to take part , or they will not be allowed to fly .
The new security rules have been introduced following the attempt to blow up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day .
There have been concerns the scanners breach passengers ' rights to privacy .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said in the immediate future only a small proportion of airline passengers would be selected for scanning .
In a written statement to the House of Commons , he said : " If a passenger is selected for scanning , and declines , they will not be permitted to fly . "
The scanners were introduced at the two airports on Monday and will be installed at Birmingham later in the month .
Privacy protection
The machine has been used at Manchester Airport 's Terminal 2 since October , with additional scanners planned for Terminals 1 and 3 by the end of February .
The Department of Transport has published an interim code of practice covering privacy , health and safety , data protection and equality issues .
" The code will require airports to undertake scanning sensitively , having regard to the rights of passengers , " Lord Adonis said .
Manchester Airport said it had put strict procedures in place to protect the privacy of passengers .
Its head of customer experience , Sarah Barrett , said : " It will enhance security for everyone , which can only be a good thing , without compromising people 's privacy .
" The image generated by the body scanner cannot be stored or captured nor can security officers viewing the images recognise people . "
The equipment does not allow security staff to see passengers naked , she added .
A rule which meant under 18s were not allowed to participate in the body scanner trial has been overturned by the government .
The introduction of body scanners has sparked a wide debate , and even the home secretary has admitted it will not be a " magic bullet " .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of trying to detonate a bomb on a flight from Amsterdam as it was about to land in Detroit .

2011 Japan , Tea for CEOs { 48 images } Created 30 Oct 2008
In every interview and meeting I attend , in the nicotine stained boardrooms of corporate Japan , I get brought a drink , mostly green tea , sometimes bad coffee , sometimes fruit juice , and once a carton of banana milk ...
Companies with household names such as Canon , Toyota , Honda , Suzuki , know how to look after their CEO 's and their guests ...
Five minutes into every meeting , there is an almost inaudible knock from outside and the boardroom door silently opens , ushering in an employee - always female , never male - bringing refreshment of some kind , perhaps coffee to wake up the inhabitants of sometimes achingly dull meetings .
If you 're lucky she will come twice during the meeting - first with tea , secondly with coffee , always silently and served with a little bow and a sweet smile .
Within these pictures we see the hierarchical society of Japanese companies , the dated uniforms still worn by secretaries , the bad art on the walls , the overhead fluorescent lighting , and the decor that is invariably stuck somewhere in the 1970's .
A small glimpse into the boardrooms of mythical monster of Corporate Japan Inc .

Those who thought things are so bad they can't get worse are wrong yet again as central Florida median prices for existing homes drop the most in at least 15 years .
The raw numbers look ominous , but the figures are distorted by foreclosures and short sales .
Not counting distress sales , prices declined 3 % .
That is still a big drop .
The Orlando Sentinel discusses the situation in Orlando - area home prices plunge 14 % in January .
President Barack Obama announced plans to funnel $ 1.5 billion of foreclosure relief to Florida and four other states .
But the Orlando Regional Realtors Association also reported that the median price of the area 's existing - home sales fell 14 percent in January from the month before — the biggest such drop in at least 15 years .
The culprit : bank repossessions and short sales , which made up 73 percent of all resales last month in the core Orlando market .
As a result , the median price was only $ 103,000 in January — down from $ 120,000 in December and $ 264,436 at the market 's peak in July 2007 .
Kathleen Gallagher McIver , chair woman of the local Realtors group said " This distorted median price does not equate to an across - the - board loss of value for traditional homes in good condition , " she said .
The association noted that resales of " normal " homes had a median price of $ 169,990 , down less than 3 percent from a month earlier .
Only about one - fourth of the January resales in the Orlando Realtors ' core market — mainly Orange and Seminole counties — were " normal " homes .
About half were bank - owned sales , and their median fell to $ 69,550 .
About one - fourth were short sales , and they fetched a median of $ 115,000 .

Orange County Shadow Inventory Analysis
Us : Your study says that five million of the 7.7 million delinquent homes will go through foreclosure or a “ foreclosure - related procedure . ”
How is this likely to occur ?
Wayne :
Of the 7.7 million delinquent homeowners , we actually think that only about 1.6 million will be able avoid losing their homes , and that the remaining 6.1 million will lose their homes .
We say that there is 5 million units of shadow inventory because we estimate that about 1.1 million delinquent homeowners already have their homes listed for sale , and we would not classify those homes as “ shadow . ”
Us : Any indication how bad the problem is in Orange County ?
Wayne : Orange County has about 13 months of shadow inventory , which is above the national average , but lower than other Southern California metros .
Us : What are the key implications of your findings ?
Wayne :
Our main conclusion is that prices are likely to keep steady , despite the massive shadow inventory , because the tremendous affordability we have today will create a floor for pricing .
However , if the economic recovery stalls or mortgage rates spike , we ’re going to see prices tumble again .
Amazing Conclusion
' Who do you think made the first stone spear ? " asks Temple Grandin .
" That was n't the yakkity yaks sitting around the campfire .
It was some Asperger sitting in the back of a cave figuring out how to chip rocks into spearheads .
Without some autistic traits you would n't even have a recording device to record this conversation on . "
As many as one in 110 American children are affected by autism spectrum disorders , according to the Centers for Disease Control .
Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed than girls .
But what ...
The boy allegedly put the bee on to his classmate 's cheek An Indonesian schoolboy who was facing " serious abuse " charges for causing a bee to sting a classmate has been cleared by a court , reports say .
The boy , believed to be about nine years old , had allegedly placed the bee on a girl 's face where it stung her .
Her parents reported him to the police who arrested him .
He faced up to three years in prison .
But the judge said the case was about " normal children 's naughtiness " and should never have reached court .
" It could have been settled amicably by the school and the parents involved , " judge Sutriadi Yahya was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
Mr Yahya said the boy had been acquitted of all charges and the court would " leave it to the parents to guide him " .
The boy 's mother , Any Sulistyowati , wept as the verdict was read out , said AFP .
" We 're satisfied with the judge 's decision .
We will look after our child properly , " she said .
The Jakarta Post said the girl 's parents were angry that she was being teased at school and had wanted to make an example of the boy .
Children in Indonesia are tried as adults from the age of eight , but there are calls for the age to be raised to 12 .
Juveniles who are given prison sentences usually serve their term in adult jails , contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , to which Indonesia is a signatory .
In 2009 , a group of 10 boys who worked as shoe shiners were accused of gambling while waiting for customers in the capital , Jakarta .
They were found guilty and faced five years in prison , but were returned to their parents ' care after a public outcry .

Here 's a typical " date night " with me and Hollywood : I do n't know what I want to see .
Neither does Hollywood .
But it bangs on my eyeballs and eardrums like Stanley Kowalski anyway .
Sometimes I come away from the multiplex reasonably satisfied ; other times I 'm bummed beyond measure .
It 's like some endless , brutal visit to the optometrist :
This explosion or that explosion ?
This superintelligent shark or that zombie anaconda ?
It 's all so clumsy , so imprecise .
Which is why I 'm thrilled to learn that Hollywood has found a way to improve its hit rate .
Not with better filmmaking —
God forbid , we do n't want artistry gumming up our popcorn flicks — but with science .
Get ready for the optimized moviegoing experience , where every instant is calculated to tickle your neural G - spot — all thanks to functional magnetic resonance imaging , soon to be every director 's new best friend .
That 's the dream of MindSign Neuromarketing , a fledgling San Diego firm with an ambitious , slightly Orwellian charter : to usher in the age of " neurocinema , " the real - time monitoring of the brain 's reaction to movies , using ever - improving fMRI technology .
The company uses the scanning technique to track blood flow to specific areas ( especially the amygdalae , those darling little almonds of primal emotion ) while a test subject watches a movie .
Right now , the metrics are pretty crude , but in theory , studios could use fMRI to fine - tune a movie 's thrills , chills , and spills with clickwheel ease , keeping your brain perpetually at the redline .
MindSign cofounder Philip Carlsen said in an NPR interview that he foresees a future where directors send their dailies ( raw footage fresh from the set ) to the MRI lab for optimization .
" You can actually make your movie more activating , " he said , " based on subjects ' brains . "
MindSign has already helped advertisers dial in their commercials ' second - by - second noggin delight and has even assisted studios in refining movie trailers and TV spots :
One of its " videographs , " mapped over a trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End , clearly shows viewers ' brains lighting up whenever a monkey appears onscreen .
( Of course , if there 's one thing we do n't need a computer to tell us , it 's that monkeys are funny . )
Now the company wants to replace that ancient analog heuristic , the dreaded focus group .
Carlsen claims that focus group members not only misrepresent the likes and dislikes of the broader population — they can't even articulate their own preferences .
Often , they 'll tell a human researcher one thing while the fMRI reveals they 're feeling the opposite .
Neurocinema helpfully speeds up a process Hollywood began years ago , namely the elimination of all subjectivity in favor of sheer push - button sensation .
By quantifying which set pieces , character moments , and other modular film packets really lather up my gray matter , the adfotainment - industrial complex can quickly and efficiently deliver what I actually want .
Movies wo n't be " made , " they 'll be generated .
Michael Bay , with access to my innermost circuitry , can really get in there and noogie the ol ' pleasure center .
And here 's the best part :
Once the biz knows what I want , it can give me more of the same .
I 'll soon be reporting levels of consumer satisfaction previously known only to drug abusers .
My moviegoing life will , literally and figuratively , be all about the next hit .
" But now movies will be more formulaic than ever ! " purists whine .
Au contraire , aesthete scum .
" Formula " is for suckers .
It implies narrative — peaks and valleys .
What MindSign seems to be offering is a new model — not formulaic , but fractal .
Forget ups and downs , suspense and release .
What if every moment were a spike , every scene " trailer - able " ?
In fact , movies will become essentially a series of trailers , which , incidentally , are far better - loved than the oft - crummy features they encapsulate .
Movie houses will become crack dens with cup holders , and I 'll lie there mainlining pure viewing pleasure for hours .
Why not ?
I can't decide what I want to watch anyway .
Luckily , Hollywood is there to make those tough choices for me .
And to show me the zombie shark I never even knew I was dying to see .
US Supreme Court Mulls Over Sex Offender Confinement Act
The Supreme Court of the United States is deciding whether the federal government has the same authority as the member states regarding the further confinement of sex offenders who have already completed their service time in jail .
The issue rose up after Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that the justices uphold the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.
Chief Justice John Roberts asked her to defend why federal authority in sex offender cases does not end when their prison sentences lapsed .
Justice Antonin Scalia has the most reservations about it after hearing Kagan argue that states may not confine further some prisoners who they think may still pose dangers .
“ This is a recipe for the federal government taking over everything , ” Scalia said .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the theory would actually hold out for any dangerous criminal if the argument passes .
Currently , public health and safety are powers granted to states .
Laws where the nation act as one are held by the federal government , like war .
Federal law only applies in crimes if the person involve is a federal authority or if it had happened in a federal property .
A few months later , the extremist Hutu militia invaded the home .
She remembers that it was the day of her very first menstrual period  the only one she has ever had .

“ First , they tied up my uncle , ” Jeanne said .
“ They cut off his hands , gouged out his eyes , cut off his feet , cut off his sex organs , and left him like that .
He was still alive .
“ His wife and his son were also there .
Then they took all of us into the forest . ”
That militia is known for kidnapping people and enslaving them for months , even years .
Men are turned into porters , and girls into sex slaves .
Jeanne and other girls were regularly tied spread - eagle and gang - raped , and she soon became pregnant .
The rapes continued , sometimes with sticks that tore apart her insides and left her dribbling wastes constantly .
Somehow the fetus survived , but her pelvis was too immature to deliver the baby .
One of the people the militia had kidnapped was a doctor who was forced to treat the soldiers .
The doctor , seeing that Jeanne was close to dying in obstructed childbirth , cut her open with an old knife , without anesthetic , and removed the stillborn baby .
Jeanne was delirious and almost dead , so the militia dumped her beside a road .

BBC News Magazine
A radical new voting system proposed by Gordon Brown which would allow the public to rank prospective MPs in order of preference has been compared to that used by TV's X Factor .
The links between voting for a reality TV star and a politician do n't stop there .
Reality TV fans are asked to pick a favourite .
If that person gets knocked out , they pick another - and then another if that person is also sent home .
Viewers of last year 's X Factor might have plumped for Jedward , then , when the terrible twosome were booted off , Olly Murs .
Equally , fans of BBC's Strictly Come Dancing might have backed Jade Johnson , then switched to Chris Hollins after her departure .
Olly and Chris may not have been their first choice , but they liked them enough to propel both into their respective finals .
Both main parties see the parallels - deploying Jedward as a means of mocking the other Both TV contests use a voting system not dissimilar to the Alternative Vote system , which Gordon Brown proposes holding a referendum on .
While the current " first past the post " system requires voters to mark an X by a preferred candidate , under the Alternative Vote model voters rank prospective MPs in order of preference .
Labour 's plans have been attacked by the Tories , who accused the PM of wanting to " fiddle " the system , and the Lib Dems , who said the plan did not go far enough .
But Labour MP Martin Linton is a fan and made the link between the Alternative Vote model and the X Factor model .
" Not only the Mayor of London is elected in this way - and other mayors - but indeed when people vote in the X Factor they are essentially using an alternative vote because candidates are eliminated .
Admittedly in the X Factor over a long period of weeks , but they 're still eliminated one by one . "
In psephologist speak , it 's a " majoritarian system " - the winner is the one the most people approve of ( or dislike the least ) .
And it also gives them a chance to punish those they do not wish to see in office by ranking them lowest , says Stephen Coleman , professor of political communication at Leeds University .
How they work : alternative voting systems BACK {current} of {total} NEXT " It gives you the chance to eliminate who you do n't like , that 's quite important .
Under our [ present , first past the post ] voting system , if you are a Labour supporter in a safe Conservative seat , or vice versa , there is very little you can do to register your displeasure and that 's frustrating . "
But critics say it's a system - whether in the Big Brother house or in a house of representatives - that favours the moderates .
The " Marmite characters " , those most loved or hated , tend to get eliminated , leaving the final choice between vanilla and , er , vanilla .
" The winner is the one who is most aggregately popular .
It 's a maximisation of compromise , " says Mr Coleman .
Wicked whispers Peter Kellner , who runs polling firm YouGov , says the closest political example to the talent show format can be found across the Channel .
From this field , Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal went into the final
In the first round of any French presidential election , a host of candidates square up on the ballot paper .
If none win an overall majority - as happened in the last election , in 2007 - all but the two most popular are eliminated .
A second round of voting is held a fortnight later .
The other constant is the presence of judges or experts .
These people already exist in our democracy - the " commentariat " of columnists and TV pundits who give a daily commentary of who 's in and who 's out in British politics .
" The voters watch the politicians and pay attention to what Trevor Kavanagh [ one time influential political editor of the Sun ] is saying .
And on X Factor , we have Simon Cowell , Cheryl Cole , Louis Walsh and Dannii Minogue mediating in the same way .
" The question is how much influence do they have at election time ?
In the same way , I 'm not sure how much influence the judges have in X Factor . "
He believes the influence of bloggers speculating on the minutiae of political personalities will grow , just as bloggers affect the voting on talent shows .
" You could argue that Danyl Johnson in X Factor suffered because of the stuff that was rumoured to have happened in the house .
It was not on the programme but the tabloids and blogosphere were full of it . "
H'Angus the Monkey , voted mayor of Hartlepool in 2002
With talent shows , the public enjoys ignoring the judges ' verdicts to support characters like John Sergeant or Jedward .
And politics throws up occasional personalities like Enoch Powell who are despised by the commentariat but popular with the public .
But there 's a limit to their advance in politics .
" The Jedwards of politics are Jimmy Goldsmith or Oswald Mosley , and get spotted much more quickly or decisively for who they are than in X Factor .
The best analogy is the monkey elected to be Mayor of Hartlepool . "
These characters are initially popular but never win high office in politics , he says .
Getting to know you ...
But if the parallels bear up for Mr Kellner , fellow psephologist John Curtice is less certain the custodians of democracy have anything to learn from reality TV voting models .
" My first question is - so how long do you want an election to go on for ? "
The British way is to get voting in a general election done and dusted in a day .
Yet Mr Curtice acknowledges that the reality TV format of running over several weeks has a parallel in places such as France and Ukraine where voters return to the ballot box after an initial elimination round .
However , he struggles to see how a presidential - style head - to - head run -off can work in a parliamentary democracy , where voters are electing a local MP .
Mr Coleman , however , says the reality TV model allows voters to get a more rounded picture of the hopefuls .
" In elections people vote for parties rather than candidates because they do n't have the sort of access to MPs that we get to reality TV contestants - following them over a period time gives you a chance to think about who you want to vote for . "
Disliked by judges , loved by voters
It 's sometimes said one of the factors that switches off the public from politics is the sheer weight of information voters now have access to .
Faced with a plethora of spin and stats , some feel unable to make an informed choice ... and so opt for no choice at all .
So how about a panel of officially - appointed independent experts who could cut through the morass of information to deliver pure , unadulterated facts ?
Mr Curtice snorts at the idea , believing it would amount to nothing more than a " guided democracy " .
The phrase is synonymous with the style of government established by President Surkarno in Indonesia in 1959 - democracy with a dash or autocracy .
In essence - not a democracy .
" I think the last time we had that was when we had limited franchise , " says Curtice , " and that 's why the people who did vote , would do so for whoever was the local landowner . "
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
" And the common room was painted this very ugly colour by popular vote . "
This is the risk of scoring candidates :
The second choice is more likely to get elected than the first choice as many people will vote for a spoiler candidate - one they think has no hope of success - simply to promote their favourite candidate .
It also does not address this representational democracy we suffer from .
As things stand , more votes could be cast for party A than party B , but party B would still get in , simply because they won more seats by a small margin than party A , who might win their seats by large margins .
Either ditch representation and opt for a proportional system , or ditch parliament and opt for a house of representatives , each independent of a political party .
Then we might have democracy .
Steve Powell , Wolverhampton
Steve , this sounds much more like it .
Take the choice away from contrived parties and vote for local individuals , answerable to local parliamentary councils .
Too good for the current lot to accept , but an excellent notion , nonetheless .
Paul Williams , Marlborough , Wilts Remember the 2007 Scottish Council elections ?
They brought in the STV ( similar to AV ) for the first time .
Although a good idea in principle with no vote wasted , many voters did not understand the system , wasting votes .
There is also the likelihood of a coalition - not necessarily a bad thing ... we 've had one since 1999 and no real issues .
Heather , Inverness Martin Linton is wrong in claiming that AV is the system used by talent shows .
The talent shows all use multiple round voting , where someone is eliminated after each round and the voters get a chance to cast another vote with this information .
This is known as Exhaustive Voting , and is rarely used in large elections , but is used in small elections .
( Votes for presidents etc may sometimes use a two - round system as a compromise . )
Interestingly , it is always claimed that multi-round voting is impractical en mass , but the talent shows have shown just how simple it could be and how effective it is .
AW , Kent I find it interesting that you use reality TV and French presidential elections to compare with this proposed system , and then complain that a system that works for a presidential system ( where there 's only one post to be filled ) would n't work with with a general election ( where there are hundreds ) .
Obviously !
Why do n't you just compare to the electoral systems for general elections in other countries ?
It 's used in Australia without any difficulties .
As for those who worry it would be too complicated to understand - FPTP is pretty darn simple , but most countries in the world use something more complicated , like AV or some form of PR .
Are Britons afraid they wo n't be able to understand a system millions of others use in many different countries around the world ?
Eileen , Dublin , Ireland STV would be a breath of fresh air for our politics .
With a third of Britons ( opinion polls indicate a hung parliament ) not wanting either Labour or the Tories , it would see the election of other parties in large numbers with alternative views .
More women , more ethnic minorities and more honest politicians not afraid to say how it is to the voting public .
Richard Denton - White
We have this system in Australia , works for us !
Chris , Perth , Australia I myself was a candidate in an election using this very system in university elections nearly 40 years ago .
I lost out in a second or third round , but was happy that my voters had their second choice votes transferred to one of the other candidates .
In the first past the post system , a candidate can win with as little as 20 % of the vote if say there are half a dozen other candidates who all poll less than the " winning " candidate .
At least with STV , electors can express who they do n't want to win by giving them either a very low ranking or no preference at all .
Tony , Bury St Edmunds , UK
Under this system , your vote is never wasted on what you think is a great candidate with an outside chance , which also has the benefit of making all those " Only X can stop Y getting in here ! " graphs in the pre-election junk mail completely obsolete .
This is a system used because it is deemed to be fairer for a great variety of things , from student politics to deciding which city will host the Olympics .
Its only downside is that it is more demanding to count the votes , electronic vote counters would be required to have the results in on time .
If we can make machines that read cheques correctly , we can certainly make one that reads ballot papers , and probably quite quickly too .
Gavin , Oxford X Factor type voting would be brilliant if it includes several episodes to enable voters to get involved .
To do this you could add elements of scenario planning : each week for a month we could set potential labour / Conservative / Liberal cabinets political dilemmas representative of the future ( global warming , Iran war , double dip depression etc ) and give them an hour to produce policies in response with fly - on - the - wall cameras showing us how these are arrived at and thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the politicians involved .
Outcomes of these policies could then be predicted by computer models run by a team of three independent experts and the public vote on these in order of preference .
The cabinet which collects the greatest accumulated popularity over four programmes would be the next government .
What do others think about this ?
Philip Iszatt , Coleford , Somerset , UK
We used this voting system at university for our student union positions .
I helped count one of the ballots and it can get quite complicated with all the re-allocations .
I do n't trust the government to correctly count the voting under this " new " system so it would be best to stick to the current one .
Charlotte , London Charlotte , no - one would trust the government to count votes , that 's why they do n't .
Dave , Hythe Gordon Ramsey shows often on his TV programmes that the public is not erudite enough to choose an evening meal without limiting their choice , and the chef in charge is n't capable enough in dealing with too much choice .
Transfer that metaphor across to an already apathetic electorate and you have Conservative voters complaining they have no real alternative on the centre - right , and that Labour and Liberal will sweep up a disproportionate number of additional otherwise " wasted votes " , whilst some Labour voters complain we 're not even sure we want to vote for our own party at the moment let alone a hatful of unrepresentative alternatives .
In my opinion this whole idea of electoral reform is absurd .
Under FPTP we have avoided hung parliaments and on the whole , provided the country with a Government which , if not always representing national consensus , is the party the people felt were the best people for the job given the alternatives .
Fred , Coventry , UK / Leuven , Belgium
What this article does n't say is that Stuart Drummond ( H'Angus the Monkey ) , mayor of Hartlepool , got re-elected twice - quite possibly because he was n't , and to some respects even now is n't , part of the political landscape .
Sacha , Hartlepool
He gets voted in because the football fans keep voting for him .
When you ask them why they vote for him , the replies are normally the same - he gets on the train with them to away games , or is on Facebook , or other stupid reasons why you would vote a monkey to the mayors job .
He won by 884 votes last time round , so fingers crossed he is on his way out .
Tracy , Hartlepool
The idea of simplifying voting is very good and key to increasing turnout - one of the reasons people do n't vote is from laziness and complacency .
The main reason now for no party taking a decisive lead is because Labour supporters are choosing not to vote , rather than vote Tory .
And I know people who do n't just because they can't be bothered to make the effort to find their nearest polling station .
If voting consisted of texting , e-mail or phoning , then turnout would be significantly higher .
Though obviously there would be all sorts of issues in regulating this .
A freephone number would attract a lot of interest , and I personally feel everyone should be compelled to vote in a democracy .
I think what we should see is a system where votes for MPs and the PM are separate .
People would have a round of national voting to decide who the PM would be between the major parties - this would mean a Tory supported in a strong Labour area would still have a valid vote , and vice versa .
Then vote for a local MP , allowing people to focus on who will best run their area , not who will best run their country .
But then that raises problems of having a PM not in control of the Commons ... it seems there is no ideal solution to a perfect democracy .
Jack , Haverhill Jack , you can't have a system where you vote for an MP and PM separately .
The PM is simply the leader of the party that returned the most MPs .
We indirectly vote for the PM by voting in our MPs .
Under your system Labour could win a clear majority of seats in parliament but Cameron could be elected PM , which would be nonsensical .
Who would form a government then ?
And who would sit in Cabinet - Labour or Conservative MPs ?
You could find that 500 Labour MPs are voted in but having to sit on the opposition bench because Cameron got voted in as PM and his 50 MPs are sat on the government bench .
Dave , Liverpool OK then - three candidates for a post , 50 % vote for candidate A with candidate C as second choice and 50 % vote for candidate B with candidate C as second choice .
Who gets in ?
Jon , Leics , UK
It would be a dead heat between candidates A and B , with C eliminated and no votes to redistribute .
As with the current first past the post system , it 'll then be up to the returning officer to sort it out - I believe in theory it would come down to drawing lots .
However , there would doubtless by arguments in court about spoiled ballots , etc , and the election would end up being re-run .
David , London Jon , given that they are both equally popular , it would be a toss of a coin , just like now , but now if the top two candidates each get 20 % of the vote , and the remaining field gets 60 % , we are left with an MP commanding the support of only 20 % of his constituents .
AV seems a sensible option which would allow far more votes to actually make a difference .
Take Wiltshire North , my former constituency .
At the last election , the Conservative candidate polled 46.9 % of the vote .
If you discount everyone except the top two candidates , you might have got a different result that reflected the 53 % of voters that did n't vote for him , and might have encouraged the 30 % of people that did n't vote to come out .

Second one - day international , Gwalior :
India 401 -3 ( 50 ovs ) bt South Africa 248 ( 42.5 ovs ) by 153 runs
Match scorecard Tendulkar underlined his sensational class with a double century in Gwalior
Sachin Tendulkar created history with the first double century in one - day internationals as India thrashed South Africa by 153 runs in Gwalior .
The 36 - year - old hit 25 fours and three sixes in an unbeaten 200 off 147 balls .
It passed the previous best of 194 , set by Pakistan 's Saeed Anwar in 1997 and Zimbabwe 's Charles Coventry last year .
Mahendra Dhoni hit four sixes in 68 from 35 balls in a mammoth 401 - 3 , and South Africa were 248 all out as India took an unassailable 2 - 0 series lead .
Tendulkar , whose previous best one - day knock was the 186 not out he scored against New Zealand in 1999 , is already the leading run-scorer in Test and ODI cricket .
But to have reached such a landmark , with a single in the final over , only serves to underline his class and add to the legacy that already surrounds arguably the finest batsman to have played the game .
His innings , the 46th one - day century of his career , was typified by wristy strokes , trademark boundary shots and , above all , stamina as he batted through the entire innings .
He passed the previous best score in ODIs off 140 deliveries before taking his time over the final six runs , completing his double century with a single off Charl Langeveldt four balls from the end of the innings .
Despite clearly suffering with cramp towards the end , Tendulkar was not to be denied and the packed Gwalior crowd were in raptures as he brought up the record .
HIGHEST INDIVIDUAL ODI SCORES 200 * Sachin Tendulkar , India v South Africa 2010 194 * Charles Coventry , Zimbabwe v Bangladesh 2009 194 Saeed Anwar , Pakistan v India 1997 189 * Viv Richards , W Indies v England 1984 189 Sanath Jayasuriya , Sri Lanka v India 2000 Around him , Dinesh Karthik and Dhoni provided able support .
Karthik , who came to the crease in just the fourth over after Virender Sehwag sent a high catch down to Dale Steyn at third man off Wayne Parnell , struck four fours and three sixes on his way to an 85 - ball knock of 79 .
He departed when he mistimed a pull shot to Herschelle Gibbs at mid-wicket but Yusuf Pathan upped the pace with 36 off 23 balls , including two huge sixes .
However , not even he could match Dhoni 's remarkable strokeplay , the India captain providing a staggering display of power hitting with four sixes and seven fours that allowed Tendulkar to calmly build his record - breaking innings at the other end .
When Mark Boucher departed in the 23rd over South Africa were 134 - 7 , and though AB de Villiers struck 13 fours and two sixes in an unbeaten 114 , his fifth one - day hundred , the tourists were never in the hunt .
They must now try to avoid a whitewash in the final match of the series in Ahmedabad on Saturday .
Several leading former players who were fortunate to witness the innings saluted India 's favourite son Tendulkar .
606 : DEBATE
So glad he is the first one to get there in the mens game
80 mph Former India captain Bishen Singh Bedi said : " It was a great moment for us and another class act from Tendulkar .
Sachin has been a great warrior for us and this innings was a delight to watch . "
The former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail , who was Anwar 's opening partner , said : " It was a brilliant innings and if you speak to Saeed Anwar , he would be so glad Tendulkar was the one to break his record .
" We all know how talented and how passionate he is about the game , but it 's incredible that at the age of 36 he is still going on , he plays the full 50 overs , runs hard and at no point during this knock did he look like he was going to throw his wicket away .
" But the biggest reason he gets all these records is because he respects the game tremendously . "
Another former Pakistan captain and top - order batsman Rameez Raja also paid rich tribute to Tendulkar .
" He 's been a great ambassador for India and world cricket , " Rameez said .
" He is a great role model because for someone who has played international cricket for 20 - odd years there is n't a single scandal against him .
" It shows the character of the man and he still has the passion and enthusiasm of a 10 - year - old . "

Was Joseph Stack a terrorist ?
Andrew Sullivan says yes : “ This was obviously an act of terrorism .
When someone is mad at the government , and when he flies a plane into a federal building , killing two and traumatizing countless others and urges others to do the same , he is a terrorist . ”
Glenn Greenwald says yes :
“ The issue is n’t whether Stack ’s grievances are real or his responses just ; it is that the act unquestionably comports with the official definition . ”
Dave Neiwert says yes : “ Since when , after all , is attempting to blow up a federal office as a protest against federal policies NOT an act of domestic terrorism ? ”
Dave then helpfully supplies the FBI ’s official definition :
Domestic terrorism refers to activities that involve ( 1 ) acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state ; ( 2 ) appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ; ( 3 ) to influence the policy of a government by mass destruction , assassination , or kidnapping ; and ( 4 ) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States .
[ 18 U.S.C. § 2331( 5 ) ]
Well , let ’s take a look at this .
I ’ve added numbers to the FBI definition for easy reference , and obviously Stack met conditions # 1 and # 4 .
No argument there .
But how about # 2 ?
Was Stack trying to intimidate civilians ?
In his manifesto he says , “ Nothing changes unless there is a body count … .
But I also know that by not adding my body to the count , I insure nothing will change . ”
Italics mine .
This means ( obviously ) that he was willing to kill himself to make a point .
Then there ’s this : “ I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt . ”
Is he talking here about more killing of civilians ?
Or is he hoping that other people follow his lead and kill themselves , with the numbers eventually getting so big that the “ American zombies ” wake up ?
At best , it ’s unclear .
He ’s certainly not trying to inspire civilian fear here ( he wants them to wake up , not give in ) , but beyond that it ’s hard to say .
But if # 2 is ambiguous , # 3 is n’t : Stack does n’t really have a policy he wants changed .
He ’s mad at the government , he ’s mad at paying unfair taxes , and he ’s mad at the turns his life has taken .
But if , instead of killing people , suppose he had been holding them hostage .
What would his demands have been ?
Repeal of Section 1706 of the tax code ?
That ’s about the closest he comes to saying something specific .
“ Jews out of Palestine ” is a policy grievance .
Ditto for “ abortion is murder , ” “ freedom for Tamil , ” and “ Jim Crow forever . ”
But all Stack has is a vague and inchoate rage caused by his feeling that he ’s been screwed by the IRS and nobody is willing to help him .
Calling that a policy grievance is to strip the word of all meaning .
Not everybody who goes postal is a terrorist .
Stack did n’t have a political agenda in the usual sense of the word , he was just a guy who ’d reached the end of his rope and finally snapped .
That happens to thousands of people every year .
Stack may have chosen to end his life a little more spectacularly than most , but that does n’t raise him to the level of a terrorist .
POSTSCRIPT : Just for the record , I agree with all the commenters ( and others ) who say that if Stack had been a lone wolf Muslim who had some equally vague complaints about , say , being treated badly by U.S. customs officials , right - wingers would be quick to call it terrorism if the guy snapped and killed a few in revenge .
But they ’d be wrong , and the way to fight this attitude is not for lefties to insist that Stack is a terrorist too , it ’s to insist that we use the word properly for everyone .
You need to have some kind of at least semi-coherent political agenda to be a terrorist , and “ the IRS sucks ” is no more one than “ the INS sucks . ”
You can make a fantastic sandwich with just great bread , fresh butter , and your favorite cheese :
1. Butter bread slices on 1 side .
Turn them over .
Lay 2 cheese slices on 1 bread slice .
Top with the other bread slice , buttered side up .
2 . Heat a medium frying pan over medium heat .
Flick a drop of water into the pan ; if it sizzles and evaporates , the pan is hot enough .
3 . Put sandwich , buttered side down , in pan .
Let it cook 3 to 4 minutes , or until golden and crunchy underneath .
Turn and let cook another 3 to 4 minutes , or until golden and crunchy .
Choose a cheese that melts well , such as cheddar , jack , Colby , gruyère , Swiss , fontina , provolone , or brie .
But why stop there ?

No Place to Hide : Missing Primitive Stars Outside Milky Way Uncovered
After years of successful concealment , the most primitive stars outside our Milky Way galaxy have finally been unmasked .
New observations using ESO ’s Very Large Telescope have been used to solve an important astrophysical puzzle concerning the oldest stars in our galactic neighbourhood — which is crucial for our understanding of the earliest stars in the Universe .
“ We have , in effect , found a flaw in the forensic methods used until now , ” says Else Starkenburg , lead author of the paper reporting the study .
“ Our improved approach allows us to uncover the primitive stars hidden among all the other , more common stars . ”
Primitive stars are thought to have formed from material forged shortly after the Big Bang , 13.7 billion years ago .
They typically have less than one thousandth the amount of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium found in the Sun and are called “ extremely metal - poor stars ” [ 1 ] .
They belong to one of the first generations of stars in the nearby Universe .
Such stars are extremely rare and mainly observed in the Milky Way .
Cosmologists think that larger galaxies like the Milky Way formed from the merger of smaller galaxies .
Our Milky
Way ’s population of extremely metal - poor or “ primitive ” stars should already have been present in the dwarf galaxies from which it formed , and similar populations should be present in other dwarf galaxies .
“ So far , evidence for them has been scarce , ” says co-author Giuseppina Battaglia .
“ Large surveys conducted in the last few years kept showing that the most ancient populations of stars in the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies did not match , which was not at all expected from cosmological models . ”
Element abundances are measured from spectra , which provide the chemical fingerprints of stars [ 2 ] .
The Dwarf galaxies Abundances and Radial - velocities Team [ 3 ] used the FLAMES instrument on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope to measure the spectra of over 2000 individual giant stars in four of our galactic neighbours , the Fornax , Sculptor , Sextans and Carina dwarf galaxies .
Since the dwarf galaxies are typically 300 000 light years away — which is about three times the size of our Milky Way — only strong features in the spectrum could be measured , like a vague , smeared fingerprint .
The team found that none of their large collection of spectral fingerprints actually seemed to belong to the class of stars they were after , the rare , extremely metal - poor stars found in the Milky Way .
The team of astronomers around Starkenburg has now shed new light on the problem through careful comparison of spectra to computer - based models .
They found that only subtle differences distinguish the chemical fingerprint of a normal metal - poor star from that of an extremely metal - poor star , explaining why previous methods did not succeed in making the identification .
The astronomers also confirmed the almost pristine status of several extremely metal - poor stars thanks to much more detailed spectra obtained with the UVES instrument on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope .
“ Compared to the vague fingerprints we had before , this would be as if we looked at the fingerprint through a microscope , ” explains team member Vanessa Hill .
“ Unfortunately , just a small number of stars can be observed this way because it is very time consuming . ”
“ Among the new extremely metal - poor stars discovered in these dwarf galaxies , three have a relative amount of heavy chemical elements between only 1/3000 and 1/10 000 of what is observed in our Sun , including the current record holder of the most primitive star found outside the Milky Way , ” says team member Martin Tafelmeyer .
“ Not only has our work revealed some of the very interesting , first stars in these galaxies , but it also provides a new , powerful technique to uncover more such stars , ” concludes Starkenburg .
“ From now on there is no place left to hide ! ”
Notes
[ 1 ] According to the definition used in astronomy , “ metals ” are all the elements other than hydrogen and helium .
Such metals , except for a very few minor light chemical elements , have all been created by the various generations of stars .
[ 2 ]
As every rainbow demonstrates , white light can be split up into different colours .
Astronomers artificially split up the light they receive from distant objects into its different colours ( or wavelengths ) .
However , where we distinguish seven rainbow colours , astronomers map hundreds of finely nuanced colours , producing a spectrum — a record of the different amounts of light the object emits in each narrow colour band .
The details of the spectrum — more light emitted at some colours , less light at others — provide tell - tale signs about the chemical composition of the matter producing the light .
[ 3 ]
The Dwarf galaxies Abundances and Radial - velocities Team ( DART ) has members from institutes in nine different countries .

It is supported by 14 countries : Austria , Belgium , the Czech Republic , Denmark , France , Finland , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom .
ESO carries out an ambitious programme focused on the design , construction and operation of powerful ground - based observing facilities enabling astronomers to make important scientific discoveries .
ESO also plays a leading role in promoting and organising cooperation in astronomical research .
ESO operates three unique world - class observing sites in Chile : La Silla , Paranal and Chajnantor .
At Paranal , ESO operates the Very Large Telescope , the world ’s most advanced visible - light astronomical observatory and VISTA , the world ’s largest survey telescope .
ESO is the European partner of a revolutionary astronomical telescope ALMA , the largest astronomical project in existence .
ESO is currently planning a 42 - metre European Extremely Large optical / near - infrared Telescope , the E - ELT , which will become “ the world ’s biggest eye on the sky ” .

In order to implode and cost taxpayers $ 180 billion , AIG first had to make -- and lose -- positively massive market bets with other Wall Street firms .
It will come as a surprise to no one that the firm on the other side of many of those lost bets was Goldman Sachs .
In fact , as Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story reveal in the NYT , Goldman 's hardball tactics and smart bets bled AIG dry .
But do n't go blaming Goldman .
No one forced AIG to do these stupid deals .
All Goldman did was stick it to AIG at the negotiating table and then demand that AIG do what it said it was going to do .
The only entity responsible for the collapse of AIG was AIG .
One very interesting nugget in this article :
As AIG got more and more distressed , Goldman offered to cancel the insurance contracts AIG had written on Goldman 's behalf AND buy the contracts AIG held with other banks at deeply distressed prices .
This was presumably before Tim Geithner charged in and paid out those contracts at 100 cents on the dollar .
Although the details of what happened here will have to be fleshed out , it 's conceivable that Goldman 's offer could have significantly reduced the need for government involvement .
Louise Story and Gretchen Morgenson :
In just the year before the A.I.G. bailout , Goldman collected more than $ 7 billion from A.I.G .
And Goldman received billions more after the rescue .
Though other banks also benefited , Goldman received more taxpayer money , $ 12.9 billion , than any other firm .
In addition , according to two people with knowledge of the positions , a portion of the $ 11 billion in taxpayer money that went to Société Générale , a French bank that traded with A.I.G. , was subsequently transferred to Goldman under a deal the two banks had struck .
Goldman stood to gain from the housing market ’s implosion because in late 2006 , the firm had begun to make huge trades that would pay off if the mortgage market soured .
The further mortgage securities ’ prices fell , the greater were Goldman ’s profits .

A DEVOUT Christian lost her appeal yesterday after being banned from wearing a cross visibly at work .
Three judges cleared British Airways of discrimination by stopping Nadia Eweida , 58 , from wearing the crucifix .
The appeal court ruling backed an earlier employment appeal tribunal decision that she was not a victim of indirect religious discrimination .
The case came about after BA introduced a new uniform with an open neck in 2004 .
The airline banned the wearing of any visible item of adornment around the neck .
But check - in worker Nadia still wore her cross and was suspended in September 2006 .
After a public outctry BA decided to lift the ban .
Nadia , from Twickenham in London , took BA to a tribunal seeking £ 120,000 in damages and lost wages - but the tribunal ruled banning a crucifix was not discriminatory because Christians " generally " do not consider wearing a cross as a requirement of their religion .
Nadia , backed by civil rights group Liberty , now intends to appeal to the Supreme Court .
Corinna Ferguson , Liberty 's legal officer , said : " This is a disappointing judgment that will do little to build public confidence in equality laws . "
Googling for Sociopaths
One of the best things about capitalism is the way it handles sociopaths .
Major executives look up to Alexander the Great and apparently try to follow in his footsteps .
But instead of leading a murderous campaign across Asia , they decide to make something people want : newspapers and movies and television shows .
True , they ’re far from perfect , but you have to admit it ’s a lot better than mass slaughter .
Many books have been written about Google , even though we ’re all pretty familiar with the company to begin with , but what makes Ken Auletta ’s Googled interesting is that it ’s a history of the company as told by the incumbent sociopaths .
These are the people Auletta has spent his life covering : the media moguls who tried to acquire and conquer their own empires of content and delivery .
And to them what ’s most shocking and galling about Google ’s incredibly rapid rise is that instead of being engineered by a fellow sociopath , it was largely done by normal , decent people plainly applying the forces of new technology .
“ What has Google ever done for the world ? ” ask the sociopaths at various points throughout the book .
“ All they do is steal other people ’s content ! ”
To a normal human the question is ridiculous — it ’s almost impossible to imagine life without Googling for something , checking your Gmail , or watching videos on YouTube — but sociopaths are n’t used to doing things that create value for people .
They ’re just interested in conquering more and taking control .
When Disney bought ABC for $ 19 billion , it did n’t improve most people ’s lives in any real way , but it did let Michael Eisner regain control of the company he once ran .
So naturally the sociopaths are outraged that their control is being taken away .
Newspapers , book publishers , television companies , ad agencies — their businesses are all failing , while Google ’s is on the rise .
The sociopaths may be outraged , but this is exactly what ’s supposed to happen .
Most people do n’t have a vested interest in whether ABC does well or even continues to exist .
What they want are good television shows at a reasonable price , and if they can get those from Apple and Google instead of their local cable company , then bully for Apple and Google .
The thing that ’s hard for the sociopaths to get their head around is that this is n’t because one of their rivals has outsmarted them — it ’s just the march of technology .
When the only way to get most television shows to people ’s houses was over a wire or across airwaves that could only hold so many channels , their particular distribution model made sense .
But when the same connection — whether cable , DSL , satellite , or WiFi — can let people download whatever video program they choose , an entirely new model can take hold .
The shift is n’t Google ’s fault any more than America should be blamed for breaking off from Pangea .
As a result , the closest people to moguls behind the recent shifts in media distribution are two computer science grad students : Larry and Sergey .
These guys do n’t even have the decency to behave like real moguls — they wear t- shirts and sneakers , get bored during meetings , and like to travel around the world instead of around Manhattan .
What ’s worse , they ’re constantly talking about “ making the world a better place ” ( by , for example , donating 1 % of their profits to charity ) and “ empowering the user ” ( by cutting out middlemen and not forcing choices down people ’s throats ) .
Sociopaths do n’t talk like that !
Who do these people think they are ?
Google gets a lot of criticism ( often deserved ) , but it ’s worth taking a moment to think of all the things they have n’t done .
If Microsoft had Google ’s market share in search , is there any doubt that they ’d be systematically demoting or even banning their competitors in the search results ?
Demoting someone in Google is a virtual death sentence , and yet not only has Google never been accused of using this vast power , the idea itself is almost unimaginable .
Hearing things from the sociopaths ’ perspective , it ’s easy to get fooled .
“ Yeah ! ” you think .
“ Why should these Google guys get to control everything ? ”
But for average people , this shift has been great : much more stuff is available , faster and freer than ever before , and the people making all the money off of it are actually decent human beings who feel some responsibility for the planet they inhabit .
Sure , I do n’t agree with them on everything and there ’s a lot more they can do , but let ’s not lose sight of the basic point : at least they ’re not sociopaths .

I 'm not sure this story is true , but if it is , I 'm going to go buy a hat just so I can take it off in this guy 's honor .
Is there anything duct tape can't do ( besides repair ducts ) ?

So this pilot was flying out in the Alaskan backcountry ( is there a frontcountry in Alaska ? ) for a fishing trip and mistakenly left some fresh bait in his plane .
That was a big mistake , since there are probably more bears than people in those parts .
One of the local bears ravaged his plane while looking for the bait , leaving it in a condition unfit for flight .
That picture :

After the attack , our noble pilot called in a buddy to deliver some new tires , sheet plastic and a whopping three cases of duct tape .
After using those materials , his newly patched - up plane looked like this :

Apparently the repairs were sturdy enough that the pilot was able to fly his duct - taped plane home safely ( not sure how far — maybe he was from Dawson City or something ) .
There are definitely reasons to be skeptical of the story , but I 'm going to choose to ignore all of them , and instead salute both this man and duct tape .

The Daily Star is reporting that High School Musical star Zac Efron has signed on to play Spider - Man in the new movie by Martin Webb .
And that his HSM co-star Vanessa Hudgens will be joining him playing a love interest .
Now , this is The Daily Star , so it could well be a load of bollocks .
Hell , they even ran one of my stories last week .
But let 's go with it ,
New director Mark Webb favours Ultimate Spider - Man , by Brian Bendis and Mark Bagley , as source material for the Spider - Man 4 movie .
There has been online encouragement to involve Bendis in the movie .
Brian Michael Bendis has just announced a movie deal for his graphic novel Fire , starring and produced by Zac Efron .
Oh come on !
There are dots to join .
And if by doing so I end up with an internal diagram of the common whelk rather than the Taj Mahal , well that 's all just part of the game …
Brian Bendis tweets ;
i have been the subject of more inernet gossip over the last two weeks then the entire time i was dating kloe kardashian :)
In the United States , aquaponics is in its fingerling stage , yet it seems to be increasing in popularity .
Rebecca Nelson , 45 , half of the company Nelson & Pade , publishes the Aquaponics Journal and sells aquaponics systems in Montello , Wis .
While she refused to disclose exact sales figures , Ms. Nelson said that subscriptions have doubled every year for the last five years , and now number in the thousands .
Having worked in the industry since 1997 , leading workshops and consulting with academics , she estimates that there may be 800 to 1,200 aquaponics set-ups in American homes and yards and perhaps another 1,000 bubbling away in school science classrooms .

One of Ms. Nelson ’s industry colleagues , Sylvia Bernstein , who helped develop a mass - market hydroponic product called the AeroGarden , recently turned her attention to aquaponics .
She has started her own YouTube channel and a blog , and is teaching aquaponics at the Denver Botanic Gardens .
She said she has done market research that suggests the technology may appeal to a half - dozen consumer types , including those seeking fresh winter herbs ; gadget - happy gardeners ; and high - income parents and their science - fair kids .
But primarily , she envisions aquaponics as catnip for “ the LOHAS market , ” she said .
“ That means Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability — the green crowd . ”
It ’s worth mentioning that most of those categories would appear to describe the 47 - year - old Ms. Bernstein .
She built her first aquaponics system with her 15 - year - old son on a concrete pad outside her remodeled 1970s - era Boulder , Colo . , home .
And she has since set up quarters in a 240 - square - foot greenhouse .
While she boasted about picking fresh basil the other day for a risotto , she has lately been preoccupied with exotic fish .
Having tired of tilapia and trout , Ms. Bernstein is now introducing pacu , a thin , silvery import from South America that she called “ a vegetarian piranha . ”
Aquaponics is addictive , Ms. Bernstein believes , and it has a way of becoming a full - time pursuit .
“ If you spend some time on Backyard Aquaponics , ” she said , “ people start with this little 100 - gallon backyard system .
But it never stays that way .
Next thing , they ’ll say , the tilapia were really cool , but I want to grow trout . ”
Interested in aquaponics , but not ready to make it a life calling ?
No problem .
An Atlanta company called Earth Solutions now sells kits online , on Amazon.com and the Home Depot ’s Web site .
Called Farm in a Box , they range in price from $ 268 to $ 3,000 , and come with pipes , pumps , frames and fittings .
David Epstein , 50 , the osteopath and entrepreneur who invented Farm in a Box , reports that the company has sold several hundred units since the product went on sale last March .
Dr. Dave , as he likes to be called , created Farm in a Box after studying a do - it - yourself manual written by Travis W. Hughey — a creative debt that bothers Mr. Hughey not a bit .
Evidence of mass cannibalism in which even children and unborn babies were on the menu has been uncovered in Germany by archaeologists .
Analysis of 7,000 - year - old bones dug up at Herxheim in south - west Germany suggest the region was a centre for cannibalism at a time when the first European farming society may have been collapsing .
Marks on bones show that bodies were skinned and had their flesh removed using techniques almost identical to those for butchering animals and one researcher suggested that some of the victims could have been spit-roasted .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Many of the bones appear to have been deliberately smashed to allow the living to suck out the marrow of the dead .
Others bear the “ chew marks ” of teeth and while they are too indistinct to be certain scavenging animals were not to blame , the “ distinctive distribution speaks strongly in favour ” of having been made by hungry humans .
Cut marks on the bones are often so clear that archaeologists have been able to distinguish between which cuts were intended to skin and scalp the bodies and which were made to get at the meat .
Archaeologists concluded cannibalism was taking place after carrying out a detailed study of bones identified as coming from six adults , at least one of them a man , two children aged about 6 and 15 , and two unborn babies .
But with almost 500 other bodies already dug up at Herxheim and at least as many again still to be recovered the final number of people eaten by cannibals could be much higher .
Researchers suspect the remains belong either to people eaten in victory celebrations after being killed in wars , or to those slaughtered and consumed as part of ritual sacrifices .
They said the sheer number of victims made it unlikely that cannibalism was a last resort during famines .
The 10 people whose remains were analysed for the study are all thought to have died at the same time and the researchers said : “ The human bones show abundant and unequivocal evidence of human - indeced modifications .
Modifications induced by the cutting up of corpses are cut marks and scrape marks . ”
Once the ribs had been cut away from the spine the heads were broken open - “ perhaps to extract the brain ” - and the tongue cut out before the fleshy parts of the limbs were removed .
Bones could then be removed and smashed open for the marrow .

“ All these observations allow us to conclude that the individuals were cannibalised , ” the archaelogical team concluded in their report published in the journal Antiquity .
“ It is highly probable that a great number of the thousand or so individuals probably deposited in Herxheim were subjected to cannibalism . ”
Dr Bruno Boulestin , of Bordeaux University , accepted it was impossible to be certain if the flesh was eaten raw or was cooked but added : " We see patterns on the bones of animals indicating that they have been spit - roasted .
We have seen some of these same patterns on the human bones . ”
Herxheim ’s remains date from a period when Europe is thought to have been plunged into upheaval , violence and decline following 500 years in which Neolithic farmers first settled the region .
Professor Chris Scarre , a neolithic expert at the University of Durham , said after learning of the study that the Herxheim site could represent useful evidence of a society in turmoil but cautioned that cannibalism can be hard to prove because other factors , such as funerary rites , can leave similar marks on bones .
Schoolbags should be searched to try and cut the number of schoolchildren abusing alcohol , a teaching union said today .
A total of 360 pupils were suspended during a five - year period because of drink , an Assembly written answer said .
NASUWT union regional organiser Seamus Searson said there should be thorough checks where a problem is suspected .
" If a child gets expelled from school that is very serious and the onus is on parents to make sure children know what is right and wrong and drinking to excess is n't a right thing for any minor to be doing , " he said .
He said there needed to be more co-operation between parents and schools .
" What schools need to do is identify systems when there are concerns about a child and that they raise those concerns early , " he added .
" We have always agreed that some random checks have to be made on schoolbags , also for things like cigarettes , schools should have regular bag checks . "
Mr Searson claimed some young people were taking their behaviour at the weekends into the classroom .
" There 's a lot of peer pressure to do these things within school .
The children see this as an opportunity to take as much drink as they can stand . "
He said it could lead to boisterous behaviour or being sick in school .
" It is the same sort of things that appear once someone has had a few drinks on a Friday night , " he added .
A total of 360 secondary school pupils were suspended because of alcohol abuse during the last five years , figures released by Education Minister Caitriona Ruane to SDLP MLA Thomas Burns revealed .
The statistics cover the academic years from 2003 / 04 to 2007/08 but no details are available on whether the pupils involved were under the influence of alcohol on their school premises .
Mr Burns said he was shocked .
" If children are getting so drunk on a regular basis it is affecting their schooling then serious action needs to be taken by both head teachers and the parents .
Harsh discipline needs to be brought to bear both inside and outside the school , " he said .
Gary McMichael , director of Ascert , a drug and alcohol charity helping young people and families , said schools needed to support pupils .
" Suspension from school we hope would not be the first option ... what other kind of help can be provided , what support can be provided to the young person ?
" What we do n't want is to isolate them in the future by expelling them from school , which is a very important support environment . "

In 2007 Facebook rolled out Beacon , an ad system that took parts of user ’s Facebook data that they thought were private , and made them public .
Last week , Google ’s Buzz did something similar .
Beacon was killed by public revolt–and a class - action lawsuit .
Now for Buzz comes a potential FTC investigation .
Whether you like it or loathe it , Google ’s new Buzz social sharing system has hit the headlines in a particularly catastrophic way over and over in the week since its launch .
Though Google has moved to adjust some of the issues , some of the damage is already done .
Google ’s usual trick of data - mining and automating some of the process ( a trick it uses elsewhere in its other services ) directly exposes to public view some data that many Google users would prefer to remain private–thanks to the auto - populated friends list that Buzz used to deliver to you on login .
The issue is that Google ’s coders seem to have put zero thought into the secondary effects of this automated social grouping –the biggest concern of which is that your friends list was exposed for all to see , and that communications which you may have been having with some people in private suddenly became public .
There are other issues too , and most recently it ’s been revealed that there ’s an issue with phishing scams via the Buzz - Twitter link , and a big privacy / security loophole that exposes your geolocation if you Buzz , whether or not you want to reveal this info .
Google has , to its significant credit , patched and tweaked Buzz repeatedly as these issues have arisen , but it may be too late .
The office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada ( recently involved in forcing Facebook to improve its user privacy control ) is investigating , the FTC has received a formal complaint from the privacy watchdog Electronic Privacy Information Center and may also receive one from the EFF .
And all of this angry storm reminds us of the hugely controversial Facebook Beacon ad system , launched back in November 2007 .
It was ostensibly designed to allow tight integration between external services that Facebook users also utilized , as a way of enabling extremely precise targeted ad placements .
But it was forced on Facebook users , and it was flawed –it enabled private user data to pop up in extremely public view .
Its privacy - smashing behavior was so shocking and bold that it resulted in law suits , and so much media , advertiser and public outcry that Facebook had to issue a number of tweaks and fixes , before then making Beacon an opt - in system only just a few weeks later .
But Beacon was crippled , and limped on until September 2009 when it was finally axed .
Is it possible that Google ’s incredibly cavalier attitude toward user privacy could turn Buzz into the next Beacon ?
It ’s not beyond the pale .
Because Google has almost forced Buzz onto its users , since even if it ’s a half opt - in system it ’s permeated throughout many of the company ’s services–so desperate is Google to get into the social networking game .
In exposing private data to public view , Google ’s also risking its trustworthiness reputation , and that ’s extremely risky when people are beginning to feel a little uneasy at the amount of data Google retains about its users Net and lifestyle habits .
If Google user trust wanes , the efficacy of Google ’s targeted advertising ( its core revenue generator ) is at risk .
Mice were exposed to signals from a centrally - located antenna After all the concern over possible damage to health from using mobile phones , scientists have found a potential benefit from radiation .
Their work has been carried out on mice , but it suggests mobiles might protect against Alzheimer's .
Florida scientists found that phone radiation actually protected the memories of mice programmed to get Alzheimer 's disease .
They are now testing more frequencies to see if they can get better results .
The study by the Florida Alzheimer 's Disease Research Centre is published in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
Genetically altered mice
It involved 96 mice , most of which had been genetically altered to develop beta - amyloid plaques in their brains , which are a marker of Alzheimer 's disease , as they aged .
The rest of the mice were non-demented .
All the mice were exposed to the electro - magnetic field generated by a standard phone for two one - hour periods each day for seven to nine months .
Their cages were arranged at the same distance around a centrally located antenna generating the phone signal .

More from BBC World Service
The researchers , led by Professor Gary Arendash , said that if the phone exposure was started when the Alzheimer 's mice were young adults , before signs of memory impairment were apparent , their cognitive ability was protected .
In fact , the Alzheimer 's mice performed as well on tests measuring memory and thinking skills as aged mice without dementia .
If older Alzheimer 's mice already showing memory problems were exposed to the electro - magnetic waves , their memory impairment disappeared .
Professor Arendash was the author of a previous study that said coffee could protect against Alzheimer's .
He said : " It will take some time to determine the exact mechanisms involved in these beneficial memory effects .
" One thing is clear , however - the cognitive benefits of long - term electro - magnetic exposure are real , because we saw them in both protection and treatment - based experiments involving Alzheimer 's mice , as well as in normal mice . "
Memory benefits
The memory benefits of phone exposure took months to show up , suggesting that a similar effect in humans would take years .
The researchers conclude that electro - magnetic field exposure could be an effective , non-invasive and drug - free way to prevent and treat Alzheimer 's disease in humans .
We do n't recommend spending 24 hours a day on a mobile phone - we do n't know the long - term effects , and bills could go through the roof
Rebecca Wood
Alzheimer 's Research Trust
They are currently testing whether different sets of frequencies and strengths might produce a more rapid and greater cognitive benefit .
Chuanhai Cao , another author of the study , said : " Since production and aggregation of beta - amyloid occurs in traumatic brain injury , particularly in soldiers during war , the therapeutic impact of our findings may extend beyond Alzheimer 's disease . "
The authors say previous studies have linked a possible increased risk of Alzheimer 's with " low - frequency " electro - magnetic exposure like the energy waves generated by power and telephone lines .
They say mobile phones emit " high frequency " electro - magnetic waves that are very different because they can have beneficial effects on brain function , such as increasing brain cell activity .
Organs normal
They did carry out autopsies on the mice and found no evidence of abnormal growth in the brains of the Alzheimer 's mice following months of exposure to the electro - magnetic waves .
They also found all the major peripheral organs , such as the liver and lungs , were normal .
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " This research has been carried out in mice that mimic some of the symptoms of Alzheimer 's in people , so we do n't know if any similar effects will be seen in humans .
" Although the researchers hope their findings will translate to people , much more research is needed to find out if there could be any beneficial effects of long - term exposure to electro - magnetism , and to guarantee its safety .
" We do n't recommend spending 24 hours a day on a mobile phone - we do n't know the long - term effects , and bills could go through the roof . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said the results were " exciting and quite convincing " .
" However , this research in mice is at an early stage and a lot more work is needed before we can say anything about the possible preventative or treatment effects of this type of radiation on people with Alzheimer 's disease . "
A spokesman for Mast Sanity said other studies had shown adverse effects of mobile phone radiation on the brain .
And the Institute of Engineering Technology ( IET ) cautioned : " All isolated reports of health effects associated with low - level exposure to electromagnetic fields , regardless of whether they are beneficial or detrimental , should be treated with some caution . "

I thought you might be interested in this job advert from the Independent .
It ’s from the nice people at Maperton Trust .
You can go and see them for a diagnosis with their magical machines , although the best product is their Head Lice Repelling Unit or HELRU ( right ) which various people have emailed me about over the years , usually when they ’ve been used in their local schools .
It ’s a badge .
It ’s basically too silly to write about .
Here is a fun report of a trial , and here is the FAQ :
1 . How does it work ?
Without a comprehensive understanding of technology e.g. that used in space travel , it is not really possible to provide a very satisfactory answer .
We ’re too stupid to understand their science .
It costs £ 19 and they take all credit cards .
For free you can have an intense online treatment :
www.mapertontrust.com/htmlfiles/treatmentdetails.htm
And it looks like they maybe dip into treating seriously ill people too .
Generally I reckon the people who go for this kind of thing kind of know what they ’re getting into , but I suppose if people exert enough effort to make it look all sciencey then there might be the odd person who really does think they ’re getting space age medicine .

Economies across Europe reportedly have used complex financial transactions — sometimes in secret — to hide the true size of their debts and deficits .
European Union rules mandate that members cap debt levels at 60 percent of their gross domestic product and their annual budget deficits to no more than 3 percent , requirements intended to build trust in the euro .
However , some have sold state assets , bundled expected future payments into securities and used credit default swaps to mask their non-compliance , The Wall Street Journal reports .
" The problem for Eurostat is the flourishing of new financial instruments and techniques , says James D. Savage , a University of Virginia professor who is an authority on EU budgeting .
“ Member states are going to try to take advantage of them . "
Additional maneuvers : Greece insisted to the Eurostat statistics authority that large portions of its military spending were " confidential " and thus excluded from deficit calculations .
Portugal classified subsidies to the Lisbon subway and other state enterprises as equity purchases .
France agreed to assume pension liabilities for France Telecom workers in exchange for a lump sum of more than 5 billion euros , a move that helped bring France 's budget gap 3 percent of GDP in 1997 and helped it to join the euro .
Germany tried to reappraise gold reserves for a fast fix in 1997 .
Investors are left in the dark because Euro - zone governments are under no obligation to completely disclose details of the derivative agreements into which they enter , making it nearly impossible to determine how risky those investments really are .
Swaps are another tactic countries have used to meet the euro - zone requirements , often without publicly disclosing them , which made it difficult for investors to gauge a country 's finances .
It was n't until 2008 that Eurostat was able to revise its rules to push countries to include swaps in their debt and deficit calculations , but critics contend too little is known about countries ' continued exposure to swaps deals already made .
The European Union and Germany today denied a report of a 20 - 25 billion euro aid plan for debt - plagued Greece , whose credit swaps with Goldman Sachs have been the focus of an investigation , The New York Times reports .
" I have no comment on such a plan that does not exist and is denied even by the alleged source of it , " European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told a news briefing in Brussels .

After a serious collision involving a truck or commercial vehicle , it is important to preserve evidence and understand your legal rights .
If a truck driver ’s negligence caused the crash , the accident victim can bring a personal injury claim against the careless truck driver , most often under a negligence theory of law .
Negligence is a failure to act reasonably under the circumstances .
To prove negligence , the victim is legally obligated to show the defendant owed them a duty of care and breached this duty .
In truck accident cases , the duty of care is imposed by North Carolina traffic laws and also by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations .
Our legal team knows all of these laws , and we can help to collect and preserve evidence to prove fault .
The victim must also show that the breach of duty directly resulted in injuries and damages that are reasonably quantifiable .
We have extensive medical experience , and we can show how the accident affected your life and health , and translate your injury claim into the proper monetary claim .
North Carolina truck accident claims are vigorously defended !
For truck accident victims , North Carolina has the toughest negligence law in the country .
If the victim contributes just slightly , even if they are only 1 % at fault for causing the collision , they have no claims and no right to payment for vehicle damage , medical bills , lost wages , or pain and suffering .
Since truck accident cases involve large settlements , trucking insurance carriers always look for evidence to show that the victim contributed to causing their own accident .
Hiring a lawyer early costs nothing up front , and your legal team will confront the opposition by investigating the collision scene , inspecting the truck , taking truck driver statements , and nailing down evidence to prove your innocence .
Even in cases in which the truck driver was clearly at fault , insurance carriers for trucking companies always defend injury claims by seeking to minimize the injury or by asserting that the injury was not caused by the truck accident .
One example is the “ pre-existing condition ” defense .
Insurance adjusters in trucking cases insist on reviewing the victim ’s pre-accident medical records , and if symptoms existed before the collision , they often deny the injury claim by asserting that the medical condition was there before the accident .
We work with your doctors to show that the truck accident worsened your condition or caused new injuries .
This allows you to collect a fair settlement that compensates you for all the difficulties inflicted by your accident .
We also know how to secure medical opinions in all traumatic injury cases to show how the injury will affect you in the future .
This step enables us to collect maximum payment for future medical needs and for all past and future pain and suffering .
Consult a Knowledgeable Truck Accident Lawyer in North Carolina
At Nagle & Associates , North Carolina truck accident attorney Carl Nagle is ready to represent victims and their families after a devastating crash .
If you or a loved one seeks legal guidance and representation following a tractor - trailer or commercial vehicle accident , we can help you assert your right to compensation .
Since our firm focuses on catastrophic injury cases , we understand the importance of financial well - being and stability to a victim and their family .
As a result , we ask for a smaller share of legal fees than most firms charge : just 25 % rather than 33 % .
We represent people throughout North Carolina , including in Raleigh , Asheville , Winston - Salem , Wilmington , Greensboro , Hickory , and other communities throughout Forsyth , Wake , Mecklenburg , Guilford , Brunswick , Durham , New Hanover , Cumberland , and Catawba Counties .

Last Friday afternoon , President Barack Obama and House Republicans made history .
At the GOPers ’ issues retreat in Baltimore , the president fielded sharp questions from the Republican legislators on critical issues : health care reform , taxes , the budget , the stimulus , energy , government transparency , earmarks , and other matters .
The exchanges , broadcast live on the three cable news networks ( with Fox News cutting away in the middle ) , were substantive and civil .
The session — a far cry from the soundbite sallies of conventional political discourse — was gripping to watch .
( You can see the video here . )
This was indeed change .
On Twitter , journalists and citizens who were viewing the event immediately started sharing their amazement ( in 140 - character messages ) .
Inevitably , a hashtag was born : #questiontime .
This was a reference to the British practice under which the prime minister regularly appears before members of Parliament and answers their queries .
( For you non-Twitterers , a hashtag is essentially a subject heading used to group tweets related to a particular and often popular topic . )
Seeing that others on Twitter were jazzed by this American version of Question Time , I noted in repeated tweets that citizens and journalists should demand regular public and televised encounters between the president and the opposition party .
Less than a week later , on this morning , a bipartisan group of bloggers , commentators , politicos , and Internet advocates — with a combined readership in the millions — has launched an online campaign urging President Obama , GOP House leader John Boehner and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell to make Question Time — televised and webcasted — a regular feature of American democracy .
You can join this call at DemandQuestionTime.com .
Let me tell you how the campaign came together .
As I was tweeting during the Obama - GOP Q&A , Micah Sifry , a co-founder of TechPresident.com , a cross-partisan group blog covering the intersection of politics , governance , and technology , sent me a direct message on Twitter : “ you write the language for an online petition for institutionalizing # questiontime and we ’ll push it out . ”
I ’m a journalist , not an activist , but I thought starting a crusade for better political debate could be worthwhile .
The next day , I sent Sifry a draft .
By this point , Sifry had enlisted Ari Melber , a Nation magazine writer who covers the Netroots , and Michael Moffo , who was director of special projects for the Obama campaign and who now works for the SS&K communications firm .
All four of us realized at the start that this effort would not fly if it had only one wing .
The point was not to set up more sessions that Obama could exploit to his advantage .
The aim was to enhance political conversation .
Sifry immediately reached out to conservative bloggers and Republican techies , and he recruited Glenn Reynolds , Jon Henke , and Mindy Finn .
Our group quickly expanded to include others , including Internet consultant Clay Shirky , liberal writer Todd Gitlin , George W. Bush campaign consultant Mark McKinnon , Wonkette.com founder Ana Marie Cox , conservative strategist Grover Norquist , Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas , conservative blogger Ed Morrissey , Craigslist creator Craig Newmark , Internet guru Esther Dyson , former Obama economic adviser Susan Crawford , MoveOn ‘s Eli Pariser , former President George H.W. Bush aide James Pinkerton , GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez , Personal Democracy Forum founder Andrew Rasiej , Democratic consultant Joe Trippi , eBay founder Pierre Omidyar , Media Research Center founder L. Brent Bozell III , and others .
This was a rather diverse collection .
It ’s hard to imagine all of us agreeing on anything ( except perhaps John Edwards ’ future in politics ) .
But we had an idea that transcends ideology — and cable - talk squabbling and blogosphere bickering .
On Sunday evening , a group of endorsers worked on a Google document of a shortened version of my original draft .
Sharing ideas via email , we quickly resolved any disagreements .
( Should we demand that regular Question Time be a “ part ” or a “ feature ” of American democracy ?
What would William Strunk Jr. say ? )
It was encouraging to see people of different political bents collaborating so smoothly .
It was a sign this was indeed a compelling idea .
Moffo found a designer who cooked up a nifty logo : a campaign - style button declaring , “ Demand Question Time . ”
There was one glitch .
At first , the plan was to post the petition on a particular social change website .
But conservative members of our ad hoc group pointed out that this site tends to promote liberal causes and that could scare off potential conservative endorsers and signers .
They were right .
The libs agreed another option was needed .
And within a day , Sifry created a stand - alone page for the petition .
So check it out .
If you agree with this wide - ranging group of initial endorsers , please sign the petition , blog about it , talk about it , tweet about it , Facebook about it , Gchat about it , email about it , and send up smoke signals about it .
None of us are naive and believe that implementing Question Time will cure what ails our country and our political process .
We do realize that if QT does become a Washington routine , politicians and their aides will do what they can to game it to their advantage .
( On Monday , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that Obama has accepted an invitation to speak to the Senate Republicans — without saying whether the session would include questions and be televised .
And on Wednesday morning , Obama was scheduled to address Senate Democrats at their own issues conference and take questions , with the event open to the press . )
There may well be attempts to institutionalize Question Time in a fashion that renders it nothing more than a canned replay of pre-existing spin .
But even though there are problems with the presidential debates — which have been taken over by the political parties and a corporate - sponsored commission — those events still have value .
As we witnessed last week , there was something riveting and moving about political opponents squaring off for an unfettered and unmoderated discussion of the challenges that face the nation .
Though nothing was resolved in terms of policy and legislation , this was a moment of optimism .
Yes , we can …have a reasonable political debate , without extreme rhetoric or name - calling .
Lousy debate will never lead to good policy ; good debate might .
If you want more Question Time — even if only for its entertainment value — you can saddle up with dozens ( and maybe it will turn into hundreds , thousands , and millions ) of your fellow Americans in calling on our elected representatives to show us their best stuff on a regular basis .
Read — and sign — that petition here .
Update : I asked Bill Burton at Wednesday ’s White House press briefing whether Obama would commit to holding regular Q&As with the GOP .
He essentially said no , arguing that Friday ’s session worked because of its “ spontaneity . ”
Washington ( CNN ) --
Heated partisan exchanges and in - depth policy discussions at the bipartisan health care summit on Thursday are unlikely to sway both parties in finding common ground , analysts said as the summit was going on .
One said the summit makes an argument against televising hearings .
Another said it will reinforce doubts about whether Washington can resolve the health care impasse .
" I think it 's reasonable to expect that an exchange like this is not going to change the public 's skepticism about the way Washington works , " said Michael Murakami , a visiting professor of government at Georgetown University .
Murakami added that the summit is a " big PR stunt " where " nothing is going to be decided . "
" This is just the two sides putting their view in front of the media so they can try and rally their support as the legislative battle begins . "
Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said the summit " was n't much more than a TV spectacle . "
" Only the infirm or unemployed could have possibly sat home and watched it all , " said Brinkley , a professor of history at Rice University .
" Instead , what everybody will see tonight on news broadcasts are the sparks of tension between [ President ] Obama and [ Sen. John ] McCain .
It 's like the 2008 election never ended . "
At one point during the meeting at Blair House in Washington , McCain , R - Arizona , slammed special deals inserted in the Senate health care bill , saying those should be removed so the American people will know " that geography does not dictate what kind of health care they will receive . "
Obama shot back , " Let me just make this point , John , because we 're not campaigning anymore .
The election is over . "
McCain responded : " I 'm reminded of that every day . "
During another exchange , Obama called out House Minority Whip Eric Cantor for bringing " props " to the summit .
Cantor had a large stack of papers and legislation in front of him .
Murakami said he'd be very surprised if any real compromise on key sticking points came out of the summit .
" If President Obama or Republicans make some kind of concession as the result of this , I think observers would be surprised . "
Dan Friedman , who covers the Senate for National Journal 's CongressDaily , noted that if Democrats and Republicans could n't find compromise in months of debate , " they are n't going to find it in a few hours in front of cameras . "
Friedman said that while some minor compromises could come out of the summit , significant sticking points -- such as costs -- are unlikely to be fixed .
But he said it is too soon to tell what will come of the talks .
The talks , Friedman added , are mostly political theater , but " that itself is not a bad thing . "
" Senate floor action is political theater .
Political theater happens because it affects politics . "
Recent polls , meanwhile , suggest Americans are angry at the partisan fights in Congress and the lack of compromise .
Two - thirds of those polled think the Republicans in Congress are not doing enough to cooperate with Obama , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday .
The majority of those polled said the Democrats should take the first step toward bipartisan cooperation and they want the Democrats to give up more than the GOP to reach consensus .

The poll 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday , 86 percent felt that government is broken , with 14 percent saying it is n't .
Of that 86 percent , 81 percent say the government can be fixed , with 5 percent saying it 's beyond repair .
Sunday 's poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey .
In terms of changing the broken government perception through the summit ?
" People looking for ' business as usual ' will see it as that probably .
For those paying attention [ to the summit ] , it 's a great illustration about why closed door meetings are necessary , " Friedman said .
The General Accounting Office today released the most comprehensive Government study so far on the costs of the savings and loan bailout , placing a total price tag on the debacle of nearly half a trillion dollars , including more than $ 130 billion from taxpayers .
The figures were roughly in line with previous estimates , and included both direct and indirect costs as well as interest payments that will stretch out for decades .
The money went to clean up the financial mess from the failure of more than 700 savings institutions in the 1980's and early 1990's as a result of mismanagement , fraud and an economic downturn in states like Texas and California .
" The bad news in this report is that the cost of the failure of many thrift institutions , with interest , approaches half a trillion dollars and that taxpayer accountability due to bonds issued will continue through the year 2030 , " said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa , a Republican who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee .
MENDHAM BOROUGH -- A 19 - year - old tried but could n’t quite get rid of his entire stash when Mendham Borough police stopped his car , police said .
Ryan Kuppersmith , of Long Hill , was pulled over for an obstructed rear - view mirror as he turned from Cold Hill Road onto Route 24 at 10:58 a.m. on Thursday , according to Detective Christopher Gobbi .
Kuppersmith did not pull over immediately and was observed fidgeting in the vehicle , Gobbi said .
Patrolman Chris Hopf approached the vehicle and detected the odor of marijuana .
Hopf , while speaking with the driver , also noticed that Kuppersmith had marijuana stuck in his teeth and along his gums .
“ It was determined that he had eaten the marijuana , ” Gobbi said .
Kuppersmith was charged with being under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance , possession of marijuana under 50 grams , possession of drug paraphernalia , hindering prosecution , obstructing administration of law , possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle , obstructed view and failure to exhibit proper documents .
He was released pending a court hearing .
The Azzurri fought back from two goals down ...
Napoli scored twice in the last 15 minutes , including a last minute Marek Hamsik penalty , to hit Roma 's Scudetto hopes and end their nine match winning run .
Roma had led through Julio Baptista 's penalty and Mirko Vucinic 's strike , but a German Denis volley gave Napoli hope before Hamsik 's late spot - kick earned a share of the spoils .
Roma were on a fantastic run coming into this game , but had been knocked out of Europe on Thursday night .
The Giallorossi were still without the injured Francesco Totti , Luca Toni and David Pizarro .
Mirko Vucinic led the forward line in a new 3 - 5 - 2 system designed to counter the Partenopei's 3-4- 2- 1.
Napoli were chasing fourth place , but had to make do without the suspended Gianluca Grava and injured Fabiano Santacroce and Andrea Dossena .
Fabio Quagliarella and Ezequiel Lavezzi both started .
Cheered on by a vociferous home crowd , Napoli created the first big chance of the game as Marek Hamsik headed over from Christian Maggio 's cross .
Roma challenged themselves on 11 minutes as Vucinic unleashed a daisycutter from 25 yards that Morgan De Sanctis pushed away well .
It was an intriguing game , with both sides clearly going for the win .
A number of shots rained in from range , including those from Lavezzi and Julio Baptista .
Such a keenly contested match , it was a while before the next opportunities arrived five minutes before the half time interval as Hamsik curled just over from the edge of the box , and Lavezzi then sliced his volley wide .
Right on half time , Napoli should have been ahead as Maggio missed a sitter .
The ex-Sampdoria winger was all alone at the back post six yards out but somehow headed down into the ground and over as the teams went in goalless .
Napoli started the second half well , and Lavezzi fired a vicious ball across the six yard box that no one took advantage of .
But it was Roma who broke the deadlock just shy of the hour mark .
Baptista tricked Hugo Campagnaro on the left of the area , who clumsily upended him .
stepped up himself to bury the penalty past Morgan De Sanctis .
There was controversy seconds later as Napoli went straight down the other end , and Quagliarella went down in the box under Juan 's challenge .
The entire San Paolo cried for a penalty , but the referee booked Quagliarella for simulation .
Replays were not entirely conclusive over whether Juan fouled the forward , but a booking was extremely harsh .
On 65 minutes Roma doubled their advantage thanks to a brilliantgoal .
The Montenigrin hit an instant half volley from an acute angle into the corner that left De Sanctis with no chance .
German Denis came on for Napoli and was desperately close to getting Napoli back in the game as he headed centimetres wide of the far post .
With 15 minutes to go , Napoli did grab a lifeline through .
The Argentine smashed an unstoppable volley into the corner to make it 1 - 2.
Napoli pushed for an equaliser and they so nearly got one on 82 minutes as Denis again headed just wide .
In the last minute , Napoli were handed a golden chance to grab a point as Mexes was penalised for handball in the area . buried the penalty to earn Napoli a point and hit Roma 's Scudetto hopes .
Napoli fall seven points behind Serie A leaders Inter who won 3 - 2 at Udinese .

Les chiffres de ventes des notaires sont toujours passionnants à éplucher .
Ceux de 2009 ne dérogent pas à la règle et lorsque il s’agit de se pencher sur les chiffres records des ventes au m² , la surprise est au rendez - vous pour une année censée être celle de la… crise .
Petits portefeuilles s’abstenir .
( BFM Immo ) - Devinette : savez - vous où se situe le bien le plus cher de France au m² ?
Réponse , Quai Anatole France . « Long de 585 mètres , il commence après le quai Voltaire , au niveau de la rue du Bac , et se poursuit par le quai d'Orsay , au départ du boulevard Saint - Germain et au niveau du Palais - Bourbon » nous apprend Wikipédia .
Certes !
Mais ce que le dictionnaire en ligne ne nous dit pas , c’est qu’en 2009 , se sont vendus deux appartements pour la modique somme de 51 000 € le mètre carré pour le premier et 50.000 € pour le second .
Presque une bonne affaire !
9.330 euros de moyenne
Certes , le 7 arrondissement parisien avec le 6ème , sont en tête du hit parade chaque année pour le ratio euros par m² .
Ainsi , les alentours de l’Eglise Saint Thomas d’Aquin , situés à un jet de pierre du boulevard Saint Germain et de la rue du Bac , étaient affichées en 2009 à 9 330 €/ m².
Celui des Invalides à 11 270 € .
Mais de là à réussir à vendre un appartement plus de 4,5 fois ce prix !
Et pourtant , l’étude Cheuvreux a bel et bien fait signer dans ses bureaux du boulevard , un compromis à ce prix .
« C’est vrai , c’est notre record .
Et nous sommes assez fiers d’avoir conclu cette affaire » précise Bruno Cheuvreux , patron de la plus grosse étude de notaires Parisienne .
Cinq arrondissements stars !
Néanmoins , si ces chiffres donnent le tournis , si la capitale française à bel et bien comblé en partie son retard par rapport à Londres et New York , respectivement 20 et 15 % plus chers annonce l’agence haut de gamme Barnes , ( voir leur résultat par ailleurs ) les transactions de ce type ne sont pas non plus légion .
A plus de 18.000 € par m² , il n’y a eu à Paris que … trente - six transactions en 2009 .
( NDLR : Source base Bien de la chambre des Notaires ) .
Seuls cinq arrondissements se partagent ce privilège : 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 et 16 éme .
Après le 7ème , c’est le 6ème qui détient le record du bien vendu le plus cher avec un prix de 28.800 €/ m² .
Une misère !
Et la clientèle dans tout ça ?
Eh bien les Français ont du mal à suivre le mouvement .
Car lorsqu’il s’agit d’acquérir un bien à plus de cinq millions d’euros , seuls 30 % d’entre eux se retrouvent les heureux propriétaires de ces biens d’exception .
( Chiffre Barnes )
In the 1990 ’s a small company started by William Clark began marketing a series of videos , the flagship of which was one called Baby Einstein .
The title carries the promise that by watching the videos babies would gain a benefit to their intellectual development .
The videos mostly consist of puppets and toys with classical music in the background .
According to the company , they enjoyed 17 million dollars in sales , and then sold the company to Walt Disney .
Marketing hype rarely accords well with reality , and such is the case with Baby Einstein .
There is a distinct lack of credible scientific evidence for any benefit from watching such videos .
Further , two studies performed at the University of Washington appeared to show that , if anything , infants watching the videos had delayed language acquisition .
One study was a phone survey of 1008 parents – here are the results :
Among infants ( age 8 to 16 months ) , each hour per day of viewing baby DVDs / videos was associated with a 16.99 - point decrement in CDI score in a fully adjusted model ( 95 % confidence interval = - 26.20 to - 7.77 ) .
Among toddlers ( age 17 to 24 months ) , there were no significant associations between any type of media exposure and CDI scores .
Amount of parental viewing with the child was not significantly associated with CDI scores in either infants or toddlers .
So for young infants watching educational videos was associated with delayed language development , but by two years old the negative effects seem to disappear .
Now Clark is suing Washington University to obtain the raw data and methods of analysis used for these studies .
He argues :
“ Given that other research studies have not shown the same outcomes , we would like the raw data and analytical methods from the Washington studies so we can audit their methodology , and perhaps duplicate the studies , to see if the outcomes are the same . ”
But I do n’t agree with his premise .
For example , a similar
Thai study found no association with video watching and language by two years of age .
The study found no delay – but neither did the Washington study – at two years of age .
The Thai study did not look at younger infants .
This recent review ( by one of the co-authors on the Washington study ) concludes :
No studies to date have demonstrated benefits associated with early infant TV viewing .
The preponderance of existing evidence suggests the potential for harm .
Parents should exercise due caution in exposing infants to excessive media .
It would seem there is no benefit to these alleged educational videos , and there is a suggestion of harm – although I would conclude that there is no long - term harm .
It must also be pointed out that these studies are observational – not experimental .
There are therefore many possible confounding factors .
Perhaps parents who rely on these videos do so because they do n’t have enough time to give to their young children – which itself is the factor that delays language .
The results of these studies fit well with what is generally known about child development .
Children need some minimum of interaction and activity in order to have normal neurological development .
If they are deprived of language , they will suffer – even to the extreme of never developing language .
But with any language exposure they will develop , mostly according to their pre-determined genetic program .
The rate at which we develop may be influenced by environmental factors , but people tend to seek their genetic potential eventually .
( This refers to raw neurological function – not knowledge or skills ) .
Clark argues that he wants to protect his legacy and that of Baby Einstein .
But I think this legacy is not worth protecting .
I appears to be a failed idea , useful for making parents anxious that they need to be doing everything they can for their children , and generating a multi-million dollar industry – but not useful for actually contributing to childhood development or long - term educational goals .
In fact , I would argue that the Baby Einstein culture has been harmful , contributing to ( while feeding off of ) the over - parenting that has marked the most recent generation .
It can be argued that parents should worry less about trying to force the intellectual development of their very young children , and just relax and give them more quality time and attention .
Ironically the Clark suit may serve to refocus attention on this point , and the fact that the research does not support the marketing claims of the overall “ baby genius ” industry .
The CPAC bruiser who was invited to speak on the ACORN video stunt and suddenly swerved into a diatribe against including GOProud at CPAC and then left the stage , is a familiar type if you ever knew anything about college Republican politics .
These people engage in insanely vicious internal feuds and think Jonah Goldberg is a public intellectual .
Sorba also fits into a sub - sub - sub - category of those young men , always bristling with somewhat strained masculinity , who are obsessed with the subject of homosexuality and have obviously spent a huge amount of time finding sources and arguments that can back up their feelings on the subject .
Here is a Google video of a recent lecture of his at Cal State .

Libya 's leader Muammar al - Gaddafi ( R ) is greeted by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi upon his arrival for his first visit to Italy on June 10 , 2009 , at Ciampino Airport .

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , a legendary media baron in his own country , is sponsoring sweeping television reforms that would ban pay - per- view pornography and adult programming during daytime hours .
The reforms seem aimed at Rupert Murdoch 's Sky Italia SpA , which makes 45 million euros annually from adult programming .
While Berlusconi's Mediaset group airs some adult programming , the company 's offerings pale next to those of Sky .
Sky is owned by Murdoch 's News Corp. and is headed by son James Murdoch .
Berlusconi and Murdoch have sparred for years .
The pair had previously worked as business collaborators in the 1990s with an informal division between Berlusconi 's broadcast and Murdoch 's cable / satellite spheres .
However , Murdoch 's launch of Sky Italia in 2003 caused a falling out , with each side accusing its rival of undermining the other .
The proposed regulation would significantly alter the economics of Italian television broadcasting — and make more money stream into Berlusconi 's pockets .
Apart from the ban on daytime adult programming , the bill offers a slew of restrictions on television commercials .
Pay - television broadcasters , such as Murdoch 's Sky , would be forced to gradually restrict the maximum amount of advertising per hour from 18 percent to 12 percent , losing almost 90 minutes of commercial time daily .
However , terrestrial - television broadcasters — like Berlusconi's Mediaset — would see their advertising cap raised by a few minutes per hour .
In total , Mediaset would be able to broadcast more than 30 minutes of additional commercials daily .
The war between Berlusconi and Murdoch has been scrappy .
Murdoch has penned numerous editorials in The Times of London accusing Berlusconi of autocratic ambitions and having an active interest in young , nubile women ( which may well be true ) .
Berlusconi made sure that Mediaset and government broadcaster RAI disappeared from Sky 's roster .
Sky 's news broadcasts — not just in Italy — have made sure to constantly mention Berlusconi 's tumultuous divorce and the affair allegations .
But Murdoch 's most audacious shot at Berlusconi took place last July when the Australian media baron aired an ultraviolent 1981 war film , The Lion of the Desert , that had been banned by the Italian government for 17 years .
The film , with an all - star B - movie cast of Anthony Quinn , Oliver Reed , Rod Steiger and Irene Papas , depicted Libyan guerillas fighting the Italian Army during World War II — and was funded by Muammar al - Gaddafi , the de-facto leader of Libya .
Murdoch 's broadcast was timed to coincide with al - Gaddafi 's historic first visit to Italy and was promoted with an extensive publicity blitz .
The film , which had been distributed as a bootleg for years and served as a staple secret showing at art houses , aired on June 11 to high ratings .
Italian authorities did not interfere .
Meanwhile , al - Gaddafi made sure his Italian visit generated some waves of its own .
While meeting Berlusconi , he pinned to his chest a large black - and - white picture of Libyan Sufi guerilla leader — and protagonist of Lion — Omar Mukhtar dating from the day before he was hanged by the Italians in 1931 .
Gaddafi wore the picture , photocopied and awkwardly pinned to his colonel 's military adornment , to multiple public gatherings during his Italian trip .
The movie itself , which enthralled Italians with its broadcast , is an unlikely mélange of gratuitous violence , Hollywood historic epic tropes and post - Fanon third - worldism .
Benito Mussolini is portrayed in strutting comic - opera glory by Rod Steiger .
Reed depicts an Italian Fascist general .
Anthony Quinn plays the Libyan guerilla Mukhtar as a reprise of Viva Zapata ! , only with his character 's Sufi associations erased by personal order of al - Gaddafi .
Another notably non-Middle Eastern actor , John Gielgud , plays Mukhtar 's associate Sharif al - Gariani .
This biography of a Libyan rebel leader would play out as a war movie in the Lawrence of Arabia mode , only with enough blood and violence to remind one of the director Moustapha Akkad 's ( Halloween ) horror - movie background .
Al - Gaddafi essentially bankrolled the project .
Lion was released in 1981 , during a period when al - Gaddafi was reveling in openly antagonizing the West .
The year before , five Libyan dissidents were murdered in exile in Italy by hit squads sent by al - Gaddafi .
Al - Gaddafi 's funding of worldwide insurgent groups were well - known by that time ; relations with world powers were at an all - time low .
A few months after the film 's cinema release , American citizens were banned from traveling to Libya .
Reviews of the film , while noting that it was an admirably fast - paced action movie and performed up to the epic expectations of other war films , never failed to mention the al - Gaddafi association .
As a result , Lion bombed at American and European box offices and turned into a cult film instead .
Lion portrayed a local Sufi resistance campaign to Italian colonial rule in Libya in bloody , loving detail .
Following a variant practiced by the local Senussi order , the group attracted a mix of Arab and Berber adherents .
After the collapse of Ottoman rule and the institution of an Italian government in the early 20th century , the Senussis quickly reconfigured themselves into a resistance movement .
The elderly Mukhtar led tribal guerrillas into battle under the Senussi banner .
Armed groups consisting of 100-300 men would conduct hit - and - run attacks on the Italians .
There was widespread support for the rebels among the general population .
The Italians and the Senussi Order were popularly known as Libya 's " day " and " night " governments .
During the day , Italians would collect taxes ; at night , the Senussi would collect zakah .
Italian reaction was swift and brutal .
In an attempt to flush out civilian support for the Senussis , Graziani constructed a series of concentration camps based on those used by the British during the Boer War .
As a result of a lack of food and harsh discipline — again , including regular hangings — tens of thousands of Libyan prisoners died .
But one of the conditions of al - Gaddafi 's funding of the film was a complete omission of any mention of Sufis or the Senussis ' religious aspects .
Apart from a short scene at the beginning showing Anthony Quinn teaching the Quran , religion is almost entirely absent .
During the late 1970s and early 1980s , Gaddafi was engaged in a contentious debate with Libya 's ulama over the content of his Green Book .
The Green Book , a confusing mishmash of political theory , armchair theological exposition and rants on every conceivable project was the subject of critical sermons by the ulama .
Despite Gaddafi's power , the criticisms continued and culminated in a 1978 meeting between him and the most influential ulama .
For al - Gaddafi , giving credence to the self - proclaimed religious heirs of the Senussis was something he would not do .
The Libyan leader 's financing of the film ( and its sister movie , the Prophet Mohammad biopic The Messenger ) was not done out of a beneficent love of epic war movies and a hope for Hollywood profits .
Lion was released in 1981 , after the Egypt - Israel peace treaty and in a period when Gaddafi was actively positioning himself as a leader of resistance to the Western power axis .
One influential American critic , Vincent Canby of the New York Times , drew explicit comparisons in his review of the film 's Cyrenaican concentration camps to Lebanon 's Palestinian refugee camps .
More so , he believed Akkad and Gaddafi were using the film to portray Mukhtar as a predecessor of Yasser Arafat , who was then one of the Libyan leader 's primary clients .
The theme of Cyrenaicans - as - Palestinians appears to have frequently been on the mind of American viewers .
Hollywood industry bible Variety 's review , anonymous as per magazine regulations , noted , " While never explicit , the overtones of the Bedouins ' desire for international recognition , Mukhtar 's insistence that confiscated lands must be returned ( with new Italian settlements on them not to be tolerated ) and other militant dialog emphasize parallels with today 's Palestinians . "
The Italian reaction to Lion was understandably angry .
Prior to the film 's release , Italian parliamentarians denounced it , and protests spread among large sections of the Italian public .
These were accompanied by the inevitable jingoistic newspaper op - eds and angry television talk show hosts that such films and books often spur .
Akkad 's film was quickly banned in Italy on the grounds of " defamation of the armed forces . "
Ownership and screening of the movie was made into a criminal offense under Italian censorship law .
Lion was notably denounced before an attempted 1982 screening by then - Prime Minister Giulio Anderotti for " damaging the honor of the army . "
Another attempted screening in Trento in 1987 was stopped by threats of legal action ; the film 's only legal showing in Italy in the 20th century was as an " education " display at the 1988 Rimini film festival .
That was until Rupert Murdoch exhumed Lion from illicit DVD trading lists and the world of torrents .
It apparently fulfilled News Corp .'s ambitions — Berlusconi 's sensibilities were tweaked , Murdoch got inches upon inches of press in the Italian print media and Sky generated some of its highest ratings for 2009 .
Only Berlusconi's fears of being caught up in a censorship row allowed Lion of the Desert to be aired .
For Murdoch 's next retaliatory attack against Berlusconi in Italy , we will have to wait .

NASA 's emerging exploration plan will call for safely sending humans to Mars , possibly by the 2030s , and de-emphasize exploration of the moon , the agency 's leader said Tuesday .
“ That is my personal vision , ” NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said .
“ I am confident that , when I say humans on Mars is a goal for the nation , not just NASA , I 'm saying that because I believe the president will back me up . ”
Bolden cited appearances set before congressional committees on Feb. 24 and 25 as a deadline for creating the “ beginnings of a plan ” for human exploration .
At those hearings , Bolden said , he will be able only to give a range of dates for a Mars trip because scientific questions , such as mitigating radiation exposure and bone loss , remain unanswered .
But he confidently said the 2030s , even the early 2030s , were viable if given a reasonable and sustained budget .
Bolden was in Houston this week making his first visit to Johnson Space Center since the release of President Barack Obama 's budget on Feb .
1 . Obama has been on the defense as the budget , while adding $ 6 billion in new money over five years , calls for the cancellation of the Constellation program that the Houston space center manages .
Bolden 's expansiveness on the attractiveness of Mars as a clear goal for NASA may blunt some of the criticism Obama has received for not addressing space policy since taking office , nor clearly outlining what will replace Constellation .
Under Constellation , NASA was to build two new rockets to fly astronauts to the International Space Station and , by the early 2020s , back to the moon where a lunar base would be built .
Researching and living on the moon would be a steppingstone to exploring outward to destinations like Mars , perhaps by 2040 .
‘ Fight , fight , fight ' vowed
Congressional critics have said NASA should not be asked to change plans when $ 9 billion has already been spent on Constellation and that by canceling the space agency 's next - generation exploration program , Obama is turning his back on human spaceflight .
“ The president 's plan is not what our country needs at this time , ” said Rep. Pete Olson , R - Sugar Land .
“ We have been the world 's leader for 50 years , and I can't accept that we 're going to fall behind .
We are going to fight , fight , fight to ensure that the next person who steps on the moon is an American . ”
Olson said the right thing to do is add $ 3 billion to NASA 's budget annually for the next five years to ensure Constellation is fully funded .
But Bolden 's comments Tuesday , made at a Houston Chronicle editorial board meeting , indicate the president hopes to reach Mars before the timeline envisioned by the Constellation program .
Bolden said this could be accomplished by sending robotic or possibly human missions to the lunar surface , but to skip the costly and timely step of building a permanent lunar base .
“ I do n't see us colonizing the moon as some people do , ” he said .
“ That 's not NASA 's job .
Our job is to explore . ”
And if someone beats NASA back to the moon while it is conducting research on rockets that can blast humans to Mars ?
“ When the Chinese or the Japanese or the Russians , or anybody else that people are worried about , get back to the moon before we do , I 'm not worried about that , ” said Bolden , a former astronaut .
“ Because when they land they 're going to be walking in the footsteps of 12 Americans who have already been there . ”
Planetary Society likes it
Some pro-space exploration organizations have embraced Obama 's plan because it has the potential to get humans beyond the moon more quickly than Constellation .
“ The proof will be in what they do with this new plan , but I have great hopes for it , ” said Louis Friedman , executive director of The Planetary Society .
Friedman noted Constellation budget 's is largely focused at present on developing the Ares I rocket , to carry astronauts to Earth orbit , and the Orion crew capsule that would house them both in orbit and on longer journeys .
The president 's proposed budget spends more , about $ 3.1 billion over the next five years , on the design of a heavy - lift rocket that can carry the fuel and supplies needed to propel and sustain astronauts on long journeys , Friedman said .
Hard sell ahead ?
Bolden said he would like to use some of the money previously earmarked for Constellation 's
Ares I rocket to fund newer technologies that might get humans to Mars more quickly .
“ I think the path that ( Obama ) has asked us to go down now gives us a better chance of getting to some destinations , if not as fast , maybe even faster in some cases because there are technologies that we overlooked , or just pushed aside , because we could n't afford them for the last several years we 've been developing the Constellation program , ” Bolden said .
His task during the next two weeks will be to flesh out more details for the Mars vision , and then sell the plan to a skeptical Congress that ultimately will have to approve funding .

The bottom bracket area on Pantani 's bike highlights the technology of the day with a standard Italian - threaded shell surrounding a square - taper bottom bracket .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 3 of 27 Pantani 's bike is fitted with dual - pivot Campagnolo brakes both front and rear , in contrast to newer versions that use a lighter single - pivot rear caliper .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 4 of 27
The popularity of integrated brake / shift levers have made down tube stops like this mostly a thing of the past but back in the day , these Campagnolo bits were among the finest examples of the breed .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 5 of 27
The modestly shaped stays are joined with TIG - welded aluminum dropouts .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 6 of 27
These chain stays would look relatively small as compared to modern carbon bikes but that did n't stop Pantani from flying up the mountainsides .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 7 of 27
The cockpit consists of a non-oversized alloy bar and TIG - welded alloy stem - both by ITM .
( Image credit : Daniel Benson ) Image 8 of 27 Few bikes are more easily identified simply by their colors than Pantani's Mercatone Uno Bianchi .

Marco Pantani's Mercatone Uno Bianchi Mega Pro XL Reparto
Corse was tailor - made for the wispy climber 's attacking style and slight build and epitomizes the cycling technology of the day .
The custom - built bike was light , stiff enough , and crafted to perfection and ultimately carried ' Il Pirata ' to the top step of both the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia in 1998 , thus more than proving its worth and earning a firm place in cycling history .
Bianchi's Reparto Corse race shop built the custom frame to Pantani 's exact specifications , using a lightweight Dedacciai doubled - butted 7000 - series shaped alloy tubeset , a very slightly sloping geometry , and a relatively generous head tube to suit the Italian 's aggressive in - the - drops climbing style .
Convention was the rule back then , rather than the exception , with a standard threaded bottom bracket shell , non-integrated 1 " head tube , telescoping 27.2 mm seat tube , and well - proven tube shapes that ventured only slightly away from round in select areas .
Needless to say , aerodynamics was barely even a concern a decade ago outside of time trials .
Aluminum was the material of choice throughout for its predictable durability , from the beautifully polished Campagnolo Record drivetrain and dual - pivot brake calipers to the tubular ITM Big One stem and standard - diameter handlebar – and even the Campagnolo Electron tubular wheels .
Looking shockingly minimal in comparison to currently fashionable deep - section carbon , the Electron 's box -section rims were ideally suited to a rider of Pantani 's nature : they had low inertia for rapid accelerations , they were comfortable over the long haul for such a light rider , and they were easily serviceable with grease injection ports front and rear , readily replaceable components and a tubular tire bed that offered a more reliable bond than carbon .
More exotic materials can still be found , though in limited quantities .
Carbon fiber was used for the Time fork and 9 - speed Record Ergopower levers – though this may have been a post - season change as most race photos from the time show alloy ones – the Time Equipe Pro pedals sported magnesium bodies , and titanium was used in the seatpost mast and rear cogs .
Though not super - stiff as compared to today 's carbon fiber machines , Pantani 's bike was undeniably light , even by modern standards .
Total weight was just 6.96kg ( 15.34lb ) , including the bottle cage and pedals .
That light weight obviously helped Pantani up the mountain but somewhat surprising is the massive gearing he used to do so .
The cassette spread is a fairly standard 11 - 23T but the chainrings measure a comparatively enormous 54/ 44T – something more commonly found on a time trial bike but assuming they 're period - correct , perhaps still appropriate to Pantani 's out - of - the - saddle climbing style .
Aside from today 's crop of hyper - customized machines , personalized touches on Pantani 's bike were more subdued – and arguably in better taste .
There 's the usual name on the top tube but also the custom embroidered Flite saddle from then - sponsor Selle Italia – not to mention the trademark single bottle cage as opposed to the more common two .
Pantani's life outside of cycling sadly was dark enough that it ultimately consumed him in a lonely hotel room almost exactly six years ago .
Though his career was also clouded with controversy in its later years , legions of fans still prefer to remember him for his emphatic performances on the bike – this bike , which now resides in the Santini factory in Bergamo , Italy – and will continue to honor his memory as one of the greatest Italian cyclists of all time .

( CNN ) -- Last spring , U.S. doctors ' offices were barraged with phone calls and worried patients packed into hospitals .
Schools closed .
Face masks and Tamiflu were suddenly in short supply .
The country verged on an H1N1 panic .
The new flu virus , first widely reported in Mexico , was infecting the young and healthy , rather than those usually most at risk , the elderly and infirm .
Beginning in April 2009 , H1N1 flu fanned across the globe .
The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic in June .
Hand sanitizer was suddenly seen everywhere , and , heeding the often - repeated advice of top U.S. health officials , many people began coughing into their shoulders or elbows rather than covering their mouths with their hands .
" My patients were so anxious , " recalled Dr. Danielle Ofri , an internist at Bellevue Hospital in New York .
" They were so agitated .
They wanted to know about that swine flu vaccine and when they 're going to get it .
" It was another variation of the flu .
Yet for our patients , it seemed so different , so unusual , so scary -- that the emotions took off well out of proportion of the disease . "
The toll , while devastating to the families of those who died of H1N1 , has not matched early projections of as many as 90,000 flu- related fatalities in the U.S .
H1N1 may have killed as many as 17,000 Americans , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
In an average year , about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu- related causes , according to the CDC .
Today , the visible signs of fear have ebbed .
Many vaccination clinics report low turnout and have cut back their hours , according to local news reports .
A recent health poll by the Harvard School of Public Health reported that nearly half of those surveyed believed the outbreak was over .
On Tuesday , a committee of the World Health Organization is scheduled to convene to review the H1N1 situation and possibly begin the process of officially downgrading the pandemic .
However , Dr. Keiji Fukuda , the special adviser on pandemic influenza to the director - general of the WHO , warned the change does not mean H1N1 is no longer a concern .
" The ending of a pandemic is not an on - and - off phenomenon , " he said at a press briefing last week .
" We really expected it to be more of a tailing - off phenomenon . "
Although it seems that H1N1 has receded from the public consciousness , Fukuda said , " It is expected that it will continue to be a significant virus , circulating around the world as we head into the winter or the coming winter in 2010 and 2011 . "
Last week , the WHO recommended that the pandemic H1N1 influenza strain be included in the flu vaccine for the coming fall and winter .
A Food and Drug Administration committee took similar steps Monday , which means there will not be a separate H1N1 vaccine this fall .
Paging Dr. Gupta blog : 2009 H1N1 flu strain will be in next season flu vaccine
Although some people may think that including H1N1 in the regular seasonal vaccine is a sign that it's a reduced threat , Dr. Michael Osterholm , director of the University of Minnesota 's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy , said the risks should not be discounted .
" I do n't think there is any reason to minimize what 's yet ahead , just because it's in the seasonal flu vaccine .
" This virus does do damage differently than seasonal flu , " Osterholm said .
" We 're talking about a disease that causes severe disease and deaths in a much younger population where you do n't expect to see that . "
Public health agencies have been criticized for sounding alarmist about H1N1 .
But Ira Longini , a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine , said not much was known in the spring of 2009 when the virus began sickening and killing people .
" It is difficult when you 're dealing with a potentially extremely dangerous virus , " said Longini .
" You err on the side of caution .
It could 've been really bad -- it was n't .
It 's much better than not reacting and having a public health disaster . "
Initially , H1N1 elicited an extraordinary response , described as an emotional epidemiology by Bellevue 's Ofri , who is also an associate professor at the New York University School of Medicine and author of " Medicine in Translation . "
" The diseases themselves have their own epidemiology , related to biological environmental factors , " she said .
" Our perception of illness runs its own independent course from the actual epidemiology of an illness .
H1N1 is a perfect example . "
One reason that the pandemic struck a chord was that it fit an " outbreak narrative . "
These types of diseases often originate from developing countries and spread throughout the world .
" It feels like the world is being overtaken , " she said .
" Ebola , HIV , SARS were examples of how the pattern of disease development fit this narrative arc and struck our emotion . "
Nowadays , she said , her patients barely mention swine flu .
" Once this was out of headlines , once the drama of the narrative arc is gone , it 's no longer this unknown , evil , dark illness , " she said .
" Now it 's kind of mundane , prosaic and so it does n't make an interesting movie any longer .
So it does n't concern people anymore . "
That 's reflected in comments from Christopher Gower , an iReport contributor who lives in Henderson , Kentucky .
" I think it was overblown , " he said of H1N1 .
" They scared the public pretty bad . "
Gower did n't get the vaccine , because he distrusts drug companies and fears side effects .
He considered H1N1 just like a seasonal flu .
Watch Gower 's iReport submission .
But for Egberto Willies , H1N1 posed an imminent danger for his family .
His wife has lupus , an autoimmune disorder .
" It was extremely frightening , " said Willies , who lives in Kingwood , Texas .
" I usually do n't get scared but this hit home because you could see the reality of young people dying from getting something that looked like a cold .
When it came to my wife , it was affecting people who are immunosuppressed .
She was flying blind . "
Watch Willies ' iReport submission
His wife was able to get the vaccine early .
And advances in public health enabled fast , effective response , said Longini , the biostatistician .
" Through surveillance and modern microbiology and disease control methods , we 've learned , we 're able to react quite quickly , " he said .
" We know a lot , we 're able to deal with threats if we 're organized quite well . "
Using the information entered by visitors , the research team hopes to find out how reliable the test really is .
A test on browser fingerprinting by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has shown how uniquely identifiable a user 's browser is on the web .
What that test is unable to do is to identify individual users .
This , however , is the goal of an experiment by the International Secure Systems Lab ( Isec Lab ) .
Originally founded by the Vienna University of Technology ( TUV ) , Isec Lab is now a collaborative venture between TUV , Eurécom and the University of California in Santa Barbara .
The test makes use of Xing , a platform widely - used in Europe on which many millions of users have published profiles .
The test essentially exploits the fact that many Xing users are identifiable by their membership of various groups .
According to Thorsten Holz , one of the researchers who designed the experiment , there are very few people on any social network who belong to exactly the same groups .
A ' group fingerprint ' could thus allow websites to identify previously anonymous visitors .
However , a little spadework is required in order to access this information .
The researchers have crawled as many Xing groups and their associated forums as possible in order to obtain an overview of Xing users and to collect URLs for the test proper .
They have found roughly 1.8 million users organised into around 7,000 groups .
The second step is the actual test .
Using special calls by the website within the browser , a website can determine whether a specific site on another server has previously been viewed by a visitor ( this technique is known as history stealing ) .
This enables the test to determine which group pages a user has visited .
For each group found , the test now checks whether the current visitor is a particular member of the group ( on the forum ) by again checking through the previously collected URLs .
The fact that social networks contain unique URLs , such as personal profile pages , should also make it possible to more or less unambiguously identify someone .
According to the report , in order to determine a user 's ' group fingerprint ' , the test only needs to check around 92,000 URLs , which takes less than a minute .
By correlating the data , it is possible to further tighten the circle so that frequently only a single user remains .
Isec Labs states that initial practical tests have given good results , but notes that so far only 30 tests have been carried out .
A quick test by the The H's associates at heise Security found that in two cases the experiment failed to return any results – although the users were members of Xing groups , they were either not active in the forums or had recently cleared their browser history .
In one case , however , the test returned two names , one of which was the user's .
According to Holz , other large social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook could also be used for this type of test , although the shear size of these networks and the resulting data volumes would present a problem .
He adds that the team has , using two computers , already found more than 40 million profiles on Facebook and that , with better equipment , it would probably be possible to crawl all of Facebook .
Gilbert Wondracek , Thorsten Holz , Engin Kirda and Christopher Kruegel describe the principles of the test in full in " A Practical Attack to De- Anonymize Social Network Users " .
The paper also describes practical remedies for protecting against this kind of de-anonymisation attack , all of which are aimed at hampering history stealing .
On the server - side , operators could insert random tokens into URLs , making it much more difficult to probe URLs at a later date .
Client - side , users can block access to browser history by , for example , visiting certain sites in incognito mode , using protective plug-ins such as NoScript for Firefox or regularly clearing their history .
The authors have also made the test publicly available .
The test requires users to reveal some information on how much they use Xing and groups .
After completing the test , a second form asks users to reveal whether they have been ( uniquely ) identified .
Holz points out that none of the data collected is stored or used for other purposes , and that the group is merely interested in voluntary feedback from readers / testers .

TSA Logo Contest
Over at “ Ask the Pilot , ” Patrick Smith has a great idea :
Calling all artists :
One thing TSA needs , I think , is a better logo and a snappy motto .
Perhaps there ’s a graphic designer out there who can help with a new rendition of the agency ’s circular eagle - and - flag motif .
I ’m imagining a revised eagle , its talons clutching a box cutter and a toothpaste tube .
It says “ Transportation Security Administration ” around the top .
Below are the three simple words of the TSA mission statement : “ Tedium , Weakness , Farce . ”
Let ’s do it .
I ’m announcing the TSA Logo Contest .
Rules are simple : create a TSA logo .
People are welcome to give ideas in the comments , but only actual created logos are eligible to compete .
( When my website administrator wakes up , I ’ll ask him how we can post images in the comments . )
Contest ends on February 6 .
Winner receives copies of my books , copies of Patrick Smith ’s book , an empty 12 - ounce bottle labeled “ saline ” that you can refill and get through any TSA security checkpoint , and a fake boarding pass on any flight for any date .

Foreign Airline Safety versus U.S. Major Airlines by Philip Greenspun , ATP , CFI ; December 2009 , updated July 2011 Site Home : Flying : One Article
This article explores an alternative explanation : foreign airlines do comparatively poorly because their first officers have almost no pilot - in - command experience .
Pilot in Command
The holder of a " Private " pilot certificate is pilot in command when taking friends from San Jose 's Reed - Hillview Airport up to Jonesy 's Famous Steak House at the Napa Airport for lunch .
He or she checks the weather , checks the airplane , and decides whether the risks are a reasonable match for his or her skills and equipment .
A Certificated Flight Instructor ( CFI ) is almost always pilot in command whenever flying with a student .
The student is controlling the attitude of the aircraft , but the CFI is the one who decides when and where it is safe to fly .
The CFI is the person who decides when it is necessary to take the controls from the student .
The CFI is the person who decides that a thunderstorm is getting too close to the airport and it is time to cease practicing touch - and - goes .
Nearly all airliners require two pilots .
The aircraft is too fast and complex for one person to operate safely .
Both pilots are trained to be able to handle the airplane , run checklists , and communicate with Air Traffic Control ( ATC ) .
The pilots tend to switch flying / monitoring roles on every leg .
But one pilot is designated " Captain " and one " First Officer " .
The captain is the pilot in command and has the final say as to whether to launch , whether fuel and weather make it prudent to divert to an airport other than the planned destination , etc .
Importance of the CFI step
This is very valuable experience in all kinds of commercial flying .
A captain needs to judge whether a first officer 's landing is going to be good experience for him , despite using up some runway and jostling passengers , or whether the landing is going to result in bent metal or running off the end of the runway .
A first officer needs to recognize when the captain is burnt out from a 4 - day trip and beginning to make mistakes .
Foreign versus U.S. Major
A foreign major airline , by contrast , does not have a large pool of regional airline pilots , ex-military folks , and flight instructors from which to draw .
Most foreign countries do not have an infrastructure of airports , flight schools , and private pilots .
There would be no work for a flight instructor in such a country .
Unless the country is very large , there wo n't be any regional airlines .
Due to the shortage of qualified nationals , the foreign airline may screen young people and send the most promising to flight schools in the U.S. until they are trained to the minimum legal standards .
For example , Japan Airlines runs a training center in Napa , California .
Lufthansa trains its pilots in Arizona .
A 23 - year - old who can barely speak English and barely knows how to fly can go directly to the right seat of an Airbus .
How do those young Lufthansa pilots do ?
In March 2008 , the 24 - year - old pilot of a Lufthansa Airbus A320 attempted to land in Hamburg in a 50 - knot gusty crosswind .
The crew rejected a more favorably oriented runway at the same airport .
The left wing contacted the ground during the landing attempt , ripping off the winglet .
The 39 - year - old captain took the controls and , with 131 passengers in the back , became a test pilot , adding power while the plane was still on the runway and taking off again ( something easily done in a little Cessna , but not typically approved in a transport category airplane due to the fact that the engines take 7 - 9 seconds to " spool up " ) .
" 24 - year - old co-pilot made first landing attempt " ( Der Spiegel ) has a video of the operation .
Would a 24 - year - old American , equipped with a different ethnicity and culture , have done better handling the Airbus A320 ?
There is no way to know because no U.S. airline would ever allow a 24 - year - old to get near the controls of a full - size airliner .
The first officer ( copilot ) of a U.S. major airline would be a 39 - year - old with thousands of hours of experience as a captain of a 50 - seat regional airliner .
The captain of that airliner would be a 55 - year - old who had been flying for three decades .
Let 's look at typical foreign and domestic career paths side by side , with true pilot - in - command time highlighted in red :
Foreign Airline Pilot U.S. Major Airline Pilot Private Certificate Obtained at professional flight school , includes 10 hours of solo .
Obtained at flight school closest to house , including 10 hours of solo .
Poking around flying visually none 50 hours solo or with non-pilot passengers .
Instrument Rating 50 hours with an instructor .
35 hours with an instructor ; 15 hours as P.I.C. with a friend acting as safety pilot .
Commercial Certificate 50 hours with an instructor .
10 hours solo .
20 hours with an instructor ; 50 hours solo and building time taking friends and family for rides .
Multi-engine Rating 20 hours with an instructor .
20 hours with an instructor .
Flight Instructor Training ---- 20 hours with instructor ; 10 hours practice teaching of friends Flight Instructor ---- 1000 hours with students Airline Training ---- 50 hours in a simulator at a regional airline First Officer at Regional Airline N/ A after roughly 1250 hours of flying , including more than 1000 pilot - in - command hours Captain at Regional Airline N/ A after roughly 3000 hours and four years of flying as first officer ; an additional 2000 hours Major Airline Training 50 hours in a simulator .
after roughly 2000 hours as captain at regional airline , 50 hours in a simulator First Officer at Major Airline after 250 hours of flying and perhaps 20 hours of solo after more than 3000 hours of pilot - in - command time , an additional 1000 - 5000 hours Captain at Major Airline after about 20 hours of pilot - in - command time after more than 3000 hours of pilot - in - command time and perhaps 9000 hours total time
The table shows that the typical first officer at a major U.S. airline will start with more than 3000 hours of pilot - in - command time , i.e. , roughly 150 times the P.I.C. experience of the first officer at a foreign carrier .
The new foreign captain has essentially no experience as pilot in command .
His or her P.I.C. time consists of 20 solo hours in a little Cessna on sunny days in Arizona or California .
The new domestic major airline captain already has thousands of hours of experience as a captain ; he or she was captain at a regional airline , doing exactly the same job but with a jet holding fewer passengers .
[ A popular misconception is that most U.S. airline pilots are former military pilots .
This does n't make sense when you think about the tens of thousands of airliners that are up in the sky 12 + hours each day and compare to the comparative handful of military planes , each of which might fly only one hour per day .
The military does not train nearly enough pilots to supply the airlines and , in any case , a retired military officer may not want to take a low - paid job that requires being away from his or her family 15 - 20 nights per month .
That said , a retired military pilot can typically skip the regional airline step and go straight to the first officer job at a major airline , upgrading to captain when and if seniority allows . ]
U.S. Regional Airlines
Making all U.S. Airlines Safer
U.S. airlines are nearly all unionized .
Union contracts are negotiated by very senior employees .
It should come as no surprise therefore that a senior pilot might be able to arrange his schedule so that he need only work 8 or 10 days per month .
He will be able to choose his home base so that it is close to his actual house .
The senior pilot will have a short commute and up to three weeks per month of rest .
How can the airline staff its flights if senior pilots are working so few days ?
By working the junior pilots 22 days per month , 16 hours per day ( hotel room to hotel room ) .
Can a junior pilot legally fly for 16 hours in a row ?
No .
Nor does he or she get paid to work all 16 hours ; the airline only pays pilots from when an airplane leaves the gate until it arrives at the destination gate .
A typical 16 - hour day may include a 6 - hour stop at an airport where the airline does not have a base and therefore there will be nowhere for the pilot to rest .
He or she will be sitting near a gate , in uniform , reading a book , trying to shut out the noise of thousands of passengers walking by and hundreds of public address announcements .
This kind of schedule is endured both by pilots newly hired by the airline and by pilots who have recently upgraded to captain .
A passenger has no way to know if the crew is a well - rested senior crew with a " princess " schedule or an exhausted junior crew who are " on reserve " ( essentially working right up to the legal / human limits ) .
How does it work for pilots of private airplanes ?
Netjets is the leading business jet operator .
Their unionized pilot workforce shares the same schedule for everyone : 7 days on ; 7 days off .
When there is a 6 - hour stop between flights , even the smallest airport ( what most people would call an " airstrip " ) will have sofas , recliner chairs , and sometimes even small bedrooms for naps .
The pilot of a $ 30,000 four - seat single - engine prop - driven airplane has a better place to rest than the crew of a 300 - passenger jet .
To improve safety at U.S. airlines , the seniority - based scheduling system should be eliminated and commercial airports should be required to use the fees that they collect for each passenger to build a reasonably comfortable quiet lounge for crew rest .

[ Note that the work - the - junior - guys - to - death systems is not universal ; quite a few foreign airlines already schedule crews without regard to seniority . ]
Could the " Ethnic Theory " be Correct ?
Ethnic and cultural factors are difficult to measure .
Did the 24 - year - old Lufthansa pilot not speak up about the inadvisability of attempting a landing in a crosswind stronger than the airplane 's maximum demonstrated capability because she was a woman ?
Because she had been reared in Germany ?
Does a Korean first officer not speak up because he is Korean ?
How can we possibly know ?
In the areas that we can measure , such as years of flying experience and hours of pilot - in - command time , these pilots are not remotely comparable to the first officers of mainline United Airlines , Southwest , JetBlue , Fedex , UPS , etc .
So why are we comparing their performance ?
Conclusion
both pilots in a U.S. major airline crew have thousands of hours of pilot - in - command time and typically have 1000 hours of flight instructor experience
only one of the pilots in a foreign carrier 's crew is guaranteed to have significant pilot - in - command experience and very likely nobody in the foreign crew will have instructor experience
About the Author
About Little , Brown
Outliers
A Sri Lankan pilot is quoted as saying that New York air traffic controllers are " rude , aggressive , and bullying " and that this may have contributed to a Colombian Boeing 707 running out of fuel and crashing ( full story ) .
A Little , Brown intern could have listened to JFK Tower ( aircraft from the ground up to about 2,500 ' ) and New York Approach ( aircraft from 2,500 ' up to 10,000 ' ) on liveatc.net and checked for rudeness or " bullying " .
I have flown four - seat airplanes , four - seat helicopters , and 50 - seat airliners in and around New York City .
Typical for me was an instrument flight rules ( IFR ) trip from Boston to Washington in a Cirrus SR20 .
A 50 - knot headwind right on the nose was going to make me late for my arrival at the Gaithersburg , Maryland airport , where my parents had planned to meet me .
The routing was right over the top of JFK at 6,000 ' .
I broke into the busy New York Approach frequency to ask for a temporary radio change to Flight Service , the guys who handle flight plans , weather briefings , and other non-urgent matters .
After vectoring a few 747s heading out to Europe , the New York Approach controller asked me what I needed .
I explained that I was hoping to convince Flight Service to call my mother in D.C. and advise her of my new arrival time .
" We can do that for you , buddy , " said the controller .
He took down my phone number and had his assistant call my mom .
[ What if the controller wo n't call your mom and / or is otherwise unhelpful ?
One of the first things that you learn during flight training is that the pilot in command can declare an emergency and , after that , do whatever he or she deems necessary for safety , regardless of the regulations or ATC instructions .
The pilot can simply say to ATC " Avianca 52 .
Emergency .
Low fuel .
Starting the ILS 4R approach . "
It then becomes ATC 's job to clear other aircraft out of the way . ]
No " Malcolm Gladwell " is listed in the online FAA Airmen Certification registry , from which one can infer that he has no flight training or pilot experience .
His biography says that he majored in history , from which one can infer that he has no technical education .
Yet apparently his publisher , Little , Brown , decided to publish a chapter on how to fly airliners without asking a few pilots to review it .
Then they charged consumers $ 28 for the unchecked manuscript .
Can someone please remind me how traditionally published material is supposed to be more reliable than Wikipedia ?

Reader 's Comments
Malcolm Gladwell made the mistake of ascribing a very complex set of circumstances to a single cause .
You made the same mistake .
In reality , culture , experience , and a host of other factors all come together to determine mishap rates : maintenance quality , equipment age , safety equipment , company procedures , ATC quality , airfield quality , predominant weather conditions , terrain , migratory bird patterns , language barriers , etc .
Experience is almost certainly a bigger factor than culture , but culture is still a very big factor : why else would the majors spend millions of dollars every year on CRM training ?
To see just how much of a factor this is , look at how mishap rates plummeted after the introduction of CRM training at US carriers in the late 1970s / early 1980s .
Prior to widespread CRM training , the culture at major US carriers was largely as Gladwell describes current foreign carrier culture : the captain 's word was final , and co-pilots did n't speak up or contradict the captain .
Multiple studies found this to be a major source of mishaps , which is one of the major reasons for the introduction of CRM training .
You also have to consider how inexperience is exacerbated by this type of culture : consider two equally inexperienced co-pilots who each notice the same unsafe condition on two separate flights .
The co-pilot for the airline with bad culture will be afraid to point out the problem , thinking to himself , " My captain has thousands of hours more experience than I : he certainly must have noticed the problem , and would do something about it if it concerned him .
I do n't want to incur his wrath and / or ridicule by distracting him with such a minor problem . "
The co-pilot for the airline with good culture will be far more likely to speak up , possibly averting a mishap .
-- Lucas Jung , December 26 , 2009
Lucas : CRM is well - known and has been taught for decades at foreign carriers as well .
As far as the improving safety record of U.S. airlines goes , consider that the period you 're describing is also the period when terrain awareness systems were installed ( as far as I know , no airliner equipped with a moving - map GPS - based TAWS system has been crashed into a mountain ) , when engines became much more reliable , when systems in general became simpler and more reliable , and when ground - based systems were substantially enhanced ( weather radar feeds to ATC , more ILSes , etc. ) .
The handful of hours of CRM training delivered to airline pilots during those decades may have made a difference , but ( 1 ) the effect is hard to separate from safety improvements due to improved technology , and ( 2 ) CRM training was delivered more or less equally at foreign carriers .
-- Philip Greenspun , December 29 , 2009
As a 20 year airline pilot I do disagree with the US vs foreign pilot argument , but I will leave that alone as it will involve pages of refutory evidence .
There is some basis of fact in what you say , but it is simplistic and , well , thats enough on that ...
As for flying to JFK .
New York is to most airlines who fly heavy jets effectively a third world airport .
It is a nightmare to taxi around , as it is way way to small ( was designed for 707's max ) and aside from seemingly nothing working the way it should and being way way too overcrowded , the controllers make no allowance for non US - English speaking crews .
My airline flies around the world and the US is difficult full stop .
Unlike almost anywhere else it takes a LOT of practice and understanding of US culture to fully know what is really being said .
And our airline is also from an English speaking nation .
The problem is that US pilots and controllers _generally_ only operate in the USA and deal with people who have grown up in the same country .
For example , at LAX , a standard call on GRD frequency was to switch from Nth to Sth controllers ' at the 50 yard line ' .
What the HELL does that mean for anyone who did not happen to play US college football in the USA ??
Another example - even in China you might be cleared direct to a VOR .
They will NEVER make a comment ( in heavily accented and highly colloqial US English ) like ' JA you can head to Urumqi when you can ' .
They will speak in concise and aviation standard ' AJA when clear of weather direct URC ' .
And Americans make it way worse .
URC VOR can be reasonably deduced as being related to Urumqi .
What about something like the Wilkes Barre VOR 's ident of LVZ ??
Yet US controllers NEVER use the LVZ terminology , but always the full ( and often indecipherable ) ' JA you can head to Wilkes Barre when you can ' .
Totally foreign words to totally foreign ears about totally foreign places .
Do you turn left or right ?
How do you spell Wilkes Barre ?
Which Map is it on ?
Is it an FMC Ident or a place name ?
For those reading this who do n't know , aviation charts are not labelled clearly with place names , but three letter code Morse code identifier letters .
And at JFK in particular , the talent for running seemingly dozens of taxi instructions at you in one sentence of very heavy New York ' English ' is second to none .
Sure the controller may say the same thing 200 times a week for 3 years , but to a foreign crew ( who might only operate into JFK once a year ) and after being at work for sometimes up to 20 hours at a time , such gibberish is at best near indecipherable , at worst dangerous with just the aid of a dimly lit small chart on possibly slippery , icy and the certainly very narrow taxiway 's of JFK .
And in heavy snow , the taxiway lights at JFK are non existant .
I heard one Asian crew make a very understandable error ( so understandable we earlier had to stop and get abused by the controller to make sure we did n't make the same exact error ) .
The extremely irate controller said extremely quickly in a VERY thick NYC accent ' XYZ if ya cant follow simple instructions then we 'll sin bin ya on Zulu ( taxiway ) '
I sympathise with the workload at JFK , but it is absolutely NOT a favourable aviation environment for anyone without a VERY thorough understanding of how things ' really ' work there .
We once got stuck along with everyone else in a bizarre traffic jam in JFK .
In a beautiful crisp English accented voice the words came over the radio ' I am slowly losing the will to live ( at JFK ! ) '
Americans CAN do it very well .
It took a while for them to really standardise the operation to what the international rule book says and also for them to understand ' international ' English .
The internatinal aviation rule book which , it must be said , was worded primarily by the US so you would think it should be fairly easy to get it right ...
However , once they did master it , the controlling the USAF now provides over Afghanistan in particular ( which used to be horrendous with minimal equipment and multiple countries who all hate each other converging in one place etc etc ) is now exceptional .
I am sure I am not alone in the hope those controllers go home and mix with their US couterparts and explain that it is often very hard to operate over foreign countries with many different accents and backgrounds and work out what it is that people ( pilots ) are really trying to say to each other and to Air Traffic Control .
Familiarity is great ( and often very humorous ) but only if you are actually familiar !!!

The US is a little over 4 % of the world 's population .
Can you see how parochial it sounds to speak of the 96 % of the world as a single group , inferior in this case , and label them " foreigners " .
There is a huge range of safety performance of airlines across the globe , including in the USA .
I do n't feel as safe on an American airline as I do on some Asian , European and my own Australian Qantas .
The whole analysis comes across as being in a Xenophobic spirit .
The original author 's thesis would not have been out of place in the intellectual milieu of master race superiority that lead to Nazi Germany ,
-- Ashley Bear , June 9 , 2010
I think you have rather substantially misinterpreted the point of Gladwell 's chapter in Outliers .
It 's not at all about the relative safety of U.S. versus foreign pilots .
It simply picks up on the well known psychological literature looking at how cultural differences in " power distance " affect pilot performance .
He really only singles out Colombia and South Korea -- and in the case of South Korea points out how they overcame that cultural disadvantage .
It 's probably a good idea to read a book closely before being so scornful of its message .

ANAHEIM , Calif . --
The Detroit Red Wings displayed much energy Wednesday in their second game in as many nights .
They skated fast , fired a lot of shots and had ample scoring opportunities .
But they did n't bury enough of them , as Jonas Hiller made 46 saves to lead the Anaheim Ducks to a 3 - 1 victory at the Honda Center .
" We got to bury 'em .
That 's all there is to it , '' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" You get your chances , you got to bury 'em . ''
The Ducks appeared to be buried in the Western Conference playoff race a month ago .
But after an 11 - 4 run that began with a 4 - 1 win against the Red Wings on Jan.
5 , Anaheim is only three points behind Detroit .
Other than his club 's inability to finish , Babcock was pleased with its effort .
" I did n't mind the way we played .
I thought we could have been a little bit harder in our own zone in the first period , '' Babcock said .
" In saying that , on back - to - back nights , we battled hard , we gave ourselves every opportunity . ''
The Red Wings trailed 3 - 0 when Pavel Datsyuk provided a spark just before the second intermission , scoring a power - play goal with 9.9 seconds remaining in the period .
Datsyuk took a pass from Brian Rafalski and broke in alone to flip a shot over Hiller 's glove for his 15th goal .
It snapped Hiller 's shutout streak at 155 minutes , 3 seconds and tied Datsyuk for the team lead in goals with Tomas Holmstrom and Todd Bertuzzi .
The Red Wings , who outshot the Ducks 37 - 16 over the final 40 minutes , could not complete a second consecutive comeback on the road .
" Coming back from ( a deficit ) on the road in back - to - back games is n't the ideal spot you want to be in , '' Bertuzzi said .
" I do n't think we played horrible .
I thought there was a little bit running around there early in our zone , but then , I thought we settled down .
We had enough chances to score , but Hiller played pretty good . ''
The Red Wings dominated early in the second period , peppering Hiller with shots and getting several quality chances .
But then , Bobby Ryan converted on one of Anaheim 's few chances , scoring from the slot on a pass by Ryan Getzlaf at 8:55 to make it 3 - 0 .
" They got a couple of goals early on by just throwing the puck at the net and creating traffic and the puck finding its way in , '' Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" ( Hiller ) played real well for them .
He saw a lot of shots , too , but he made some big saves and he was there for the rebounds . ''
The Ducks capitalized on a pair of fortunate bounces to take a 2 - 0 lead in the first period .
Ryan
Whitney opened the scoring at 1:11 on a long - range wrist shot that was deflected in past Jimmy Howard .
The Ducks made it 2 - 0 at 16:13 on a goal by Kyle Chipchura .
Steve Eminger flung the puck at the net from the point .
It hit Chipchura 's glove and sailed past Howard .
The goal was allowed to stand after a video review determined that Chipchura did n't direct the puck into the net with his arm .
" I asked the ref why it was a goal , and he said because he did n't intentionally ( direct it in ) , '' Howard said .
" I figured when it went in off the glove , whether it was intended or not intended , it was no goal . ''
Said Babcock : " There was four ( officials ) on the ice , they all saw it the same way .
Even when we saw it on replay , it was hard to tell .
" They had some breaks that way , but we got to box them out better at the net and we got to cut off the top better . ''
It was Howard 's 19th start in the past 21 games .
" They were getting pucks back to the D and just firing it on net , '' Howard said .
" You get out of the net and try to cut it down the most you can , but when the deflections happen up around the hash marks , it 's really hard to react to them . ''
These teams have split their four - game season series , with each club winning twice at home .
" We did a great job , '' Howard said .
" We just did n't get the bounces like they got . ''
Latvia has been suffering in the global recession
An alleged hacker has been hailed as a latter - day Robin Hood for leaking data about the finances of banks and state - owned firms to Latvian TV .
Using the alias " Neo " - a reference to The Matrix films - the hacker claims he wants to expose those cashing in on the recession in Latvia .
He is slowly passing details of leading Latvian firms via Twitter to the TV station and has its audiences hooked .
The Latvian government and police are investigating the security breach .
Data leaked so far includes pay details of managers from a Latvian bank that received a bail - out .
It reveals that many did not take the salary cuts they promised .
Other data shows that state - owned companies secretly awarded bonuses while publicly asking the government for help .
' Cult status '
The anonymous hacker claims to be part of a group - called the Fourth Awakening People 's Army - that downloaded more than seven million confidential tax documents from the State Revenue Service .
He is thought to be based in Britain .
Over a three month period they downloaded the private data of up to 1,000 companies .
Ilze Nagla , a TV presenter on the state - owned Latvian TV , told the BBC the hacker has attained cult status for some .
" A lot of people perceive him as a modern , virtual Robin Hood , " she told the BBC .
" On the one hand of course he has stolen confidential data ... and he actually has committed a crime .
But at the same time there is value for the public in the sense that now a lot of information gets disclosed and the whole system maybe becomes a little more transparent , " she said .
Latvia is currently in the middle of its worst economic crisis since it broke free from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Unemployment , at 23 % , is the highest in the European Union and over the last two years economic output has dropped by almost a quarter .

A BILL
TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA , 1976 , BY ADDING ARTICLE 18 TO CHAPTER 1 , TITLE 1 SO AS TO PROVIDE THAT SILVER AND GOLD COIN SHALL BE LEGAL TENDER IN PAYMENT OF CERTAIN DEBTS .
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina :
SECTION 1 . Chapter 1 , Title 1 of the 1976 Code is amended by adding :
" Article 18
Gold and Silver Coin as Legal Tender
Section 1-1-1110 .
The South Carolina General Assembly finds and declares that the State is experiencing an economic crisis of severe magnitude caused in large part by the unconstitutional substitution of Federal Reserve Notes for silver and gold coin as legal tender in this State .
The General Assembly also finds and declares that immediate exercise of the power of the State of South Carolina reserved under Article I , Section 10 , Paragraph 1 of the United States Constitution and by the Tenth Amendment , is necessary to protect the safety , health and welfare of the people of this State , by guaranteeing to them a constitutional and economically sound monetary system .
Section 1-1-1120 .
For the purposes of this article :
( 1 ) the term ' State ' shall include the State of South Carolina and all executive and administrative departments and agencies , courts , instrumentalities , and political subdivisions of it , and all elected and appointed officials , employees , and agents of it acting in their official capacities ; and
( 2 ) the term ' silver and gold coin ' shall include the silver and gold coins of the United States coined or minted , or silver and gold coins of any foreign nation adopted as money of the United States , by authority of Congress pursuant to Article I , Section 8 , Paragraph 5 of the United States Constitution , and all new certificates of the United States issued by authority of Congress pursuant to Article I , Section 8 , Paragraph 5 of the United States Constitution which certificates are in law and in fact redeemable on demand in silver and gold coin at their face values .
The term silver and gold coin does not include any note , obligation security , bill of credit , or other form or species of paper currency or other instrument or document intended to circulate as money emitted or issued by the United States or any department , agency , or officer of it , or by the Federal Reserve System or any board , committee , member bank instrumentality , official , or agent of it .
Section 1-11-1130 .
On and after the effective date of this article , this State shall not recognize , employ , or compel any person or entity to recognize or employ anything other than silver and gold coin as a legal tender in payment of any debt arising out of :
( 1 ) taxation by the State , where the applicable authority for the tax shall mandate the calculation and payment of it in silver and gold coin ;
( 2 ) expropriation of private property pursuant to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by the State or by any entity privileged by the laws of it to exercise this power ; and
( 3 ) judgments , decrees , or orders of any court or administrative agency of this State in civil or criminal actions or proceedings , except where and only to the extent that the court or agency granting an award shall find , on the basis of clear and convincing evidence , that payment of silver and gold coin shall not constitute just compensation for the damages suffered by the prevailing party , and therefore shall mandate :
( a ) specific performance of a contract or agreement by other than the payment of money ;
( b ) specific restitution of identifiable property other than money , or
( c ) other like relief , and contracts or agreements for the payment of wages , salaries , fees , or other monetary compensation to any person , corporation or other entity who or which shall provide goods or services to the State in aid of performance of its governmental functions .
Section 1-1-1140 .
The unit and measure for determining what shall constitute legal tender in payment of any debt specified in Section 1 - 1- 1130 is the standard silver dollar , containing 371.25 grains ( troy ) fine silver , as coined or minted by authority of Congress from time to time pursuant to Article I , Section 8 , Paragraph 5 of the United States Constitution .
Section 1-1-1150 .
The value of any silver or gold coin as legal tender in payment of any debt specified in Section 1 - 1 - 1130 must be denominated in ' dollars ' calculated as follows :
(1 ) the value of any silver coin must be calculated by dividing the weight of fine silver in grains ( troy ) that the coin shall contain by 371.25 grains , and expressing the quotient in ' dollars ' ;
( 2 ) the value of any gold coin shall be calculated by multiplying the weight of fine gold in grains ( troy ) that the coin shall contain by the proportion by weight between silver and gold as determined by the Treasurer of the State of South Carolina by dividing the product of such multiplication by 371.25 grains , and expressing the quotient in ' dollars ' ; and
( 3 ) at the beginning of each business day , the State Treasurer shall determine the average proportion by weight by which gold exchanges against silver in the major precious metals market or markets in the State , and
( a ) shall immediately make available this determination to any person upon request without charge ; and
( b ) shall permanently certify and record this determination .
Section 1-1-1160 .
On and after the effective date of this article the State shall denominate all public accounts , and record the value of all public assets and liabilities , in standard silver dollars . "
SECTION 2 . If any section , subsection , paragraph , subparagraph , sentence , clause , phrase , or word of this act is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid , such holding shall not affect the constitutionality or validity of the remaining portions of this act , the General Assembly hereby declaring that it would have passed this Act , and each and every section , subsection , paragraph , subparagraph , sentence , clause , phrase , and word thereof , irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections , subsections , paragraphs , subparagraphs , sentences , clauses , phrases , or words hereof may be declared to be unconstitutional , invalid , or otherwise ineffective .
SECTION 3 . This act takes effect upon approval by the Governor .

OAKLAND , Calif . – Since the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) was formed following the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , Transportation Security Officers responsible for keeping the country ’s airways safe and secure have been fighting their own struggle for security through collective bargaining rights .
Some 100 area labor and community supporters and elected officials rallying at Oakland International Airport Feb. 12 demonstrated wholehearted support for their cause .
“ They give us the security and confidence to know that we can fly and keep our families safe , ” California Labor Federation head Art Pulaski told the rally .
“ But much as they do to protect us , there ’s nothing to protect them .
Long schedules , hard work , poor wages , and they do n’t even have the freedom to collectively bargain for a decent wage for themselves , ” Pulaski said , pledging the support of the whole California labor movement .
The AFL - CIO and the American Federation of Government Employees ( AFGE ) “ have been fighting for eight long years ” to win “ the same basic rights of every federal employee and every American – the right to collectively bargain , ” said AFGE national organizer Joe Diggs .
“ If I am on the front lines against terrorism , why cannot I have collective bargaining , why can’t I have someone who can officially represent me in any sort of dispute ? ” asked Oakland Airport Transportation Security Officer Steve Ayala .
He urged rally participants to show their support for the TSOs by wearing something that says , AFGE .
“ Say , ‘ Hi , how are you doing ? ’ instead of , ‘ why do I have to take off my shoes ? ' ”
AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka , who had planned to address the rally but was snowed in on the East Coast , sent the workers warm greetings .
City and county elected officials and state legislators also signaled their support .
Of some 34,000 TSOs around the country who could join the union , about 13,000 are already dues - paying members of AFGE , even though the union is now limited to helping TSOs without the ability to formally represent them .
AFGE currently represents some 600,000 federal government and District of Columbia workers .
The Bush administration fought any move to give TSOs collective bargaining rights .
Though candidate Obama promised to do so , his nominee to head the agency withdrew after Republican attacks , and legislation for bargaining rights remains in the House of Representatives .
Rally participants signed a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , urging immediate action to grant the TSOs collective bargaining rights .
In a conversation after the rally , Diggs said the fairly cooperative TSO - management relations at the Oakland airport are an exception .
“ The problem we ’re having at other airports is that management teams are very arbitrary , because there ’s no third party review of anything they do . ”
Diggs described a situation at another airport , where a supervisor was fired for an action which was not a violation at the time it was undertaken .
“ She was out of work for eight months because we had to go through the internal system , ” Diggs said .
“ If we had had collective bargaining , we could have filed a grievance and gone to arbitration , ” and the TSA would be less likely to take such actions .
Other airport unions , including flight attendants , pilots and baggage workers , are supporting TSOs at other airports , Diggs said , and AFGE is building such a coalition in Oakland .

The EU Presidency has announced a deal to save Greece , but there 's no deal yet -- just a statement .
This is following the TARP path still -- lots of talk , little action , and deep political opposition .
So , who are the parties that are just praying for a deal to come through ?
We 've gone through the research to figure out the banking systems , insurance companies , and countries that will get slammed if it all falls through .
Because it is Saturday I decided to do a list I have been wanting to do for a very long time .
This is a list of movie trailers that have been recut by amateurs to change their genre .
For example , a horror movie might be recut to make it a romantic comedy .
I can spend all day watching these so I hope that all the listverse readers will enjoy this list as much as I enjoyed the hours picking out the entries .
10 Terminator
This one has a slightly offputting voice - over , but I have included it because one slightly NSFW moment made me laugh out loud .
See if you can work out which scene it is .
9 Willy Wonka
Here we see Willy Wonka in quite a different light from the books and films .
Just when you thought Gene Wilder could n’t be more sinister in the role , you are proven wrong .
8 Office Space
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atHWASn_ygo
This is a film all geeks love .
Here we see the a comedy turned into a psychological thriller .
7 American Pie 2
This is actually the second recut by the same person – the first one is also excellent but it does n’t allow embedding .
If you want to view that too , you can find it here .
Both are recut to be horror movies .
6 Mrs Doubtfire – the Psycho
This brilliant recut shows how a skilled editor can totally transform a film with virtually no changes except the music .
5 The Ring
No need to close your eyes in terror during this one – this is a very well done recut of the Ring to make it appear to be a tearjerker .
4 Brokeback of the Ring
This is another straight movie turned gay .
It is hilarious and extremely well done .
If you like this one , you should also check out Brokeback to the Future , Meet Joe Brokeback , and The Empire Brokeback .
We could do nearly an entire list based on brokeback recuts .
3 Top Gun
Frankly , it does n’t take a lot of recutting to make Top Gun appear to be a gay movie , but here we have it anyway – from a military film to a gay romance .
2 The Shining
Here is our favorite horror movie recut as a romantic comedy .
It just goes to show how clever film editors can be and why we so often see a film trailer we love for a film we hate .
In this recut they even manage to include the bathroom scene with the dead lady !
1 Scary Mary Poppins
This is the recut that got the whole thing going .
It is quite well known ( for reasons that are obvious when you see how good it is ) .
Enjoy .
They wo n't be there for you any more Repeats of the hit US comedy Friends will no longer be shown on Channel 4 and sister station E4 from autumn 2011 .
The sitcom , which stars Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer , has been a regular fixture on the broadcaster 's schedules since 1994 .
Channel 4 said the move would free up funds for new shows and acquisitions .
" After 15 years , 10 hit series and 236 terrific episodes , it 's time to say goodbye to old Friends and welcome new ones , " said Channel 4 's Gill Hay .
She added : " We are incredibly proud to have been the home of Friends for so long , but at a point when the channel is undergoing a period of creative renewal it felt like the right time to part company . "
INSIDER'S VIEW Torin Douglas , Media correspondent Friends is one of those rare series , like The Simpsons , that has become " default " viewing for many viewers .
When it moves in 18 months ' time , it will leave a big hole in the schedules .
It 's on E4 every day , and on Channel 4's T4 slot on weekend mornings .
With the dropping of Big Brother as well , later this year , it means the channels will look very different in 2011 .
It 's also a boost for Comedy Central , which will add Friends to a schedule that includes South Park , Two and Half Men and the US version of The Office .
Commercial success
In a statement Channel 4 said it was hopeful the decision would " provide an opportunity to refresh the schedule " across both networks .
Last year it was announced that Big Brother - another long - serving Channel 4 programme - would come to an end in 2010 .
Channel 4's deal with Warner Bros International Television will end next autumn , after which Comedy Central will broadcast episodes from the series .
The agreement was made after Channel 4 lost out in a bidding war with the cable channel , which the network 's Jill Offman described as a " major coup " .
Friends has been a huge commercial success in both the US and the UK .
The series was based around six 20 - somethings living in New York and yet to figure out where their lives were leading .
A lot of time was spent in the show 's local cafe Central Perk
As the years went on , the show charted their tangled romantic liaisons and life experiences .
The characters - Ross , Monica , Phoebe , Rachel , Joey and Chandler - spawned catchphrases , calendars , notebooks , mugs , T - shirts , video and DVD box sets and even copycat haircuts .
The last ever episode , from series 10 , drew an audience of 8.6 million viewers to Channel 4 when it was screened in 2004 .
Since then , the show has been on constant rotation at Channel 4 and its sister station E4 , where it continues to attract an average audience of almost 400,000 .

A COMMERCIAL featuring Pamela Anderson in a gold bikini rubbing against another scantily clad woman while being sprayed with a white liquid has " crossed the line " in bad taste and been banned from Australian television .
But the company responsible for the ad , Crazy Domains , a business that registers internet domain names , is fighting the decision .
A spokesman for the Perth company said the ad was no worse than some music video clips .
Rubbed the wrong way ... the offending advertisement with Pamela Anderson .
The Advertising Standards Bureau upheld a complaint about the ad , after receiving more than 40 submissions , stating it went too far in objectifying women .
" It 's meant to be a cheeky , over - the - top depiction but in the bureau 's view it did cross the line , " bureau chief executive Fiona Jolly said .
The 30 - second ad , aired on free - to - air and pay television , prompted scathing remarks from viewers .
The High Court has delivered a stinging criticism of the WorkCover Authority over its prosecution of a New South Wales farm owner .
WorkCover took action against Picton farm owner Graeme Kirk after the death of his farm manager in 2001 .
The manager Graham Palmer drove an all terrain vehicle down the side of a hill on the property , it overturned and he was killed .
Mr Kirk was fined for breaching occupational health and safety laws but he appealed the matter all the way to the High Court .
Today the court has upheld Mr Kirk 's appeal , finding that it was absurd to have prosecuted him over the inexplicable recklessness of the manager , who had skill and experience much greater than his own .
In its judgement the court said it was time for WorkCover to " finish its sport with Mr Kirk . "
It ordered WorkCover to pay his costs .
Scott Roeder argued that he shot Dr Tiller in order to save unborn babies
A man who said he killed a US abortion doctor in Kansas to save the lives of unborn babies has been found guilty of first - degree murder .
Scott Roeder had pleaded not guilty to murder , arguing that he committed manslaughter to prevent a greater harm .
He shot George Tiller , one of few late - term abortion providers in Kansas , at his church in Wichita on 31 May , 2009 .
Roeder , 51 , faces life in jail with the possibility of parole after 25 years .
He is due to be sentenced on 9 March .
The jurors took only 37 minutes to find him guilty of first - degree murder .
He was also convicted of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at two church ushers after shooting Dr Tiller .
Clinic targeted
Roeder 's lawyers had hoped he would face a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter .
But Judge Warren Wilbert ruled that that charge could not be considered because abortion , including the late - term abortions conducted by Dr Tiller , 67 , was legal in Kansas .
George Tiller had been providing abortion services since the early 1970s
The judge also ruled out a second - degree murder conviction , which does not involve premeditation .
On Thursday , Roeder told the court in Wichita : " I did what I thought was needed to be done to protect the children .
I shot him . "
" If I did n't do that , the babies were going to die the next day . "
The BBC's Adam Brookes , in Washington , says that because Dr Tiller performed abortions , and late - term abortions in particular , he had been a target of anti-abortion activists for many years .
His clinic was one of only three in the US that offered what are known as late - term abortions , performed after 21 weeks .
It was heavily fortified after a bomb attack in 1986 .
Dr Tiller also survived an attempt on his life in 1993 .

In the dispute between the SCO Group and Novell about the copyright for Unix , the new jury trial scheduled to begin on the 8th of March is apparently set to go ahead : according to a statement by Chapter 11 trustee Edward Cahn , SCO 's majority owner Ralph Yarro wants to inject a loan of $ 2 million dollars into the financially stricken company .
Legal observers at Groklaw reported that Ralph Yarro intends to finance the loan via his investment company , Seung Ni Capital Partners .
The loan is termed to run for a year at an interest rate of 6.6 % .
SCO will have to repay the loan before settling its other open debts .
Among these is a court order to pay $ 2.5 million to Novell .
Earlier , trustee Cahn had told the bankruptcy court that SCO was in urgent need of further funding if it was to survive the new trial .
The trustee said that without further funding he would not be able to continue SCO 's business .
SCO had repeatedly tried to find investors for the pending trial .
For instance , there were talks with Middle Eastern company Gulf Capital Partners and with London - based investment firm Merchant Bridge .
The investors were to finance a company called UniXis , which is taking over SCO 's software business .
The court responsible for the SCO vs Novell lawsuit is currently investigating the question of which of the charges to try before the jury and which of them to drop .
This will be clarified in a last hearing scheduled for the 25th of February .
Both Novell and SCO have submitted numerous motions about what they think should be tried .
One important point has already been clarified , as the responsible judge has denied the motion by Novell to exclude the slander of title claim from the new trial .
The legal observers at Groklaw are currently having fun with an expert report .
In his report , Professor of Business Administration at Harvard University , Gary Pisano , examined the alleged financial damage SCO suffered after Novell , like Hewlett Packard before it , announced that it would protect its customers via a Linux Indemnification Program at the beginning of this never ending story .
Pisano said that after the announcement the sales of the license that SCO was trying to use to extract money from corporate Linux customers collapsed .
According to Pisano 's calculations , SCO is entitled to up to $ 25 million dollars in damages for the lost revenue .

Costa Rica is set to have its first female president , after election results gave governing party candidate Laura Chinchilla an unassailable lead .
With most votes counted from Sunday 's poll , Ms Chinchilla had 47 % of the vote , 22 points ahead of the main opposition contender , Otton Solis .
Ms Chinchilla , a former vice - president , has pledged to continue the free - market policies of outgoing head , Oscar Arias .
She has also promised to tackle violent crime , a growing issue in Costa Rica .
" The biggest challenge we face is criminality , violence and drug - trafficking , " Ms Chinchilla , 50 , told her supporters .
Costa Rica , along with other Central American nations , is increasingly being used as a transit route for drugs smuggled from South America to the US market .
She also responded to criticism that she is too close to Mr Arias , a Nobel Peace Prize winner , and that he will continue to control government policies .
" I have to justify the confidence placed in me by having an independent government focused on the wellbeing of my country , " Ms Chinchilla said .
Mr Solis , who was narrowly defeated by Mr Arias in Costa Rica 's previous presidential vote , was quick to declare Ms Chinchilla the winner .
Mr Solis won some 25 % of the vote , while the third - placed candidate , Otto Guevara , won 21 % .
Costa Rica is one of Latin America 's most stable countries .
The country abolished its army in 1949 and has become known in recent years for tourism and progressive environmental policies .
Barclays hands out £ 1.5 bn in cash bonuses as bank 's profits soar by 92 % to record £ 11.6 bn
Barclays hands out £ 2.7bn in bonuses after bumper profits
But bank 's chief executive and president turn down payout
Six out of ten firms still being turned down for bank loans
Credit card interest soars to 12 - year high
Inflation soars to 14 - month high of 3.5 %
Experts warn house prices facing second crash
Bankers at Barclays were handed a bumper payout of £ 1.5 billion in cash bonuses last year as the bonus pool doubled and the bank posted record annual profits , it was announced today .
The banking giant posted eye - watering profits of £ 11.6 billion for 2009 this morning - up a massive 92 per cent on last year .
These figures were buoyed by its investment banking arm , BarCap , where top investment bankers shared a bonus and pay pool of £ 4.5 bn , almost double the previous year .
Just 23,000 of the firm's top investment bankers shared a bumper payout of £ 2.1 billion in bonuses with the average BarCap employee receiving a £ 95,000 payout .

But while Barclays ' results were good news for its bankers , they come as a survey showed that fat cat bankers are still refusing to give small businesses the help they need .
Business bosses are so starved of cash that they have been forced to borrow on their credit cards because banks are still refusing to lend them money .
Six out of ten firms were still being turned down for bank loans last year , according to a survey by the Institute of Directors .
Meanwhile another survey found that credit card rates are at 12 - year high despite the interest rates being at a historic low .
The average interest charged on a credit card has soared to 18.8 per cent - the highest level since 1998 .
Some consumers now paying more than 40 per cent on the cash they have borrowed .
This morning official statistics showed that inflation rose to 3.5 per cent in January , well above the Bank 's 2 per cent target .
Across the group as a whole , Barclays paid out £ 2.7 billion in bonuses - £ 1.5 billion in cash bonuses and £ 1.2 billion in long - term awards vesting over three years .
Almost three - quarters of these payouts were made in shares .
But chief executive John Varley and president Bob Diamond have sacrificed payouts in the light of the ' intense public interest and concern ' over bankers ' pay , Barclays said .
Shares in Barclays jumped by 8 per cent as the markets reacted to the better - than - expected results .
Other banks are set to follow with results over the next fortnight , and it is predicted that 10,000 City workers will walk away with pay and bonuses topping £ 1 million each .
Barclays bosses Bob Diamond , left , and John Varley , right , have opted to forgo their bonuses despite record profits
But today 's Institute of Directors survey makes a mockery of boasts by Gordon Brown and Chancellor Alistair Darling that the Government ordered the banks to start lending again as payback for pumping £ 850 billion into the economy .
IoD director general Miles Templeman said : ' The fact that more than half of all businesses seeking finance last year were turned away by their banks is totally incompatible with the banking sector 's position on the state of lending in the UK .
' What is even more concerning is that having been rejected , 83 per cent of businesses are not receiving information about alternatives available to them , including the Government 's Enterprise Finance Guarantee .
' It seems that more businesses are turning to forms of unsecured finance , such as credit cards , to get them through their short - term spending needs . '
The IoD survey of 1,000 businesses is particularly significant because the Institute represents company directors who employ an average of 20 to 30 people - the very entrepreneurs whose desire to expand will be critical to creating jobs and dragging Britain out of recession .
The survey raised questions over the degree to which Labour has helped business get back on its feet .
Official figures show that just £ 2.4 billion of a budget of £ 18.7 billion earmarked for aiding cash - strapped firms has actually been spent .
There were 27,000 corporate insolvencies between the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009 , a record number in any British recession .
Economists and credit experts today warned that the UK housing market faces a second crash next year when banks are forced to start paying back the billions they borrowed from the Government at the height of the crisis .
Credit rating agency Moody 's echoed fears raised by the Council of Mortgage Lenders that a sudden choking - off of credit will see mortgage costs soar and house prices tumble .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Chancellor Alistair Darling had said the Government had ordered the banks to start lending again
Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Philip Hammond said : ' This research makes a mockery of Gordon Brown 's claim to be giving real help now to businesses and to have extracted legally binding guarantees from the banks to lend more in exchange for taxpayer support .
' Thanks to his incompetence , more businesses have gone to the wall in this recession than in any other , while many more are being deprived of the credit they need to invest and create the new jobs we need for a sustainable recovery . '
The IoD survey also contradicts claims by the Treasury that lower lending figures are due to businesses not wishing to borrow cash to expand or develop during the economic downturn .
Surveys by the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) have claimed that three out of four businesses got the money they wanted .
But the IoD survey indicates that these figures are wrong .
Last week the Public Accounts Committee criticised the nationalised banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group for failing to lend a total of £ 39 billion by the end of this month - supposedly a legally binding commitment .
An IoD spokesman said that the performance of the banks nationalised during the financial meltdown is no better than that of their high street rivals : ' A lot of the people affected will be customers of the state - owned banks .
Nothing I can see suggests they have done any better . '
Although Barclays , which doubled its profits in 2009 , has not taken taxpayers ' cash to rebuild its finances , it has indirectly benefited from taxpayer support to the struggling sector .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the big banks should concentrate on lending , not bonuses .
' There is a huge gap between what the banks tell us and the experience of companies on the ground , ' he said .
' Instead of paying themselves large bonuses , the money should be used to strengthen balance sheets and to provide lending to solvent British companies who have a vital role to play in our recovery . '
A Treasury spokesman said : ' Banks must do everything they can to lend to creditworthy businesses and support the recovery .
' The evidence shows that more lending is beginning to flow to businesses , but there is no room for complacency .
' As a result of the lending commitments , both Lloyds and RBS have made available more than £ 90 billion in new lending since February , of which £ 50 billion was loans to businesses . '

Utah inventor who created one of the best - known objects of modern times has died .
Walter Fredrick Morrison invented the Frisbee in the 1940s .
He sold the production and manufacturing rights to his " Pluto Platter " in 1957 to the Wham - O company .
The plastic flying disc was later renamed the " Frisbee , " with sales surpassing 200 million discs .
It is now a staple at beaches and college campuses across the country and spawned sports like Frisbee golf and the team sport Ultimate .
Morrison never had a patent and never got rich , but Wham - O voluntarily paid him a modest royalty .
Morrison lived most of his life in the Richfield area .
When KSL - TV reporter John Hollenhorst played Frisbee with Morrison for a report in 2007 , Morrison said the popularity of his simple invention always amazed him .
" The whole thing 's a wonderment ! " he said .
" I still shake my head .
What have I done to deserve all this ?
This was not Einstein at work .
I did n't add anything to aeronautical sciences by putting a curve on a cake pan . "
Morrison co-wrote a book with Frisbee enthusiast and historian Phil Kennedy in 2001 .
Kennedy released a brief biography about Morrison on Thursday , wishing his late friend " smoooooth flights . "

DARPA ’s F6 program not only may lead to networked constellations of spacecraft , but could also have implications for larger space systems and the overall industry .
( credit : DARPA )
Breaking up may be good to do
Throughout the Space Age spacecraft have become increasingly sophisticated .
At the same time , though , they have become larger and more expensive .
This makes them vulnerable to on - orbit failures — losing a billion - dollar spacecraft because of a single subsystem malfunction — and also obsolescence , as it can years to develop such large “ monolithic ” satellites .
One alternative to large satellites is the development of smallsats , which typically have much lower costs and development times than larger spacecraft , although lacking some of the capabilities because of their limitations of size , power , and other characteristics .
“ Half of you are probably thinking , ‘ this is the most brilliant thing I ’ve ever seen . ’
The other half are thinking , ‘ this is the dumbest thing I ’ve ever heard , ’ ” said DARPA ’s Owen Brown .
A different approach being studied the last couple of years by DARPA as part of its F6 program is to break up , or fractionate , spacecraft ( see “ From one , many ” , The Space Review , August 20 , 2007 ) .
Rather than a single monolithic spacecraft , several smaller spacecraft , each representing a key subsystem — power , communications , instruments , etc. — would fly together in formation , using wireless data and power links to act as a single spacecraft .
Components that malfunctioned or needed to be upgraded could be replaced individually .
“ Half of you are probably thinking , ‘ this is the most brilliant thing I ’ve ever seen . ’
The other half are thinking , ‘ this is the dumbest thing I ’ve ever heard , ’ ” quipped DARPA ’s Owen Brown , who chaired a plenary session about the concept at the AIAA Space 2009 conference in Pasadena in September .
“ I think that ’s very symptomatic of a disruptive technology . ”
Brown said that the main motivation for this concept is to “ answer the call of uncertainty ” and develop systems that are flexible and robust , and thus be better prepared to deal with unforeseen developments .
Flexibility , he said , gives the networked spacecraft the ability to change missions or respond to component failures , while robustness makes such systems less vulnerable to various threats .
That capability is what gives fractionated spacecraft the edge over existing monolithic ones .
“ When uncertainty is incorporated into the lifecycle analysis of these types of space systems , ” Brown said , “ what you will find — and we have found this — is that these systems provide more value at a lower cost than a comparable monolith . ”
The long - term vision of such fractionated spacecraft is still several years away from flight testing — an initial test flight is planned for around 2013 — but work is underway on the “ technology package ” , which F6 program manager Paul Eremenko described as “ a modular collection of enabling components ” that are at the core of the fractionation concept .
These systems range from wireless crosslinks to distributed computing to the algorithms needed for flying spacecraft in clusters .
The program will also create a “ developer ’s kit ” of open hardware and software specifications to make it easier for new components to integrate into such fractionated systems .
The same technologies can also be used on large spacecraft to create what Eremenko called a “ fractionatible monolith ” .
The technology package can be incorporated on large spacecraft as a hosted payload with a mass penalty of less than 15 kilograms .
The payload would remain inactive unless and until a major component on the spacecraft , such as a control processor , failed .
A small satellite providing the missing functionality could then be launched and fly in formation with the monolithic spacecraft , with the technology package on the monolith integrating the smallsat ’s capabilities into the larger spacecraft .
“ What this 20 - to - 30 pound technology package on the monolith enables us to do is buy architectural assurance , ” said Eremenko .
This capability is “ tremendously enabling , and we get essentially for free ” as part of the development of the overall fractionation concept .
The fractionation concept could have benefits well beyond the technology and its applications .
Pierre Chao , managing partner with Renaissance Strategic Advisors , said that it could help address issues with the space industry in general .
“ It is hard to hear , but accurate to say , that in many ways the space industry is a mature industry , ” he said .
With current systems , he said , we ’re hitting the “ asymptotic part of the curve ” where each incremental advancement is costing an increasing amount of money .
“ Usually when you reach this part of the technology curve or the industrial development curve , there is something that comes along that restarts the technology curve and refragments an industry , ” he said , suggesting that fractionation could be that technology .
“ The intriguing appeal of spacecraft fractionation , and the element that bears a considerable amount of attention to , is the intangibles , ” he said .
For example , with large , monolithic satellites , there are relatively few programs that engineers can work on , limiting their ability to gain experience .
Working on more , and smaller , programs that could be enabled by spacecraft fractionating makes it easier to develop a skilled , experience workforce .
He added that fractionation had other potential benefits .
For example , breaking up monolithic spacecraft into smaller components could provide business for developers of new , smaller launch vehicles that would otherwise not be available to them .
New companies developing such components would also have an easier time raising money from investors than those seeking to develop far larger and more expensive systems .
“ It is hard to hear , but accurate to say , that in many ways the space industry is a mature industry ” and thus ripe for disruptive innovation , Chao said .
Fractionation could also be essential to what Daniel Hastings , an MIT professor and former chief scientist of the Air Force , says needed for a new space paradigm .
Industry today , he said , “ has too slow a clock speed ” for responding to the needs of users and other changes .
“ Can you actually come up with space system architectures which are much more responsive and much more flexible ? ”
A new , more flexible architecture , he added , might help entice young engineers to stay in the industry , by giving them short - term projects that provide them a return without waiting for years .
“ Things like F6 , but also other ways of thinking — on - orbit servicing , operationally responsive space — offer a way to get at these kinds of issues , ” he said .
While F6 is a specific program , Brown sees spacecraft fractionating as something much bigger , with implications that go beyond specific technology development .
“ Fractionation is not a thing , ” Brown said .
“ It is a new paradigm in architecting and acquiring space systems .
It will fundamentally revolutionize , we believe , the entire way we buy , build , and operate spacecraft . ”

When we have braces on our teeth , sometimes it just disturbs our photo .
Do you have a problem with your look while using braces ?...
Sarah Palin has signed a multi - year broadcast deal to serve as a contributor to Fox News , a provocative venture that immediately shook the media landscape Monday , prompting heavy commentary from her fans and foes alike .
“ I am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at Fox News , ” the former governor of Alaska said .
“ It ’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news . ”
The network did not reveal the complete terms of the arrangement .
But it appears to be an happy match .
“ Governor Palin has captivated everyone on both sides of the political spectrum and we are expected to add her dynamic voice to the Fox News lineup , ” said Bill Shine , Fox News ’ executive vice president of programming .
Plans call for Mrs. Palin to offer network - wide political analysis , appear in “ special event ” coverage and host periodic episodes of “ Real American Stories , ” a new Fox series that showcases inspirational stories from across the nation .
“ The most important thing is for Fox News to let Sarah be Sarah .
She is a natural brand that people recognize and like instantly .
They should just let her be herself , ” said John Tantillo , a New York marketing expert who first coined the programming name “ The O’Reilly Factor ” for Fox News .
“ It would be very unwise if Sarah Palin went too New York or too Hollywood or too Washington in her new role .
She ’s got to avoid that .
The reason people like her is that they can relate to her .
She does n’t need a lot of flashy stuff , ” Mr. Tantillo continued .
“ The audience detects that she ’s getting too fancy and they ’re going to think she ’s become one of ‘ them . ’
You know .
The ‘ media . ’ ”
Fox News has a canny habit of hiring political heavyweights with immediate name recognition , plenty of on - camera prowess and the chutzpah to hold their own in the roughhouse press .
Karl Rove , Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee have all become part of the Fox stable in the past year , driving the political and cultural discourse with cachet , and a little brute force .
Mrs. Palin , who has been consistently vilified or mocked by the mainstream press , has also held her own in the media milieu since her meteoric debut almost 18 months ago as a running mate for Sen.
John McCain , Arizona Republican , in his quest for the White House .
She often has fended off critical press coverage through social media , posting clear policy statements on Facebook and the occasional heartfelt missive via Twitter .
Monday ’s announcement sparked a broad swath of reactions , pro and con .
“ Palin joins Fox : There is a God , ” said the Kansas City Star in the aftermath .
“ Sarah Palin to join Fox News , gains official wingnut status , ” noted the San Francisco Chronicle .
Fox News is not the only network to employ a politico , however .
“ It ’s odd that liberals would complain about the crossover out of politics , just as ABC named George Stephanopoulos to host its new morning show , ” observed Tim Graham of the Media Research Center , who pointed out that perennial presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan appeared on CNN in between his campaigns in 1992 and 1996 .
“ Stephanopoulos ’ new programming should be called ‘ Good Morning , Conflict of Interest , ’ ” he added .

Dick Cheney is not the most popular of politicians , but when he offered a harsh assessment of the Obama Administration 's approach to terrorism last May , his criticism stung — so much that the President gave a speech the same day that was widely seen as a direct response .

Any large city in the world would have suffered extensive damage from an earthquake on the scale of the one that ravaged Haiti 's capital city on Tuesday afternoon , but it 's no accident that so much of Port - au - Prince now looks like a war zone .
Much of the devastation wreaked by this latest and most calamitous disaster to befall Haiti is best understood as another thoroughly manmade outcome of a long and ugly historical sequence .
The country has faced more than its fair share of catastrophes .
Hundreds died in Port - au - Prince in an earthquake back in June 1770 , and the huge earthquake of 7 May 1842 may have killed 10,000 in the northern city of Cap ­Haitien alone .
Hurricanes batter the island on a regular basis , mostly recently in 2004 and again in 2008 ; the storms of September 2008 flooded the town of Gonaïves and swept away much of its flimsy infrastructure , killing more than a thousand people and destroying many thousands of homes .
The full scale of the destruction resulting from this earthquake may not become clear for several weeks .
Even minimal repairs will take years to complete , and the long - term impact is incalculable .
What is already all too clear , ­however , is the fact that this impact will be the result of an even longer - term history of deliberate impoverishment and disempowerment .
Haiti is routinely described as the " poorest country in the western hemisphere " .
This poverty is the direct legacy of perhaps the most brutal system of colonial exploitation in world history , compounded by decades of systematic postcolonial oppression .
The noble " international community " which is currently scrambling to send its " humanitarian aid " to Haiti is largely responsible for the extent of the suffering it now aims to reduce .
Ever since the US invaded and occupied the country in 1915 , every serious political attempt to allow Haiti 's people to move ( in former president Jean - Bertrand Aristide 's phrase ) " from absolute misery to a dignified poverty " has been violently and deliberately blocked by the US government and some of its allies .
Aristide 's own government ( elected by some 75 % of the electorate ) was the latest victim of such interference , when it was overthrown by an internationally sponsored coup in 2004 that killed several thousand people and left much of the population smouldering in resentment .
The UN has subsequently maintained a large and enormously expensive stabilisation and pacification force in the country .
Haiti is now a country where , according to the best available study , around 75 % of the population " lives on less than $ 2 per day , and 56 % – four and a half million people – live on less than $ 1 per day " .
Decades of neoliberal " adjustment " and neo-imperial intervention have robbed its government of any significant capacity to invest in its people or to regulate its economy .
Punitive international trade and financial arrangements ensure that such destitution and impotence will remain a structural fact of Haitian life for the foreseeable future .
It is this poverty and powerlessness that account for the full scale of the horror in Port - au - Prince today .
Since the late 1970s , relentless neoliberal assault on Haiti 's agrarian economy has forced tens of thousands of small farmers into overcrowded urban slums .
Although there are no reliable statistics , hundreds of thousands of Port - au - Prince residents now live in desperately sub - standard informal housing , often perched precariously on the side of deforested ravines .
The selection of the people living in such places and conditions is itself no more " natural " or accidental than the extent of the injuries they have suffered .
As Brian Concannon , the director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti , points out : " Those people got there because they or their parents were intentionally pushed out of the countryside by aid and trade policies specifically designed to create a large captive and therefore exploitable labour force in the cities ; by definition they are people who would not be able to afford to build earthquake resistant houses . "
Meanwhile the city 's basic infrastructure – running water , electricity , roads , etc – remains woefully inadequate , often non-existent .
The government 's ability to mobilise any sort of disaster relief is next to nil .
The international community has been effectively ruling Haiti since the 2004 coup .
The same countries scrambling to send emergency help to Haiti now , however , have during the last five years consistently voted against any extension of the UN mission 's mandate beyond its immediate military purpose .
Proposals to divert some of this " investment " towards poverty reduction or agrarian development have been blocked , in keeping with the long - term patterns that continue to shape the ­distribution of international " aid " .
The same storms that killed so many in 2008 hit Cuba just as hard but killed only four people .
Cuba has escaped the worst effects of neoliberal " reform " , and its government retains a capacity to defend its people from disaster .
If we are serious about helping Haiti through this latest crisis then we should take this comparative point on board .
Along with sending emergency relief , we should ask what we can do to facilitate the self - empowerment of Haiti 's people and public institutions .
If we are serious about helping we need to stop ­trying to control Haiti 's government , to pacify its citizens , and to exploit its economy .
And then we need to start paying for at least some of the damage we 've already done .
The molecules in a smectic C are tilted :
Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens almost always vote together on the Supreme Court , but they are polar opposites when it comes to the State of the Union address .
Breyer always attends , believing that the Court needs to show the country that the Justices are part of the government , if an independent and co-equal branch .
Stevens , on the other hand , never goes to the speech , on the theory that the independence of the judiciary requires a position of detachment for the Justices , physical and otherwise .
It ’s likely that Samuel Alito is spending some time today weighing these alternative views a little more carefully .
That ’s because the cameras caught Alito giving an unusually demonstrative response to President Obama ’s speech last night .
It came after Obama said this : “ Last week , the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections . ”
In the audience , Alito could be seen shaking his head in response and saying , it seemed , “ Not true , not true . ”
There ’s a big issue and a small issue here .
The first concerns the specific nature of the dispute , about the Court ’s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC ,
In that five - to - four decision , written by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Alito , the Court held that corporations , labor unions , and other organizations have the right under the First Amendment to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence the outcomes of elections .
Obama may have been overstating the point when he said foreign companies now had the same unlimited rights to participate in our elections .
The Court ’s opinion carefully said it was not deciding the issue with regard to foreign entities .
So the Court may give the green light to these foreign companies — but it has n’t done so yet .
In time , though , Congress will or will not pass a law to revive the limits on corporate spending , and the Court will or will not reject that effort as well .
The larger issue raised by Alito ’s pouty face goes to the place of the Court in American life .
In public , and especially in confirmation hearings , the Justices try to portray themselves as Olympian figures , removed from the hurly burly of politics .
In Chief Justice Roberts ’ famous ( now mostly infamous ) phrase at his confirmation hearing , the Justices are like baseball umpires , who do nothing more than call balls and strikes .
But that ’s not true — and it never has been true .
( I discussed this issue in my Profile of Roberts . )
The Justices have strong political views , which have powerful impacts on how they do their jobs .
Alito performed the public service of making this point clearer for a national audience .
What makes Alito ’s reaction even more delicious is that it ’s further evidence that the Justice just ca n’t stand Obama .
As a Senator , Obama voted against Alito ’s confirmation , which the Justice does not seem to have forgotten .
When the President - elect Obama made a courtesy call on the Justices shortly before his inauguration last year , Alito was the only member of the Court not to attend .
( Obama voted against Roberts , too , but the Chief Justice managed to spare the time to welcome Obama . )
The first law that Obama signed as President was the Lilly Ledbetter Act — which reversed a decision by the Supreme Court that had erected new barriers to plaintiffs filing employment discrimination cases .
The author of that now - overruled decision ?
Samuel Alito .
These two guys have a history .
And now everyone knows it .
And for that reason , then , I do n’t begrudge Alito his grimace .
He was just being honest .
Alito ’s role in that room — and his place at the Court — is no different from that of the Republican members of Congress ; both are dedicated political adversaries of the President .
The camera — and the Justice — did n’t lie .

Dec. 7 , 2009  -- Catholic sex- abuse victims ' groups are decrying a Vatican decision to clear a former high - ranking Long Island priest , and longtime friend of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , of sex - abuse allegations .
The Diocese of Rockville Centre announced on Friday that the Catholic Church had found Monsignor Alan Placa not guilty of molesting teenage boys , an allegation that first surfaced in a local grand jury investigation in 2002 .
The grand jury report concluded that Placa could not be prosecuted criminally because the statute of limitations had expired .
Victims ' rights groups harshly criticized the Catholic Church 's decision and the process of trying the accused priest .
" While not surprising , it 's still heart - breaking to see that a victim deemed credible by virtually everyone else -- prosecutors , grand jurors , journalists , survivors , relatives and lay Catholics -- is deemed not credible by a couple of Vatican bureaucrats thousands of miles away , " said David Clohessy , the national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
Anne Barrett Doyle of BishopAccountablity.org , a group that tracks sex abuse allegations against Catholic priests , called the decision a " slap in the face to survivors and all Catholics who want to believe the Church can change its ways . "
Placa was placed under investigation by the Church after he was identified as " Priest F " in a grand jury investigation in New York 's Suffolk County .
The grand jury heard testimony from three alleged victims , two students and an altar boy , who said that a " Priest F " had molested them in the 1970s .
Richard Tollner , the only accuser to come forward publicly , told ABC News in a 2007 interview that Placa was Priest F , and that Placa had repeatedly molested him in 1975 when he was a teenage student at an all - boys Catholic high school in Uniondale , N.Y .
Alan Placa 's Past Reveals Abuse Allegations
Placa later served as a lawyer for the diocese in dealing with allegations of abuse against other priests .
According to the grand jury report , Priest F became instrumental in a church policy that used " deception and intimidation " to keep the church scandal quiet .
Priest F claimed he had saved the church hundreds of thousands of dollars in his handling of possible litigation .
When the allegations first surfaced , Placa was serving as the Vice Chancellor of the diocese .
After Placa was placed under investigation , and told by the Church to stop performing his priestly duties , Giuliani hired him to work at his consulting firm , Giuliani Partners .
Placa accompanied Giuliani and his wife Judith on a trip to Rome in January of 2007 , around the time a canonical panel was trying him in Albany .
On Sunday , Tollner told ABC News.com that he stood by his testimony and was " astonished " by the Catholic Church 's decision to absolve Placa .
" What upsets me most is that it sends a message that it is okay to be a sex abuser , " said Tollner .
" The Church will just ignore it , sweep it under the rug , and nobody is going to care . "
Tollner says he was kept in the dark about the testimony presented at the proceedings and unsuccessfully sought information on its outcome for the past two and a half years .
He did not learn about the " not guilty " ruling until a reporter called him about it on Friday .
" We do not know what the basis is for this decision " said Doyle of the Church process .
" It 's very secretive , that 's why we can't put any stock in it . "
Tollner told Good Morning America in 2007 that the sexual abuse started when he and Placa were making posters for a Right to Life march .
" As he started to explain how these posters should be done , I realized that something was rubbing my body , " Tollner said .
" After a minute or two , I realized that he 's feeling me , feeling me in my genital area . "
The grand jury report concluded that Priest F abused the boys sexually " again and again and again . "
" Priest F was cautious , but relentless in his pursuit of victims .
He fondled boys over their clothes , usually in his office , " the report said .
Giuliani Defended , Employed Priest
Several former students from the same high school say they were asked by the " Giuliani organization " to contact ABC News and vouch for Placa .
" There was absolutely not a hint of rumor of a speculation or a whisper , in four years , or in decades after of any sexual predatoriness on the part of Rev. Placa , " wrote Matthew Hogan in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
Placa did not respond to a request for comment left at his office at Giuliani Partners , and a spokesperson for Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment .
A spokesperson for the Diocese of Rockville Centre did not respond to a request for comment by press time .
According to the Diocese 's official announcement of Placa 's not guilty ruling , " Msgr. Placa will not be given a diocesan assignment .
Msgr. Placa will reside at St. Aloysius parish , Great Neck .
Msgr. Placa 's status is that of a retired priest in good standing . "
In 2007 , Giuliani said during a Wisconsin campaign appearance that he stood by Placa despite the accusations .
" I know the man ; I know who he is , so I support him , " Giuliani said .
" We give some of the worst people in our society the presumption of innocence and benefit of the doubt , " said Giuliani .
" And , of course , I 'm going to give that to one of my closest friends . "
Placa has been friends with Giuliani since they both attended Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn .
They were in an opera club together and would sometimes double date .
Giuliani and Placa later attended Manhattan College together , where they were also fraternity brothers .
Placa was ordained as a Catholic priest in May 1970 .
He was the best man at Giuliani 's first marriage in 1968 , then helped Giuliani get an annulment in 1982 so he could marry second wife Donna Hanover .
Placa officiated at Hanover and Giuliani's 1984 wedding .
He officiated at the funerals of Giuliani 's father and mother and baptized both of Giuliani 's children .

TAIPEI , Taiwan —
While China ramps up its missile threat , Taiwan 's air defenses are getting shabbier by the day .
So says an unclassified report from the Defense Intelligence Agency , prepared for and sent to the U.S. Congress last month .
Taiwan has some 400 fighter jets , but " far fewer " than that number would actually be good in a fight , the DIA says .
( China has 330 fighters within range of Taiwan , and 1,655 fighters total , according to the most recent Pentagon report on China 's military power ) .
Some of Taiwan 's planes are too old , others have outdated gear .
And for Taiwan 's 56 French - made Mirage fighter jets , spare parts are in short supply .
Afraid of China 's wrath , France has n't sold any major weapons to Taiwan recently , leaving the U.S. as Taiwan 's only supplier of big - ticket arms systems .
The report also highlighted the growing missile gap between Taiwan and China .
Despite warming cross -strait relations , China continues to build up its arsenal of short - range ballistic missiles ( at least 1,300 and counting ) and cruise missiles ( several score ) .
To shoot those down , Taiwan has 200 Patriot missiles and 500 homegrown " Skybow " missiles , the DIA says .
But Wendell Minnick , Asia bureau chief for Defense News , said in an email that only about half the Skybows can hit incoming SRBMs ( the others can only be used against
aircraft ) , and " normally you dedicate 2 missiles per incoming target . "
That means Taiwan can only blunt some 15 percent or less of China 's deployed missile force .
Three hundred and thirty more Patriot missiles , and missile fire units , were approved by
Washington in 2008 but wo n't be delivered until August 2014 , says the DIA .
And the weapons package released for sale by the White House last month — the one China got so angry about — will add another 114 Patriots after that .
Even then , it 's a lopsided game , and the Patriots and Skybows would be used to protect only the most valuable military and political targets .
China , for its part , has insisted its missile arsenal is there only to deter Taiwan 's pro-independence forces from seeking a formal , legal break .
The DIA report comes as Taiwan and its allies in Washington push hard for President Obama to approve the island 's request for 66 advanced F - 16s to replace its over - the - hill fighters .
Taiwan has been asking for the planes since 2006 .
The DIA did n't openly push for the sale , but the implications of its report are clear .
Says the report dryly , " Taiwan recognizes that it needs a sustainable replacement for obsolete and problematic aircraft platforms . "
One interesting side - note of the DIA report was its inventory of Taiwan 's tactical or short - range surface - to - air missile arsenal .
It includes some 2,000 Stinger missiles , including 728 shoulder - fired units , and more than 700 other missiles .
Those would n't be any help against ballistic or cruise missiles .
But if China 's People 's Liberation Army ever did attempt to invade and occupy Taiwan , they could be a " huge problem for [ PLA ] helicopters and low - altitude aircraft , " said Minnick .
Reuters , Oct. 9
BERLIN — A Spanish amnesty for illegal immigrants has drawn more of them to Europe and unilateral policies should be abandoned in favour of joint international solutions , Germany ’s Interior Minister said on Sunday .
Europe may be “ overwhelmed ” by migrants if the economic and social gap between it and impoverished Africa continued to widen rapidly , Interior Minister Otto Schily warned , in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .
“ The pressure on Europe from migrants will increase so dramatically that we will be totally overwhelmed , ” the paper quoted him as saying .
“ Not even three — or five - deep layers of fencing will prevent it . ”
In recent weeks , large groups of African migrants have tried to get into Europe by storming razor wire fences around Spain ’s North African enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta , which are situated on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco .

“ In the long term immigration and refugee problems cannot be solved with unilateral action , but only with European and international cooperation , ” he added .
In February , Spain introduced a three - month amnesty for illegal immigrants as part of a drive to lift them out of the shadow economy , give them rights and make them pay taxes .
Around 700,000 people took advantage of the scheme , which the government said helped better regulate immigration in a country that is a main gateway into the European Union from Africa and Latin America .
