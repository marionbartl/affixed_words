大学生になると付き合いも増えて、その分出費も増えるものでしょう。
バイト先の友達と一緒にコンパを楽しんだり旅行を楽しんだり、その上で一人暮らしをしていれば家賃や食費、光熱費などの生活費もかかってくることになりますので、お金が足りなくて困ってしまうということもあると思います。
奨学金をもらっていても、生活費に回さざるを得なくなると、ついには学費が足りなくなってしまうケースもあります。そんなときにおすすめなのが学生ローンの利用です。学生ローンとは、20歳以上の学生に限定して融資をしてくれるサービスです。『参考サイト：e-campus：学生ローン』
通常のキャッシングやカードローンと違う点は、学生に特化しているという点なります。
一般的なキャッシングサービスの場合には、収入の少ない相手は不良債権化する恐れがあることから融資を断るケースが多く、学生は返済してくれない可能性のある危険因子としてサービスの対象外にすることがありますが、学生ローンではそういった断られてしまうことが少なく、そのため利用勝手が良いと言えます。
また、学生ローンは通常のキャッシングサービスと比較して若干金利が安くなっている点も利点で、より安く借りられるのはとても魅力的です。
当サイトでは学生ローンの特徴と利用方法について解説していきます。
学費の工面に困っている、遊ぶお金が足りなくて困っている、生活費に困っているという方はぜひ参考にしてみてください。使い方次第ではとても便利なサービスです。

I ’m not alone : I hate the Recording Industry Association of America .
Most people my age do .
People in their 20s know the RIAA almost exclusively from articles in their student newspaper — some of which I wrote for The Michigan Daily — about the organization suing students for sharing songs under copyright .
To date , about 30,000 people , many of them students , have been sued .
Adults uninitiated into digital culture said " good riddance " to these kids , accusing them of stealing .
How silly .
My thoughts on the RIAA improved slightly a few months ago when I heard they were stopping the lawsuits .
The lawsuits were bad PR and they were n't working .
Hallelujah !
But not so fast !
Never underestimate the will of an industry in search of profits .
Now there is news the organization is enlisting ISPs — the likes of AT&T and Comcast — to go after those who breach copyright .
How did they muscle the ISPs into this ?
I 'm no expert on telecommunications policy and the law , but my uneducated guess is they threatened to sue the ISPs for violators on its servers , and the ISPs figured it was easier to just comply .
Yet this deal reeks of corporate collusion .
If one ISP decides not to comply , which may still happen , users who had the choice might flock to them ( the lack of real free choice among telecommunications providers is one of my big pet peeves ) .
The RIAA / ISP deal only works if everybody 's in on it .
This entire hullabaloo only underscores how silly and outdated copyright law is today — how silly it has been since its inception , really .
Copyright violations happen all the time today and go unprosecuted — see YouTube — because companies simply find a way to make money through other channels .
Post Grey 's Anatomy on YouTube ?
Fine , come to ABC.com for the HD version !
Yet copyright has been protecting the interests of companies since its invention ( since 17th and 18th centuries ) , and typically an industry relents and finds a way for artists to " violate " copyright after discovering new profit channels .
Digital media presents a challenge to the arts industries , but do not be fooled : the RIAA is not defending artists .
That 's the crap they say to gain public support .
In fact , artists have little control over the money they make on their songs these days .
RIAA is protecting the companies , who take most of the money artists make .
Because copyrights last decades , long after the artist dies , the industry can lock - in profits for years to come at the expense of artists , users and the public interest .
It is corporate greed , plain and simple .
And they are willing to wage the country 's worst PR campaign — suing your customers !
Nice !— in order to make a few extra dollars .
Let 's also be honest about something : young people are not stealing .
They are sharing , like those who once made VCR recordings of TV shows for friends ( a court - approved practice the industry originally opposed ) .
Lawrence Lessig has been the most impassioned voice in trying loosen our definitions of copyright to be more open , fostering creativity instead of criminalizing young people .
Lessig 's Creative Commons license , a free and easy way for artists to encourage others to use their work , is quite revolutionary and should become the standard among creative types working today .
People my age have a different idea of what ownership means .
We share and remix to create new art and are less profit - driven than others .
In fact most artists do n't care too much about profits .
That 's because most artists will never make as much as those signed with Universal Music Group or with a distribution deal with Warner Bros .
One of the most important movies about digital culture to date , LOL , has its soundtrack available for free download .
As another example , I once made a YouTube video using a song by Mikel Rouse I heard at a Merce Cunningham performance and cited him next to the video .
One day the artist himself commented on my page .
I was scared .
Was he going to sue me for copyright violation ?
No !
He congratulated me on my interpretation of his work .
Most artists just want their work seen and heard .
Corporations want to make money .
Now two industries are colluding to stifle creativity and the advancement of the arts , which is the constitutional justification for copyright .
People are powerless to stop it .
When will the recording industry modernize and develop a viable alternative to file sharing ?
When will Congress , the administration , or some rich file - sharer finally stand up to these bullies and say enough is enough ?
Prosecutors said that the girl disappeared while on her way to school on Jan 19 .

Michelle Obama flashes the ‘ El Diablo ’ hand signal on the cover of Vogue magazine .
Texe Marrs ’ book Codex Magica contains dozens of pictures of members of the elite flashing similar hand signals on the cover of magazines and newspapers .
Texe explains the significance of the signal in the article below .
— — — — — — — — —— —— ——
Three versions of the “ El Diablo , ” the sign of Satan , the horned god .
The hand sign at right is also the deaf ’s gesture , or signing , for “ I love you , ” a fact which has many people confused .
Also called Il Cornuto and Diabolicus , the employment by the elite of the hand sign of the horned devil can actually be tracked all the way back to Babylon .
On the great wall of Babylon , adjacent to Ishtar ’s Gate , was a mosaic image of a horned bull , representing the sun god .
The horns were symbolic of the Babylonian god ’s power over the hearts of men .
Later , in Imperial Rome , Caesar ’s military legions and millions of common people worshipped the sun god , Mithras .
Mithraic initiates were baptized in the blood of a horned bull , slain and sacrificed by temple priests .
The Knights Templar , predecessor to today Scottish Rite Freemasons , worshiped the grotesque horned goat god , Baphomet .
It is believed that many Illuminists continue to sacrifice to this unspeakable deity to this very day .
Reportedly , the Illuminati take great delight in seeing the masses adopt their ancient symbol of satanic worship on such a vast scale .
How easy it has been for the elite to persuade the stupid and gullible to enter into satanic bondage .
In giving the El Diablo , that is exactly the message the giver is signalling the devil : “ I ’m yours forever , Satan , heart and soul I ’m yours ! ”
I Love You , Devil ?
The “ El Diablo ” hand sign often is con-fused with the deaf ’s signing of the phrase , “ I love you . ”
While at first this appears an odd resemblance , we register an “ ahh , I get it ! ” emotion when we discover that the person who invented , or created , the hand sign system for the deaf , Helen Keller , was herself an occultist and Theosophist .
Did Keller purposely design the deaf ’s “ I love you ” sign to be such a remarkable imitation of the classic sign of Satan ?
Was Keller saying , basically , “ I love you , Devil ? ”
Then , we have the confusion of the El Diablo hand sign with the University of Texas “ hook ‘ em horns ” sign .
Texas ’ mascot is the longhorn cow and it is only natural that the horns sign be employed by the student body , alumni , and fans of that great institution .
When Jenna Bush , the daughter of President George W. Bush , gave the horns sign at the 2004 presidential inauguration , it shocked the world .
Most viewers of international TV did not know that Jenna is a recent graduate of the University of Texas .
However , at that same inaugural gala , the President also was photographed giving the sign , and so was the other Bush daughter .
Not only that , but the First Lady , Laura , and even the President ’s mother , Barbara Bush , got into the mix .
They , too , were seen giving the sign .
However , the inauguration of President George W. Bush was not the first which had featured the giving of the El Diablo sign .
President Bill Clinton also did it at his first inaugural , and , in Codex Magica , you ’ll see a shocking example of the El Diablo sign of Satan given at the inauguration of George Washington , our nation ’s very first President !
High priest of the Church of Satan , Anton LaVey , was honored upon his death in this article in the San Francisco Chronicle .
In the picture , LaVey is giving the “ El Diablo ” hand sign while , on the wall , is the “ Baphomet ” version of the satanic pentagram star .
Was it mere coincidence that on the very day that this wicked satanist died in California , across the sea , in England , Illuminati chief Lord Edmond de Rothschild also passed away ?
Marion Berry , then Mayor of the nation ’s capital , Washington , D.C. Later arrested for cocaine possession , Mayor Berry once remarked , “ Outside of the killings , Washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country . ”
President George W. Bush is very adept at giving the sign .
President Bill Clinton is often seen flashing the horned devil sign .
Prince William of Britain ’s royal family .
Partying , Drinking , Rebellion , Or… ?
With the rapid rise in popularity of the El Diablo sign among rock music fans , many people seem to be blissfully unaware of the satanic background and dark history of this sign .
To some , giving the sign more likely indicates eagerness and gusto for fun , partying , drinking , and rebellion .
I leave it to you , the reader , to decide which of the persons shown here and in my book , Codex Magica , rendering the El Diablo sign , are paying homage to Satan and which are employing it for some other purpose .
I have my own opinion , what ’s yours ?
For example , in Codex Magica you ’ll discover former President Bill Clinton , entertainer Michael Jackson , and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi all giving the sign .
Are they telling us they are Texas Longhorns fans .. or that they love Satan ?
Actress Meryl Streep gives the sign of the Devil just over the head of “ Angels in America ” director , Mike Nichols .
In 2004 , the HBO series “ Angels in America ” was aired .
It was possibly the most evil TV program ever broadcast .
The director and actress were given “ Golden Globe ” awards , indicating how hateful Hollywood and the TV networks have become .
The series depicted angels having sex with homosexuals and blasphemously mocked God .
It praised communist spies like Ethel Rosenberg .
( Photo : Newsweek , November 17 , 2003 ) Entertainer Michael Jackson sends a message to his fans .
Watch Those Hands !
Actor Jason Alexander ( ” George ” in Seinfeld TV series ) performs a cabala ritual in plain sight of a vast audience .
To the uninitiated and ignorant millions of people who read TV Guide and see this cover , Jason Alexander appears to be merely hamming it up .
Little do they know of the deeper occult meaning .
For example , we find Jason ’s left and right hands giving the “ El Diablo ” satanic hand sign .
His arms — one pointing up , the other down — indicate the dualistic ( marriage of opposites , or reconciliation ) , cabalistic magical philosophy “ As Above , So Below ” ( The devil goat Baphomet performs the same sign ) .
We also note the three triangles presented by Jason ’s legs and arms .
Judging the Evidence
A final word :
Even if you and I are willing to allow that the giving of this sign by some is not intentionally satanic , we cannot dismiss the evidence that many , if not most , who employ the sign are , in fact , knowingly honoring Satan , the rebellious dark angel .
The case of the vampire satanists who stabbed a victim 66 times and drank his blood undeniably stamps the El Diablo hand sign given by the murderers as intensely satanic in nature .
Neither can the pictures in Codex Magica of a Hindu sect member , a witch , and of Anton LaVey , High Priest of Satan , giving the sign be disputed or explained away .
As for top - ranked Christian evangelists pictured in Codex Magica giving what appears to be the El Diablo sign , are these men servants of the One , True God as revealed in the Holy Bible , or do they cryptically serve His adversary , Lucifer ?
Judging from their hand gestures , what do you say ?

A Nintendo patent from March 2006 shows that the company originally intended a Wii-mote style device for the GameCube .
A patent drawing shows how the Wii Remote could link with the GC .

A Wavebird - like adapter would be attached to the GameCube console , which would interface with the wand remote .
There appears to be two separate sensors points on the television .
The wand remote in the patent drawings looks surprisingly similar to the finalized Wii-mote .

There is also a patent drawing for a tennis game — which includes a drawing of Mario .
Early shades of Wii Tennis , no doubt .
So somewhere along the line , Nintendo decided to turn this add - on into the impetus for the console we now call the Wii .

Walter Martin and Paloma Munoz are geniuses at creating beautiful but tragic stories .
What you once thought was playful and innocent is actually a world of chaos ; lone wanderers survey the frigid landscape , people and creatures exhibit unnatural tendencies and ill - defined crimes are committed .
These imaginary worlds and events will shock you into believing that this world is more cold than we think ; where every man is out for himself .
Like fairy tales or dreams , the tiny tableaus work as psychological metaphors : specifically , a stage everyone is bound to enter when life has lost its warmth and promise , at which point finding a new way becomes desperately urgent .
They speak to isolation and environment , cause and effect , connection and disconnection on individual , global , and ideological levels all within the confines of a snow globe ( Travelers ) or on landscape panoramas ( Islands ) .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Bernie Madoff ’s investment fund may never have executed a single trade , industry officials say , suggesting detailed statements mailed to investors each month may have been an elaborate mirage in a $ 50 billion fraud .
Accused swindler Bernard Madoff exits the Manhattan federal court house in New York January 14 , 2009 .
Madoff can remain out on bail and under house arrest , a U.S. judge ruled on Wednesday , rejecting a government appeal to send him to jail .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
An industry - run regulator for brokerage firms said on Thursday there was no record of Madoff ’s investment fund placing trades through his brokerage operation .
That means Madoff either placed trades through other brokerage firms , a move industry officials consider unlikely , or he was not executing trades at all .
“ Our exams showed no evidence of trading on behalf of the investment advisor , no evidence of any customer statements being generated by the broker - dealer , ” said Herb Perone , spokesman for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority .
Madoff ’s broker - dealer operation , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities , underwent routine examinations by FINRA and its predecessor , the National Association of Securities Dealers , every two years since it opened in 1960 , Perone said .
Madoff , a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market who was a force on Wall Street for nearly 50 years , allegedly confessed to his sons the firm ’s investment - advisory business was “ basically a giant Ponzi scheme ” and “ one big lie , ” according to court documents .
He estimated losses of at least $ 50 billion from the Ponzi scheme , which uses money from new investors to pay distributions and redemptions to existing investors .
Such schemes typically collapse when new funds dry up .
Each month , Madoff sent out elaborate statements of trades conducted by his broker - dealer .
Last November , for example , he issued a statement to one investor showing he bought shares of Merck & Co Inc , Microsoft Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and Amgen Inc among others .
It also showed transactions in Fidelity Investments ’ Spartan Fund .
But Fidelity , the world ’s biggest mutual fund company , has no record of Madoff or his company making any investments in its funds .
DISCREPANCIES
“ We are not aware of any investments by Madoff in our funds on behalf of his clients , ” Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said in an e-mail to Reuters .
Neither Madoff nor his firm was a client of Fidelity ’s Institutional Wealth Services business , their clearing firm National Financial or a financial intermediary client of its institutional services arm , she said .
“ Consequently , his firm did not work with our intermediary businesses through which firms invest their clients ’ money in Fidelity funds , ” she added .
There also appear to be discrepancies between monthly statements sent to investors and the actual prices at which the stocks traded on Wall Street .
For example , his November statement showed he bought software maker Apple Inc ’s securities at $ 100.78 each on November 12 , about a month before his arrest .
But Apple ’s stock on that day never traded above $ 93.24 .
The statement also showed he bought chip maker Intel Corp at $ 14.51 on November 12 , but Intel ’s highest price on that day was $ 13.97 .
“ You could print up any statements you want on the computer and send it out to a client and the chances are the client would n’t know , because they are getting a statement , ” said Neil Hackman , president and chief executive of Oak Financial Group , a Stamford , Connecticut - based investment advisory firm .
To some , the numbers did not add up .
About 10 years ago , Harry Markopolos , then chief investment officer at Rampart Investment Management Co in Boston , asked risk management consultant Daniel diBartolomeo to run Madoff ’s numbers after Markopolos tried to emulate Madoff ’s strategy .
DiBartolomeo ran regression analyses and various calculations , but failed to reconcile them .
For a decade , Markopolos raised the issue with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , which has come under fire in Congress in recent weeks for failing to act on Markopolos ’s warnings .
Wikipedia Needs Rubyists to Flesh Out Mobile Vision
By Peter Cooper
You might know Hampton Catlin as the Rubyist who invented the Haml markup system ( as used in many Ruby web apps ) , Sass or make_resourceful .
What you might not know , however , is that Hampton went on to develop a successful Wikipedia iPhone app ( iPedia née iWik - listen to this podcast about its development ) and was then hired by Wikipedia to lead the development of the mobile Wikipedia site ( powered by Ruby ! )
Hampton has been taking Ruby into Wikipedia in a big way and he needs the help of other Rubyists to keep the momentum going .
I caught up with Hampton to find out what he 's doing at Wikipedia , what Wikipedia needs , and how Rubyists can get involved :
Ruby Inside :
What are you responsible for at Wikipedia ?
Hampton Catlin :
My title there is " Mobile Development Lead " and basically I 'm responsible for making sure that people with mobile devices have access to Wikimedia projects .
Initially we are focusing on Wikipedia , but since all of the Wikimedia projects run on basically the same code base , we are going to be covering most of the projects .
My main responsibility is to grow open source communities around the different mobile projects .
Wikipedia is the fourth most popular site in the world and most of the programming is done via open source channels .
Initially , I 'm doing a lot of the foundational programming and will be responsible for maintaining code quality , but into the future , we are really looking for people to help and take charge of different components .
How is Ruby involved in the work being done at Wikipedia ?
Ruby is being used via Merb ( Rails 3 ? ) and a whole series of Ruby libraries that are focused on the back end formatting services .
Actually , we just launched them last week , and they are still a little rough , but the foundations are solid .
Basically , the Ruby app is responsible for providing custom - formatted article pages to different mobile apps .
The service is currently live at http://en.m.wikipedia.org
How would you ( and Wikipedia ) like Rubyists to get involved ?
Go grab the code at http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/tree/master then run rake todo : list .
Viola !
Pretty soon we are going to have a full bug tracker , but at the moment , its a pretty early stage in the project and bugzilla is a bit overkill .
I think this is a huge opportunity for people .
How often do you get to do work that is seen by so many people and potentially so many more ?
It 's a very simple project to dive into .
I 've put a LOT of work into making sure that it is absolutely as simple and logical as possible .
I 've also put a lot of work into documentation to ensure that people do n't get confused when diving in .
And if you are just learning , its actually a good project to look at .
Beyond general help with the project , I 'm also looking for people to help work on adding new mobile formats .
Initially we are focusing on " XHTML " and " WebKit " as the two major supported platforms .
That is the same thing as " Anything Modern " and " iPhone / Android " .
However , if you have a Blackberry and you want to see stuff on Wikipedia that is totally perfect for your phone , then its pretty easy to do !
Just add a device to our list , figure out its user agent , and then go create the views !
Its stupid simple .
Also , you can brag at dinner parties " Oh , you have a Blackberry ... look at what I did this weekend ! " ;)
The final thing we need help with is press .
We need to get the word out to regular users !
If you know people that run a mobile conference or work in the press , please try and help us out .
One of the major failures of the first - generation of Wikipedia Mobile was that no one knew about it .
Its part of my job to make sure they know about this .
What new technologies or services do you anticipate being created for or by Wikipedia in the next year ?
( that are relevant to Rubyists )
Beyond the mobile services , not too much !
We just need to keep growing them with press ( tell your friends ! ) , bug reporting , and new formats .
Oh , and if you want to learn iPhone development , grab our edge branch of the iPhone app at http://github.com/hcatlin/wikipedia-iphone/tree/master
At the time of writing this , its a little rough but its what I 'm doing this week !
We also need people who know Java development to help with a native Android app .
And , for Ruby stuff ...
I 'm looking to have an entire Mediawiki Ruby library done .
But , it 's not the kind of thing I 've very good at , so at the moment its taken a back seat .
If anyone wants to create one , shoot me an email ( at hcatlin - at- wikimedia.org ) .
We can make it " official " .
Update :
You can also discuss this on IRC on irc.freenode .

A few days we reported on a new service which claimed to offer lifetime anonymous BitTorrent for a $ 50.00 one - off payment .
As the service ' launched ' we had our doubts , but understandably some people decided to give it a try since it was so cheap .
It turns out that the offer was indeed too good to be true .
The ability to partake in some anonymous BitTorrent - ing is becoming increasingly desirable .
A reputable VPN service , offering fast transfer speeds and unlimited transfers costs around $ 10 to $ 20 per month , so when a ‘ new ’ service called VPN4 Life was about to launch last week offering incredibly cheap prices , we took a closer look .
In a nutshell , a representative from VPN4 Life claimed they were about to offer a fast , 128 bit encrypted , fully unlimited and anonymous PPTP service – all for just a one - off payment of $ 50.00 .
It seemed to good to be true and in our report we said as much , warning people away from the service .
Nevertheless , since the offer was so cheap , some people decided to take the chance .
After handing their cash over via PayPal , customers did not receive a PPTP VPN service , but an executable file named ‘ VPN 4 Life PC.exe ’ .
Sadly , this was neither new nor original code , but a piece of software designed to protect people ’s privacy when using public WiFi networks .
The ad - supported software , called Hotspot Shield , is already available for free from AnchorFree.com .
The scammers at VPN4 Life simply renamed the file to make it look like their own work .
Confirmation that the two files are identical can be obtained by checking the MD5 checksum , which can be viewed as a type of digital fingerprint .
The results for each file are identical .
4b34079841d43799e5d0849ac16feb61 HSS-1.10-install-anchorfree-76-conduit.exe
4b34079841d43799e5d0849ac16feb61 VPN
4 Life PC.exe
The VPN4 Life site now has a note on it stating that if anyone is unhappy with the service , that ’s too bad .
“ No refunds will be given if you are dissatisfied with our services , ” says the site ’s recently - added Terms and Conditions .
However , according to reports from purchasers , a complaint to PayPal seems to do the trick .
Too good to be true ?
You bet .
A new electrified high speed rail line linking London , Birmingham and Heathrow will form the centrepiece of a major government transport initiative today that will include a third runway at Britain 's largest airport .
Gordon Brown will defy environmental critics and the Conservative party when the government formally unveils the package that will herald what ministers are dubbing a " green Heathrow " .
The most dramatic element will be the building of a railway hub at Heathrow which will form part of a new 200 mph rail line , running parallel to the congested west coast mainline , linking London and Birmingham direct , with a spur to Heathrow from St Pancras station , linking the new line to Britain 's current high speed Eurostar line to Paris and Brussels .
The government will declare that it is delivering a new high speed link for the whole of the west coast mainline to the north - west of England even though the new line will stop at Birmingham .
This is because most of the congestion occurs around Birmingham , allowing new trains to continue at speed , though not the full 200 mph , to Manchester and Liverpool even after they come off the new line .
Greenpeace and the Tories last night pledged to maintain their opposition to Heathrow 's third runway , with the environmental group vowing to ensure it would not be built .
But Brown believes the announcement will trump the Tories .
David Cameron told his party conference last year a Tory government would abandon a third runway and instead build a rail link between London , Birmingham and Leeds .
Geoff Hoon , the transport secretary who will outline the package to MPs today , will spell out a series of measures to create a " green Heathrow " .
These will include :
• Limiting new landing and takeoff slots on Heathrow 's third runway to airlines that meet the strictest emissions standards .
• Assurances that EU rules on air and noise pollution will not be breached by the expansion of Heathrow .
These were the key areas of concern raised by Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , who is now supporting the announcement .
The new rail link to the airport , which is designed to reduce the number of passengers arriving by cars , taxis and buses , will be highlighted as a key measure in ensuring that air pollution standards are met .
Greenpeace said the environmental " sweeteners " did not go far enough .
John Sauven , its executive director , said last night : " It will shred the last vestiges of Brown 's environmental credibility .
An expanded Heathrow would become the single biggest emitter of CO2 in Britain .
Labour MPs will lose seats over this .
We 'll fight it every step of the way because the lives of millions of people depend on us all slashing carbon emissions . "
The prime minister is determined to press ahead with the expansion of Heathrow because he sees it as the kind of vital infrastructure project Britain should be building in a recession and because he believes it provides a perfect " dividing line " issue with the Tories .
Lord Adonis , the railway minister , has said he is keen on a £ 4.5 bn hub to improve London 's links with the north of England and Scotland .
Plans for a new rail hub at Heathrow have already been drawn up by Arup , the engineering consultancy .
They have proposed building a 12 - platform station , linking the airport directly to London , the north west and the south west .
Citigroup Inc. and the U.S. are close to an agreement in which the government will substantially increase its stake in the bank and will demand boardroom changes in return , according to people familiar with the matter .
The deal , expected to be announced Friday morning , is designed to ease jitters about the soundness of one of the world 's ...
[ Update : The issue discussed below has been announced , and I have the news posted ! ]
Spoilers ( sorta ) ahoy !
If you want to know nothing at all about series / season 5 of Doctor Who , go away now .
I mean it .
( looks around ) OK ?
Good .
The BBC will be announcing tomorrow ( Saturday ) the actor who will take over for David Tennant in Doctor Who !
Speculation has been running wild for months , ever since Tennant announced he would leave .
Some are a little out there ( I personally would love to see the Doctor played by a woman , but I do n't think there 's much weight to those rumors ) .
Another contender is Paterson Joseph , who would be great .
I saw him in the UK show " The Survivors " , and he 's very , very good .
A black Doctor would be pretty interesting ; I do n't think it would matter inside the universe of the show , but with Obama coming in , it might send out another strong signal that times have changed on this planet of ours ( I 'm not elevating DW to the status of importance of the POTUS , of course , but the show is watched and idolized by millions of people , and that does make a difference ) .
I do know that whoever it is , lots of people will love the choice , lots will hate it , and we 'll all watch anyway .
I 'll try to have the news here on the blog as soon as I find out what 's what who 's Who .
Tip o' the sonic screwdriver to my Twitter follower J H Van Ophem .

Busted Coverage brought you the world exclusive last month that NBA TV was about to get much more sexier with the hiring of former Tempe12 bikini model and Penn State grad Melanie Collins .
Now there is actual visual and audio proof of Collins gaining experience before what we expect will be a sideline career .
One of her first assignments – talk to some NBA.com writer about what ’s going on with the D - League .
Yeah , not exactly like asking Shaq about his Twittering .

Collins , not even a year removed from college , seems destined for big things in TV .
Our Indian researchers have yet to pinpoint Collins ’ age but she is all alone in the high profile job “ Hot Broadcasters Under 25 ” category .
We ’re begging NBA TV to send her to the all star game .
It ’s in Phoenix .
Maybe a poolside chat .

A BAKER has been cleared of raping a 20 - year - old woman in a park after they left an Evesham nightclub together .
Daniel Wilmot , who was attacked when the woman made a complaint to passers - by , insisted they had sex by consent .
A jury at Worcester Crown Court today unanimously found him not guilty of two counts of rape and an alternative third count of attempted rape .
Mr Wilmot , aged 21 , of Clevedon Green , South Littleton , near Evesham , shouted " thank you so much " from the dock as the verdicts were announced at the end of a four - day trial .
The woman gave evidence that she and the defendant were " bumping and grinding " on the dance floor at Inuendo on January 13 last year .
They also kissed passionately and she touched him sexually .
A CCTV film showed her leading him out of the club in the early hours in the direction of Abbey Park .
The jury heard she knew 15 minutes after meeting Mr Wilmot for the first time that he wanted sex .
Mr Wilmot , who works for a supermarket , claimed she kissed him passionately in the park , voluntarily performed a sex act on him and then pulled him down on top of her .
Defence counsel Adam Western said : " The idea that she went outside for anything else but sex defies common sense . "
She was unsure of some events that night because of alcohol consumption .
Mr Western said she may have made a false complaint because she did n't want her friends to find out she had gone for sex with a stranger .
He also suggested that she wanted to resume a love affair with an ex-boyfriend and if he had found out " it would scupper a reconciliation " .
Mr Wilmot was hit in the face by a man before police were called to the scene .
Prosecutor Nicolas Cartwright insisted the woman had no grudge against Mr Wilmot and had nothing to gain from her allegation .
He added : " There may been provocative dancing in the club , but that does n't mean it was a green light for what happened later . "
The woman had bruises on her arms and a scratch on Mr Wilmot 's back bled significantly .
Damage was also found to his shirt and waistcoat .

Explanation : Thousands of satellites orbit the Earth .
Costing billions of dollars , this swarm of high altitude robots is now vital to communication , orientation , and imaging both Earth and space .
One common type of orbit is geostationary where a satellite will appear to hover above one point on Earth 's equator .
Geostationary orbits are very high up -- over five times the radius of the Earth -- and possible only because the satellite orbital period is exactly one day .
It is usually cheaper to place a satellite in low Earth orbit , around 500 kilometers , just high enough to avoid the effect of Earth 's atmosphere .
The above animated sequence starts by showing the halo of Earth 's satellites , including the ring at geostationary , and finishes by zooming in on the only one currently hosting humans : the International Space Station .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Borrowing by consumers fell in August for the first time in more than 10 years as a weak economy continued to strain household budgets , according to a government report issued Tuesday .
The Federal Reserve reported that consumer borrowing decreased by $ 7.9 billion in August to $ 2.577 trillion from a revised $ 2.585 trillion in July .
The annual rate of consumer borrowing fell 3.7 % last month .
Credit card borrowing decreased at an annual rate of 0.8 % while non-revolving borrowing , including student and auto loans , contracted by 5.4 % .
Economists had expected borrowing to have increased by $ 5 billion in August , according to a poll conducted by Briefing.com .
Tuesday 's report marks the first time consumer credit has shrunk since January 1998 , when it dropped $ 4.7 billion , or at a 4.3 % annual rate .
" This month 's decline was predominantly due to a decrease in non-revolving lines of credit , " said Sean Maher , associate economist for Moody's Economy.com .
Maher added that auto loans make up the bulk of non-revolving lines of credit and that the decrease in August reflects weak vehicle sales in the month of July .
" Gas prices were high in July and consumers ' transportation budgets were squeezed , which translated to a weak appetite for new vehicles , " he said .
While the 0.8 % decline in credit card borrowing was less dramatic , Maher said that revolving credit has steadily increased on a historical basis and that the dip in August was " fairly significant . "
" Consumers are becoming more reluctant to charge on their credit cards , " he said .
And as economic conditions have deteriorated and individual borrowers have had trouble making payments , " it 's also clear that banks are being a lot more cautious . "
Indeed , the Fed 's most recent survey of senior loan officers showed that 65 % of U.S. banks tightened lending standards on credit card loans over the three months ended in July .
The pullback in borrowing comes as American households have struggled with a severe downturn in the housing market , rising unemployment and high energy prices .
With consumer spending contributing two - thirds of the nation 's gross domestic product , many economists fear the third quarter will be the first to show a decline in GDP since 1991 .
The reason Zimbabwe is horrifying , rather than merely awful and repugnant like other dictatorships , is spectacularly terrible land reform .
It turns out that land rights are the absolute linchpin of a functioning agricultural economy .
This is not , as some would have it , a brief against land reform .
There have been lots of good land reforms .
And in fact , no matter how efficient giant white - owned farms may be , they represent an ongoing legacy of colonial injustice .
But successful land reform is gradual , works hard to preserve property rights even as it passes them on to someone else ( which means , among other things , compensating the former owners ) , and focuses on putting control of the land into the hands of those who worked it .
If you have been following the horrors in Zimbabwe at all , you know that this is the opposite of how Mugabe has handled this redistribution , using violence to kick white farmers off their farms and hand them over to his cronies who have no idea how to run a farm .
Since many of the disposessed white farmers bought their land in the post - colonial era , this has massively undercut the justice of the redistribution .
Having destroyed the principle that a clear title represents a solid claim on the future output of that land , Mugabe can hardly be surprised to find that no one wants to invest any time or capital in making the land yield .
Property rights are neither sacred nor absolute .
But they are very , very important .
And we 're in an era when the temptation to arbitrarily violate them " For the Greater Good " is growing stronger .
In Washington , D.C. , a jury ignored a military veteran 's obvious violation of the city 's draconian gun laws , setting him free with only a slap on the wrist .
In LaSalle County , Illinois , a medical marijuana user found with 25 pounds of the plant did n't even get the slap ; jurors chatted with him after finding him not guilty .
While we can't know for sure , in both cases jury nullification was likely at work as regular people serving an important role in courtrooms exercised their power to quash laws they found repugnant .
Corporal Melroy H. Cort , who lost his knees to an improvised bomb in Ramadi , Iraq , was en route to Walter Reed Hospital from his home in Columbus , Ohio , when his car got a flat .
He and his wife , Samantha , pulled over for repairs , at which time Cort , who has a concealed carry permit at home , retrieved his 9 mm pistol from his glove compartment and put it in his pocket .
Cort 's gun was spotted by somebody who called police , and Cort rapidly gained a rapid education in D.C. notoriously strict firearms laws .
He was charged with carrying a pistol without a license , possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of ammunition .
He spent the night behind bars for having the nerve to possess a weapon in a city that , while it has improved since its nadir in the 1990s , still has about triple the national average rate of violent crime .
Despite its crime rate , D.C. has done its best to deny residents the right to legally defend themselves .
This is the city that was taken to court for its restrictions -- and lost , resulting in the landmark case of D.C. v. Heller , which reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms .
Depite that loss , city laws remain extremely restrictive , and Cort had clearly run afoul of local law .
But an amazing thing happened in court .
According to the Washington Post :
After being deadlocked twice , a D.C. Superior Court jury yesterday acquitted a Marine amputee on felony charges of gun possession stemming from an arrest while he was on the way to Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
...
Although acquitting him of the gun charges , the jury found Cort guilty of possessing ammunition , a misdemeanor .
He was sentenced to time already spent in the D.C. jail .
It 's hard to avoid the conclusion that the jury ultimately saw no benefit in applying the city 's tight gun laws to a handicapped man who was just passing through .
Maybe they even questioned the overall propriety of the laws .
In the end , they rather clearly ignored the law to set Cort free with just a nominal slap on the wrist -- which he plans to appeal .
And that brings us to the case of Loren J. Swift .
Swift was arrested during a peaceful encounter at his home with a sizeable quantity of marijuana and plants -- reportedly 25 pounds and 50 pounds , respectively .
He had been convicted once before for marijuana possession .
A Navy veteran , Swift says he smokes marijuana to relieve pain and alleviate post - traumatic stress disorder , but Illinois does not yet have a medical marijuana law .
Twenty - five pounds of grass , plus plants , in a state where marijuana is strictly illegal .
That does n't sound good for Swift .
Except ...
On Wednesday in La Salle County Circuit Court , several jurors shook hands with an emotional Loren J. Swift after finding him not guilty of a marijuana charge that would have sent him to prison .
...
In the courthouse lobby , after the verdict , two male jurors talked and laughed with Swift and his attorney , Randy Gordon ; one of the jurors patted Swift on his back .
However , one of these jurors refused to admit he was a juror when The Times approached him for comment about the verdict ; the other juror did n't deny he was indeed a juror , but nevertheless refused to talk .
Not surprisingly , observers at Swift 's trial openly speculated about jury nullification .
Once again , it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that jurors sympathized more with the defendant than with the law , so decided to ignore what the statute books say .
In doing so , in both cases , justice prevailed .
So did liberty .
We do n't know what was going through the jurors ' heads in the Cort and Swift trials , or whether any jurors were even familiar with jury nullification .
But it 's not that difficult a concept to invent from scratch , if necessary .
Historically , as President John Adams put it , it has been the juror 's " duty ... to find the verdict according to his own best understanding , judgment , and conscience , though in direct opposition to the direction of the court . "
Unfortunately , you wo n't come across that quote from Adams in many modern courtrooms .
Government officials do n't like being second - guessed by the hoi polloi , so the tradition of independent juries has been allowed to wither from neglect .
Few jurors ever learn about the traditional power of juries .
But you do n't need to know history to have an inkling that the rights of the individual sometimes violate the dictates of the law -- and then decide to come down in favor of individual rights .
And individual rights are an endangered species in a nation increasingly hemmed in by laws and regulations that seem to render ever more of our daily activities either mandatory or forbidden .
They need as much protection as they can get .
To preserve what 's left of our liberty , jury nullification is a good and powerful tool for checking government power .
But since it is frequently discouraged by judges and prosecutors jealous of their prerogatives , it 's generally exercised on the sly -- often by jurors unaware that they 're doing exactly what was originally intended .
For that reason , we 'll likely never know exactly when nullification is being exercised .
But we can celebrate it when we see it .

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
A judge sentenced a rogue FBI agent to 40 years in prison on Thursday for the 1982 mob-related killing of a witness who was about to testify against Boston mob members , court officials said .
Former FBI agent John Connolly " crossed over to the dark side , " a judge said .
Disgraced ex-FBI agent John Connolly Jr. " crossed over to the dark side , " said Miami - Dade Circuit Court Judge Stanford Blake .
The sentence will run consecutively to a 10 - year racketeering sentence .
Connolly , 68 , was convicted in November of second - degree murder in the death of businessman John Callahan , an executive with World Jai-Alai .
Callahan 's bullet - riddled body was found in the trunk of a Cadillac parked at Miami International Airport .
Connolly 's fall from celebrated mob-buster to paid gangland flunky captivated a South Florida courtroom for weeks .
In testimony at his sentencing hearing last month , he denied having any role in Callahan 's death .
" It 's heartbreaking to hear what happened to your father and to your husband , " he told members of Callahan 's family .
" My heart is broken when I hear what you say . "
He explained , in the face of vigorous cross-examination , that rubbing elbows with killers and gangsters and winning their confidence was part of his job .
His attorney argued that Connolly did what the FBI wanted him to do , and now was being held responsible .
Connolly did not testify at his trial .
Prosecutors had asked that Connolly be given a life sentence , saying the 30 - year minimum was not enough because Connolly abused his badge .
In a Boston Globe interview published last month , however , Connolly vigorously denied being a corrupt agent .
" I did not commit these crimes I was charged with , " Connolly told the newspaper .
" I never sold my badge .
I never took anybody 's money .
I never caused anybody to be hurt , at least not knowingly , and I never would . "
During his two - month trial , jurors heard that Connolly told his mob connections that Callahan , 45 , was a potential witness against them , setting him up for the gangland - style slaying .
According to testimony , Connolly was absorbed by the very gangsters he was supposed to be targeting -- members of South Boston 's notorious Winter Hill gang .
His story was said to be the inspiration for the character played by Matt Damon in the 2006 Martin Scorsese movie , " The Departed . "
Connolly 's tale was closely followed in New England , where he grew up in Boston 's " Southie " neighborhood , the same area long dominated by the Winter Hill gang and its notorious leader , James " Whitey " Bulger .
Sought in 19 slayings , Bulger is the FBI 's second most - wanted fugitive .
During the first two decades of his FBI career , Connolly won kudos in the bureau 's Boston office , cultivating informants against New England mobsters .
Prosecutors said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest - ranking snitches : Bulger and Stephen " The Rifleman " Flemmi .
Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with Bulger and Flemmi .
He was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10 - year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the Callahan slaying .
During testimony , jurors heard that Connolly was on the mob payroll , collecting $ 235,000 from Bulger and Flemmi while shielding his mob pals from prosecution and leaking the identities of informants .
The prosecution 's star witnesses at the Miami trial were Flemmi , who is now in prison , and mob hit man John Martorano , who has admitted to 20 murders , served 12 years in prison and is now free .
Callahan , who often socialized with gangsters , had asked the gang to execute Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler over a business dispute , according to testimony .
Martorano killed Wheeler in 1981 on a golf course , shooting him once between the eyes , prosecutors said .
After Connolly told Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was going to implicate them in the slaying , Martorano was sent to do away with Callahan , prosecutors said .
But one star witness did not testify -- the former FBI agent who inspired the 1997 film " Donnie Brasco . "
He refused to take the stand after the judge denied his request to testify anonymously .

China Investment Corporation is to put the brakes on making investments in western banks until governments come up with coherent policies to cope with the global economic downturn .
Lou Jiwei , the chairman of the sovereign wealth fund , said today : " Right now , we do not have the courage to invest in financial institutions .
We have to wait for the time when there wo n't be massive collapses of financial institutions . "
China had lost confidence in many financial institutions , Lou said , because foreign governments seemed to be changing their policies " every week " .
The announcement by CIC , which has a 9.9 % stake in US investment bank Morgan Stanley and a $ 3bn stake in US private equity firm Blackstone Group , will come as a big blow to many American banks that had hoped CIC would help bail them out .
Mark Williams , an economist at consultants Capital Economics , said : " I think it would be unlikely that they would rule out any investment in western institutions whatsoever , but such investments would have to be structured so there 's next to no chance of them losing any money . "
He said it was unlikely that CIC would pull out of institutions such as Morgan Stanley and Blackstone because it would lose too much money .
CIC was given $ 200 bn to invest by the Chinese government last year .
Its biggest investment to date is $ 5bn in Morgan Stanley , staked in December 2007 .
Since then , it has been relatively cautious as the credit crunch has worsened .
BARBECUE definitely gives apple pie a run for its money in the competition for all - American food .
More than 17 million barbecues were sold in 2006 , according to the Hearth , Patio & Barbecue Assn .
And 81 % of Americans own a barbecue , more than half grill year - round , and 47 % barbecue at least twice weekly in the summer months .
The truth is , pretty much anything tastes better hot off the grill .
It ’s something about the flames , the smoke , the tongs , the - meat - on - metal sizzle that no broil or fry pan can reproduce .
Even a tofu dog almost comes alive with a set of grill marks .

Health article on the health effects of eating barbecued meat incorrectly referred to a scientist as Zei Wheng .
His name is Wei Zheng .
The article also said that many processed meats contain nitrates and that these have been shown to increase cancer risk .
The chemicals most commonly used in curing meat today , and which also have been shown to increase cancer risk , are nitrites .
Nothing that good can be good for us , of course .
And yes , the natural chemicals that give barbecued foods their trademark crusty - brown smokiness are toxic and carcinogenic .
Researchers have linked consumption of flame - grilled meat to all sorts of ailments : breast , prostate and colon cancer ; diabetes ; glaucoma ; heart disease ; and Alzheimer ’s disease .
Fumes from burning fat drippings , along with smoke from wood and charcoal , add another layer of carcinogenicity ( as well as deliciousness ) to grilled foods .

And let ’s not forget the foods themselves .
A diet high in red meat -- a favorite of U.S. backyard cooks -- is a known cancer risk factor .
But you do n’t have to convert to a raw food diet yet .
Barbecue chemicals may be potent toxins in petri dishes and mice , but the evidence that they do the same in humans , at the doses we ’re exposed to , is weaker .
Most studies find a significant increase in cancer risk only for people who eat several portions of well - or very well - done meat a week .
And even then , the risk is often small .
For example , a 2005 study in Cancer Research found a 21 % increase in the risk of developing colon cancer precursors for people eating as much as 18 ounces of well - done red meat per day .
The bottom line : A twice - weekly date with a medium - rare steak is unlikely to give you cancer any time soon .
What ’s more , in addition to reducing portion size and frequency of grilling or developing a taste for steak tartare , there are many simple changes you can make to your grilling techniques to drastically reduce the toxicity of your barbecue with little adulteration of taste ( see sidebar ) .
Which is good , because you wo n’t find many takers in the “ give up steak for summer ” campaign .

The best - known toxic barbecue chemicals are heterocyclic amines , or HCAs , which form under high heat conditions -- such as grilling -- from amino acids , sugars and a muscle meat chemical called creatine .
Almost any meat cooked above 300 degrees Fahrenheit , when it begins to brown , will have HCAs , but as a general rule , the levels increase sharply with higher cooking temperatures and longer cooking times .
For example a steak cooked until just rare -- about 15 minutes or so -- has just 2.5 nanograms of one common HCA per gram of food .
Wait until that steak is black and crispy -- about 40 minutes -- and that value rises more than tenfold to 30 nanograms per gram .
Chicken breasts are even worse .
A nicely blackened grilled breast , cooked for about 40 minutes , has 480 nanograms of the same cancerous HCA per gram of meat .
Compared with other high - heat cooking methods such as pan-frying or oven broiling , grilling almost always leads to the biggest , baddest HCA numbers .
In laboratory tests , high doses of HCAs have proved to be potent carcinogens and tumor promoters .
So , too , have tests on another class of cooking - related meaty carcinogens , PAHs , or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
Whereas HCAs are generated by any high - heat cooking method , PAHs are specifically formed from the close relationship of food , fire and smoke in grilling and Southern barbecue .

PAHs are technically the incomplete combustion products of fuel and are best known as components in air pollution and cigarette smoke .
However , the World Health Organization estimates that 80 % to 90 % of our exposure to PAHs comes through food .
Smoke clouds from charcoal grills and those fat drip flare - ups are packed with PAHs .
And , again , the longer the cooking or smoking time , the greater the coating of carcinogens .
The extra whammy of PAHs , in addition to HCAs , is probably why a high intake of grilled , well - done meats is worse than that of broiled or fried meat .
One 1999 study led by cancer and cooking expert Rashmi Sinha , a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute , found that for every 2.5 ounces of grilled meat consumed per week , colon cancer risk rises 26 % .
For frying , it was only 10 % .
Still , the overall evidence of the malignant effects of PAHs and HCAs on people has been less than overwhelming .
Some studies do find that a general preference for , or high daily consumption of , well - done or very well - done red meat ( black on the outside , gray in the middle ) is a risk factor in prostate , stomach , breast and colorectal cancer .
For example , a 2002 study of 1,658 men and women from North Carolina found that those who ate 2 ounces of well - or very well - done meat a day had a 70 % increase in colon cancer risk .
Similarly , a 1998 study of nearly 42,000 women from Iowa found that those who preferred to eat their steak , hamburgers and bacon very well - done were 4.62 times more likely to get breast cancer than women who liked their red meats rare or medium done .
Advertisement
But other studies find no connection between cooking methods , meat doneness and cancer risk .
A 1999 study of nearly 33,000 women in the Nurses ’ Health Study in Massachusetts found no increase in breast cancer risk related to meat cooking habits .
A study of 800 New Zealand men found barely any connection between meat doneness preferences and prostate cancer .
“ The existing literature is quite inconsistent , but I think it is reasonable to say that if there were large risks due to the cooking methods , we would have seen them by now , ” says Dr. Walter Willett , Fredrick John Stare professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health .
Roger Clemens , a spokesman for the Institute of Food Technologists and professor of molecular pharmacology and toxicology at USC , says he is similarly unconvinced .
“ All foods contain a variety of naturally occurring toxins .
The dose in which we consume them is so small that they do n’t really have an impact on our health , ” he says .
But Dr. Zei Wheng , director of the Vanderbilt University epidemiology center , who has been studying the link between meat doneness and breast cancer for the last decade , does n’t agree .
He believes that the risks are hard to detect in human studies because of nuances of genetics .
Advertisement
For example , Wheng ’s analysis of the 42,000 women from the Iowa Women ’s Health Study found that women who carry one version of a gene for a particular metabolizing enzyme showed no increase in breast cancer risk no matter how charred they liked their red meat .
( The gene causes the enzyme , which is involved in activation of HCAs , to convert the compounds more slowly . )
But women with a hankering for blackened burgers and who had a different , “ fast ” copy of the enzyme had eight times the breast cancer risk of those who liked their meat rare .
Mariana Stern , assistant professor of preventive medicine at USC , also believes genetic variations are clouding results .
She is sifting through 20 metabolism genes and 30 DNA repair genes to understand the link between meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk .
“ There may be people that can eat grilled meat everyday and nothing will happen to them , ” she says .
But with so many genes involved , she says , everyone needs to watch their grilled meat intake .
If the evidence seems smoky for PAHs and HCAs , it ’s even more confusing for a class of toxic cooking chemicals that are making waves in the nutrition world .
Called advanced glycation end products , or AGEs , they are flavorful chemicals generated when all foods are cooked , processed and browned under high heat .
Advertisement
Foods high in fat and with a high degree of processing seem to be the worst AGE risks :
Hot dogs , butter and Parmesan cheese are as bad as it gets .
AGEs are powerful oxidants .
Animal and human studies have shown that they can damage cells and trigger widespread inflammation throughout the body .
They are implicated in many chronic diseases of aging : Accumulation of AGEs in the brain is linked to Alzheimer ’s disease , accumulation in the eyes to glaucoma , buildup in arteries to premature stiffening , buildup in the blood to insulin resistance and diabetes .
Scientists are even more divided as to how concerned we should be about these compounds in our diets than they are about HCAs or PAHs .
For one thing , AGEs , unlike HCAs or PAHs , form spontaneously in our bodies , says professor Paul Thornalley at the University of Warwick in England .
For another , if we eat them , they have a tough time surviving digestion , only weakly move into the bloodstream and are mostly filtered out by the kidneys in healthy people .
So , he says , although AGEs are harmful , it ’s unclear whether eating them causes damage .
Advertisement
But Dr. Helen Vlassara at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York is so convinced of their potential harm she wants the AGE content of food marked on food labels , right beside calories and trans fats .
Just last month , Vlassara published two studies :
One found that the amount of AGEs we consume leads to higher levels of the chemicals in the bloodstream of both old and young participants and increases signs of cellular stress and inflammation .
The second found that cutting the lifetime levels of dietary AGEs by half led to a longer lifespan in mice .
Vlassara believes that everyone should cut their consumption by reducing intake of processed foods and using low - temperature , moist cooking methods such as stewing .
“ Everybody likes the taste of grilled and baked foods , ” she says .
“ The idea here is not to deny the facts and continue eating ourselves to death but to think a little bit more critically about what we put in our mouths . ”

Jeffrey Steingarten , food writer for Vogue magazine , thinks very critically about what he puts in his mouth and has yet to find sufficient evidence to steer clear of a perfectly done steak -- which , in his estimation , is somewhere between rare and medium rare .
For those who choose to grill their steaks to the blackened point of well - done shoe leather , his tongue - in - cheek opinion is simple : “ If you eat a steak like that , you do n’t deserve to live . ”
But Steingarten settles on a point that most researchers of food - based diseases would agree on , despite the plethora of conflicting evidence .
If we are to eat really well and grill to the best of our all - American potential , we probably can’t eat meat that often -- from a health and a budgetary and a gastronomic perspective .
The meat he deems worth eating does n’t come cheap .
“ If you only eat the finest meat in every category , you probably wo n’t be able to afford to eat it every week , ” he says .
“ I do n’t eat beef that costs less than $ 30 a pound .
If you follow my rules , you will probably end up eating a lot more rice and salad . ”

Healthier ways to barbecue
If you simply must eat barbecue several times a week , here are a few tips from food science experts on ways to reduce the hazard ratio .
Advertisement
* Use a gas grill .
Gas grills tend to cook food at a lower temperature than their charcoal counterparts , generally meaning fewer heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) .
And because the gas combusts more completely ( there ’s less smoke ) , fewer polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are likely to accumulate on your food .
Yes , you lose that authentic char taste , but it ’s better than precooking in the microwave , as the National Cancer Institute suggests .
* Do n’t overcook .
Almost all of the studies on meat cooking methods and cancer risk find that rare or medium - rare red meats are relatively safe .
If you do n’t like your cow still mooing , try baking your steak or burger in a low - temperature oven and transferring it to the grill for a few moments to get a good crust .
* Trim the fat .
Fat dripping down on hot coals and heated surfaces burns and floats back up in a lovely cloud of PAHs .
Moving up the rack a few notches also will cut down on PAH accumulation .
* Processed meats = bad .
Hot dogs have some of the highest levels of AGEs per serving .
Many also contain nitrates , which have been shown in large studies of eating habits to increase cancer risk .
Advertisement
* Have an enormous salad , a giant bowl of blueberries and a glass of red wine with your barbecued steak .
The antioxidants found in fresh fruits and vegetables and in wine might not totally counter damage from consuming AGEs and other carcinogens but they could help -- plus they might help you cut down on meat portion size .
* Marinate , even for a minute .
Studies have found that marinating can reduce the levels of HCAs by up to 90 % .
Researchers suspect this has to do with keeping the meat moist .
If your marinade is acidic -- made with vinegar or lemon juice , say -- it will also help ward off excessive AGE formation .
Acid tenderizes meat too .
Bonus .
* Flip , flip , flip .
Like marinating , constantly flipping grilled foods cuts down on HCAs .
One study found that flipping a burger once a minute can cut down HCAs by 90 % .
Perfect your skills and soon you can do for burgers what Tom Cruise did for cocktails .

Introduction
Network security is a primary consideration in any decision to host a website as the threats are becoming more widespread and persistent every day .
One means of providing additional protection is to invest in a firewall .
Though prices are always falling , in some cases you may be able to create a comparable unit using the Linux iptables package on an existing server for little or no additional expenditure .
This chapter shows how to convert a Linux server into :
A firewall while simultaneously being your home website 's mail , web and DNS server .
A router that will use NAT and port forwarding to both protect your home network and have another web server on your home network while sharing the public IP address of your firewall .
Creating an iptables firewall script requires many steps , but with the aid of the sample tutorials , you should be able to complete a configuration relatively quickly .
What Is iptables ?
Originally , the most popular firewall / NAT package running on Linux was ipchains , but it had a number of shortcomings .
To rectify this , the Netfilter organization decided to create a new product called iptables , giving it such improvements as :
Better integration with the Linux kernel with the capability of loading iptables - specific kernel modules designed for improved speed and reliability .
Stateful packet inspection .
This means that the firewall keeps track of each connection passing through it and in certain cases will view the contents of data flows in an attempt to anticipate the next action of certain protocols .
This is an important feature in the support of active FTP and DNS , as well as many other network services .
Filtering packets based on a MAC address and the values of the flags in the TCP header .
This is helpful in preventing attacks using malformed packets and in restricting access from locally attached servers to other networks in spite of their IP addresses .
System logging that provides the option of adjusting the level of detail of the reporting .
Better network address translation .
Support for transparent integration with such Web proxy programs as Squid .
A rate limiting feature that helps iptables block some types of denial of service ( DoS ) attacks .
Considered a faster and more secure alternative to ipchains , iptables has become the default firewall package installed under RedHat and Fedora Linux .
Download And Install The Iptables Package
Before you begin , you need to make sure that the iptables software RPM is installed .
( See Chapter 6 , " Installing Linux Software " , if you need a refresher . )
When searching for the RPMs , remember that the filename usually starts with the software package name by a version number , as in iptables - 1.2.9-1.0.i386.rpm .
Managing the iptables Server
Managing the iptables daemon is easy to do , but the procedure differs between Linux distributions .
Here are some things to keep in mind .
Firstly , different Linux distributions use different daemon management systems .
Each system has its own set of commands to do similar operations .
The most commonly used daemon management systems are SysV and Systemd .
Secondly , the daemon name needs to be known .
In this case the name of the daemon is iptables .
Armed with this information you can know how to :
Start your daemons automatically on booting
Stop , start and restart them later on during troubleshooting or when a configuration file change needs to be applied .
For more details on this , please take a look at the " Managing Daemons " section of Chapter 6 " Installing Linux Software "
Note : Remember to configure your daemon to start automatically upon your next reboot .
Packet Processing
In iptables
All packets inspected by iptables pass through a sequence of built - in tables ( queues ) for processing .
Each of these queues is dedicated to a particular type of packet activity and is controlled by an associated packet transformation / filtering chain .
There are three tables in total .
The first is the mangle table which is responsible for the alteration of quality of service bits in the TCP header .
This is hardly used in a home or SOHO environment .
The second table is the filter queue which is responsible for packet filtering .
It has three built - in chains in which you can place your firewall policy rules .
These are the :
Forward chain : Filters packets to servers protected by the firewall .
Input chain : Filters packets destined for the firewall .
Output chain : Filters packets originating from the firewall .
The third table is the nat queue which is responsible for network address translation .
It has two built - in chains ; these are :
Pre-routing chain : NATs packets when the destination address of the packet needs to be changed .
Post - routing chain : NATs packets when the source address of the packet needs to be changed
Table 14 - 1 Processing For Packets Routed By The Firewall
Queue Type Queue Function Packet Transformation Chain in Queue Chain Function Filter Packet filtering FORWARD
Filters packets to servers accessible by another NIC on the firewall .
INPUT Filters packets destined to the firewall .
OUTPUT Filters packets originating from the firewall Nat Network Address Translation PREROUTING
Address translation occurs before routing .
Facilitates the transformation of the destination IP address to be compatible with the firewall 's routing table .
Used with NAT of the destination IP address , also known as destination NAT or DNAT .
POSTROUTING
Address translation occurs after routing .
This implies that there was no need to modify the destination IP address of the packet as in pre-routing .
Used with NAT of the source IP address using either one - to - one or many - to - one NAT .
This is known as source NAT , or SNAT .
OUTPUT Network address translation for packets generated by the firewall .
( Rarely used in SOHO environments )
Mangle TCP header modification PREROUTING POSTROUTING OUTPUT INPUT FORWARD
Modification of the TCP packet quality of service bits before routing occurs .
( Rarely used in SOHO environments )
You need to specify the table and the chain for each firewall rule you create .
There is an exception :
Most rules are related to filtering , so iptables assumes that any chain that 's defined without an associated table will be a part of the filter table .
The filter table is therefore the default .
To help make this clearer , take a look at the way packets are handled by iptables .
In Figure 14.1 a TCP packet from the Internet arrives at the firewall 's interface on Network A to create a data connection .
The packet is first examined by your rules in the mangle table 's PREROUTING chain , if any .
It is then inspected by the rules in the nat table 's PREROUTING chain to see whether the packet requires DNAT .
It is then routed .
If the packet is destined for a protected network , then it is filtered by the rules in the FORWARD chain of the filter table and , if necessary , the packet undergoes SNAT in the POSTROUTING chain before arriving at Network B .
When the destination server decides to reply , the packet undergoes the same sequence of steps .
Both the FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains may be configured to implement quality of service ( QoS ) features in their mangle tables , but this is not usually done in SOHO environments .
If the packet is destined for the firewall itself , then it passes through the mangle table of the INPUT chain , if configured , before being filtered by the rules in the INPUT chain of the filter table before .
If it successfully passes these tests then it is processed by the intended application on the firewall .
At some point , the firewall needs to reply .
This reply is routed and inspected by the rules in the OUTPUT chain of the mangle table , if any .
Next , the rules in the OUTPUT chain of the nat table determine whether DNAT is required and the rules in the OUTPUT chain of the filter table are then inspected to help restrict unauthorized packets .
Finally , before the packet is sent back to the Internet , SNAT and QoS mangling is done by the POSTROUTING chain
Figure 14 - 1 Iptables Packet Flow Diagram
It is now time to discuss the ways in which you add rules to these chains .
Targets And Jumps
Each firewall rule inspects each IP packet and then tries to identify it as the target of some sort of operation .
Once a target is identified , the packet needs to jump over to it for further processing .
Table 14.2 lists the built - in targets that iptables uses .
Table 14 - 2 Descriptions Of The Most Commonly Used Targets
target Desciption Most Common Options ACCEPT iptables stops further processing .
The packet is handed over to the end application or the operating system for processing N/A DROP iptables stops further processing .
The packet is blocked N/A LOG
The packet information is sent to the syslog daemon for logging
iptables continues processing with the next rule in the table
As you can't log and drop at the same time , it is common to have two similar rules in sequence .
The first will log the packet , the second will drop it .
-- log-prefix " string "
Tells iptables to prefix all log messages with a user defined string .
Frequently used to tell why the logged packet was dropped REJECT Works like the DROP target , but will also return an error message to the host sending the packet that the packet was blocked -- reject - with qualifier
The qualifier tells what type of reject message is returned .
Qualifiers include : icmp-port - unreachable ( default ) icmp-net - unreachable icmp-host - unreachable icmp-proto - unreachable icmp-net - prohibited icmp-host - prohibited tcp-reset echo- reply DNAT Used to do destination network address translation .
ie. rewriting the destination IP address of the packet -- to - destination ipaddress Tells iptables what the destination IP address should be SNAT Used to do source network address translation rewriting the source IP address of the packet
rewriting the source IP address of the packet
The source IP address is user defined -- to - source < address > [ -< address > ] [ :< port >-< port > ]
Specifies the source IP address and ports to be used by SNAT .
MASQUERADE Used to do Source Network Address Translation .
By default the source IP address is the same as that used by the firewall 's interface [ -- to - ports < port > [ -< port > ] ]
Specifies the range of source ports to which the original source port can be mapped .
Important Iptables Command Switch Operations
Each line of an iptables script not only has a jump , but they also have a number of command line options that are used to append rules to chains that match your defined packet characteristics , such the source IP address and TCP port .
There are also options that can be used to just clear a chain so you can start all over again .
Tables 14.2 through 14.6 list the most common options .
Table 14 - 2 General Iptables Match Criteria
iptables command Switch Desciption -t <- table ->
If you do n't specify a table , then the filter table is assumed .
As discussed before , the possible built - in tables include : filter , nat , mangle -j < target >
Jump to the specified target chain when the packet matches the current rule .
- A
Append rule to end of a chain -F Flush .
Deletes all the rules in the selected table - p < protocol - type >
Match protocol .
Types include , icmp , tcp , udp , and all -s < ip - address >
Match source IP address -d < ip - address >
Match destination IP address - i < interface - name >
Match " input " interface on which the packet enters .
-o < interface - name >
Match " output " interface on which the packet exits
In this command switches example
iptables -A INPUT -s 0/0 - i eth0 -d 192.168.1.1 -p TCP -j ACCEPT
iptables is being configured to allow the firewall to accept TCP packets coming in on interface eth0 from any IP address destined for the firewall 's IP address of 192.168.1.1 .
The 0/0 representation of an IP address means any .
Table 14 - 4 Common TCP and UDP Match Criteria
Switch Desciption - p tcp -- sport < port > TCP source port .
Can be a single value or a range in the format : start - port - number : end - port - number - p tcp -- dport < port > TCP destination port .
Can be a single value or a range in the format : starting - port : ending - port -p tcp -- syn Used to identify a new TCP connection request .
!
-- syn means , not a new connection request - p udp -- sport < port > UDP source port .
Can be a single value or a range in the format : starting - port : ending - port - p udp -- dport < port > UDP destination port .
Can be a single value or a range in the format : starting - port: ending - port
In this example :
iptables -A FORWARD -s 0/0 - i eth0 -d 192.168.1.58 -o eth1 -p TCP \ -- sport 1024:65535 -- dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables is being configured to allow the firewall to accept TCP packets for routing when they enter on interface eth0 from any IP address and are destined for an IP address of 192.168.1.58 that is reachable via interface eth1 .
The source port is in the range 1024 to 65535 and the destination port is port 80 ( www /http ) .
Table 14 - 5 Common ICMP ( Ping ) Match Criteria
Matches used with --- icmp - type Desciption -- icmp - type < type >
The most commonly used types are echo-reply and echo- request
In this example :
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -- icmp - type echo- request -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT - p icmp -- icmp - type echo-reply -j ACCEPT
iptables is being configured to allow the firewall to send ICMP echo - requests ( pings ) and in turn , accept the expected ICMP echo - replies .
Consider another example
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -- icmp - type echo- request \ -m limit -- limit 1/s - i eth0 -j ACCEPT
The limit feature in iptables specifies the maximum average number of matches to allow per second .
You can specify time intervals in the format / second , / minute , / hour , or / day , or you can use abbreviations so that 3 / second is the same as 3/s .
In this example , ICMP echo requests are restricted to no more than one per second .
When tuned correctly , this feature allows you to filter unusually high volumes of traffic that characterize denial of service ( DOS ) attacks and Internet worms .
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -- syn -m limit -- limit 5/s - i eth0 -j ACCEPT
You can expand on the limit feature of iptables to reduce your vulnerability to certain types of denial of service attack .
Here a defense for SYN flood attacks was created by limiting the acceptance of TCP segments with the SYN bit set to no more than five per second .
Table 14 - 6 Common Extended Match Criteria
Switch Desciption -m multiport -- sports < port , port >
A variety of TCP / UDP source ports separated by commas .
Unlike when -m is n't used , they do not have to be within a range .
-m multiport -- dports < port , port >
A variety of TCP / UDP destination ports separated by commas .
Unlike when -m is n't used , they do not have to be within a range .
-m multiport -- ports < port , port >
A variety of TCP / UDP ports separated by commas .
Source and destination ports are assumed to be the same and they do not have to be within a range .
-m -- state < state >
The most frequently tested states are : ESTABLISHED :
The packet is part of a connection that has seen packets in both directions NEW :
The packet is the start of a new connection RELATED :
The packet is starting a new secondary connection .
This is a common feature of such protocols such as an FTP data transfer , or an ICMP error .
INVALID : The packet could n't be identified .
Could be due to insufficient system resources , or ICMP errors that do n't match an existing data flow .
This is an expansion on the previous example :
iptables -A FORWARD -s 0/0 - i eth0 -d 192.168.1.58 -o eth1 -p TCP \ -- sport 1024:65535 - m multiport -- dports 80,443 -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -d 0/0 - o eth0 -s 192.168.1.58 - i eth1 -p TCP \ -m state -- state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
Here iptables is being configured to allow the firewall to accept TCP packets to be routed when they enter on interface eth0 from any IP address destined for IP address of 192.168.1.58 that is reachable via interface eth1 .
The source port is in the range 1024 to 65535 and the destination ports are port 80 ( www /http ) and 443 ( https ) .
The return packets from 192.168.1.58 are allowed to be accepted too .
Instead of stating the source and destination ports , you can simply allow packets related to established connections using the -m state and -- state ESTABLISHED options .
Using User Defined Chains
As you may remember , you can configure iptables to have user - defined chains .
This feature is frequently used to help streamline the processing of packets .
For example , instead of using a single , built - in chain for all protocols , you can use the chain to determine the protocol type for the packet and then hand off the actual final processing to a user - defined , protocol - specific chain in the filter table .
In other words , you can replace a long chain with a stubby main chain pointing to multiple stubby chains , thereby shortening the total length of all chains the packet has to pass through .
For example
iptables -A INPUT - i eth0 -d 206.229.110.2 -j fast - input - queue iptables -A OUTPUT - o eth0 -s 206.229.110.2 -j fast - output - queue iptables - A fast - input - queue -p icmp -j icmp-queue - in iptables - A fast - output - queue -p icmp -j icmp-queue - out iptables - A icmp - queue - out - p icmp - - icmp - type echo - request \ -m state -- state NEW -j ACCEPT iptables - A icmp-queue - in - p icmp -- icmp - type echo- reply -j ACCEPT
Here six queues help assist in improving processing speed .
Table 14.7 summarizes the function of each .
Table 14.7 Custom Queues Example Listing
Chain Desciption INPUT
The regular built - in INPUT chain in iptables OUTPUT
The regular built - in OUTPUT chain in iptables fast - input - queue Input chain dedicated to identifying specific protocols and shunting the packets to protocol specific chains .

icmp-queue - out Output queue dedicated to ICMP icmp-queue - in Input queue dedicated to ICMP
Saving and Restoring Your iptables Scripts
The iptables - save command outputs the content of your configuration to your screen or STOUT .
By redirecting this output to a file , you can later use the iptables - restore command to use this data and revert iptables to the original configuration when the iptables - save command was run .
When the iptables daemon starts it tests for the existence of the /etc / sysconfig / iptables file which it uses as its default configuration .
It expects this file to have the format of the output of the iptables - save command .
Therefore to save your configuration so that it survives your next reboot and is activated , you need to redirect the output of the iptables - save command to this file , like this :
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # iptables - save >
/etc/sysconfig/iptables
The format of the /etc / sysconfig / iptables file is slightly different from that of the scripts shown in this chapter .
The initialization of built - in chains is automatic and the string " iptables " is omitted from the rule statements .
Here is a sample / etc / sysconfig / iptables configuration that allows ICMP , IPSec ( ESP and AH packets ) , already established connections , and inbound SSH .
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # cat /etc/sysconfig / iptables # Generated by iptables - save v1.2.9 on Mon Nov 8 11:00:07 2004 * filter :INPUT ACCEPT [ 0:0 ] : FORWARD ACCEPT [ 0:0 ] :OUTPUT ACCEPT [ 144:12748 ] : RH - Firewall -1-INPUT - [ 0:0 ] - A INPUT -j RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-A FORWARD -j RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-A RH-Firewall -1-INPUT
-i lo -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p icmp -m icmp --icmp- type 255 -j ACCEPT -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p ah -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT -m state -- state RELATED , ESTABLISHED
-j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p tcp -m state -- state NEW -m tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT -A RH-Firewall -1-INPUT
-j REJECT -- reject - with icmp-host - prohibited COMMIT # Completed on Mon Nov 8 11:00:07 2004 [ root@bigboy tmp ] #
It is never a good idea to edit this script directly because it is always overwritten by the iptables - save command and it does n't save any comments at all , which can also make it extremely difficult to follow .
For these reasons , you 're better off writing and applying a customized script and then using the iptables - save command to make the changes permanent .
Here is an example of how to manually restore your configuration using the iptables - restore command .
In this case we are restoring from the /etc / sysconfig / iptables file .
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # iptables - restore -c < /etc/sysconfig/iptables
Sometimes the script you created to generate iptables rules may get corrupted or lost , or you might inherit a new system from an administer and cannot find the original script used to protect it .
In these situations , you can use the iptables - save and iptables - restore commands to assist you with the continued management of the server .
Fedora 's iptables Rule Generator
Fedora comes with a program called lokkit that you can use to generate a very rudimentary firewall rule set .
It prompts for the level of security and then gives you the option of doing simple customizations .
It is a good place for beginners to start on a test system so that they can see a general rule structure .
Like the service iptables save command , lokkit saves the firewall rules in a new / etc / sysconfig / iptables file for use on the next reboot .
Once you have become familiar with the iptables syntax , it 's best to write scripts that you can comment and then save it to /etc / sysconfig / iptables .
It makes them much more manageable and readable .
Recovering From A Lost Script
Sometimes the script you created to generate iptables rules may get corrupted or lost , or you might inherit a new system from an administer and cannot find the original script used to protect it .
In these situations , you can use the iptables - save and iptables - restore commands to assist you with the continued management of the server .
Unlike the service iptables save command , which actually saves a permanent copy of the firewall 's active configuration in the /etc / sysconfig / iptables file , iptables - save displays the active configuration to the screen in /etc / sysconfig / iptables format .
If you redirect the iptables - save screen output to a file with the > symbol , then you can edit the output and reload the updated rules when they meet your new criteria with the iptables - restore command .
This example exports the iptables - save output to a text file named firewall - config .
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # iptables - save > firewall - config [ root@bigboy tmp ] # cat firewall - config # Generated by iptables - save v1.2.9 on Mon Nov 8 11:00:07 2004 * filter :INPUT ACCEPT [ 0:0 ] : FORWARD ACCEPT [ 0:0 ] :OUTPUT ACCEPT [ 144:12748 ] : RH - Firewall -1-INPUT - [ 0:0 ] - A INPUT -j RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-A FORWARD -j RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-A RH-Firewall -1-INPUT
-i lo -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p icmp -m icmp --icmp- type 255 -j ACCEPT -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p ah -j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT -m state -- state RELATED , ESTABLISHED
-j ACCEPT -A RH - Firewall -1-INPUT
-p tcp -m state -- state NEW -m tcp -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT -A RH-Firewall -1-INPUT
-j REJECT -- reject - with icmp-host - prohibited COMMIT # Completed on Mon Nov 8 11:00:07 2004 [ root@bigboy tmp ] #
After editing the firewall - config file with the commands you need , you can reload it into the active firewall rule set with the iptables - restore command .
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # iptables - restore < firewall - config
Finally , you should permanently save the active configuration so that it will be loaded automatically when the system reboots :
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # service iptables save
If desired , you can eventually convert this firewall - config file into a regular iptables script so that it becomes more easily recognizable and manageable .
Loading Kernel Modules Needed
By iptables
The iptables application requires you to load certain kernel modules to activate some of its functions .
Whenever any type of NAT is required , the iptable_nat module needs to be loaded .
The ip_conntrack_ftp module needs to be added for FTP support and should always be loaded with the ip_conntrack module which tracks TCP connection states .
As most scripts probably will keep track of connection states , the ip_conntrack module will be needed in any case .
The ip_nat_ftp module also needs to be loaded for FTP servers behind a NAT firewall .
Unfortunately , the /etc / sysconfig / iptables file does n't support the loading of modules , so you 'll have to add the statements to your / etc/rc.local file which is run at the end of every reboot .
The script samples in this chapter include these statements only as a reminder to place them in the /etc/rc.local file
# File : /etc/rc.local # Module to track the state of connections modprobe ip_conntrack #
Load the iptables active FTP module , requires ip_conntrack modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp # Load iptables NAT module when required modprobe iptable_nat # Module required for active an FTP server using NAT modprobe ip_nat_ftp
Sample iptables Scripts
This section provides some sample scripts you can use to get iptables working for you .
Pay special attention to the logging example at the end .
The basic initialization script snippet should also be included in all your scripts to ensure the correct initialization of your chains should you decide to restart your script after startup .
This chapter also includes other snippets that will help you get basic functionality .
It should be a good guide to get you started .
Note :
Once you feel more confident , you can use Appendix II " Codes , Scripts , and Configurations " , to find detailed scripts .
The appendix shows you how to allow your firewall to :
Be used as a Linux Web , mail and DNS server
Be the NAT router for your home network
Prevent various types of attacks using corrupted TCP , UDP and ICMP packets .
Provide outbound passive FTP access from the firewall
There are also simpler code snippets in the Appendix II " Codes , Scripts , and Configurations " , for Inbound and outbound FTP connections to and from your firewall
Basic Operating System Defense
You can do several things before employing your firewall script to improve the resilience of your firewall to attack .
For example , the Linux operating system has a number of built - in protection mechanisms that you should activate by modifying the system kernel parameters in the / proc filesystem via the /etc/sysctl.conf file .
Using of /etc/sysctl.conf to modify kernel parameters is explained in more detail in , Appendix I " Miscellaneous Linux Topics " .
Here is a sample configuration :
# File : /etc/sysctl.conf
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Disable routing triangulation .
Respond to queries out # the same interface , not another .
Helps to maintain state #
Also protects against IP spoofing #---------------------------------------------------------------
net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

#
Enable logging of packets with malformed IP addresses #---------------------------------------------------------------
net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians

# Disable redirects
#---------------------------------------------------------------
net/ipv4/conf/all/send_redirects

#
Disable source routed packets
#---------------------------------------------------------------
net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route

= 1 #---------------------------------------------------------------
# Enable IP routing .
Required if your firewall is protecting a # network , NAT included #--------------------------------------------------------------- net/ipv4/ip_forward = 1
Advanced iptables Initialization
You may also want to add some more advanced initialization steps to your script , including checks for Internet traffic from RFC1918 private addresses .
The sample script snippet below outlines how to do this .
More complex initializations would include checks for attacks using invalid TCP flags and directed broadcasts which are beyond the scope of this book .
The script also uses multiple user - defined chains to make the script shorter and faster as the chains can be repeatedly accessed .
This removes the need to repeat the same statements over and over again .
You can take even more precautions to further protect your network .
The complete firewall script in Appendix II " Codes , Scripts , and Configurations " , outlines most of them .

Allowing DNS Access To Your Firewall
You 'll almost certainly want your firewall to make DNS queries to the Internet .
This is not because it is required for the basic functionality of the firewall , but because of Fedora Linux 's yum RPM updater which will help to keep the server up to date with the latest security patches .
The following statements will apply not only for firewalls acting as DNS clients but also for firewalls working in a caching or regular DNS server role .
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow outbound DNS queries from the FW and the replies too # # -
Interface eth0 is the internet interface # #
Zone transfers use TCP and not UDP .
Most home networks # / websites using a single DNS server wo n't require TCP statements #
#--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -o eth0 -- dport 53 -- sport 1024:65535 \ -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p udp - i eth0 -- sport 53 -- dport 1024:65535 \ -j ACCEPT
Allowing WWW And SSH Access To Your Firewall
This sample snippet is for a firewall that doubles as a web server that is managed remotely by its system administrator via secure shell ( SSH ) sessions .
Inbound packets destined for ports 80 and 22 are allowed thereby making the first steps in establishing a connection .
It is n't necessary to specify these ports for the return leg as outbound packets for all established connections are allowed .
Connections initiated by persons logged into the Web server will be denied as outbound NEW connection packets are n't allowed .
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow previously established connections # - Interface eth0 is the internet interface #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -m state -- state ESTABLISHED , RELATED \ -j ACCEPT
#---------------------------------------------------------------
# Allow port 80 ( www ) and 22 ( SSH ) connections to the firewall #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A INPUT -p tcp - i eth0 -- dport 22 -- sport 1024:65535 \ -m state -- state NEW -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT - p tcp - i eth0 -- dport 80 -- sport 1024:65535 \ -m state -- state NEW -j ACCEPT
Allowing Your Firewall To Access The Internet
This iptables script enables a user on the firewall to use a Web browser to surf the Internet .
HTTP traffic uses TCP port 80 , and HTTPS uses port 443 .
Note : HTTPS ( secure HTTP ) is used for credit card transactions frequently , as well as by RedHat Linux servers running up2date .
FTP and HTTP are frequently used with yum .
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow port 80 ( www ) and 443 ( https ) connections from the firewall #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m state \ -- state NEW , ESTABLISHED , RELATED
-o eth0 -p tcp \ -m multiport -- dports 80,443 -- sport 1024:65535 #---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow previously established connections # - Interface eth0 is the internet interface #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -m state -- state ESTABLISHED , RELATED \ -i eth0 -p tcp
If you want all TCP traffic originating from the firewall to be accepted , then remove the line :
- m multiport -- dports 80,443 -- sport 1024:65535
Allow Your Home Network To Access The Firewall
In this example , eth1 is directly connected to a home network using IP addresses from the 192.168.1.0 network .
All traffic between this network and the firewall is simplistically assumed to be trusted and allowed .
Further rules will be needed for the interface connected to the Internet to allow only specific ports , types of connections and possibly even remote servers to have access to your firewall and home network .
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow all bidirectional traffic from your firewall to the # protected network # - Interface eth1 is the private network interface #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p all -s 192.168.1.0/24 - i eth1 iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -p all -d 192.168.1.0/24 -o eth1
Masquerading ( Many to One NAT )
As explained in Chapter 2 , " Introduction to Networking " , masquerading is another name for what many call many to one NAT .
In other words , traffic from all devices on one or more protected networks will appear as if it originated from a single IP address on the Internet side of the firewall .
Note :
The masquerade IP address always defaults to the IP address of the firewall 's main interface .
The advantage of this is that you never have to specify the NAT IP address .
This makes it much easier to configure iptables NAT with DHCP .
You can configure many to one NAT to an IP alias , using the POSTROUTING and not the MASQUERADE statement .
An example of this can be seen in the static NAT section that follows .
Keep in mind that iptables requires the iptables_nat module to be loaded with the modprobe command for the masquerade feature to work .
Masquerading also depends on the Linux operating system being configured to support routing between the internet and private network interfaces of the firewall .
This is done by enabling IP forwarding or routing by giving the file / proc / sys / net / ipv4 / ip_forward the value 1 as opposed to the default disabled value of 0 .
Once masquerading has been achieved using the POSTROUTING chain of the nat table , you will have to configure iptables to allow packets to flow between the two interfaces .
To do this , use the FORWARD chain of the filter table .
More specifically , packets related to NEW and ESTABLISHED connections will be allowed outbound to the Internet , but only packets related to ESTABLISHED connections will be allowed inbound .
This helps to protect the home network from anyone trying to initiate connections from the Internet :

#

This value will not be retained in the #
/ etc /sysconfig / iptables file .

#--------------------------------------------------------------- echo 1 > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Allow masquerading # -
Interface eth0 is the internet interface # - Interface eth1 is the private network interface #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o eth0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 0/0 \ -j MASQUERADE
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Prior to masquerading , the packets are routed via the filter # table 's FORWARD chain .
# Allowed outbound : New , established and related connections # Allowed inbound : Established and related connections
#--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A FORWARD -t filter -o eth0 -m state \ -- state NEW , ESTABLISHED , RELATED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -t filter - i eth0 -m state \ -- state ESTABLISHED , RELATED -j ACCEPT
Note :
If you configure your firewall to do masquerading , then if should be the used as the default gateway for all your servers on the network .
Port Forwarding Type NAT ( DHCP DSL )
In many cases home users may get a single DHCP public IP address from their ISPs .
If a Linux firewall is also your interface to the Internet and you want to host a Web site on one of the NAT protected home servers , then you will have to use port forwarding .
Here the combination of the firewall 's single IP address , the remote server 's IP address , and the source / destination port of the traffic can be used to uniquely identify a traffic flow .
All traffic that matches a particular combination of these factors may then be forwarded to a single server on the private network .
Port forwarding is handled by the PREROUTING chain of the nat table .
As in masquerading , the iptables_nat module has to be loaded and routing has to be enabled for port forwarding to work .
Routing too must be allowed in iptables with the FORWARD chain , this includes all NEW inbound connections from the Internet matching the port forwarding port plus all future packets related to the ESTABLISHED connection in both directions :
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Load the NAT module # # Note :
It is best to use the /etc/rc.local example in this # chapter .

#--------------------------------------------------------------- modprobe iptable_nat #--------------------------------------------------------------- #
Get the IP address of the Internet interface eth0 ( linux only ) # #
You 'll have to use a different expression to get the IP address # for other operating systems which have a different ifconfig output # or enter the IP address manually in the PREROUTING statement # #
This is best when your firewall gets its IP address using DHCP .
#
The external IP address could just be hard coded ( " typed in # normally " )
#--------------------------------------------------------------- external_int = " eth0 " external_ip= " `ifconfig $ external_int | grep ' inet addr ' | \ awk '{print $ 2} ' | sed -e 's/.*://'` "

#
After DNAT , the packets are routed via the filter table 's # FORWARD chain .
# Connections on port 80 to the target machine on the private # network must be allowed .
#--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp - i eth0 -o eth1 -d 192.168.1.200 \ -- dport 8080 -- sport 1024:65535 - m state -- state NEW -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -t filter -o eth0 -m state \ -- state NEW , ESTABLISHED , RELATED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -t filter - i eth0 -m state \ -- state ESTABLISHED , RELATED -j ACCEPT
Static NAT
In this example , all traffic to a particular public IP address , not just to a particular port , is translated to a single server on the protected subnet .
Because the firewall has more than one IP address , I can't recommend MASQUERADE ; it will force masquerading as the IP address of the primary interface and not as any of the alias IP addresses the firewall may have .
Instead , use SNAT to specify the alias IP address to be used for connections initiated by all other servers in the protected network .
Note : Although the nat table NATs all traffic to the target servers ( 192.168.1.100 to 102 ) , only connections on ports 80,443 and 22 are allowed through by the FORWARD chain .
Also notice how you have to specify a separate -m multiport option whenever you need to match multiple non-sequential ports for both source and destination .
In this example the firewall :
Uses one to one NAT to make the server 192.168.1.100 on your home network appear on the Internet as IP addresses 97.158.253.26 .
Creates a many to one NAT for the 192.168.1.0 home network in which all the servers appear on the Internet as IP address 97.158.253.29 .
This is different from masquerading
You will have to create alias IP addresses for each of these Internet IPs for one to one NAT to work .

Troubleshooting iptables
A number of tools are at your disposal for troubleshooting iptables firewall scripts .
One of the best methods is to log all dropped packets to the / var / log / messages file .
Checking The Firewall Logs
You track packets passing through the iptables list of rules using the LOG target .
You should be aware that the LOG target :
Logs all traffic that matches the iptables rule in which it is located .
Automatically writes an entry to the / var / log / messages file and then executes the next rule .
If you want to log only unwanted traffic , therefore , you have to add a matching rule with a DROP target immediately after the LOG rule .
If you do n't , you 'll find yourself logging both desired and unwanted traffic with no way of discerning between the two , because by default iptables does n't state why the packet was logged in its log message .
This example logs a summary of failed packets to the file / var / log / messages .
You can use the contents of this file to determine which TCP / UDP ports you need to open to provide access to specific traffic that is currently stopped .
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#
Log and drop all other packets to file / var / log / messages #
Without this we could be crawling around in the dark #--------------------------------------------------------------- iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOG iptables -A INPUT -j LOG iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -j DROP iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP
Here are some examples of the output of this file :
Firewall denies replies to DNS queries ( UDP port 53 ) destined to server 192.168.1.102 on the home network .

The traffic in all these examples is n't destined for the firewall ;
Therefore , you should check your INPUT , OUTPUT , FORWARD , and NAT related statements .
If the firewall 's IP address is involved , then you should focus on the INPUT and OUTPUT statements
If nothing shows up in the logs , then follow the steps in Chapter 4 , " Simple Network Troubleshooting " , to determine whether the data is reaching your firewall at all and , if it is not , the location on your network that could be causing the problem .
As a general rule , you wo n't be able to access the public NAT IP addresses from servers on your home network .
Basic NAT testing requires you to ask a friend to try to connect to your home network from the Internet .
You can then use the logging output in / var / log / messages to make sure that the translations are occurring correctly and iptables is n't dropping the packets after translation occurs .
iptables Wo n't Start
The iptables startup script expects to find the /etc / sysconfig / iptables before it starts .
If none exists , then symptoms include the firewall status always being " inactive " .
An easy way fix this is to simply create the file using the touch command and then using chmod to give the file the correct permissions .
Starting iptables should be successful after this .
[ root@bigboy tmp ] # touch /etc/sysconfig / iptables [ root@bigboy tmp ] # chmod 600 /etc/sysconfig/iptables [ root@bigboy tmp ] # systemctl start iptables .
service [ root@bigboy tmp ] # systemctl status iptables.

Conclusion
A firewall is a critical part of any establishment that connects to an unprotected network such as the Internet , but a firewall is never sufficient .
Web site security involves not just protection from corrupted packets or maliciously overwhelming volumes of traffic , but also involves daily data backups to help recovery from device failures , regular application patching , enforced password policies , restricted and monitored physical access to your servers , reliable power and cooling , secured cabling , redundant hardware , and , probably most importantly , well trained and motivated employees .
Security should be viewed as anything that contributes to the desired risk - free functioning of your site , and it is well worth the money to invest in and learn from a book that specializes in the topic .
Cash - squeezed privately held companies are facing another threat in this struggling economy : rising employee fraud .
Employee fraud -- from check - forgery schemes to petty - cash theft -- tends to rise during tough economic times , when workers are feeling financial pressure in their personal lives , experts say .
And small companies are especially vulnerable because they often lack stringent internal controls to prevent fraud .
Sometimes , managers at affected companies attribute lost funds to lower sales -- never even suspecting ...
The LORD spoke to Moses , saying :
Make two silver trumpets ;
you shall make them of hammered work ;
and you shall use them for summoning the congregation ,
and for breaking camp .
Numbers 10 : 1 - 2 NRSV
I was dipped below the waters of Fruitland Baptist Church in a baptismal backed by a brightly colored , tropical river scene — palm trees lining the banks and clear blue water meandering further and thinner into the horizon .
Brother Mike said to trust his hold on my forearm and let him lower me , backwards , into the lukewarm water before pulling me up and out .
But when he bent me back , in front of nearly a hundred people on that Sunday morning , my right foot stepped to catch my weight , afraid my arching body was going to fall .
I knew Mike would n’t drop me and I was n’t scared of water , but my leg reached back and planted , just in case .
When Mike lifted my 12 - year - old torso back into the Sunday morning air , the robe clung to my body , and I felt self - conscious of the water in my nose and dripping down my face .
I felt embarrassed to have stepped back instead of letting my body fall slowly and freely into the water .
But when I wiped the water from my eyes , the church clapped and I stood before “ amens ” hollered from the congregation below .
No one seemed to have noticed my misstep , and I left the baptismal to change into the dry clothes waiting in a plastic bag in the pastor ’s office .
As a small child , I had sat in the wooden pews of that church and stared at the painted scene behind the baptismal .
The pastel river was the backdrop to every Sunday — higher than the pulpit , higher than the choir — and I wondered where it ended , if it ended .
The next Monday at school , sitting in 7th grade band class , Adam Pressley asked me if , since I ’d been baptized , I planned to stop cussing .
Adam and I both played trumpet , and I ’d known him since I could remember : his family too came to Fruitland .
I cleared the condensation from my trumpet by blowing soundless air through the mouthpiece and opening the water key , glancing sidelong at the new girl playing clarinet , and finally replied , “ Hell no . ”
*
While there was something a little exciting the next year about sitting , hidden , in the church sanctuary ’s wing instead of with the rest of the congregation in the wooden pews , it was mostly a guilt - driven feeling of duty that sat me in that padded chair with my trumpet on my knee .
I was 14 , nearly in high school , and I felt I ought to be part of the newly - formed Fruitland Baptist Orchestra because everyone who could play an instrument was .
There were seven of us .
Adam and I sat in the back with our trumpets , and luckily for us , a more talented man sat in front of us with his trumpet , meaning Adam and I could simply move our fingers up and down with the trumpet ’s keys without actually making any sound .
Along with we three trumpets , there were also a couple trombones , a clarinet , and a flute .
We played as everyone sang the hymns on Sunday mornings , but during the offertory — when money is collected — we played all alone , without the cover of a congregation of voices .
I did n’t like the trumpet .
In sixth grade , the trumpet seemed exciting , and I remember walking the dirt road from the school bus to Grandma ’s one afternoon , when the apple trees were heavy with fruit , and blowing with all of my might to blare any sound from it .
It sounded as I imagined a dying moose might , but I kept blowing and blowing until something resembling a clean note erupted .
Yet by the end of middle school I wanted nothing to do with the golden beast .
It was no longer cool to be in band class , and I was tired of tightening my lips and cleaning the condensation and spit from it .
So I sat in the back of the Fruitland Orchestra and played softly or not at all .
There were , however , occasional Sunday mornings in which I did try to hit the 2nd - trumpet notes of hymns like “ How Great Thou Art ” and “ Power in the Blood , ” but when an off - key bleep came from the wing , it was likely Adam or I , and I ’d then resort to faking it .
*
My family ’s line had attended Fruitland since it was built in 1875 .
Grandma ran the kitchen .
Granddaddy was the Sunday School director .
Daddy was a deacon ;
Mom ran the nursery .
Aunt Rhonda directed the choir .
Uncle Tim gave the morning announcements .
It was a church of families , a place where everyone knew everyone because it was a brick building in the middle of a small apple - farming community in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina .
It was a place where opening prayers thanked God for much - needed rains and women left right at noon so the beans did n’t burn .
I grew up within those walls , singing in the youth choir and competing in Bible drills .
So when I said “ hell no ” to Adam in band class I felt strange .
My parents did n’t really cuss , and while tossing damn and ass into sentences made me feel a sturdier part of my middle school world , the words still felt fraudulent falling from my mouth .
My hell that morning had quite a bit to do with the new , pretty Kathleen Hatcher playing clarinet , and assuring I was still in .
But I also did n’t feel much different after my dip that Sunday .
I believed in it .
I believed in God and that Jesus , somehow , could fill someone and change a life , but I did n’t know what it looked or felt like to have Jesus seep into my adolescent heart .
I was taught that baptism meant more than commitment : it signified an entering .
Still I was n’t sure that I ’d felt or noticed what I should have .
I did set myself to some changes — changes that would n’t undermine the work I ’d done for popularity , but changes nonetheless .
I started to live my life within the goods and bads I gathered from the youth group at Fruitland .
I did n’t drink alcohol or smoke marijuana because those things were bad ; I went to church on Sunday and was respectful because that was good .
I tried to align my life with what I believed the Bible taught to be right and wrong .
I did n’t usually consider my motives or the reasons behind the goods and bads , but I attempted to live within a code that seemed to be the Christian way .
*
In high school I donated my trumpet to the church , hoping someone else would play it .
I had retired from trumpet playing and surely had no more plans to lift the metal mouthpiece to my lips on Sundays .
While I went to Fruitland on Sunday mornings and sat in its pews with my family , I had started attending Sunday evening services at a larger church in town with friends from high school .
Mud Creek ’s evening service was called X - Treme Life , and it was only for high schoolers .
One of my friends played bass in the loud , exciting worship band and teenagers from all of the area high schools came : it certainly felt like the place to be .
X - Treme Life invited people to raise their hands and sway to simple songs projected on huge screens beside ten - foot speakers ; the music was hip — there were no trumpets or organs — and the speaker wore a t - shirt and made jokes .
For all intents and purposes , X - Treme Life was plain fun .
And passionate .
People danced and sang loudly , and this , they said , was worship .
At Fruitland , worship meant the entire service — the prayer and the sermon , the orchestra ’s playing and the shaking of hands during the “ fellowshippin ’ time ” — but at Mud Creek , worship meant music .
It meant closed eyes and dynamic songs rising and falling , bouncing off the walls of the church ’s gymnasium .
I wondered why Fruitland did n’t incite such passion .
This was the same Jesus in the songs , and even though Susy Rollins sometimes rocked her head from side to side during a country - western - sounding choir song on Sunday mornings , no one jumped or clapped or seemed to approach music as a way to meet God , face to face .
At Fruitland we sang and sat back down ; at Mud Creek we sang and kept singing .
I did n’t leave Fruitland completely .
I was there every Sunday morning , but the hymns and suits and ties started to feel distant and empty .
I sat in the pews , waiting for Sunday nights , when I would head to Mud Creek in a t - shirt to sing and laugh and listen to loud rock music .
I wished the people at Fruitland could engage God as I did , beside young people and bright stage lights .

Brother Mike decided that Fruitland should have an early service on Sunday mornings , a more contemporary and casual service before the normal worship meeting , and he asked me to lead the music .
There would be no organ or choir or trumpets : only me and my guitar , and I was to lead the congregation in the songs I ’d learned from X - Treme Life .
Even though there were no skits or games , Mike did n’t plan to wear a suit and the service was to be shaped for a younger audience .
I ’d started playing the guitar a few years prior .
My parents agreed to buy me a used acoustic Epiphone from a pawnshop .
I had plans to form a band , to be on a stage , or at least a stool in a coffee shop .
I even imagined myself on the stage at X - Treme Life , as I sat in my room contorting my hand into the chords of popular songs —
Oasis and Counting Crows .
For the early service at Fruitland , I projected the words to the worship songs on a sheet that Dad helped me hang over the baptismal , hiding the tropical river from view .
I asked the congregation to stand as I played my guitar energetically , but they had a hard time learning the words and following the songs .
Despite Mike ’s intentions , the early service largely attracted senior citizens , who especially liked the 8:30 a.m. time .
The younger members of the church slept and showed up for the normal , traditional service .
Most Sunday mornings , elderly faces who preferred to sit , trying to catch the lyrics to the fast - paced songs , stared back at me as I sang “ Lord I Lift Your Name On High ” alone .
After a few months , we canceled the early service , and I took my guitar and left home for college .
*
In college I stumbled into a group called InterVarsity .
They met in one of the university ’s cafeterias after it closed , and when I stood in the back that first Tuesday night , I heard songs I recognized from X - Treme life .
Over 200 college students gathered in the room to sing along with a small acoustic band , play games , and listen to a short , hip talk about relationships , filled with TV clips and stories , from a young speaker .
The meeting was smaller and not as organized or flashy as X - Treme life , but everyone sang loudly and swayed or danced .
I came back the next week , and eventually I started playing in the worship band .
Since I knew many of the songs , and since they mostly consisted of only three chords , I played along with my guitar , filling in simple licks to enrich the tunes .
At the end of the year , InterVarsity asked me to lead the worship team for the upcoming year .
I agreed .
While IV ’s meetings were entertaining and trendy , they meandered along and often seemed to simply wander from skit to music to speaker without any transitions or turns .
I saw quite a bit of room for improvement , and as newly appointed worship leader , I formed a full band - drums , keyboard , bass , electric and acoustic guitars - and found a garage for our weekly practices .
We learned the songs without any need for sheet music , and integrated various moves to make the songs tighter and more dynamic — key changes , solos , crescendos .
As worship leader , I was the front man .
I sang and chose the songs ; I decided when the music slowed or built or ended .
The first IV meeting of the year proved to be a musical success .
The songs were tightly orchestrated and people seemed to engage them head - on , singing loudly and moving with the drums and bass .
I dropped the music off completely for our final song , leaving only the voices hanging , singing the chorus once more a cappella .
The lights slowly came back on and everyone stayed quiet , as though we had been somewhere else , in a dream , but now reawakened .
In a cafeteria .
After the service , people congratulated me on the “ awesome worship . ” I said thanks .
Week to week , I chose songs that people reacted to .
I brought up the drums or cut everything but the acoustic guitar .
I began to sense the moments and movements of the room .
I felt voices rising or a unified building in passion and catered the songs ’ progressions to it .
I knew when to end a song or when to repeat a chorus .
I knew when to tease a song so that the group ’s longing grew and grew until we finally broke into the chorus , all instruments at full force , shaking the small room .
As the worship leader , I began to innately detect the desire and mood of the room , and week after week , people congratulated me on worship well done .
*
During my second year of college , I had also moved sturdily into my major ’s coursework .
I had decided to pursue a religious studies degree , and so I spent my days in classes on Christian history , ethics , and theology , as well as classes exploring and outlining other world religions .
At some point during the semester , I realized that my head ’s analytical voice , the part of me that I needed to put to work in the classroom , had often been strangely absent — or at least muffled — with regard to my beliefs and religion .
I had taken many goods and bads , rights and wrongs at face value because they had come from people in my church .
I had sung songs and played them without question because they were termed “ Christian ” and were popular .
It was n’t that I never thought in any deep way about God and faith .
I read the Bible and thought through parables and prophetic claims , but I realized that I had often dropped the analytical gear from my head when it came to things deemed Christian .
During my second semester my head started to rattle between the logical days and impassioned nights .
When the sun was out , I was able to step back and examine many beliefs and lines that I imagined formed Christianity and God .
But once it set , I led hundreds of people through theologically simple or vague or sometimes - conflicting songs — repeating them surely .
One evening , as we sang the final verse of a worship song , the last tune on our set list , I suddenly felt uncomfortable with my awareness of the group ’s longing .
I knew that I could dampen the song ’s final verse and build dramatically to the last chorus , sending the room into an intense moment of unified song .
I could feel and hear it in the voices .
But the power of intuiting the group ’s yearning suddenly felt disconcerting .
The air felt more like emotion , emotion that I was manipulating , rather than holy movement , and I felt ashamed of this power .
I ended the song without building to the chorus , only letting the guitar ring out remotely as the light slowly lifted and everyone opened their eyes , looking at me , waiting for direction .
I did n’t give any .
I felt dishonest .
I put my guitar on the stand and sat down .
The room was out of sorts , expecting me to anticipate their want , but eventually someone stood and introduced the guest speaker , and the meeting continued .
The crowd at IV had grown during the year , and I received consistent compliments on the “ great worship . ”
I liked the attention , but that night , the space between worship and music felt immense .
Any band worth its weight can excite a crowd and lead people through ups and downs , through jams and ballads .
I realized that all of my musical planning , all of my work to improve the movement of IV had merely played upon the momentary , fleeting emotions of the people .
Disenchanted as I was , I was still the same kid that believed God moved , even if I did n’t understand how .
I did n’t feel that I had clear , first - hand experience .
It was n’t as though I did n’t think people could act on passion in order to worship , that people could sing loudly to praise God , but the more I examined my time at X - Treme Life and IV , the more I began to see jokes and games and skits directed specifically at appealing to the crowd ’s emotions .
What had originally seemed pure engagement with a living God now seemed controlled , emotional charm to keep everyone interested .
*
I left IV after that year ; I even left the country to study in Central America .
A year later , when I returned to the U.S. , I understood that life would forever be a constant struggle against grabbing surrounding attraction while searching for deeper understanding .
I told Adam “ hell no ” in 7th grade to attempt to walk the line between popularity and my newfound Christianity .
Even in college , when I had decided that “ hell ” and “ damn ” were only words with arbitrary meanings , I still tried to toe the line between spotlight and reflection .
The religious landscape to which I returned has no shortage of spotlight and fashion .
Churches grow up all over the U.S. with shows and productions — cleanly orchestrated songs and dances to attract and keep crowds .
Many churches arrange their services and activities like television channels in order to catch the demographics and hold a wide base .
The latest Christian self - help book often floods churches , taking the place of scripture .
When I returned , at twenty - one , I knew that my adult Christian life would likely be a fight against comfort — not an intentional , affected plight , but a continual awareness of any belief that seems too easy and stylish .
One Sunday , when I ’d returned to Fruitland from college , I was glad to see my trumpet in use .
As it and the rest of the orchestra carried various harmonies beneath our voices singing “ Majesty , ” I thought about how living within Christianity means existing within a group , a culture brimming with subcultures and trends .
Living within the religion , among its many parts and pieces , does n’t mean taking everything within its confines without inspection .
It means searching while feeling sure you ’ve found .
It means accepting and questioning all in one breath .
And while I already knew that Sunday morning that I would n’t likely live my adult life in a Southern Baptist church , I was glad to stand there with people who knew me well as we sang and I pondered the painted river — questioning its veracity while swimming in its waters and floating downstream .

Eight of the most amazing tales of survival ever written .
1. Survival Against the Odds
“ Men wanted for hazardous journey …
Safe return doubtful .
Honour and recognition in case of success . ”
Sir Ernest Shackleton ’s Antarctic expedition of 1914 would ultimately fail , but the hardy crew he mustered would still win honour and recognition for its ability to survive against the odds .
After their ship Endurance was crushed in pack ice , the crew abandoned the plan to cross Antarctica on foot and the aim became merely to survive .
Over two years , Shackleton led the crew across ice floes , then in lifeboats to a camp on Elephant Island where for six months the main group would subsist on seal meat and blubber .
Shackleton took five men around the island to the north and then across 800 miles of treacherous ocean to South Georgia Island .
He then hiked with two others for 36 hours across the island ’s uncharted interior to a whaling station with another three months to go before he could safely reach the crew left on Elephant Island .
He later wrote , “ We had suffered , starved and triumphed , grovelled down yet grasped at glory …
We had reached the naked soul of man . ”
2. Lost in the Amazon
“ I was obsessed with the idea of exploration , ” Yossi Ghinsberg told CNN Traveller magazine on the recent release of his book Lost in the Jungle : A Harrowing True Story of Adventure and Survival .
It describes how in 1981 , Israeli - born Ghinsberg and three companions set off into the depths of the Bolivian Amazon .
When they realized they were ill - equipped for the journey , and lost , the four broke off into pairs ; two were never seen again .
Ghinsberg and his friend Kevin were to float a raft downriver , but it caught on a rock and they were split up .
For 19 days , Ghinsberg wandered helplessly in a brutal environment .
Fortunately , some local men had found Kevin and helped him search the river for Ghinsberg .
Miraculously , they discovered him , alive and with a new understanding of his weaknesses and strengths .

3. Two Weeks in an Ice Cave
In 1982 , Mark Inglis and Phil Doole were high up the slopes of New Zealand ’s highest mountain , Aoraki Mt. Cook , when a blizzard hit .
They built an ice cave and waited for the storm to pass , but it would be 13 days before help could reach them .
They survived on meagre rations , but in the cramped cave they lost circulation in their legs , which had to be amputated .
This has n’t stopped the men ’s climbing careers .
Both have gone on to summit Mt. Cook , and in 2006 , Inglis became the first double amputee to conquer Mt Everest , losing five fingertips and more flesh off his legs to frostbite , though none of his strength of character .
He told the New Zealand Herald , “ When you lose your legs when you ’re 23 … something like this is just a minor hiccup , just a bump in the journey , really . ”
4. Stranded in the Andes
It ’s a story so extraordinary it has spawned several books , a Hollywood film , an acclaimed documentary and an official website , and can be recognized with just one word : Alive .
When the plane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes in October 1972 , the story should have ended there , but it was only just beginning .
Of the 45 people on board , 12 died in the crash or shortly afterward , another five passed away the next morning from injuries , another on the eighth day , then eight in a later avalanche .
The remaining 16 struggled through extreme cold and starvation before resorting to cannibalism of those who had perished .
When it became clear help would n’t come to them , Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa hiked for days out of the mountains and eventually found help .
The most recent , and arguably the most sensitive retelling of the 72 - day saga is Gonzalo ArijÃ³n ’s 2007 documentary , Stranded : I Have Come From a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains .
5. Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place
Amputating your arm with a blunt knife is a task the average person would find virtually inconceivable .
But on May 1 , 2003 , it was the only option left to Aron Ralston after an 800 - pound boulder fell on his arm , pinning it to a canyon wall .
After five days , the little food and water he had was gone and it was unlikely anyone would find him in the remote canyon in Utah .
In his book , Between a Rock and a Hard Place , he describes how he managed to literally break free , first using the boulder to leverage his arm until the bones snapped and then sawing away at muscle and tendon with his pocket knife .
He then had to rappel down a 65 - foot wall .
He was walking back to his car when hikers found him .
The 33 - year - old continues to climb , including all of Colorado ’s 55 peaks higher than 14,000 feet , and is also a motivational speaker .

6. Mountain Odyssey
Joe Simpson and Simon Yates were descending from the summit of the 20,813 - foot - high Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes when disaster struck - twice .
First , Simpson slipped and broke his leg .
Then , while Yates was lowering him down , Simpson went over a cliff and was left dangling on the end of the rope .
Yates could n’t see or hear Simpson and held on for an hour as he was pulled down the mountain .
Controversially , he cut the rope ( which some say was against the mountaineering code , while others say it ultimately saved both men ’s lives ) and safely descended .
Simpson dropped into a crevasse , and though severely injured , was able to abseil down to the bottom from the ice shelf he landed on .
From here , he spent three days dragging himself across five miles of rough terrain , with no food or water and in great pain .
He crawled into base camp in the middle of the night and was reunited with Yates , who , after recovering from his own injuries , was planning to break camp the next morning .
The harrowing tale of survival is told in detail in Simpson ’s book , Touching the Void , and the documentary of the same name .
7. Struck Down in the Pacific
Sailing the South Pacific may seem like an idyllic pursuit , but when American Tami Oldham Ashcraft and her British boyfriend Richard Sharp were caught in a category four hurricane 19 days into what should have been a 30 - day crossing , the dream turned into a nightmare .
It was 1983 and they were en route from Tahiti to San Diego to deliver the 44 - foot sailboat Hazana .
Battered by Hurricane Raymond ’s 50 - foot waves , Hazana capsized .
Ashcraft , sheltering below decks , was knocked unconscious .
When she woke 27 hours later , Sharp was gone , his safety line broken , and while the boat had righted itself , the mainmast had snapped .
In the May 2002 issue of National Geographic Adventure , Ashcraft described how she had to fight the desire to just give up , how she fixed a makeshift mast and sail , rationed her supplies and plotted a course for Hawaii , 1,500 miles away .
Forty days later she sailed into Hilo Harbor , still in shock but thankful to be alive .
She continues to sail and in 2000 published an account of her ordeal in the book , Red Sky in Mourning .

8. Three Months in the Outback
When a walking skeleton over six feet tall appeared in front of his jeep in April 2006 , Mark Clifford , a farm manager on a remote property in Australia ’s Northern Territory , must have thought he was seeing things .
The skeleton was 35 - year - old Ricky Megee , who had been lost in the outback for an incredible 10 weeks .
Apparently drugged and left for dead by a hitch - hiker he had picked up ( though he also claimed his car had broken down ) , Megee survived by staying close to a dam and eating leeches , grasshoppers , and frogs .
While police and the public had doubts about the story , especially when it came to light that Megee had minor drug convictions , there ’s no question he was lost in the outback , for whatever reason , and lucky to have survived .

Iran 's supreme court has upheld a sentence of blinding against a jilted suitor who threw acid into the face of the woman who spurned him , leaving her blind and disfigured , a newspaper reported on Tuesday .
A Tehran criminal court in November ordered a man known only as Majid , 27 , to be blinded with 10 drops of sulphuric acid in each eye under the Islamic eye - for - an - eye ( qisas ) penalty , the government newspaper Iran said .
It said the supreme court on Monday rejected the defendant 's appeal and ruled that the initial verdict was lawful and could be carried out .
Majid confessed to seeking revenge against his university classmate , Ameneh Bahrami , by throwing acid on her face when she refused his proposal of marriage four years ago .
Despite years of treatment in Spain , Bahrami , 26 , has lost sight in both eyes and still has serious injuries on her face and body .
" Take his eyes away from him to become like me , " Bahrami was quoted as telling the Tehran court .
" I do n't demand qisas for myself .
This is what the society wants .
Majid must be punished so that such people know they cannot throw acid on a girl 's face . "
Several acid attacks have been reported in Iran in the past few years .
The rise and fall of Bernard Madoff is a tipping point for the current market .
The market may be captivated next week with the automaker bailout but make no mistake , this will turn out to be a big case rivaling anything we have seen in this current climate .
Why ?
Madoff actually admitted to the existence of fight club .
The first rule of investing fight club is to deny its existence .
He not only broke this rule but flatly stated that his investment strategy was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme .
This case will be important because so far , all we have had is a theatre of bread and circus from our politicians giving lip service to CEOs only to let them go off after a verbal lashing to collect their million dollar golden parachutes .
This case has the potential to cement a generation of distrust .
Here you have a market maker and former chairman of the Nasdaq .
A market maker is essentially a firm that both quotes a buy and sell price .
The profit is made on the turn which is the spread .
Now this of course requires at least some integrity but here you have a huckster making it to the top at one of the “ big 3 ” markets in the U.S. ; the Dow , Nasdaq , and S & P 500 .
How big is this ?
The Enron scandal , one of the biggest of the decade destroyed more than $ 60 billion of shareholder value .
Enron at its peak in 2000 had about 22,000 employees .
We already know that Madoff has put up to $ 50 billion at risk .
And from all reports we are now getting , it appears most of it was done with his own hands !
It is absolutely stunning .
Yet what is equally stunning is how complicit people were to believe his strategy .
Welcome to mania , a part of consumer psychology where people want to believe in fairy tales and easy street .
As the days go on , more and more reports are coming out with early warning signs being issued yet no one in any enforceable arm of the government wanted to act .
It is important to understand a bit of Madoff ’s history to gain a bigger perspective of one of the biggest swindles of our time .
Madoff was the chairman of Bernard Madoff Investment Securities which he founded in 1960 .
His firm was one of the top market makers especially in the Nasdaq .
Madoff was born in New York in 1938 during the end point of the Great Depression .
He has homes in Palm Beach , France , Roslyn New York , and an apartment on Manhattan ’s Upper East side with a street value of $ 5 million .
Not to be out done , he has a 55 - foot fishing boat with the aptly put name of “ Bull . ”
I think he forgot the last name of the boat that goes very nicely after bull .
Madoff tapped into the elite social circles of the east coast .
Most of his clientele grew from word of mouth .
He had consistent returns although most of his investors had little idea how he was able to yield such consistent returns .
I would imagine many did n’t care so long as the money came in .
How can they know ?
It was a Ponzi scheme .
Many knew that something was amiss .
He either had inside information ( illegal ) or had some other connections to gain the upper hand for his investors .
Instead , we now find out that he was basically stealing from Peter to pay Paul .
Many of his investors trusted him to the point where the New York Times had an anonymous quote from a hedge fund executive who nicknamed him the Jewish T - Bill .
I ’m not sure you want to use that nickname anymore given that some T - Bills are returning zero percent .
The criminal complaint filed against Madoff alleges that investors lost $ 50 billion because of the scheme .
That is right .
$ 50 billion .
He now faces 20 years in prison and a fine of $ 5 million if convicted .
Madoff did something different .
You mean run a $ 50 billion Ponzi operation ?
Nope .
He confessed .
According to the S.E.C. Madoff told the F.B.I. agent that there was “ no innocent explanation ” for his behavior and here is the kicker , that he “ paid investors with money that was n’t there . ”
This is the reason this story will gain traction .
Not only is it the biggest swindle in U.S. history if things play out like they are going but it will also be the first major player simply admitting criminal activity .
The public wants justice and we now start down the painful road of discovering what really went on in the cellar .
Why will this have such a big impact ?
Because on a macro level , collectively the public has been yearning for someone to simply admit to what is going on .
We all know that each time some crony capitalist from the big Wall Street firms makes his way to Congress , all we are going to see is some Kabuki theatre .
They ’ll get nicely dressed up and entertain us for a few hours and then that is it .
No one admits any guilt or responsibility .
They get a verbal lashing and that is the extent of the punishment .
The American public needs some representatives with a stronger spine .
With Mr. Madoff , we have our first opportunity for a cathartic societal release of pent up retribution .
Make no mistake , this is only the first of many .
There is never just one roach .
So what is a Ponzi scheme ?
Named after the lovable Charles Ponzi , it is a fraudulent investment that pays a very high return to investors out of money paid in by subsequent investors .
There are no true net revenues or money generated from a legitimate business .
Sort of like injecting more and more into banks pretending they actually have valuable assets on their books .
Charles Ponzi , went from a nobody to a Boston millionaire in six months in 1920 promising returns of 50 % in 45 days in an international postal reply coupon scheme .
Approximately 40,000 people jumped on the bandwagon with a total of $ 15 million .
When it collapsed as all Ponzi schemes do , only a third was recovered .
He went to jail but got out in time to gamble again in the middle 1920s Florida real estate speculation bubble .
Went to jail again and was deported to die broke in Italy .
What Madoff did is n’t new .
In fact , if you remember the 1920s was a roaring time .
People want to believe in the free lunch and that they somehow have privy knowledge that no one else can obtain .
The power of Ponzi schemes is they suck in even “ bright ” people .
Think of going to a casino .
You sit at a slot machine .
You put in a quarter and right off the bat , you win $ 200 .
You put in another quarter .
Bam !
Another $ 200 .
Another quarter and a $ 300 win this time .
After a few times , you are conditioned to believe that somehow this machine is lucky or you have some secret skill .
You then decide that you are going to put all your winnings in the machine for one max payout play .
The machine does n’t pay out .
Game over .
I ’ll leave you with this great summary from John Kenneth Galbraith that sums up the stage of the collapse we are in :
“ In many ways the effect of the crash on embezzlement was more significant than on suicide .
To the economist embezzlement is the most interesting of crimes .
Alone among the various forms of larceny it has a time parameter .
Weeks , months , or years may elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery .
( This is a period , incidentally , when the embezzler has his gain and the man who has been embezzled , oddly enough , feels no loss .
There is a net increase in psychic wealth . )
At any given time there exists an inventory of undiscovered embezzlement in – or more precisely not in – the country ’s businesses and banks .
This inventory – it should perhaps be called the bezzle – amounts at any moment to many millions of dollars .
It also varies in size with the business cycle .
In good times people are relaxed , trusting , and money is plentiful .
But even though money is plentiful , there are always many people who need more .
Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows , the rate of discovery falls off , and the bezzle increases rapidly .
In depression all this is reversed .
Money is watched with a narrow , suspicious eye .
The man who handles it is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise .
Audits are penetrating and meticulous .
Commercial morality is enormously improved .
The bezzle shrinks .
… Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth , so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery .
Within a few days , something close to universal trust turned into something akin to universal suspicion .
Audits were ordered .
Strained or preoccupied behavior was noticed .
Most important , the collapse in stock values made irredeemable the position of the employee who had embezzled to play the market .
He now confessed . ”
Human behavior rarely changes .
The crash of 2008 will force many people to reveal their losses .
We will be “ shocked ” at what we find .
I am still stunned by crony capitalist calling for a freeze to mark - to - market accounting hoping their nepotism can continue .
They want to keep their corrupt internal system hidden .
They would like us to believe Madoff was an exceptional case but he is simply the tip of the iceberg .
The secret of fight club is now out .

For years , Oregon has been diligent about reducing the state ’s dependence on fossil fuels , but its environmental consciousness has come at a stunning price -- gas tax revenue is down $ 4.8 million a year compared with 2006 .
That drop , caused by lower fuel consumption and a slowing economy , has prompted Oregon to consider a new way to pay for road repairs : Democratic Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski ’s upcoming budget calls for a highway tax based on mileage , not gasoline purchases .
A state task force will look at equipping every new vehicle in Oregon with a Global Positioning System to record every mile driven and where .
Motorists would pay at the gas pump based on how much they drove , no matter how fuel - frugal their vehicle .
The plan still requires legislative endorsement and the full details could take several years to work out , but state analysts said the governor ’s endorsement is a crucial step toward solving what has become a problem in many states : dependence on a gasoline tax .

“ This is a way to try to develop a fair funding mechanism that we ’re going to have to have if we ’re going to be aggressive in terms of looking at electric cars and hybrids and plug-ins and all those options , and at the same time continue to invest in our roads and infrastructure , ” said Rem Nivens , the governor ’s deputy communications director .
Oregon plans to spend $ 650 million on transportation projects next year , a smaller version of President - elect Barack Obama ’s proposal to stimulate the economy with infrastructure spending .
Here , it will be financed in part by a 2 - cent - a - gallon tax increase .
Jim Whitty , manager of the state transportation department ’s office of innovative partnerships and alternative funding , said the state already faces a $ 10 - billion shortfall in financing transportation projects , and the number will climb unless the decline in gas tax revenue is addressed .
Only a major rethinking of highway finance can keep Oregon from running seriously short of transportation funding as early as next year , state officials say .

While Oregon appears to be out in front in looking at a mileage fee , several other states , including Ohio , Pennsylvania , Colorado , Florida , Rhode Island , Minnesota and Texas , have also expressed an interest in phasing out the gas tax in favor of charging motorists for how much they drive .
In Oregon , some drivers protest that the plan would discriminate against rural residents who may have to drive several miles just to get to the grocery store ; create potential inequities compared with drivers from out of state ; and raise privacy concerns , with Big Brother keeping a satellite watch over where everyone is driving .
“ What ’s next ?
Tattoo numbers on your forearm ? ” wrote one commenter at Oregon Catalyst , a conservative website .
Jason Williams , executive director of the Taxpayer Assn. of Oregon , said : “ This is just another wide - eyed government experiment that ’s going to fail and cost the taxpayer a lot of money .
We basically see it as the next big boondoggle of 2009 . ”

While the GPS mileage - counters could be programmed not to regularly report a vehicle ’s location , that would n’t entirely eliminate privacy concerns , Williams said .
“ The fact that they tag your car to a certain place at a certain time means they ’re tracking your movements .
So what happens in a divorce court when the wife tries to track where her husband was , or a boss tries to make sure you were where you were supposed to be ? ”
Some Oregon businesses have been eager to take advantage of the state ’s substantial tax credits for shifting to energy - efficient vehicles .
The governor ’s proposal to expand the tax credit for electric cars to up to $ 5,000 , combined with new federal subsidies , could allow Oregonians to save up to $ 12,500 on the purchase of an all - electric car .
Portland ’s Hot Lips Pizza already has converted five of its 14 delivery vehicles to all - electric , “ and we ’re looking at definitely increasing that number , ” in part because some customers now specify that they want their pizza delivered in an electric car , said Lou Hijar , director of operations .
He said the company has not calculated how a mileage fee rather than a gas tax would affect its expenses , but is ready to look at the proposal .
“ We ’re always looking for the better mousetrap , ” he said .
Advertisement
State officials say they are committed to minimizing concerns about privacy and about inequity before implementing any mileage - based idea .
In a Portland trial program in 2006 and 2007 , about 300 cars were equipped with GPS devices and every time drivers bought gas , they were charged 1.2 cents a mile -- about equivalent to the state ’s 24 - cents - a - gallon tax assuming a vehicle that averages 20 miles per gallon .
“ They drive up to the pump and there ’s a mileage reader there , very much like a modern toll reader , which identifies the car as a mileage fee payer , and the total mileage driven in each zone is transferred by a wireless radio frequency that goes into a database , and the mileage fee rates are applied , ” Whitty said .
In Kulongoski ’s proposal , GPS devices would be installed only in new vehicles , and would monitor mileage only on Oregon roads .
Drivers from outside the state would pay the standard gas tax , Whitty said .
Advertisement
The monitors could also allow the state to charge higher fees for rush - hour travel in congested areas , Oregon officials say .
Seattle recently conducted such a trial with GPS and found that drivers were much less likely to enter congested areas when charged to do so .
California has also looked at mileage fees , but “ we ’re still talking .
We ’re not there yet , ” said Elizabeth Deakin , professor of city and regional planning at UC Berkeley .
She said the increasing variation in vehicles ’ fuel efficiency has impelled the national debate over how to pay for transportation expenses .
“ A vehicle that gets 20 mpg pays more gas tax , but does n’t actually use that much more road than my hybrid does , ” she said .
“ I ’m not paying much gas tax .
I ’m getting kind of a free ride .
Of course , you can say that ’s not a bad thing , because it gave me an incentive to pay more money for the hybrid . ”
Advertisement
Mileage fees do n’t have to involve GPS trackers , Deakin said .
They could be as simple as submitting periodic odometer readings -- when renewing car registration , for example -- or setting an estimated average that everyone would pay .
( In the latter scenario , drivers could be invited to prove they drove less , and car sellers could be charged if their odometer readings were higher than they should be . )
Whitty acknowledged that he thinks Oregon “ wo n’t be able to complete this without assistance from the federal government , or a consortium of other states , ” because of such complications as the GPS cost to manufacturers for cars sold in Oregon ; the likelihood that some Oregonians would just go out of state to buy cars without the GPS ; and the potential inequity with drivers from out of state .
“ We know what we need to do , ” Whitty said .
“ Now the other states have to decide whether they want to use our system or try their own . ”

People who take daily garlic supplements will catch fewer common colds than people who do not supplement with garlic .
Studies have determined that taking a daily garlic supplement that contains allicin will reduce one 's risk of contracting a cold by approximately 50 percent .
Allicin is a purified component of garlic that is the active ingredient produced by the garlic plant .
Garlic supplements that contain allicin have also been shown to be effective for fighting methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) infections .
Everyone suffers from the common cold from time to time .
In fact , the common cold is the most prevalent viral infection in the world with more than 200 known variations of the viruses that cause the common cold .
On average , people can expect to suffer between two and five colds every year .
Recent research is now revealing that not only can garlic help prevent many colds but taking daily garlic supplements can also help to reduce the duration and severity of colds when they are contracted .
Allison has also been proven to be effective in fighting MRSA superbug infections .
MRSA is a dermatological staph infection that occurs among patients in health care settings .
MRSA can be widespread , is becoming resistant to many antibiotics , and can be a very serious and debilitating condition .
How to Use Garlic for Cold Prevention : 1.Use garlic as soon as the initial symptoms of a cold are felt .
Garlic consumption is effective for strengthening the immune system and will even help prevent many colds .
When symptoms first appear take a garlic supplement or drink garlic tea to boost the body 's disease - fighting strength .
Garlic tea will also soothe a sore throat and cough .
2 . Try to consume between 1 and 2 whole cloves of garlic each day .
Consuming more than this is fine but this amount of garlic will provide all the immune system benefits needed to fight a cold .
3. Taking a large dose of garlic supplements when cold symptoms are initially noticed may be effective for preventing , or at least reducing , a cold .
Experts believe that a mega dose of garlic at the first sign of colds or the flu can reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms .
How to Prepare Garlic Tea : 1.
Chop one clove of garlic finely .
Fine chopping activates the allicin in garlic that is effective for fighting cold and flu viruses .
2. Add the chopped garlic to boiling water and allow to steep for several minutes .
3. Cool the tea before drinking .
For best taste allow the tea to cool somewhat but do n't drink it cold .
The taste is best when slightly warm .
4 . Drink one cup each day during the winter months or when cold and flu symptoms begin .

Broadcaster owned by arch 9/11 debunkers Hearst Corporation and military contractor General Electric
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , January 19 , 2009
A new FBI drama currently showing on A&E portrays 9/11 truthers as dope smoking terrorists in its pilot episode , a ploy made all the more interesting for the fact that A&E is part - owned by Hearst Corporation , which has also attempted to debunk 9/11 truth with savage hit pieces via its subsidiaries The History Channel and Popular Mechanics .
The plot of the show , which stars Patrick Swayze , centers around an attempt to infiltrate a group who are suspected of smuggling Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers into Iraq .
In one scene , a member of the group talks with an FBI agent who is operating undercover .
“ Are you a truther or a sheep ? ” the man asks the FBI agent .
He continues , “ 9/11 was a false flag operation man , wake up , a self - inflicted wound to control the masses , you know there was no planes , all of them were holograms and CGI . ”
The man then takes a drag on a marijuana spliff and gives the FBI agent a crazed look .

The insertion of the 9/11 truther caveat in the episode serves no purpose except seemingly to convince the viewer that the man is unstable and dangerous .
The mention of CGI and holograms , an obsessive tenet of an extreme fringe that attempted to hijack the 9/11 truth movement a few years ago , also serves only to detract more credibility from the subject .
Watch the clip .
The A&E network , which stands for Arts & Entertainment , is jointly owned by Hearst Corporation ( 37.5 % ownership ) , The Walt Disney Company ( 37.5 % ownership ) and NBC ( 25 % ownership ) .
NBC is owned by General Electric , a major player in the military - industrial complex and a huge benefactor of the 9/11 attacks , which of course could only have resulted in gargantuan profits for military contractors if the official story was upheld .
Hearst Corporation , the founder of which became synonymous with the term “ yellow journalism ” for his publication of dubious and sensationalized stories , also owns The History Channel and Popular Mechanics magazine , both of which attacked 9/11 truth in separate hit pieces in 2005 and 2007 .
A&E also has close ties with the British Broadcasting Corporation , which has also attempted to debunk 9/11 with a series of hit pieces over the last few years .
Portrayals of the 9/11 truth movement in popular culture have manifested with both negative and positive connotations .
An episode of South Park satirized truthers but a more recent episode of the firefighter drama Rescue Me showed actor Daniel Sunjata , himself a truther in real life , talking at length and with clarity about issues surrounding 9/11 being an inside job .
The very fact that the 9/11 truth movement has entered into popular culture alone and that giant media corporations and arms of the military - industrial complex are having to go to such lengths in a desperate attempt to debunk questions surrounding the attacks , is proof positive that the movement as a whole has had a significant impact on public consciousness , a fact that debunkers are loathe to admit .

Below is a guest blog entry by MoJo author Maia Szalavitz :
The “ drug czar ” position has never worked as intended .
Originally proposed as a cabinet - level coordinator of drug policy by Joe Biden in the early 80’s , it was a knee - jerk response to growing hysteria over widespread cocaine use .
Ronald Reagan initially vetoed the idea as more bureaucracy , but eventually got on board , signing the relevant legislation in 1988 .
The post ’s creation was part of a package of harmful laws that included the death penalty for “ drug kingpins ” and the notorious mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine that helped make an already racially - biased drug policy ( . pdf ) into a situation where one in ten young African American men are in prison .
Ever since , the job has been held by political operatives ( William Bennett ) , police officers ( Lee Brown ) and generals ( Barry McCaffrey ) .
Never once has an academic drug policy expert , an MD , PhD , or other addiction researcher who has actually studied the subject served as drug czar .
Will that change under Obama ?
Historically , our czars have actively opposed sensible drug policy :
They have gone on crusades against medical marijuana , interfered in state initiatives aimed at promoting treatment over punishment , and most notoriously , stopped President Clinton from letting his HHS secretary legalize federal funding for needle exchange when the data was incontrovertible that it helps fight AIDS and does n’t increase drug use .
The current czar is campaigning to get high schools to implement drug testing — something opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics as counter - productive to teen health .
Another big initiative was the two billion dollar anti-drug media campaign — which may actually have increased drug use by those who viewed it .
And written into the job description is the idea that this czar must oppose even studying any form of drug legalization — including the discovery of medical uses for drugs currently listed in our drug laws as having no medical purpose , like marijuana .
Never mind that medical science advances :
If it turned out that marijuana could treat cancer or Alzheimer ’s , the drug czar is legally mandated to oppose it .
Writers are told that we must “ kill our darlings ” when they are n’t useful to the narrative — and I ’m sure it would be hard for VP - elect Joe Biden to let this Frankenstein ’s monster go .
However , if any position has outlived its usefulness , the drug czar job is it .
Obama is apparently considering appointing a man who would be similar to his predecessors .
Rep. Jim Ramstad opposes needle exchange and medical marijuana .
While fighting to improve access to addiction treatment , he tried to exclude coverage for methadone maintenance — the treatment that science says is most effective for heroin and other opioid addictions .
Instead of spending $ 464 million on this needless and harmful agency — $ 26 million of that on salaries for the czar and his staff ( . pdf ) — let ’s put this relic of the 80’s away with Miami Vice .
Or , if we ’re going to be stuck with it , let ’s hire an academic researcher or MD who knows that needle exchange saves lives ; methadone works and is over - regulated ; addiction treatment needs to be varied , empathetic , and not humiliating to be effective ; 12 - step programs are not the only way ; treatment providers should only be paid to provide treatment proven to be effective ; mandatory minimums do n’t work , and prison should be reserved for violent criminals .

As anyone who has lusted over the technical specifications for Canon ’s new Digital Rebel XSi knows , the capabilities of the average point and shoot camera are severely limited .
Using the CHDK firmware hack , the features of Canon point and shoot cameras can be significantly expanded , allowing for ultra - high speed photography , very long exposures , time lapse photography , and RAW capture .
This How - To provides a guide to our experiences using the CHDK firmware , and shows just how easy it is to get more out of a point and shoot than ever thought possible .
Installing CHDK
The first step is to install the CHDK software .
Our friends at Lifehacker recently ran an article covering exactly that , so we wo n’t bother repeating the instructions .
Be sure to install the Allbest build , it has all of the nice features .
After installing , you ’ll want to have the firmware autoload when you boot up your camera .
To do so , open up the main CHDK menu by pressing your ALT button , then the MENU button .
Scroll down to “ Debug parameters ” , then click on “ Make card bootable … ”
After it is done , turn off your camera , remove the SD card , and toggle the write protect switch .
When this switch is toggled , the camera will automatically boot into CHDK ( you ’ll still be writing to it ) .
Taking long exposures
Long exposure photography is appreciated for its soft , sometimes surreal images of ( usually ) night scenes .
Many point and shoot cameras only allow exposures of 15 seconds , but with CHDK , you can take photos at up to 64 seconds .
Navigate to CHDK ’s main menu and find Extra Photo Operations .
In Extra Photo Operations , change the Override Shutter Speed value to the shutter speed you wish to shoot at , such as 64 seconds .
Scroll down and change the Value Factor from OFF to 1 .
Though the camera will not indicate the modified shutter speed , the changes will take place .
Just take a picture as you normally would .
Be sure to have your camera set to manual mode .
Taking photos of moving things works best for long exposures : try subjects like the ocean , windy trees , and traffic .
Additionally , using neutral density filters , you can even take long exposures in the day time !
Taking ultra -fast exposures
Just as you can override the shutter speed for long exposures , you can take ultra - fast exposures as well , at up to 1/100,000 of a second with some cameras .
Flash will sync at up to 1/60,000 of a second , and you ’ll need flash with such short exposures .
We were unsure how useful or easy this would be to use , but the results surprised us : in just a few minutes we were able to capture nice looking water droplets , without a hint of motion blur .
Navigate to CHDK ’s main menu and find Extra Photo Operations .
In Extra Photo Operations , change the Override Shutter Speed value to the shutter speed you wish to shoot at , such as 1/16,000 of a second .
Scroll down and change the Value Factor from OFF to 1 .
Be sure to have your camera set to manual mode .
Note that the minimum shutter speed is restricted by the aperture value you have selected in the camera ’s manual settings .
The wide end ( lower numbers ) , can usually only shoot at down to 1/8000 of a second , while the narrower end ( higher numbers ) can shoot for the full range .
Prefocus before taking the picture , either by using manual focus mode , or by holding the shutter button halfway down .
Though the camera will not indicate the modified shutter speed , it will use the short shutter speed .
There are many different things that can be done with high speed photography : capture water droplets , capture explosions , or even capture a bullet leaving a gun .
All of these are possible with CHDK .
Running scripts
The real power in CHDK comes from running user made scripts .
The first script we will look at is an intervalometer , which allows you to take many photos over a period of time .
We used it to easily create a time - lapse video .
Copy and paste this script into a new document , and save as ult_intrvl .bas to your computer .
Then , plug in your camera ’s SD card , and copy ult_intrvl .bas to /CHDK / SCRIPTS /.
To use the intervalometer , navigate to the main CHDK menu , find “ Scripting parameters ” , and click “ Load script from file ” .
Find ult_intrvl.bas , and press set .
Then , scroll down and adjust the script parameters : the delay until the first shot is taken , the number of shots you wish to take , the interval between each shot , and whether or not you want it to take an “ endless ” number of photos .
Then , exit the menu , but leave your camera in ALT mode , and press the shutter button to start the script .
The video above was created by taking approximately 700 shots at 15 second intervals over 2 hours and 45 minutes .
Just set your camera on a tripod or another steady surface , and start the intervalometer .
Using QuickTime Pro , go to File > Open Image Sequence to convert the hundreds of separate images into a movie .
For space and processing considerations , we recommend setting your camera to a low - resolution mode before starting the intervalometer .
Exposure bracketing
Exposure bracketing allows you to take many pictures at slightly different exposures nearly simultaneously .
You can use this to correct errors in the camera ’s autoexposure , or merge exposures for HDR photography .
Many higher end Canon PowerShot ’s have exposure bracketing built in , but for those that do n’t , CHDK has the answer .
Like with the intervalometer script , simply copy and paste this script into a new text file .
Name it bracketing .
bas , and place it in the / CHDK / SCRIPTS / folder of your SD card .
Then navigate to the main CHDK menu , find “ Scripting parameters ” , and click “ Load script from file ” .
Find bracketing .
bas , and press set .
Then , scroll down and adjust the script parameters .
The step size is the difference between each image taken , in 1/3 EV steps , the correction is the EV of the middle image taken .
The only slightly tricky part here is that first parameter is the ( number of images – 1 ) / 2 .
This means that if you want three pictures , it must be 1 , five is 2 , seven is 3 , and so on .
To run the script , exit the menu , leave the camera in alt mode , and press the shutter button .
With these different exposures , you can create HDR tone - mapped images , that show very bright and very dark regions exposed properly .
For example , taking the seven different images of the lighthouse above into an HDR program such as Photomatix , optimizing settings for realism , produces this result :
You can also use HDR to produce more dramatic photos , such as this train .
It is all in how you process the images .
There is a lot that can be done with HDR , from extremely vibrant photos , to the scarily surreal , such as this one below from Till Krech .
..
For more information on HDR photography , Stuck In Customs has an excellent tutorial .
Taking RAW photos
RAW photos can be extremely useful to digital photographer .
They enable you to extract more information from bright highlights in an image , and RAW gives the you complete control over white balance .
For example , in the above photo the JPG had an incorrect white balance , which was easily corrected using the RAW image .
While DSLRs offer 12 bits of data in RAWs , most point and shoot cameras can only provide 10 , meaning that even with CHDK , you wo n’t be able to extract as much information from highlights as you could with a DSLR .
Still , RAWs are very useful for having precise white balance control .
In the Raw Parameters menu , enable “ Save RAW ” , and adjust the other parameters as shown .
Now , you can take photos as normal , and a RAW will be automatically saved with your JPG .
The RAW file will take quite a bit a more space than the standard JPG , so your camera will not be able to correctly display remaining space on the SD card .
Processing RAW photos
To process your RAW photos , you ’ll need to convert them to the Digital Negative format , DNG .
The DNG4 PS - 2 software can do this for these cameras : A610 , A620 , A630 , A640 , A710 IS , S2 IS , S3 IS , A700 , G7 , A560 , A570 IS , IXUS 700 , IXUS 70 , IXUS 800 , A720 IS , S5 IS , IXUS 950 , A650 IS , A460 , SD800 IS , A530 , A540 .
You can also process the files using UFRaw or dcraw , though that is much more difficult .
Open DNG4 PS - 2 , then go to settings .
Adjust the model settings based on how many megapixels your camera is .
Next , press OK , and find the path to RAW files option .
This is not the location of the file that you wish to convert , but the folder that contains the files .
When you have selected the correct folder , press “ Convert ” .
The DNGs will be in a folder marked with today ’s date , and from there , you can process them in Lightroom , Aperture , Photoshop , or whichever RAW processing software you prefer .
Adding a battery meter
Tired of have the low battery warning sneak up on you ?
CHDK can add a battery meter to your camera , though the configuration depends on what type of camera you have .
To enable it , go to OSD parameters in the main menu , then to Battery .
Edit the parameters so that they are as they appear above , if you have a camera with 4 AA rechargeable batteries .
Cameras with 2 AA rechargeable batteries should be about half of that .
For other power sources , experiment to find the best value .
Writing your own scripts
CHDK uses a very simple BASIC - like language called UBASIC .
It has all of the features that one would expect from any language , but there are many camera specific features .
Input / output
Each script begins with a special header , that provides information and control to the user .
@title Intervalometer
@param a Number of shots
@default a 10
@param b Interval ( Minutes )
@default b 1
In this header , the title of the script is declared , as are two user adjustable parameters .
The syntax is simple : @title declares a title , @param par declares the name and label of a parameter , and @default [ par ] declares the default value of a parameter .
Scripts can only receive input through the header , at the beginning of their execution .
To output information to the user , the print command is used : print " Num shots : " , a will print the number of shots , as inputted in the script header .
Note the use of the comma to seperate text from variables .
The print command is limited to 25 characters of text .
To clear what has been printed , use the cls command .
Standard program flow
let a = 2
for x=1 to 10
gosub " display "
next x
: display
rem print even numbers
if x % a = 0 then print x
return
This block of code demonstrates many of the logic features of the UBASIC language .
To assign values to variables , use the let command .
You can also see a for loop and a subroutine .
Note the use of the rem command to insert comments , and the single line if statement .
UBASIC supports most standard mathematical comparisons , including + , - , * , / , % , < , > , = , <= , >= , <> ( not equal to ) , & , | , ^ ( xor ) .
Camera control
The meat of UBASIC is in its many commands for controlling the camera :
shoot Takes a photo click / press / release " button " Clicks ( press and release ) , presses , or releases on the cameras buttons .
The following are available : up , down , left , right , set , shoot_half ( depresses the shutter halfway ) , shoot_full , zoom_in , zoom_out , menu , display , print , erase , iso , flash , mf ( manual focus ) , macro , video , timer .
wait_click timeout Waits for a button to be pressed , then continues .
The timeout value is optional .
is_key x " button " Immediately follows a wait_click command .
If the last button pressed is " button " , then the variable x is set with the value of 1 .
If wait_click timed out , then " no_key " is used as the button name .
set_tv val
Sets the shutter speed to val .
Note that val is not “ 1/1000 ” or something similar , but rather an integer value .
Each increase in the integer value corresponds to a 1/3 EV increase .
The absolute mapping between integer values and shutter speeds varies between cameras , but tables are available here .
This , and all following commands must be used with the camera in manual mode .
set_tv_rel val
Sets the shutter speed relative to the current shutter speed .
Example : set_tv_rel 0 - 1 increases the shutter speed by 1/3 EV .
get_tv target
Sets target equal to the current shutter speed .
set_av val , set_av_rel val , get_av target
With the same syntax as shutter speed commands , these adjust aperture settings .
set_zoom val , set_zoom_rel val , get_zoom target Just like set_tv/ set_tv_rel commands .
In set_zoom_rel , val is +/- the relative change .
Zoom values range from 0 to 8 or 14 for A - series cameras , and 0 to 128 for S - series cameras .
set_zoom_speed x S - series only .
Sets the zoom speed , at x % of maximum speed .
x may vary between 5 and 100 .
set_focus x , get_focus target x/ target is distance in millimeters .
set iso x , get iso target x/ target is one of the following values : 0 ( Auto ISO ) , 1 ( 50/80 ) , 2 ( 100 ) , 3 ( 200 ) , 4 ( 400 ) , 5 ( 800 ) , - 1 ( High ISO ) .

Finally , take photos !
The most important thing that you can do to improve your photography skills is to take lots of photos .
Your activities on the Internet are akin to your activities out in public — they 're not private and are possibly open for police scrutiny , according to an Ontario Superior Court .
The ruling was made by Justice Lynne Leitch on — surprise !— a child pornography case .
The judge said that there 's " no reasonable expectation of privacy " when it comes to logs kept by ISPs .
Canadians , watch out , because everything you do online could soon be turned into legal fodder , even without a warrant .
The case in question came about when , in 2007 , police asked Bell Canada to hand over subscriber information for a particular IP address that they suspected of accessing and " making available " child porn online .
According to the National Post , the ISP handed over the name and contact information for the account without asking for a warrant , which is apparently typical among ISPs in Canada only if the request is related to a child porn investigation .
The lawyer for the defendant — the defendant being the husband of the woman whose name was on the account — disagreed with Bell Canada 's actions .
He argued that since there were no accusations of luring a child or putting a minor in danger , a warrant should have been required .
This argument was rejected by Judge Leitch , however , who equated the information to data that the state already has .
" One 's name and address or the name and address of your spouse are not biographical information one expects would be kept private from the state , " she wrote .
She also stated that Canada 's Personal Information Protection Electronics Documents
Act allows for ISPs to give IP information to a " lawful authority , " which she interpreted as not requiring a warrant .
Though it 's clear that the ruling in the case ( which is still ongoing ) was made with good intentions , privacy advocates know what the road to hell is paved with .
Critics fear that such a precedent could open the doors to police asking for information on all manner of Internet activities , ranging from the embarrassing to the questionable - but - legal , without judicial oversight .
One instructor from Toronto's Osgoode Hall Law School argued that , even when criminal activity is suspected , a warrant should be required .
" [ E ] veryone wants to get at the child abusers , " professor James Stribopoulos told the National Post , which is why judges seem to be agreeing with Judge Leitch 's interpretation of the law .
" It is not just your name , it is your whole Internet surfing history .
Up until now , there was privacy .
An IP address is not your name , it is a 10 - digit number .
A lot more people would be apprehensive if they knew their name was being left everywhere they went . "
IP addresses are n't necessarily accurate indicators of who 's behind certain activities online .
As many college campuses in the US have argued to the RIAA , IP addresses are reassigned often and no single student can be tied to a single IP address much of the time .
IP address data can even be incorrect ( or incorrectly matched up by ISPs ) , leading to some being unfairly accused of illegal activities . �
Judge Leitch 's ruling has privacy advocates in Canada worried , as it is binding to lower courts in Ontario .
" There is no confidentiality left on the Internet if this ruling stands , " Stribopoulos said .
Keeps you hooked to the screen !
Materialistic people tend to form strong connections to particular product brandswhen their level of anxiety about death is high , according to a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research .
Authors Aric Rindfleisch ( University of Wisconsin- Madison and KoreaUniversity ) , James E. Burroughs ( University of Virginia ) , and Nancy Wong ( University of Wisconsin - Madison ) examined levels of materialism and insecurityin consumers and discovered that the combination of " death anxiety " andmaterialism led to strong attachment to brands .
While conventional wisdom holds that materialistic individuals are weaklyconnected to brands and use them as superficial status badges , the new researchproves that brands hold more meaning for materialistic consumers than previouslythought .
When those individuals are also worried about death , their brandattachment grows .
" We propose that materialistic individuals form strong connections to their brandswhen death anxiety is high but not when death anxiety is low , " write the authors .
" Materialistic individuals are strongly connected to their brands and employ themas an important source of meaning in their lives . "
The authors tested their hypothesis by conducting two different but relatedstudies .
The first study asked adults in the United States to rate their degrees ofmaterialism , death anxiety , and brand connection .
In the second study , conductedamong college students , the researchers manipulated death anxiety by havingparticipants consider their own deaths in detail .
In both studies , participants ratedtheir degree of connection to a variety of products including cars , microwaves , jeans , cell phones , MP3 players , and sunglasses .
" Materialistic consumers with anxiety about their existence are especially in needof the symbolic security that brand connections provide , " write the authors .
" Given the recent rise in materialistic tendencies along with the media ' sheightened focus on existential threats , the number of consumers who display thiscombination of values and motives should increase in the near future . "

The Federal Reserve is living up to its purpose , which is to enrich bankers at the expense of everyone else .
Ben Bernanke , who chairs the Federal Reserve Board , is to be congratulated for his open call for the banks under his tutelage to receive billions more of our tribute .
Let us understand the matter clearly .
We have exited a significant boom period .
During the boom , the bankers made large and very large profits .
The managements took home very large pay and bonuses .
The stockholders ( including officers and managers of the banks ) had , for a time , very large wealth in the stocks they held .
The bondholders of the banks had , for a time , very secure debts .
But the bankers over - reached for business in several ways .
They extended a slew of bad loans during the lately departed boom .
The stocks and bonds fell in price , reflecting the lower worth of the bank assets , these bad loans .
And now that the boom is over , the bankers , led by Mr. Bernanke , want us to eat their losses .
Bernanke urges Congress to absorb the bad loans .
The details of his three alternative plans are secondary to the fact that they all ask that others pay for the losses that the bankers caused , or else they involve the government in a variety of complicated maneuvers by which the government ends up shoring up these banks and bankers while taking on various risks of owning portfolios of bad loans .
The idea is for the bankers to offload their mistakes onto taxpayers .
One plan has the government buy the bad loans .
Why ?
Why do n’t the bankers reveal what these loans are and sell them in the market ?
Such sales will reveal that their assets are worth even less than what the market now thinks .
The insolvency of the banks will not only be revealed but it will trigger legal ramifications .
The banks will have to be re-organized .
This will mean breaking them up .
It will mean that the holders of the securities of the banks will face large losses , even larger than are now being reflected in the current market prices .
A government bailout does the following .
It preserves the bank organization .
It preserves the current bank management .
It transfers taxpayer wealth to the security holders of the bank ( bondholders , preferred stockholders , and stockholders ) .
It transfers wealth to counterparties to other contracts that the bankers entered into .
Why is any of this necessary ?
What is so precious about these banks ?
Have n’t they demonstrated a level of high incompetence ?
Should n’t that spell their doom ?
Heads I win , tails I win .
That is the deal that Bernanke wants for the banks and these associated parties .
Tails — they should be losing .
No one else should be footing the bills .
Citibank or Citigroup is emblematic of the whole tawdry affair .
Why in the world should we be saving Citibank ?
I have been wondering about this for some time before Bernanke ’s latest salvo .
The government already made a complex deal involving over $ 300 billion of this company ’s loans .
What is so special about this bank , other than it has attempted to become a world - girdling enterprise and is failing badly in this endeavor ?
It even has an office two miles from where I write that usually looks barren .
Why should we support the ambitions of a bank like this that is competing with a myriad of other banks in this area alone ?
The reasons given by Bernanke are absurd ( " to promote a lasting recovery unless they are accompanied by strong measures to further stabilize and strengthen the financial system , … " ) .
Promoting overcapacity and singling out inefficient banks for the grace of taxpayer dollars does not promote a lasting recovery and it surely does not strengthen the financial system .
Shifting the assets of Citibank , such as they are , to higher - valued uses through re-organization is a sound way to promote recovery and strengthen the economy .
But this path would require that a lot of Bernanke ’s favorites would bear losses .
It would mean a rather different banking system might emerge that influential members of the Fed , who apparently shape its recommendations and bailouts , do not want .
What cheek !
What effrontery !
What brazen thievery !
How disgusting !
The losses of the banks are already to a large extent reflected in the lower security prices of the stocks and bonds of the banks .
However , investors do not yet know fully what these losses are because the bankers have not yet recognized and reported on them fully in their accounting or in any other way .
If the government were not available as a possible trash bin , the banks would be forced into re-organization , and that is as it should be .
Banks , in Bernanke ’s world , are not only to have insured deposits that lead them to make risky loans , investments , mergers , and expansions into all sorts of lines of business , which are overlooked by regulators such as the Fed and even encouraged by them , but they are also to be bailed out by government financing when these investments turn sour !
With the S&Ls , we had outright fraud engineered by S&L owners .
With the banks , we have the equivalent bad incentives and the equivalent massive losses , but with the blessing and participation of the Fed and the government .
It is a monstrous fraud in all but name , perpetrated in plain view .
I wish the whole dreary episode were over , but instead each day I am punished by more dreadful trial balloons and suggestions such as the latest emanating from Bernanke .
There seems no end to the extent of it .
Obama , the candidate of hope , comes across to me as a clueless patsy in this affair .
If he understands any economics at all , he surely does not show it , not yet .
According to the Wall Street Journal , he wants the second half of the $ 700 billion so that he wo n’t be caught without emergency funds if financial markets weaken further .
" In consultation with the business community and my top economic advisers , it is clear that the financial system , although improved from where it was in September , is still fragile …
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me , with the first $ 350 billion already spent , to enter into the administration without any potential ammunition should there be some sort of emergency or weakening of the financial system . "
The model being used by Obama and his advisers is that one shoots dollars at bear markets and failing firms , which is what the weaker financial system really means , and that these dollars cure the losses in value .
( These dollars are of course printed up . )
The idea is that one cures lower asset prices by injecting dollars into the system somehow .
This inane idea parallels the equally inane idea of FDR and his advisers when he took office in 1932 that the cure was to raise the prices of goods and services .
Prices of assets fall because investors are forecasting worse business prospects and lower future cash flows of businesses .
They are recognizing uses of capital that are not productive in a financial sense , that is , the recovery of one ’s investment in terms of a cash flow return is too meager and too long - delayed to justify existing asset prices , and so these prices must fall .
The injection of dollars into the system does absolutely nothing to cure the unproductiveness of capital .
All it does is divert resources to still other uses that are unproductive .
The decisions as to what is productive or not cannot be lodged in the hands of marshals in Washington loaded with six - guns ready to shoot billion dollar bullets every which way .
They have no idea what the capital pricing should be or where capital should be shifted or what enterprises should receive new capital .
They are politicians , economists , lobbyists , and lawyers .
And , by the way , the title of economist does not by any means suggest that a person knows anything about the ins and outs of business or what businesses should receive capital or not .
Academic economists often talk and act as if they know it all , but there is no evidence that they do .
There is no evidence that any person or even group of persons is able to understand and direct an entire economy .
Even in individual markets , the entrepreneurs closest to the action make frequent mistakes .
Directing a " financial system " to a condition of stability and progress with $ 350 billion is a task beyond the scope of Mr. Obama and Mr. Summers or all the king ’s horses and men .
They can only throw sand into the gears .
They need only look at the actions of their predecessors and the directives of past administrations who brought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into being , who encouraged subprime lending , who allowed insurance companies to endanger policyholders by writing credit insurance , and who recently have fallen into a $ 150 billion black hole with AIG .
Closer to home , they might look at the long list of government actions in the past 15 months that have , more often than not , ultimately been associated with lower prices of stocks and corporate bonds .
It is obvious to all but those in government that the markets are attempting to mark prices down to realistic values and that this will facilitate recovery .
The markets are attempting to weed out inefficient firms .
It is obvious that there is overcapacity in some lines of production and some asset classes , and this capital must be priced out at market and brought into uses that are economic at the new and lower prices .
It is obvious that the capital structures supporting many of these investments likewise have to be marked down in price and a good deal of it must disappear altogether .
This is what deleveraging means .
It is evident that there are losses to be borne by those who invested in these assets and those who hold this capital .
The government ’s attempts to stem these adjustments are futile and counter - productive .
Its wealth transfers , which are nothing more than theft , resolve nothing .
The economy will recover in spite of government action , not because of it , and be delayed in doing it at that .
The Fed ’s attempts to bail out its clients are worse than futile .
They are blatant theft .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
Americans are going through election withdrawal , trying to adjust to life without poll numbers .
Really , we ’ve heard quite a bit of whining on this subject lately .
But there ’s still Minnesota !
The U.S. Senate race there is up in the air .
You may want to consider becoming totally obsessed with it , jumping out of bed every morning and racing to the computer to check for the latest vote count .
Or perhaps not .
Still , it ’s something to hang on to .
There are actually three Senate races that are undecided , and if the Democrats won them all , they ’d hit the magic filibuster - proof number of 60 .
Alaska , determined to continue in its role as the vortex of all things politically strange , still has n’t counted tens of thousands of ballots .
Georgia has a Senate runoff Dec. 2 , and the Democrats have dispatched tons of canvassers to help their candidate , Jim Martin .
Martin is a long shot , but we should all be grateful that they ’ve found something to do with the Obama campaign workers , who would otherwise have been set loose to wander the country , muttering about change and attempting to register household pets to vote .
But we digress .
About Minnesota .
Right now , the incumbent Republican , Norm Coleman , is about 200 votes ahead of the Democratic challenger , the former comedian Al Franken .
In a race where 2.9 million votes were cast , Coleman is leading 41.99 percent to 41.98 percent .
• Reports of more than 40 killed in and around UN shelter • 12 members of family killed in Gaza City air strike
The civilian death toll in Gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive .
Two Israeli tank shells struck the school in Jabaliya refugee camp , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , according to news agency reports .
The medical director of the hospital in Jabaliya told the Guardian 41 bodies had been brought in so far and more could be on the way .
Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes .
In addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , hospital officials said .
The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports .
A United Nations official in Gaza said the school was clearly marked with a UN flag and its location had been reported to Israeli authorities .
John Ging , director of operations in Gaza for UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , said that three artillery shells landed at the perimeter of the school where 350 people were taking shelter .
" Of course it was entirely inevitable if artillery shells landed in that area there would be a high number of casualties , " he said .
Asked whether there were Hamas militants in the area at the time of the attack , Ging said it was the scene of clashes " so there 's an intense military and militant activity in that area . "
He said UN staff vetted Palestinians seeking shelter at their facilities to make sure militants were not taking advantage of them .
" So far we 've not had violations by militants of our facilities , " he said .
Ging called for an independent investigation of the strikes near UN facilities .
" I saw a lot of women and children wheeled in , " Fares Ghanem , a hospital official told the Associated Press .
" A lot of the wounded were missing limbs and a lot of the dead were in pieces . "
Majed Hamdan , an AP photographer , who rushed to the scene shortly after the attacks , said many children were among the dead .
" I saw women and men parents slapping their faces in grief , screaming , some of them collapsed to the floor .
They knew their children were dead , " he said .
" In the morgue , most of the killed appeared to be children .
In the hospital , there was n't enough space for the wounded . "
Elsewehere , at least 12 members of an extended family , including seven young children , were killed in an air strike on their house in Gaza City .
The bodies of the Daya family were pulled from the rubble of a house in Gaza city 's Zeitoun district after it was hit by two Israeli missiles .
The dead included seven children aged from one to 12 years , three women and two men .
Nine other people were believed to be trapped in the rubble .
Hours earlier , three young men – all cousins – died when the Israelis bombed another UN school , the Asma primary school in Gaza City .
They were among about 400 people who sought shelter there after fleeing their homes in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza .
The UN , which said the school in Jabaliya was clearly marked , said it was " strongly protesting these killings to the Israeli authorities and is calling for an immediate and impartial investigation " .
" Where it is found that international humanitarian law has been violated , those responsible must be held to account .
Under international law , installations such as schools , health centres and UN facilities should be protected from attack .
Well before the current fighting , the UN had given to the Israeli authorities the GPS co-ordinates of all its installations in Gaza , including Asma elementary school . "
The killings take the total toll in Palestinian lives since the Israelis launched their assault on the Gaza Strip 11 days ago to above 600 .
Doctors at Gaza hospitals say that at least one - fifth of the victims are children and a large number of women are among the dead .
Israel continues to insist that the bulk of those killed are Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters , although its claim to be going to extraordinary lengths to target only " terrorists " has been undermined by one of its own tanks firing on a building being used by Israeli troops , killing four .
The sharp spike in the number of civilian casualties came as Israeli troops and tanks moved into Gaza 's second largest city , Khan Younis , for the first time today , supported by intensive artillery strikes as the military pledged to press on with its attack .
In a separate attack earlier in the day , three Palestinians were killed in an air strike on another school run by Unwra , the UN relief agency .
Nine Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict .
At least five rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel today , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 17 miles from Tel Aviv , police said .
A three - year - old girl was wounded .
The heaviest fighting has been in northern Gaza , with witnesses reporting wave after wave of bombing strikes across the north of the territory accompanied by gunfire from helicopters and artillery from land and sea .
Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered to leave their homes or forced to flee the fighting .
In Shajaiyeh , east of Gaza City , Israeli troops seized control of three apartment blocks and set up gun positions on the rooftops .
Residents were locked in their homes and soldiers confiscated their mobile phones , neighbours said .
Three of the four Israeli soldiers killed by friendly fire died when a tank mistakenly fired on a building where the soldiers had taken up positions .
There was heavy artillery fire to cover the evacuation of 24 soldiers who were injured , including the commander of the Golani infantry brigade , one of Israel 's key fighting forces .
Israel 's defence minister , Ehud Barak , said his country 's troops would continue their operation despite mounting Palestinian casualties and growing international calls for a ceasefire .
" Hamas has so far sustained a very heavy blow from us , but we have yet to achieve our objective , and therefore the operation continues , " Barak said .
The Israeli foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , said the offensive was intended to change permanently the shape of Israel 's conflict with Hamas .
" When Israel is targeted , Israel is going to retaliate , " she said .
Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire .
The military said it had bombed more smuggling tunnels across the border with Egypt , in the south , and hit more than 40 other sites across Gaza including buildings storing weapons and rocket launching areas .
In Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , the most senior leader of Hamas in the strip and a hardliner in the movement , appeared on the party 's al - Aqsa television station and gave a defiant speech threatening attacks not only in Gaza but elsewhere .
" The Zionists have legitimised the killing of their children by killing our children .
They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people , " Zahar said .
He urged Hamas fighters to " crush your enemy " .
Another Hamas figure , a recognised military spokesman called Abu Ubaida , said thousands of Hamas fighters were waiting in Gaza to take on the Israeli military , and that rocket attacks would increase .
More than 40 were fired into southern Israel yesterday , including one that landed in an empty kindergarten , which , like all schools near the Gaza border , has been closed since the conflict began ..
Israeli police said a total of 520 rockets had been fired in the past 11 days of fighting .
Israeli troops are now deployed in and around the major urban areas of Gaza , particularly to the north , in Beit Hanoun , Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya .
Using leaflets , telephone calls and radio announcements , they have ordered residents in many areas to leave their homes , forcing at least 15,000 Palestinians to flee to safety elsewhere .
At least 5,000 are staying in 11 different UN schools and shelters .
The UN said more than 1 million Gazans were still without electricity or water and that it was increasingly difficult for staff to distribute aid or reach the injured .
It said more industrial diesel was needed to reopen the strip 's sole power plant , which has been shut for a week .
Ten transformers have been damaged in the fighting .
More wheat grain is needed for food handouts , and the UN said Karni , the main commercial crossing , should be reopened to allow it in .
Four ambulances and three mobile clinics were destroyed when bombs hit the headquarters of the Union of Health Care Committees in Gaza City .
John Holmes , the UN emergency relief coordinator , said Gaza represented an " increasingly alarming " humanitarian crisis , and that the territory was running low on clean water , power , food , medicine and other supplies since Israel began its offensive .
Israeli leaders claim there is no humanitarian crisis .

Why Games ?
Why Now ?
What 's Really Happening Out There ?
The Criminal Motivation
What Can Developers Do ?
Every January , security software firm ESET releases its Global Threat Report -- and this year , online game password security has become a primary concern .
Gamasutra spoke with Jeff Debrosse , ESET 's research director , to learn more .
ESET , a vendor of virus and malware removal solutions -- best known for its Smart Security software -- tracks threats across all aspects of computing , not just games .
But over the course of 2008 , says Debrosse , " We saw [ gaming ] just spiking above all of the malware or types of security threats that we 've seen .
" According to the Global Threat Report , the transition of virus and malware activity from thrill - seeking hackers to criminal syndicates is also what 's driving the targeting of games .
" That 's really the crux of it all , that 's really what it boils down to , " says Debrosse .
" In the past , it was really mischievous .
People would deface a website or send a virus ... something that would be more of just an irritant .
But the criminal element has really figured out that if folks are going to spend their time creating malware , why not make it lucrative at the same time ?
" Games became a natural target , because of the " money trail " crooks follow , says Debrosse .
" It really comes down to the really simple fact of they 're looking for the trail where the most money is amassed ... and in this case the money trail really leads to online gaming .
" Continues Debrosse , " A big part of it is really around the reselling of what I 'd like to call ' virtual assets ' , whether it be the actual characters themselves ... weaponry , shields , energy , any of those things that you can actually transfer in the virtual world ... that 's the goal behind getting the username and the password , and literally stripping it of all of its assets .
" But it 's not that the games themselves are compromised by the malware creators , though , cautions Debrosse - rather , the user 's machines are hacked to extract their passwords .
Attackers rely on more traditional , broader tactics -- tools like social engineering , or interacting with and convincing players to fall victim to attacks .
This helps them introduce viruses and malware , like keystroke - logging Trojan horses .
Debrosse notes , " From a research perspective , we look at the amount of malware that we 're detecting that 's targeting password stealing -- Trojans specifically -- that 's built for games .
We can see that when we reverse engineer [ the software ] , that it 's trying to get passwords and it's targeted to certain strings ... and that has grown immensely over the last 12 months .
" The method ?
Debrosse explains : " It 's a two - phase attack .
If someone 's account was compromised , then someone else can actually [ using their avatar ] during a chat session , or through in - game communication ... they could leverage that people trust this person and point them at various URLs , and those URLs will either have drive - by malware or a specific [ malware ] executable .
" " What ends up happening is that folks may end up downloading and using it .
This is just one methodology .
" These attackers also target gamers in external community sites , says Debrosse , through " banners on websites or URLs in chat rooms or forums " -- which can lead to unsafe URLs .
" If [ users ] do n't have adequate protection , they could very well be downloading malware without their knowledge .
"
" The folks that are trying to get your credentials , your username and password , to get something from you , or to get you even to click on malware -- it all comes down to armchair psychology .
A lot of the infections do not occur without user interaction .
" What drives these criminals , and why do n't they typically try to hack game clients directly ?
Says Debrosse , " What it comes down to ...
Someone who's on the non-criminal side tries to look at what their return on investment is .
"
" The criminal element is thinking , ' Well , if I could just steal these credentials through a social engineering / malware method ... it 's easier to capture it from a keylogger than it is to create a specially - targeted piece of malware for that game ' .
" And what 's the major target ?
It 's no surprise , says Debrosse .
" is the big prize for a lot of these criminals , because they know that there is a lot of in - world commerce and value , and they go for where the money is , and they know that there 's a lot of money tied into . "
" It 's a volume game with them .
Even if they do n't get a lot per account , there are a lot of accounts they can go after .
" Though gamers can discover that their characters have been stolen and petition MMO customer service reps for assistance , it may be too late .
These attackers often move quickly , strip the account of goods , and sell them off at bargain prices -- and once they have the money , they 're gone .
" Because it 's at an attractive price , and the games are so popular , they 'll have quite a few takers , " Debrosse says .
" It 's fairly quick , the process is done ... if [ the stolen equipment ] can be tracked down , the person who paid for it is out of luck at that point .
They 're gone , they 've made their money , and they 're going to move on to the next victim .
" According to Debrosse , " The developers are doing a fairly good job .
It 's not that the games themselves have all of these vulnerabilities where someone can exploit them .
"
" The problem comes around the client operating system , where the user is .
It typically comes back to a user problem .
It 's user behaviors that come back , that level them vulnerable to someone exploiting them . " " There 's no software that 's 100 % , you 'll always find some vulnerability , " Debrosse maintains .
" But what we 've found from the stealing of online gaming credentials , it revolves around that malware and that social engineering , and if you were to figure out the root cause , it 's someone doing something not correct -- trying to run stolen software , or clicking on a bad URL .
" While developers could put more warnings in games and forums to try and deter users from trusting strangers with their sensitive information , or to avoid clicking on external URLs , social engineering often wins over automatic messages .
Debrosse does think that " if the developers were able to continue adding verbiage , to educate or remind their gamers " that security is important , there might be a positive effect .
However , he also warns that , between human interaction and automated messaging , " there 's a tremendous difference in effectiveness ...
There 's this thing called click fatigue .
If you were to pop up these warnings ... people just want to click their way through so they can get started .
" There are also some possible technical aides .
For example , Blizzard has introduced theauthenticator RSA key generator .
This is a physical token device that allows you to augment account security by entering a specially generated password created by the device every time you log in .
But stopping attacks , in general , has little to do with adding better security to games .
Debrosse concludes : " It does come down to something as simple as behavior modification .
That behavior -- having not risky behavior online , but having a more careful , more insightful personality online , " is what will protect users from having their accounts violated .
What might have been the biggest tech headline of the year " Technology Investment Saves Auto Industry " did n't quite happen .
The Senate shot down the House 's $ 15 billion compromise plan to loan the money that Congress originally appropriated in Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 for fuel - efficiency technology development to be used as a bridge loan to see GM and Chrysler through the liquidity crisis .
But there was plenty of other news being made in the tech arena .
Here were my favorite stories of 2008 :
1. Cellulosic Ethanol 's For Real !
Early in the year we reported on Coskata 's plans to produce ethanol by superheating any carbon - rich feedstock ( corn stalks , wood chips , plastic bottles , tires , etc. ) to turn it into carbon - monoxide and hydrogen , then feeding this " syngas " to special microbes that breathe it in and sweat out pure ethanol at an estimated ; production cost of under $ 1/ gallon .
Plans were announced for a demonstration plant to be located at the Westinghouse Plasma Center near Pittsburg , opening in early 2009 , followed by a full - scale operation in 2011 , but economic woes have appear to have pushed back the timing of the demo plant . ;
Technologue : Booze Clues
2. Cellulosic Ethanol 's REALLY for Real !
Then we reported on Mascoma 's totally different Consolidated Bioprocessing ( CBP ) method of breaking down the lignin in various non-food plant materials and fermenting it into ethanol using designer microbes that mimic what happens in a cow 's digestive system in breaking down .
Production cost is estimated at $ 1- 1.50 / gallon , demonstration plants are in the works in Rome , NY and Kinross , MI , with full - scale production targeted at 2011 .
GM Partners with Mascoma on Cellulosic Ethanol
3. Cellulose is For Real !
The third piece of the puzzle -- economically viable plant materials to feed these ethanol facilities -- came from Ceres .
The first bio-engineered high - yield switchgrass and sorghum varietals tailored to suit different climates and ethanol production methods went on sale in December .
They boast high - yield density , require little fertilizer and less water than most crops , and they can grow in marginal soil .
Keep your fingers crossed that the processing plants get built in time to turn these plants into fuel .
Technologue : Whiter Lightning
4 . If not Ethanol , Maybe Methanol ?
Lotus trotted out a methanol - powered Exige concept car at the Geneva show that encouraged the world to have another look at the world 's simplest alcohol .
With only one carbon , CH3 - OH can be produced more easily than ethanol , so the scientists say .
Its high - octane rating would allow engines running on pure methanol to run diesel compression ratios for better output and efficiency .
Cold - starting is a problem , but hydrogen generated by using exhaust heat to crack the Hs of the methanol molecule could solve that problem and boost efficiency too .
There are even some fuel cells that run directly on methanol .
5. Greenhouse - Gasses - to - Methanol .
Imagine turning that CO2 everyone 's always moaning about into fuel and driving a mile in someone else 's carbon footprint !
There are several technologies in the works : big louvered scrubbers coated with sodium hydroxide that absorb CO2 are said to be capable of offsetting coal - generated power equivalent to twice as much as the windmill could generate .
Exotic catalysts are in the works that might one use solar energy to mimic the way chlorophyll breaks down CO2 , which could then combined with hydrogen split from water , perhaps using sunlight and titanium catalysts .
It 's tech worth watching .
Technologue : Reusing CO2
6. If Not Alcohol , Maybe Ammonia ?
Pure NH3 boasts a 110 octane rating and burning it in a combustion engine releases pure nitrogen and water -- no CO2 , ' cuz there 's no carbon .
Ammonia is the second most widely produced chemical , it stores and transports like propane ( liquid under light pressure at room temperature ) and is already distributed nationwide for use as fertilizer .
A slow flame front means you need multiple spark plugs and the engine wo n't rev all that high , but it could be the perfect way to remove agriculture from the Global Warming debate .
7. What About Electric Power ?
If vehicle electrification manages to take off like Congress and the environmentalists hope , we 're headed for a potential neodymium - supply shortage .
This rare - earth metal is used to make permanent - magnet motors .
But the Chorus Meshcon electric motor is an AC - induction type motor that manages to deliver the efficient low - end torque of a permanent magnet motor with the light weight , lower cost , and better high - speed performance of an AC induction motor , thanks to a mesh - connected winding that can change the number of magnetic poles and the alternating - current frequency .
Look for it next year on the nose - gear of Delta 's new Boeing 737s , and on cars in the near future .
Technologue : Flying Hybrids !
8. Race - Ready Hybrids ?
Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems ( KERS ) will be permitted in Formula 1 in 2009 , so most teams are reportedly working on " hybridizing " their cars .
My favorite was a small flywheel that connected to the transmission 's output shaft via an infinitely variable toroidal friction - drive transmission .
Gear reductions along the way allow the flywheel to reach 64,500 rpm ( it operates in a vacuum , using special high - speed bearings that reportedly seal tight ) .
Storing the FIA - mandated maximum of 400 KJ of energy keeps the flywheel small and light enough to be safely contained ( unlike the one in the still - born Chrysler Patriot prototype ) .
As of press time we 're unaware of any team using this system by Flybrid Systems LLP , of Silverstone , England at the start of the season , but watch for it .
Technologue : Blessing & KERS
9. VVT For Smarties .
Ford has come up with a better ( more elegant ) way of achieving variable valve timing by capitalizing on waste energy .
Most cam phasers rotate the camshaft using oil pressure delivered by the engine - oil pump , but this can be problematic at low engine speeds and at low temperatures during vehicle startup .
Ford engineers noticed that the oil pressure in the chambers that rotate the cam fluctuated just before and after the nose of each cam rotated past its valve tappet , and decided to harness these little pressure spikes .
Voila .
Less oil pressure is needed and more cam rotation is possible as low as 1500 rpm , all of which helps boost economy and performance .
Ford Gets Phased -- Using Free Energy
10 . Lights , Cameras , Action .
Digital CMOS cameras are becoming so cheap that we 'll be seeing a lot of them on cars in the very near future , starting off with high - end luxmobiles like the next Mercedes E- and S - class sedans .
Cameras keep an eye out for traffic ahead of the vehicle and tailor the lighting pattern to reach as far as possible without blinding oncoming cars ; an infrared camera provides an enhanced night - view image in the dash that also identifies and highlights pedestrians ; and the various cameras will also inform the lane - keeping assist and Pre-Safe systems to warn a distracted driver of impending doom .

By Lázaro Barredo Medina
Granma International -- October 30 , 2008 -- " The dictatorship has been defeated .
The joy is immense .
And yet , there still remains much to do .
We wo n’t deceive ourselves by believing that everything will be much easier from now on ; perhaps it will be much more difficult . "
This is what Commander in Chief Fidel Castro told the people on January 8 , 1959 , the day of his entry into Havana .
Many people could never imagine the immense challenge that they would live to experience .
Suffice it to say that just a few days later , Fidel proclaimed the right to self - determination in terms of relations with the United States and immediately , the aggressions , attempts on his life and anger on the part of US politicians began , evidence of which can be seen in speeches and articles of the time , as in an editorial of Time magazine , the mouthpiece of the most conservative sectors , entitled : " Fidel Castro ’s neutralism is a challenge for the United States . "
But the Cuban people could not be neutral in the face of the United States .
The triumph of the Revolution that January 1959 signified for the Cuban nation , for the first time in its history , the real possibility of exercising the right to self - determination .
From that moment on , neither the US president , Congress nor its ambassadors could continue making decisions on what could or could not be done in Cuba .
The bitter dependence had been brought to an end ; a dependence that saw US governors and ambassadors enjoying a degree of power in Cuba that was far greater than the actual power that they had – with respect to decision - making – within the US federal government or in relation to any of the 50 states that make up the USA .
When full national independence was achieved , the Revolution began to exercise that right by immediately applying the program that Fidel had announced during the Moncada trial of 1953 and which is contained in his historic self - defence speech History Will Absolve Me .
Dependence on US ends
Cuba established the economic and social regime that it believed was most just and established a socialist state with participatory democracy , equality and social justice .
The country ’s economy was characterised by limited industrial development , essentially depending on sugar production and a latifundia agricultural economy , where landowners controlled 75 % of the total arable land .
Most of the country ’s economic activity and its mineral resources were managed by US capital , which controlled 1.2 million hectares of land ( a quarter of the productive territory ) and most of the sugar industry , nickel production , oil refineries , the electricity and telephone services and the majority of bank credits .
Likewise , the US market controlled approximately 70 % of Cuban imports and exports , within a system of highly dependent volumes of exchange : in 1958 , Cuba exported products worth 733 million pesos and imported 777 million pesos worth of goods .
The prevailing social picture was characterised by a high unemployment and illiteracy , a precarious healthcare , social welfare and housing system for the vast majority of the population , as well as abysmal differences in living conditions between urban and rural populations .
There was a high degree of polarisation and unequal distribution of income ; in 1958 , 50 % of the population earned just 11 % of total income , while a 5 % minority controlled 26 % .
Racial and gender discrimination , begging , prostitution and social and administrative corruption were widespread .
Addressing the social and economic problems in Cuban society could no longer be put off and could only be resolved if the Cuban people had control of their own wealth and natural resources .
Thus , using the 1940 constitution and in line with international law , Cuba exercised its right to take control of these resources and assumed total responsibility for this action .
The island paid compensation to all nationals from third countries ( Canada , Spain , Britain , etc. ) with the exception of US nationals , given that that government rejected the provisions outright and transformed the Cuban government ’s decision into a pretext for unleashing a war unprecedented in the history of bilateral relations between the two nations .
Not only did the Revolution hand over land to campesinos who , up until then , had been subjected to semi-feudal conditions of production and forced to live in extreme poverty , but it also determined that that all the country ’s resources should be allocated to national economic development and improving the material and living conditions of the population .
To give just one example , in the 1980s alone , approximately 60 billion pesos were allocated to the construction of productive and social facilities .
Industrialisation
The process of industrialisation underway paved the way for economic and productive diversification .
Under the Revolution and up until the economic crisis which began with the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European socialist bloc between 1989 and 1991 – what we in Cuba call the ``Special Period '' – the country ’s capacity for producing steel grew 14 - fold , fertiliser increased six - fold , the oil - refining industry quadrupled ( not counting the new refinery in Cienfuegos ) , the textile industry grew seven - fold , tourism three - fold , to mention but a few .
The state also created complete new industries such as machinery , mechanics , electronics , the production of medical equipment , a pharmaceutical industry , construction materials , a glass industry and ceramics , as well as making investments to increase and upgrade the sugar , food and light industries .
In addition to these endeavours , we have the development of biotechnology , genetic engineering and other branches of science .
The country has also made great efforts in terms of improving its infrastructure .
Electricity generation has risen eight - fold and water storage capacity has increased 310 times , from 29 million cubic metres in 1958 to nine billion - plus cubic metres today .
There has been diversification with respect to roads and freeways and modernisation of ports and other areas .
Social needs have been covered fairly well , except for housing , which has been Cuba ’s biggest problem .
Social progress
The progressive growth and diversification of productive potential and the application of a widespread social program has allowed the nation to confront the problem of unemployment .
In 1958 , with a population of 6 million inhabitants , approximately one third of the economically active population was unemployed .
Of this figure , 45 % of the unemployed lived in rural areas while , out of 200,000 women in work , 70 % were employed as domestic servants .
Today , with 11 million inhabitants , the number of people in work is in excess of 4.5 million .
More than 40 % of workers are women and today they represent more than 60 % of the nation ’s technical and professional sectors .
In 1958 , the number of illiterate and semi-illiterate people in Cuba stood at 2 million .
The average academic level of 15 - plus - year - olds was third grade , more than 600,000 children did not attend school and 58 % of teachers were unemployed .
Just 45.9 % of school - age children were enrolled and half of them did not attend classes .
Only 6 % of those enrolled finished elementary education .
Universities were available to just 20,000 students .
The education sector received immediate attention from the revolutionary government .
Its first task was to develop a mass literacy campaign with the participation of the population .
An extensive network of schools was constructed throughout the country and more than 300,000 teachers and professors were in full - time employment in this sector .
The average academic level for 15 - plus - year - olds rose to ninth grade .
One - hundred per cent of school - age children are enrolled in schools , some 98 % complete elementary education and 91 % complete junior high .
One in every 11 citizens is a university graduate and one in eight has technical - professional qualifications .
There are 650,000 students in the country ’s universities today and all education is free of charge .
Education and vocational skills are also guaranteed for 100 % of children with physical or mental disabilities , who attend special schools .
The precarious situation in 1958 with respect to public health was characterised by an infant mortality rate of 60 per 1000 live births and a maternal mortality rate of 118 per 10,000 .
The mortality rate for those suffering from gastroenteritis was 41.2 per 100,000 , and from tuberculosis , 15.9 per 100,000 .
In rural areas , 36 % of the population suffered from intestinal parasites , 31 % from malaria , 14 % from tuberculosis and 13 % from typhoid .
Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 58.8 years .
Around 61 % of hospital beds and 65 % of the nation ’s 6500 doctors were concentrated in the capital .
In the other provinces , medical coverage was one doctor for every 2378 inhabitants and there was just one hospital for all the country ’s rural areas .
Today , healthcare is free of charge and Cuba has more than 70,000 doctors , providing coverage of one for every 194 inhabitants .
Almost 30,000 of them are providing services in more than 60 different countries .
A national network of more than 700 hospitals and polyclinics has been created .
Thanks to a widespread vaccination campaign ( every child currently receives vaccines against 13 different illnesses ) diseases such as polio , diphtheria , measles , whooping cough , tetanus , rubella , mumps and hepatitis B have been almost entirely eradicated .
The infant mortality rate is now 5.3 for every 1000 live births and life expectancy exceeds 77 years .
There is also a series of advanced medical services that are not considered as " basic " in the international arena , and are provided completely free of charge , such as intensive care units in pediatric and general hospitals , cardiovascular surgery , transplant services , special perinatal care , treatment for chronic renal failure , and special services for occupational and physical rehabilitation .
Democracy
The revolutionary state did not focus its attention solely on economic and social measures .
It also embarked on efforts to establish an internal legal system to facilitate the right to self - determination via the population ’s direct participation in discussions , analyses and the passing of the country ’s principal laws .
The most notable of these was the 1976 constitution , supported by 97 % of Cubans aged 16 and over through a referendum , as well as other momentous laws like the Penal Code , the Civil Code , the Family Code , the Children and Young People ’s Code , the Labour and Social Security Code and many others .
Likewise , the self - determination of the Cuban people is expressed through the right to defend the nation against foreign aggression .
Today , more than four million Cubans – workers , campesinos and university students – are organised in militia groups have access to weapons in their campuses , factories and in rural areas .
US aggression
However , since 1959 , Cuba has had to confront the hostility of ten US administrations that have attempted to limit its right to national self - determination through the use of aggression and the unilateral imposition of a criminal economic , commercial and financial blockade .
One of the universally accepted principles of international law is that state cannot be allowed to coerce another in order to deny it the right to exercise its sovereign rights .
Article 24 of the UN Charter states that , in the context of international relations , nations must refrain from using threats or force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state .
Over the past 45 years , the United States has prohibited any trade with Cuba , including foodstuffs and medicines ; it cancelled the Cuban sugar quota ; prohibited its citizens from travelling to Cuba via the imposition of heavy sanctions ; prohibited the re-export of US products or items containing US components or technology to Cuba from third countries ; prescribed that banks in third countries should maintain Cuban bank accounts in US dollars or use that currency in their transactions with Cuba ; has systematically intervened to prevent or hinder trade with or financial assistance to Cuba on the part of governments , institutions and citizens from other countries and international organisations .
In the 1960s these reprisals forced Cuba to structurally reconstitute its economic relations and establish its essential markets in countries in the former East European bloc – specifically in the Soviet Union – which meant that the country had to embark on an almost total re-conversion of its industrial technology , means of transport , and provisions , etc .
When Cuba lost its natural markets in Eastern Europe , the US government intensified its blockade via the 1992 Torricelli Act , which used the pretext of " democracy and human rights " to prohibit US subsidiaries located in third countries and subject to the laws of those nations from engaging in commercial or financial operations with Cuba ( particularly in respect to food and medicines ) , and punishing these by prohibiting the entry into US ports for 180 days of vessels transporting goods to or from Cuba or on behalf of Cuba , measures that – given their extraterritorial nature – do not just prejudice Cuba but also harm the sovereignty of other nations and the international freedom of transportation .
On March 12 , 1996 , the US government passed the Helms - Burton Act , further aggravating relations between the two countries and assuming the right to sanction citizens of third countries in US courts , as well as determining their expulsion or denying them and their families entry visas into the United States , with the aim of hindering Cuba ’s efforts to recover its economy and hampering its possibilities of securing a greater insertion in the international market .
That was also a way of attempting to pressure the Cuban people into relinquishing their efforts of self - determination .
More recently , it has adopted the Bush Plan , an attempt to transform Cuba into a colony through an annexationist program and the intention to intervene via a pretext of " transition " , a scenario in which the US State Department would entrust one of its leaders as " governor " , when the Cuban revolutionary state disappears .
This plan , with which US President George W. Bush decided " to precipitate the day when Cuba becomes a free country " , has intensified the blockade and pressure on the Cuban people by repressing family relations between Cubans resident in the United States and their families on the island ; grants million - dollar resources to terrorist groups in Miami , as well as to mercenary subordinates in the US Interests Sections in Havana ; and promotes formulas to destabilise the country and redouble international pressure on the island .
US terrorism
That hostility on the part of the US has included other notorious manifestations of aggression , ranging from the military aggression through the Bay of Pigs in 1961 , the dirty war carried out by counterrevolutionary gangs heavily supplied by the US CIA , bacteriological warfare on agricultural crops ( sugar , tobacco and citric fruits ) , animals ( swine fever ) and humans ( hemorrhagic dengue ) , to sabotage plans , bombings using pirate planes and assassination attempts on the country ’s principal leaders .
The actions of terrorist organisations executing military attacks on Cuba from US territory are notorious , and are publicised and fomented by the Miami media .
Groups are constantly recruiting adventurers who are willing to head off to Cuba as agents and saboteurs , who openly declare that they have no fear whatsoever of being brought to justice in US courts .
That is why Cuban patriots have had to leave aside their personal interests to serve those of the nation , even sacrificing their family relationships , in order to infiltrate the ranks of those terrorist groups in order to discover their activities and , with this information , prevent the bloodshed of Cuban and US people .
They are willing to pay the price of the political irrationality of the US government , as is the case of the five Cuban heroes unjustly incarcerated in US jails for combating terrorism .
The above is compounded by the heavy military mechanism created by the United States around Cuba and its constant tension - generating activities , as well as the illegal occupation of the Guantánamo Naval Base on Cuban territory ( today converted into a horrific prison camp ) , a part of Cuba rented out by force to the United States in the early 20th century and which the US government refuses to return .
In the early 1990s , with the disappearance of the Soviet Union , isolated and reviled by the international reaction , Cuba absorbed the terrible blow of losing the bulk of its markets in a matter of months and an abrupt descent in its gross domestic product .
But the island confirmed that it shone with its own light and that it had never been a satellite of anyone , given that it was able to face that juncture on account of the extraordinary resistance of the majority of Cubans , who have acted on the basis of authentic motivations , values and ethical principles .
Challenges of the revolution
The Cuban people have made a conscious decision to support the country ’s leadership , not only because they identify the system with their own interests , but also because of the responsible manner in which the state took on the crisis , reorganised its forces and designed a recovery strategy , despite the US blockade and conditions imposed by its European allies .
The sacrifices provoked by that situation have been hard , but it has been possible to endure them because of the undisputed social advances attained , because of the confidence deposited in the country ’s leading institutions and because of people ’s appreciation that their government is not a decadent one or one that is in management crisis or lacking in strategies , but has confirmed that the population has remained at the centre of all its work , even in the most difficult circumstances .
Fifty years have gone by and the liberation process has reached this point following the same direction indicated that night , 50 years ago , when Fidel , speaking to the huge crowd awaiting him in what was the dictatorship ’s headquarters , affirmed that everything could be more difficult in the future , because we would have to fight to make the Revolution .
That is the challenge of the struggle currently underway to eradicate vices and exalt virtues , with Fidel as a soldier of ideas serving as a compass in the fight for freedom and independence .
Cuba ’s enemies are backing their all on the opposite of that .
In this world , where politics is a caricature , they cannot comprehend that , in its thinking and action , this revolution is a process of continuity , and that Fidel will continue to be the leader of the Revolution of today and tomorrow , because , beyond responsibilities and titles , he will continue to be the counsellor of ideas to which we will always have recourse .

Ben Stein described the brouhaha over his selection as commencement speaker at the University of Vermont as “ laughable ” on Tuesday called the whole episode “ pathetic . ” …
“ I am far more pro-science than the Darwinists , ” Stein said later in an e-mail .
“ I want all scientific inquiry to happen — not just what the ruling clique calls science . ”
Stein ’s comments came a day after UVM President Dan Fogel announced that Stein , whom Fogel had invited to address UVM ’s commencement in May , would not be coming after all .
Fogel said that his selection of Stein generated an intense protest , that he received hundreds of angry e-mails over the weekend , and that after he shared these “ profound concerns ” with Stein , Stein “ immediately and most graciously declined our commencement invitation . ” …
Stein called the university ’s response to the furor “ chicken sh** , and you can quote me on that . ”
“ I like Dr. Fogel , ” Stein wrote , “ and feel sorry he is caught in the meat grinder of political correctness .
My heart goes out to him .
He ’s a great guy trying to do his best in difficult circumstances . ”
The computer game series Civilization created by Sid Meier manages to find a spot near the top of every list of top computer games of all time .
As a moderate game enthusiast , I agree with such a placement .
It is an addictive game that remains enjoyable long after being dated by better software technology .
There are three versions created in the last 15 years with a fourth due in 2005 , but previews show it will not likely address many of the challenges to the realism that I address here .
The title reveals the massiveness of its scope .
You start as an ancient tribe just inventing the wheel and the alphabet with continuous progression in time to the modern world and beyond .
Libertarians and anarchists who have played have probably grumbled at the portrayal of government .
' Anarchy ' in the game is the period of chaos , revolution , and poor productivity experienced when switching between supposedly more stable and permanent forms of government .
Despotism is the original form of government at the dawn of civilization , and different government types are ' discovered ' through research , and democracy is considered the most advanced and generally advantageous form to have in the game .
Having played the game , I thought it would be good to have a more realistic and thus libertarian version of the game .
However , the game requires a government to be controlled by the player in order for there to be a game to actually play .
Trying to imagine an anarchist version , I could only think that being able to control a single individual unable to control the choices of even your own anarchist society , I gave up the thought of reconciling the political flaws of the game in a manner to retain the entertainment value .
The series has tried to make entertaining scenarios where a player can play real historical wars and events .
Some scenarios it could do moderately well such as the World Wars .
However , George W. Bush 's current War on Iraq could not even remotely be recreated within the design framework of the Civilization series .
Not only does it fail completely to accurately model human nature in government , it equally fails to model 4th generation war .
An attempt to make a Civilization game model of the Iraq war would have one enormous problem .
It could correctly model the three week conquest of Iraq , but that is it .
In the Civilization game , that would be the end of war , end of story .
Iraq with its oil reserves would then be a part of the American Empire .
Destroyed infrastructure would have to be replaced , but citizens would go from pawns of one state to pawns of another without any further opposition or guerilla war .
Judging by Bush administration pre-war statements , it seems they might have based their lack of post - invasion strategy on playing Civilization .
But what would be the best way to model the fundamental nature of real civilization to replicate all these historical events ?
While seeking this answer , I discovered that real civilization with its major complexities could in fact be modeled into a playable game .
The existing series starts with nomads settling down starting their first non-nomadic village .
This dawn of land - bound agriculture should not begin with despotism as Sid Meier has it , but the opposite : anarchism .
In a world of wide open spaces and nomadic lifestyle , those who want to leave can easily do so , and chasing them down to enslave them would be an impossible task , so any government must be wholly by consent at the start of the game .
What ' you the player ' as a people are is not a state , but a people / culture / tribe .
( I could add nation , but the modern meaning of nation has changed . )
The existing games blur this distinction , just as state propaganda would not have us comprehend the difference .
However , it is true that this ' people ' -- either yours or other peoples in the game -- could become a state , and likely many will .
It happened historically , and the game would be inaccurate if perpetual blissful anarchy was the norm .
This possibility starts after agricultural former nomads become fixed to the land , forgetting the nomadic way of life , and space constraints first make escape less likely to succeed .
Two societies cross , often in competition for relatively scarce resources .
Language barriers naturally exist , but were not modeled in the Civilization games .
These societies can either spend the effort to learn to practice peaceful trade , learning your neighbor tribe 's language , going to war , or some combination .
Whenever one formerly anarchist tribe conquers another one , a state is born .
But if there is no complete genocide , and the loser is made to pay tribute , tax , or enslaved , then this new combined dual society has castes and / or classes .
The existing games would make such a conquest the end of game for the conquered , and the conquered take on the culture and identity of the victor .
Instead , this should not be the end of game for the conquered .
In reality , the conquered people live on , and may fight against the state , either within its laws by trying to change them , outside the law of the state for their own higher law , or some combination .
Eventually they could seek to emigrate somewhere where they can have more control over maintaining their identity .
One particularly interesting historical people that any realistic Civilization game should be able to model is the Israelite / Jewish people 's history .
Start from their entry into Egypt per the Torah record .
Joseph was offered a high position in government by the Pharaoh for his management skills , and in return , the Israelites became a privileged caste , whereas the rest of the country became indentured servants .
[ 1]
But as a minority , eventually the tables turned and the influence of the masses turned their privilege to slavery , from which they eventually made their Exodus .
After the Exodus they are again a free society , though eventually enslaving themselves to a king .
Part of Israel is then scattered by Assyria to such a degree that they lose their identity .
( In game terms , this loss of self - awareness as a people would be the ' end game - failure ' condition , if this were the whole people . )
Then there is the Roman Diaspora in AD 70 , but the Jews continue to maintain their cultural identity in multiple nations .
This is what should be modeled : A game player controls a united people whom are not bound by force .
The people could stay free , become enslaved in a state , become enslavers in the state , have their identity fade away through assimilation , hostile propaganda , or even genocide by enemies .
If the game player does enslave another people , then at most he can control most of their production .
He can not control their will .
( Though he may try and have some success with propaganda , bread , circuses , and buying allegiance through granting privilege to leaders of the enslaved people . )
Likewise if he is enslaved , he controls his people 's will to resist , the fighting spirit , the counter propaganda , and even attempts to seek friendly cultures to make an alliance against his enslavers .
The factor that unites a people should have a name .
Perhaps the best term for this , get ready . . . is religion .
This may seem odd and incompatible with the reality of multi-cultural cooperation , but there is a type of religion that makes the reality instead of the Plato 's cave type perception .
Are the American Baptists and American Mormons part of the same , or hostile religions ?
They seem to be able to go to war together to kill the Assyrian Orthodox Christian women and children in Iraq and be proud of it as justified collateral damage .
In truth , their religion is not Baptist or Mormon , but American .
Every state is a religion .
Generally we call this worship of state civic religion , with its flags , anthems , pledges of allegiance , rituals , and holidays .
( Notice the etymological origin from holy day . )
States often allow freedom of religion , but by propaganda , forced schooling / brainwashing , and threats to dissenters , it instills the civic religion into the core of every approved religion .
You no longer have to believe that the state or king is God , only the instrument of God to be obeyed and the legitimate maker of laws of right and wrong .
In the existing series , a player is the head of state who must choose how to allocate workers to agriculture , manufacturing , trade , science , entertainment and such fields .
This could still be done similarly in this essay 's revised game concept as a popular leader of a people , and it can be assumed that your people as a people consent to your general wisdom .
( Exceptions nevertheless exist for alienating some people , and you could experience an outflow of people feeling unappreciated . )
If whole cities are entirely of your people , then control of city dynamics could be similar to the existing games .
Some of these cities could be in free anarchies , while others could be controlled and regulated by hostile states demanding tribute .
Individual cities could be mixed cultures , and the trade and interaction of your people could vary by the strengths , weaknesses , peaceful or hostile state of other cultures to yours .
So everyone would want to know , ' How do you model choices between capitalism and socialism ? '
Unfortunately , those terms are too ambiguous .
I can't imagine a capitalism / socialism meter where you choose between 0 - 100 % to represent the two .
Instead , there needs to be meters to choose between tradeoff in voluntary cooperation vs. voluntary competition .
There should be at least two of these :
One internal one for how your own people are treated , and external meters for each of the other peoples that could change based on relative mutual regard between each people .
Too much cooperation makes some people inefficient free riders , but too much internal competition gives no reason for your people to be loyal to you if they could be better off joining some other society .
If a player did create a state , then the game should accurately model the historical difficulty of undoing it .
The creation of a state creates massive privilege among the conquering people .
If a player created a state and then wants to abandon it , realism requires that at most he lead a break off culture ( a counter - culture ) because the portion of his people who obtained privilege would not follow him in this abandonment .
So the game should not only allow for the various mergers between peoples , but even a single culture could split in two .
This game concept will have opponents .
If a player ( even a computer AI ) decides to create a state and subjugate or destroy opposing cultures , then genocide is the inevitable approach against those who refuse subjugation .
Players who likewise try to refuse subjugation will have to survive genocide attempted upon them .
The opponents of this game will claim horrification at the possibility of modeling the Holocaust .
Nevertheless , if the game provides an accurate model of this reality , it provides a means to observe causes of many possible historical or theoretical holocausts .
Is not this a good way to remember the Holocaust to not repeat it in the real world ?
I have no idea if Sid Meier and Co. are too ideologically invested in the inaccuracies of their series to desire these corrections or not .
This concept is different enough from the Civilization series that a competitor could make such a game described here without violating Civilization copyrights if necessary .
Still , this is only a rough outline of the structure of this game concept .
Feel free to add ideas that could be useful to model the real nature of civilization , hopefully to present to a video game company to see if they would create such a game .

A new US study suggests there is a link between marijuana use and elevated risk of the most aggressive form of testicular cancer , with frequent and long term users having the highest risk .
The study was the work of researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington , and other centres in the US and is published early online in the journal Cancer .
The study results show that being a marijuana smoker at the time of diagnosis was linked to a 70 per cent higher risk of testicular cancer .
For men who smoked marijuana at least once a week or who had been smoking it since their teens , the risk was about double that of a man who had never smoked it .
The results also showed that the link with marijuana use might only be with the most aggressive , fast growing form of testicular cancer , nonseminoma .
This type of cancer usually develops in younger men between the age of 20 and 35 , and accounts for approximately 40 per cent of all cases of testicular cancer .
The rate of testicular germ cell tumors ( TGCTs ) has been growing by about 3 to 6 per cent a year for the last 40 to 60 years in the United States , Canada , Europe , Australia and New Zealand , and coincides with a similar rise in the use of marijuana in North American , Europe and Australia .
There are two types of TGCT : the aggressive , fast growing form , nonseminoma , that generally strikes younger men , and the more common , slower form , that generally strikes men in their 30s and 40s .
Previous studies have already shown that regular and frequent use of marijuana affects the human endocrine and reproductive system , and in men this has been linked with reduced testosterone , lower sperm quality , and impotency .
Male infertility and poor semen quality has also been associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer , so the researchers decided to investigate if there was a link between this type of cancer and use of marijuana .
Study author Dr Stephen M Schwartz , an epidemiologist and member of the Public Health Sciences Division at the Hutchinson Center , said in a press statement that :
“ Our study is not the first to suggest that some aspect of a man ’s lifestyle or environment is a risk factor for testicular cancer , but it is the first that has looked at marijuana use . ”
Known risk factors for testicular cancer include family history of the disease , having undescended testes , and problems with testicular development .
There is a widely held theory that the disease starts in the unborn fetus , when fetal germ cells ( the ones that go on to make sperm in adulthood ) do n’t grow properly and become vulnerable to becoming cancerous and that this is further exacerbated by male sex hormones later in life .
As senior author Dr Janet R Daling , another epidemiologist and member of the Hutchinson Center ’s Public Health Sciences Division explained :
“ Just as the changing hormonal environment of adolescence and adulthood can trigger undifferentiated fetal germ cells to become cancerous , it has been suggested that puberty is a ‘ window of opportunity ’ during which lifestyle or environmental factors also can increase the risk of testicular cancer . ”
“ This is consistent with the study ’s findings that the elevated risk of nonseminoma - type testicular cancer in particular was associated with marijuana use prior to age 18 , ” she added .
Daling said she first got the idea for the study when she heard a talk eight years ago that showed the brain and the testes both had cellular receptors for tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC , the main psychoactive component of marijuana .
Since then , she said , other studies have found other sites for these receptors , which are also located in the heart , uterus , spleen and immune system .
The reproductive system of men naturally produces a cannabinoid - like chemical that is thought to protect against cancer tumors , and Daling , Schwartz and colleagues suggested that perhaps marijuana interferes with this protective process .
For the population - based , case - control study , the researchers interviewed 369 Seattle - Puget Sound - area ( in Washington State ) men aged 18 to 44 years who were diagnosed with TGCT from January 1999 through January 2006 and asked them about their lifetime use of marijuana .
Their responses were compared to the responses of 979 age - matched healthy controls who lived in the same area .
The men were also asked about other lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption .
The results showed that even after ruling out the effect of these other lifestyle habits , and other risk factors such as family history of testicular cancer and undescended testes , use of marijuana was significantly and independently linked to higher risk of testicular cancer .
However , the researchers said they do not claim the results are definitive , the link is just a link , and does not prove cause .
They want their findings to open a door to further research , as Schwartz explained :
“ Our study is the first inkling that marijuana use may be associated with testicular cancer , and we still have a lot of unanswered questions . ”
One question for example is why is marijuana use linked to only one type of testicular cancer ?
Schwartz said more studies were needed to examine whether the link appears in other populations , and whether it might be possible to find molecular markers that show the pathways through which the marijuana might be helping testicular cancer to grow .
The researchers ’ next step is to look at the expression of cannabinoid receptors in both seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumor tissue from the patients in this study and look for genetic variations and signalling molecules that might suggest the underlying mechanism of cancer development .
In the meantime Schwartz said that young men should know that we do n’t know enough about the long term effect of marijuana use , especially heavy use , but this study suggests there could be at least one serious consequence , and therefore , his message is :
“ In the absence of more certain information , a decision to smoke marijuana recreationally means that one is taking a chance on one ’s future health . ”
“ Association of marijuana use and the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors . ”

13 years ago I blogged about …
I 'm an avid Linux user .
What to most Windows users is their Desktop , is my home directory to me .
When ever there is a download to save , a file to create or an archive to unpack – it will be done in my home directory .
This quickly turned into a mess in the past .
My first attempt to solve the problem was to use a subdirectory called temp .
Of course this did n't solve anything , it just moved the problem to a different directory .
The system that finally worked for me is using daily temp directories .
To make this easy to manage I use a simple command defined in my ~/.bashrc .
Let 's have a look at the code first :
export TD = " $ HOME / temp / `date +'% Y - %m-%d'` " td ( ) { local td = $ TD if [ ! - z " $ 1 " ] ; then td = " $ HOME / temp / `date -d " $ 1 days " +'%Y- %m-%d'` " ; else ln -s -f - T $td " $ HOME / temp / 00 - today " fi mkdir -p $td ; cd $ td }
The command is called td .
When called it checks if today 's temp dir already exists or creates it if necessary .
It then changes into the directory .
The command also accepts an argument to access previous temp directories .
Just add a minus and the number of days you want to go back .
Quick example ?
It works like this :
~$ date Wed Feb 27 20:24:37 CET 2008 ~ $ td ~/temp/2008-02-27 $ td - 2 ~/temp/2008-02-25 $
Additionally to the td command a variable called $ TD is defined .
It just points to today 's directory .
This is quite handy if you need to copy something from or to your temp directory .
My new system helps me to have a clean workspace for trying stuff everyday .
All I have to do is to delete old temp dirs from time to time when disk space becomes scarce .
What 's your way to keep your $ HOME clean and your mind sane ?
The New York Times has an interesting OpEd piece by science writer Dennis Overbye ( free subscription may be required ) .
Overbye writes about Obama 's inauguration speech , where he said " We will restore science to its rightful place . "
I cheered when Obama said that , but my brain , evil organ that it is , immediately then whispered , You know Bush probably felt exactly the same way while he was gutting it .
But I suspect Obama has more of a respect for reality than Bush did .
But I wanted to point out something that Overbye said in his article :
Science is not a monument of received Truth but something that people do to look for truth .
That endeavor , which has transformed the world in the last few centuries , does indeed teach values .
Those values , among others , are honesty , doubt , respect for evidence , openness , accountability and tolerance and indeed hunger for opposing points of view .
These are the unabashedly pragmatic working principles that guide the buzzing , testing , poking , probing , argumentative , gossiping , gadgety , joking , dreaming and tendentious cloud of activity — the writer and biologist Lewis Thomas once likened it to an anthill — that is slowly and thoroughly penetrating every nook and cranny of the world .
I agree .
He goes on to say that democracy shares a lot of the same values as science , which is something I 've been saying for a long time .
Democracy is an experiment : it 's still in its early act on the world 's stage .
It started with a hypothesis -- people have a say in how they are governed -- and it's gone through a few versions since then .
We try different things , even swapping out our equipment every few years when we need an upgrade .
Our basic premise , the Constitution in our case , is updatable as needed .
If the evidence that our choices were wrong becomes overwhelming , then we 're willing to start over again from the beginning .
And like science , it 's easy to follow the wrong but seductive path .
But if we are honest with ourselves and are willing to pursue truth when we see it , and we use all the available evidence that we have that is untainted by rhetoric and authority , and we 're willing to unshakably and unflinchingly examine that evidence no matter where it leads , why then , we will walk the correct path .
Science and democracy : their price is eternal vigilance , and it's a small one to pay .

Advertisement A health and safety investigation has been launched after a 14 - year - old girl suffered burns over 70 % of her body using an unstaffed tanning salon .
Kirsty McRae was put on a hospital drip after spending £ 4 for 19 minutes on a coin - operated sunbed on Monday .
Her mother Jill , from Barry Island , Vale of Glamorgan , said unstaffed salons posed " an enormous risk " .
James Hadley , who owns Lextan , the salon which Kirsty used , said he was operating within the law .
Kirsty , who is on half - term , originally put £ 1 into a coin operated sunbed at Lextan , but felt she was not tanned enough , so paid another £ 3 for another 15 minutes .
No -one was at the salon to prevent her from using the beds or stop her from using the booth for as long as she did .
It just beggars belief that anyone can put money into a slot and do this amount of damage to themselves
Jill McRae , mother of Kirsty
She left the salon in pain and was later taken to hospital where doctors told her she had suffered first degree burns , the lowest level of skin burn .
She was put on a drip and given oxygen while doctors rehydrated her and administered painkillers .
Kirsty , a pupil at Bishop of Llandaff High School , Cardiff , has since been released from hospital and has returned home although she must apply lotions to soothe the burns every few hours .
Back home in Barry on Thursday , the teenager said she took full responsibility for the fact that she should not have been in the salon because she was under 16 .
She said : " It is something I do n't think I 'll ever forget about how scared I was and how I did n't realise just going on a tanning bed could result in going to hospital and being quite ill . "
But she said there should be more controls on who is using the salons .
" Teenagers are going to push the boundaries .
They are going to do things they should not do . "
' Partly responsible '
Mrs McRae , a health and safety officer , said she was able identify the symptoms that her daughter was displaying and to recognise that she was suffering from superficial burns , heat stroke and going into shock .
" Had I not had that knowledge I would have been absolutely terrified to see what she was going through , and that 's not to say it was n't terrifying , even with the knowledge , because it was , " she sad .
She agreed that her daughter was partly responsible for her condition but said there should be much more regulation of the salons .
She said she did not believe , even at 16 that teenagers were mature enough to understand the risks they were taking by using these salons .
" If Kirsty had collapsed in the salon and no - one knew that she was there , that does not bear thinking about , " Mrs McCrae said .
It was extremely frightening .
I was just glad I got out of hospital
Kirsty McCrae Kirsty said she had no idea the tanning booths were so dangerous .
" I paid my money .
I went in there .
I stayed in the booth for 20 minutes and then I came out .
I got home and I was extremely red and burnt .
She added : " It was extremely frightening .
I was just glad I got out of hospital . "
Mr Hadley said his salon had posters all over the walls and on the doors warning of the dangers of sunbeds .
Under - 16s were not allowed to use the booths and Mr Hadley said he did not want them using the shop .
" I 'm upset to hear about the incident , but I operate within the law , " he said .
" It 's unfortunate someone chose to ignore the warnings about sunbeds . "
Mr Hadley said a member of staff was present every day between 3 pm - 4 pm and 7 pm - 9 pm .
The Health and Safety Executive advise under - 16 s not to use cosmetic tanning equipment and said further guidance would be published in March in response to public concerns about safety at tanning salons , especially those which are unstaffed .
' Extremely concerned '
The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was sorry to hear about the incident and a health and safety investigation was underway at the salon .
" The council is extremely concerned about unmanned tanning salons but there is no current legislation in Wales relating to such premises , " said principal environmental health officer Rowan Hughes .
Julie Barratt , director of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health , said it had been calling for unmanned tanning salons to be banned for some time .
" As this unfortunate case demonstrates there is no effective control over who uses such facilities and how they are used , " she said .
The Welsh Assembly Government said it was concerned that young people under the age of 18 were using such tanning facilities but it did not have the power to introduce regulation of the sunbed industry .
However , a spokeswoman said Health Minister Edwina Hart had asked the Department of Health to tighten regulation of the use of artificial tanning devices .

Escape From City 17 is a short film series made by the Purchase Brothers .
Part one was just released onto Youtube and this is easily going to be the best videogame related fan made video of 2009 .
The amazing thing about this and the second episode ( coming soon ) is that both were filmed with a budget of just $ 500 .
The video really feels like a Hollywood production , if not better .
Speaking of which , this is how you make a videogame into a movie , Hollywood .
We 'll be sure to post the next episode as soon as it hits Youtube .
[ Thanks , R3Y ! ]
Calling from Texas five days ago , John M. King told Minneapolis police he had committed the perfect murder .
In October , he and his new girlfriend , 51 - year - old Pam Sjogren , got in a fight because she would n't deal with some personal issues .
He claimed she poked him in the eye , which angered him to the point that he put her in a " full nelson ' ' sleeper hold for 40 seconds until she passed out .
King told police he believed he broke her neck .
Because Sjogren had threatened suicide in the past , King left her body hanging from a rope in her garage , a wooden stepladder kicked out from her feet , according to charges detailing the crime .
The Hennepin County medical examiner ruled it a suicide .
Police speculate a guilty conscience may be the reason King decided to confess .
In a statement to police , he said he did n't want Sjogren 's children to think she had killed herself .
On Monday , King , 50 , who is described as a drifter , turned himself into the Texas Rangers in Dallas .
He is now charged with second - degree murder and is awaiting extradition to Minnesota .
" It 's an unusual case to have somebody come in three months later and confess to the crime , but he felt guilty and wanted to do the right thing , " said Lt. Richard Zimmerman , head of the Minneapolis homicide unit .
Even though charges have been filed , Zimmerman said police and the medical examiner will continue their investigations .
Investigators have evidence to corroborate King 's story , he said .
Police informed Sjogren 's son Robert Silver about the charges against King .
He could n't be reached for comment .
Christian Hallanger , who said he had lived across the street from Sjogren 's duplex for 10 years , said neighbors " were always surprised that she killed herself because she was a strong and assertive woman . "
Famed rock - and - roll guitarist and longtime Ann Arbor resident Ronald " Ron " Asheton was found dead in his home on the city 's west side this morning , police said .
Asheton , 60 , was an original member of The Stooges , a garage - rock band headlined by Iggy Pop and formed in Ann Arbor in 1967 .
His personal assistant contacted police late Monday night after being unable to reach Asheton for days , Detective Bill Stanford said .
Officers went to the home on Highlake Avenue at around midnight and discovered Asheton 's body on a living - room couch .
He appeared to have been dead for at least several days , Stanford said .
Detective Sgt. Jim Stephenson said the cause of death is undetermined but investigators do not suspect foul play .
Autopsy and toxicology results are pending .
Asheton was born in Washington , D.C. His brother , Scott , who lives in Florida , is the band 's drummer .
In 2007 , The Stooges reunited and released " The Weirdness , " their first album in three decades .

So Citigroup ( C ) has proposed that the US taxpayer and other preferred shareholders convert up to $ 75 billion of preferred stock into common stock , thus bolstering the company 's tangible equity and putting it in less desperate need of a complete takeover .
And what will the US taxpayer get for this preferred stock conversion ?
40 % of the company for some of its $ 45 billion of preferred , say reports .
The reports add that Citigroup 's goal here is to keep the US 's ownership under 50 % , so this wo n't be a de facto nationalization .
Well , that 's nice for Citigroup ... and another ream - job for taxpayers .
Citigroup 's common equity is currently worth $ 10 billion .
If the US were to convert all $ 45 billion of its preferred at the current stock price , it should end up with 80 % of the company , not 40 % .
If another $ 30 billion of preferreds converted , the US should end up with just over 50 % .
For the US to convert $ 45 billion of preferred to common and only get 40 % of the company , Citigroup 's existing common equity would have to be valued at $ 65 billion , not $ 10 billion , and the conversion price would have to be about $ 10 a share .
Or the US would only be able to convert $ 4 billion of its $ 45 billion , which would n't help Citigroup 's tangible equity ratio much .
So is that what Citigroup is trying to do here ?
Persuade the US goverment to convert to common stock at a price miles above the current trading price , screwing the US taxpayer yet again ?
Or does Citigroup have some other secret plan up its sleeve ?

Is it Best to Eat Before or After Exercise ?
Making Sense of Pre-Workout and Post - Workout Nutrition .
Dear Fitness Nerd ,
When should I eat ?
Before or after I exercise ?
In particular , if I ’m going to wake up and workout in the morning , do I eat breakfast before or after I workout ?
Jen — Detroit , MI
Timing of meals , especially before or after exercise is one of those things that ’s part science , and part personal preference .
Let ’s tackle the science first , and then deal with some of the personal things you need to consider .
Understanding Pre-Workout and Post - Workout Nutrition
Pre and post - workout nutrition is critical , because it allows the body to have the necessary energy to exercise effectively , as well as the right macro-nutrients and energy after exercise to help with recovery .
As a rule of thumb , you want to try to fill your tank up both before and after working out .
How much you need to eat and what you should eat before exercise will have a lot to do with :
The time of day
When you last ate
How your body responds to pre-workout food .
What To Eat Before Exercise
In general , you ’ll want to eat a light meal about 60 - 90 minutes before exercise .
The ideal meal will have a good balance of complex carbohydrates and some lean protein .
A little healthy fat is fine , but you do n’t want to overdo it .
So a good pre-workout meal might be an apple with some natural peanut butter or a light sandwich made with 100 % whole wheat bread and some turkey or chicken breast .
The same rule basically applies if you work out in the morning , although your choice of foods may be different .
A good pre-exercise breakfast would be a bowl of oatmeal with some fresh fruit and maybe a little honey and a couple of scrambled egg whites .
If you are pressed for time , a bowl of 100 % whole grain cereal with skim milk and some fruit will do the trick , or you can opt for a smoothie made with skim milk , frozen or fresh fruit and maybe a scoop of whey or soy protein powder .
In either case , you should be aiming to come in at around 300 - 350 calories .
If you go much beyond that , you may feel too full and this can make exercising uncomfortable .
What To Eat After A Workout
In terms of post - workout nutrition , you ’ll want another small , balanced meal as soon as possible after working out .
This , in my opinion is a must , regardless of whether you eat a pre-workout meal or snack .
For your post - workout meal , the best things to eat after a workout are foods that are low in fat , high in lean protein and have a mix of simple and complex carbs .
The choice of carb is yours — there are some good reasons for eating a more quickly digested carbohydrate ( like white rice or Rice chex ) with some protein right after you workout , but this is n’t required .
The main thing here is to eat something after you workout that has lean protein and some healthy sources of carbs .
That could be scrambled egg whites , a bowl of whole grain cereal with skim milk or low - fat yogurt , or a whey or soy shake .
While it ’s not ideal , even a higher - protein nutrition or sports bar right after you workout or exercise is better than nothing .
Timing Your Pre Workout and Post Exercise Meals
As I mentioned before , timing of meals around exercise is critical .
If you are eating too close to your actual workout , this can leave you feeling bloated or sluggish .
A good practice is to give yourself at least 60 minutes between eating and exercising .
That gives your body plenty of time to get on with the digestion process .
Choosing complex carbohydrates keeps your blood sugar levels stable and can help you sustain your energy during exercise , so you should always be including them in your pre-workout meal .
Also , the type of exercise and intensity of that exercise can determine the timing of meals .
Intense exercise and activity can cause disruptions with digestion .
When you exercise , the body slows digestion to conserve energy , re-rellocating it to your muscles to power your workout and activity .
This can sometimes cause stomach upset — especially if you eat to close to your workout .
The resulting indigestion , bloating and “ gassiness ” is often more prevalent among runners or people performing high - intensity cardio right after eating than with with weight trainees or people performing lower - intensity cardio .
Some people have no issues , while others find that they need to eat far advance of their workout to avoid this .
Generally , people have less issues with handling post - workout meals .
In fact , many people are plenty hungry 30 minutes after a good workout .
So they welcome the food .
Other Considerations Around Eating Before Exercise
Finally , when and how much you eat before exercise ( or whether you eat at all ) needs to be vetted against your own personal preferences and experiences .
Some people simply find eating before exercise difficult .
This seems to be especially common for people who like to work out first thing in the morning .
Often you do n’t have the luxury of eating 60 minutes before your workout if you do it early in the morning .
Also , some people have problems eating breakfast immediately after waking .
Both of these things can impact whether or not you eat before an a .m. workout or not .
If you ’re able to eat something before exercising , I would encourage you to do it .
Even something simple like some fruit or a nutrition bar can help give you a boost of energy without weighting you down or negatively impacting your performance .
At the end of the day , it comes down to experimenting to find what works best for you .
Try both approaches and see what impact eating or not eating before your workout has on your energy levels .
Tinker around with the types of foods you eat , how much of them you eat and their timing until you find something that fits .
Usually you can discover the right combination for you with a little awareness and practice .

The mother of octuplets born last month in California has been targeted by rival bids from adult entertainment companies , including an offer of US $ 1 million to star in a porn movie .
Nadya Suleman , who has been at the centre of a fierce debate in the media and medical arenas since giving birth to eight children last month , is now embroiled in a public relations spat involving rival purveyors of porn .
Nadya Suleman .. . gave birth to octuplets .
Credit :AP
A Los Angeles - based company , the world 's largest adult film producer , announced that it had offered Suleman $ US1 million plus a year of health insurance if the unemployed 33 - year - old starred in a porn movie .
" There is a tremendous amount of interest in Nadya and we can help her capitalise on that interest and put some real cash in her bank account , " said its co-chairman Steven Hirsch .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner last week proposed a series of programs , totaling $ 1.5 trillion , to bail out the U.S. banking system .
Of course , Geithner has n't told us precisely how he plans to spend the money , or identified which banks require such an enormous outlay .
So I thought it was worth looking at the United States ' 12 largest banks to see where the problems might be and identify which banks might need big infusions of government cash .
I perused the financial statements of all 12 banks , and also looked at their market valuations .
Unlike when the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) was proposed in September – when the projections for potential losses were largely financial conjecture – we now have important concrete data on the banking system 's troubles ; namely , each of the bank 's annual financial reports for 2008 .

If Bill Clinton was the first black president , then Barack Obama might be the first urban one .
He is the only American president in recent history to seem unembarrassed about claiming a personal residence in a major American city .
Instead , presidents have tended to hail from homes called ranches or groves or manors or plantations , in places called Kennebunkport or Santa Barbara or Oyster Bay or Northampton .
There were times , certainly , during the course of the presidential campaign when Barack Obama seemed less than proud of his Chicago heritage .
Indeed , Obama treated Chicago as little more than a bedroom community during parts of his presidential bid , choosing to launch his campaign downstate in Springfield instead , and not holding a major public rally in the city until his climactic event in Grant Park on November 4 .
As John McCain 's commercials yapped about the " corrupt Chicago political machine , " Obama seemed as though he was worried about bumping into Bill Ayers at Manny 's Deli or Tony Rezko at the Frontera Grill .
As Rudy Giuliani the former mayor of the hamlet called New York City tried to portray Obama as an out - of - touch elitist , Obama seemed to strain to avoid the caricature .
Like many incoming presidents , Barack Obama was elected partly in reaction to the failures of the previous one , a president who was dogmatic , insecure , white - bread , and at least ostensibly rural .
By contrast , Obama is unmistakably urban : pragmatic , superior , hip , stubborn , multicultural .
But Obama 's election may also represent something more if not a sign that America 's psyche has changed then at least that its demographics are on the move .
We may still romanticize some of the more familiar , rurally oriented narratives of presidents past : the Ronald Reagan frontiersman caricature ( which both Sarah Palin and John McCain tried to co-opt at various times ) or the Bill Clinton born - in - a - small - town shtick ( see also : Edwards , John ; Huckabee , Mike ) .
Fewer and fewer of us , however , have actually lived those experiences .
In 1992 , when Bill Clinton won his first term , 35 percent of American voters were identified as rural according to that year 's national exit polls , and 24 percent as urban .
This year , however , the percentage of rural voters has dropped to 21 percent , while that of urban voters has climbed to 30 .
The suburbs , meanwhile , have been booming : 41 percent of America 's electorate in 1992 , they represent 49 percent now ( see chart ) .
In other words , if you are going to pit big cities against small towns , it is probably a mistake to end up on the rural side of the ledger .
Last year , Obama accumulated a margin of victory of approximately 10.5 million votes in urban areas ( see chart ) , far bettering John Kerry 's 3.6 million .
Obama improved his performance not only among black and Latino voters but also among urban whites , with whom he performed 9 points better than Kerry .
Obama also won each of the seventeen most densely populated states , a list that includes such nontraditional battlegrounds as Virginia , North Carolina , and Indiana .
( One hidden advantage of urban areas :
They 're easier to canvass to get the vote out . )
By contrast , for all their bluster about small towns , John McCain and Sarah Palin beat Obama by just 2.4 million votes in rural areas , actually a bit worse than the 4.3 - million - vote margin that Bush racked up in 2004 .
With the votes that he banked in the cities , Obama did not really need to prevail in the suburbs .
But he did anyway as every winning presidential candidate has done since 1980 bettering McCain by 2 points there .
Indeed , among the many mistakes the McCain campaign made was targeting the rural vote rather than the suburban one , as Bush and Karl Rove did in 2000 and 2004 .
It may also be that suburban voters are starting to look and behave more like their urban brethren .
According to a poll by the National Center for Suburban Studies , 20 percent of suburban voters are nonwhite not much behind the national average of 27 percent and 44 percent live in a racially mixed neighborhood ( versus a national average of 46 percent ) .
Suburban voters are just as likely to be concerned about the economy as other voters are and just as likely to know someone who has lost a job .
Moreover , many suburbanites who do not live in cities may nevertheless be thoroughly familiar with them ; according to the Census Bureau , at least eight to nine million persons commute into urban areas each day .
As a result , urban bashing is n't what it once was at the height of white flight and the Reagan revolution .
Whereas in 1980 , according to the biannual General Social Survey conducted by the University of Chicago , 24.4 percent of Americans thought that the government was spending too much money to solve the problems of big cities , nowadays that number is down to 12.8 percent .
The suburbs are immune to neither urban America 's problems nor its promise .
Barack Obama , the former community organizer , may be the first president in a generation to actively seed urban renewal .
His proposals include creating an Office of Urban Policy , restoring the Bush cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program , financing so - called regional - innovation clusters to link smaller cities together , and establishing twenty " Promise Neighborhoods " essentially , oases of social services in inner cities .
Closer to home , he has already started to pitch Chicago as the prospective home of the 2016 Olympic Games , a potentially climactic event that if all goes well could give a bounce in the polls to his Democratic successor in the midst of an election year .
We have , of course , started to get a little ahead of ourselves .
But the future of America is an urban one among the twenty largest metropolitan areas in 2000 , nineteen had added population by 2007 , a trend likely to sustain itself as rising gas prices place more pressure on exurban commuters .
Republicans trail Democrats among essentially every fast - growing demographic except the elderly the youth vote , the Latino vote ; they never had the black vote .
It is long past time that they hone their pitch to urban voters , and find their shining city upon a hill .

Steve Keen , from the University of Western Sydney , said yesterday the US treasuries auction market was now a sideshow .
Associate Professor Keen said by way of evidence , the US money supply doubled between 1994 and 2008 and " Bernanke has doubled it again in just the past four months " .
" The US has essentially abandoned conventional ways of raising money , " he said .
Asked about US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner 's attack on China 's currency manipulation , Keen said that the rules of the game had now fundamentally changed and the US was , in expanding its money supply , pursing a policy eerily similar to Fed policies that preceded the Great Depression .
Keen , who last week was interviewed by The Wall Street Journal and is fast becoming a world - recognised economic authority , outlined in his recent Debt Watch Report that Bernanke 's famous " helicopter drop doubling of base money will be impotent against the US 's credit crunch " .
Most economists believe the US and China are bound irrevocably by US debt and China 's continued purchase of that debt .
They assume the US , with 46 states insolvent or approaching insolvency , will suffer immediate MAD if China ends the long financial arrangement .
But with the US entering a period of deflation , its economic leadership appears to be doing the unthinkable — going it alone and letting the electronic printing presses take care of the huge sums required to keep the nation afloat .
The consequences for the world economy are incomprehensible as China 's purchases of US treasuries underwrite the US 's unquenchable demand for money to service its multitrillion - dollar public debt , which President Obama said recently would reach $ US11 trillion ( $ A17 trillion ) this year .
Faced with the huge sinkhole created by the financial meltdown and the prospect of deflation , US Fed boss Ben Bernanke has been printing money so rapidly that the US is being flooded with liquidity .
This is beyond unprecedented .
Many Americans believe printing money can free the country from the suffocating embrace of mutual dependence with China .
In his blog earlier this week , Brad Setser from the US Council on Foreign Relations , and one of the world 's most respected China commentators , outlined the US position : " Exchange rate policies can also influence the allocation of resources across sectors .
China 's de facto dollar peg is an obvious example … it is hard for me to believe that as much would have been invested in China 's export sector if China had had a different exchange rate regime …
" Those who attribute the growth of the past several years solely to the market miss the large role the state played in many of the world 's fast growing economies . "
Setser and others close to policymakers are realising the boom in China may not be a rerun of the Japanese and German postwar economic miracles but more akin to the creation of a giant sweatshop for the benefit of Western companies and the Chinese Communist Party .
But this required US consumers to play their role as the linchpins .
Now the linchpin has broken .
There is no way the old arrangement can continue and the US is realising the system will end .
By reverting to the printing press it can free itself from dependency on China .
The risk is massive inflation but that has never been a matter to concern Bernanke nor , it seems , the team President Obama has assembled .
And US debt can be paid with inflated dollars .
China is onto the tactic , which explains why it is keen to convert its dollars into iron , coal and , I suspect , vast amounts of mineral wealth as well as property overseas .
China must act , however , while the US dollar is strong .
Do n't be surprised if the Chinalco deal is but the first of many and keep your eyes on our resource stocks .
There are many games being played at a geopolitical level and many a twist and turn to come .

We ventured over to NAGTROC.org and gtrblog.com and discovered that a member has already taken his GT - R to get the new firmware / ECU updated and he has shared his experience afterwards .
It seems the launch control was NOT disabled but the launch RPM changed .
Also , the new launch control can be done with VDC on .
Do you know what I am thinking ?
Yes , I can break the transmission and get it covered under warranty provided I leave the VDC on and the transmission decides to take a dump on me !
Yes , off to the dealership I go !
Below is the post from NAGTROC.org and gtrblog.com and video of the “ new ” launch control RPM after the jump …
Nissan North America ’s campaign to update willing GT - R owner ’s ECUs with the new 2010 firmware has already begun with one enthusiast , Matt “ MC ” from the North American GT - R Owners Club ( NAGTROC ) , already taking them up on the offer .
In the name of science he ’s volunteered to have his GT - R go under the knife ( so to speak ) for the update and report back on the changes .
Matt ’s report on the changes has demystified the workings in terms of the much rumoured launch control functions .
First up the launch control is not gone , but it is modified .
It is no longer a launch from 4,500rpm and it no longer requires the VDC ( Vehicle Dynamic Control ) to be disengaged to function .
That ’s right the new launch control functions with VDC ON .
It even functions with the gearbox in automatic mode .
So how does it work , you hold the brake on and floor the accelerator .
The car revs to 3,000rpm and holds it there .
Release the brake and off you go .
Matt has already tested this with a passenger in the car in manual mode and it ’s good for 3.8 ’s 0 - 60 mph times .
Without a passenger , in auto mode or on a better surface perhaps it ’s good for 3.7 seconds or faster .
More testing is required .
The prime issue Nissan seemed to have with the launch control in the 2009 GT - R was the fact that to do it VDC had to be turned off , something the owners manual forbade .
Now the launch is much more gentle but the effect is reported to be 80 % as potent .
So if guys were hitting 11.6 second quarter mile ETs without launch control before the change , it will be interesting to see what they hit with this revised VDC ON version of the launch control .

We posted this weeks ago and it is still a classic !
Editor 's Note :
We are reposting this essay from our June 2002 issue to accompany our coverage of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button .
To read the full position statement on aging and its extensive list of references , follow this link .
Efforts to combat aging and extend human life date at least as far back as 3500 B.C. , and self - proclaimed experts have touted anti-aging elixirs ever since .
Indeed , the prospect of immortality has always had universal appeal , spurring Alexander the Great and Ponce de Leon to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth and feeding alchemists ’ desire to manufacture gold ( once believed to be the most potent anti-aging substance in existence ) .
But the hawking of anti-aging “ therapies ” has taken a particularly troubling turn of late .
Disturbingly large numbers of entrepreneurs are luring gullible and frequently desperate customers of all ages to “ longevity ” clinics , claiming a scientific basis for the anti-aging products they recommend and , often , sell .
At the same time , the Internet has enabled those who seek lucre from supposed anti-aging products to reach new consumers with ease .
Alarmed by these trends , scientists who study aging , including the three of us , have issued a position statement containing this warning : no currently marketed intervention — none — has yet been proved to slow , stop or reverse human aging , and some can be downright dangerous .
While the public is bombarded by hype and lies , many biologists are intensively studying the underlying nature of aging in the belief that their research will eventually suggest ways to slow its progression and to thereby postpone infirmity and improve quality of life .
But anyone purporting to offer an anti-aging product today is either mistaken or lying .
( Here 's the full position statement . )
Here we state the case as we see it , speaking for ourselves .
What Aging Is ... and Is n’t Any discussion of aging should first clarify its terms .
Various definitions have been proposed , but we think of aging as the accumulation of random damage to the building blocks of life — especially to DNA , certain proteins , carbohydrates and lipids ( fats ) — that begins early in life and eventually exceeds the body ’s self - repair capabilities .
This damage gradually impairs the functioning of cells , tissues , organs and organ systems , thereby increasing vulnerability to disease and giving rise to the characteristic manifestations of aging , such as a loss of muscle and bone mass , a decline in reaction time , compromised hearing and vision , and re -
duced elasticity of the skin .
This accretion of molecular damage comes from many sources , including , ironically , the life - sustaining processes involved in converting the food we eat into usable energy .
As the energy generators of cells ( mitochondria ) operate , they emit destructive , oxidizing molecules known as free radicals .
Most of the damage caused by these reactive molecules gets repaired , but not all .
Biologists suspect that the oxidative assaults ultimately cause irreparable injury to the mitochondria , thereby impeding the cell ’s ability to maintain the integrity of the countless molecules needed to keep the body operating properly .
The free radicals may also disrupt other parts of cells directly .
Aging , in our view , makes us ever more susceptible to such ills as heart disease , Alzheimer ’s disease , stroke and cancer , but these age - related conditions are superimposed on aging , not equivalent to it .
Therefore , even if science could eliminate today ’s leading killers of older individuals , aging would continue to occur , ensuring that different maladies would take their place .
In addition , it would guarantee that one crucial body component or another — say , the cardiovascular system — would eventually experience a catastrophic failure .
It is an inescapable biological reality that once the engine of life switches on , the body inevitably sows the seeds of its own destruction .
Men and women in the developed world typically live longer now ( 75 and 80 years , respectively ) than they did throughout much of history ( about 25 years ) because human ingenuity — which brought us sanitation systems , vaccines , antibiotics and so on —has had phenomenal success in thwarting the infectious and parasitic diseases responsible for a great deal of premature death .
We live longer now not because we have altered the way we age but because we have altered the way we live .
Though inevitable , aging is not , as some might think , a genetically programmed process , playing itself out on a rigidly predetermined time schedule .
The way evolution works makes it impossible for us to possess genes that are specifically designed to cause physiological decline with age or to control how long we live .
Just as an automobile does not have a built - in plan for decline written in its blueprints , we do not possess genetic instructions that tell our bodies how to age or when to die .
The logic behind this assertion goes basically like this :
Genes perpetuate themselves by orchestrating the transformation of a fertilized egg into a sexually mature adult that produces offspring .
Clearly , any genetic variant that compromises this developmental process would be self - eliminating .
Conversely , evolution is totally blind to the consequences of gene action ( whether good , bad or indifferent ) after reproduction is achieved .
Genes or genetic variants that prove detrimental in the postreproductive part of the life span can become commonplace , but only if they participate in important processes early on .
For example , several genes that contribute to cancer in the later years are known to participate in growth and development early in life .
Without a doubt , a host of our genes influence aging , but they do so indirectly , as an inadvertent by - product of processes involved in growth , development , and the maintenance of health and vigor .
The lack of a specific genetic program for aging and death means that there are no quick fixes that will permit us to treat aging as if it were a disease .
A single genetic intervention in an organism as complex as a human being would have little chance of combating the probably vast array of genes and biological activities that play subtle , unpredictable parts in the timing of our ultimate demise .
False Claims
Despite this complexity , some researchers believe that they may manage to find ways to slow the rate of human aging .
If they succeed , many people will live longer than would otherwise be expected , and a few people might even surpass the modern longevity record of 122 years .
But the primary goal of biomedical research and efforts to slow aging should not be the mere extension of life .
It should be to prolong the duration of healthylife .
Slowing the rate of aging could help postpone the onset of age - related diseases and infirmities , essentially enabling people to stay younger longer .
On what grounds do we assert so vehemently that no purported anti-aging intervention has been proved to modify aging ?
To assess whether an intervention has affected a biological process , researchers need a yardstick for measuring that process .
In this case , no single or aggregate age - related phenomenon has proved to be a reliable indicator of the rate of aging in humans or other species .
Without a yardstick , there can be no measurements , and without measurements there can be no assurance that an intervention was successful .
People eager to retain or restore their youthful biology might well recognize the paucity of proof but decide to try a putative anti-aging intervention anyway , thinking they have little to lose .
They should think again .
For instance , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not require products sold as dietary supplements to undergo
the rigorous tests of safety and effectiveness that medicines must pass before they can be sold to the public .
Consequently , these supplements come with no guarantees of purity or potency , no established guidelines on dosage , and often no warnings about side effects that may result when the products are taken along with approved medications .
Antioxidants constitute one popular class of supplements touted to have anti-aging powers .
Such chemicals occur naturally in the body and in fruits and vegetables and are believed to neutralize free radicals .
Proponents claim that if taken in sufficient quantities , antioxidant supplements will sop up the radicals and slow down or stop the processes responsible for aging .
But eliminating all free radicals would kill us , because they perform certain necessary intermediary steps in biochemical reactions .
Further , although epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the antioxidant vitamins E and C contained within the foods we eat may reduce the risk of cancer , macular degeneration and other disorders , no one has established that vitamin supplements containing antioxidants limit oxidative damage in the body or influence aging .
Like antioxidants , another fashionable anti-aging intervention , hormone replacement , has a plausible rationale .
This strategy was first popularized early in the 20th century , when older men occasionally submitted to the grafting of testicles from goats or monkeys or received injections of macerated testicles .
Today pure forms of hormones can be administered .
The replacement strategy seems logical in principle because the blood levels of most hormones — among them melatonin , growth hormone , testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) — commonly decrease with age .
Also , experiments on older men have demonstrated that some physical and physiological attributes that show declines over time , notably muscle mass and skin elasticity , respond favorably in the short term to growth hormone replacement .
On the other hand , hormones can cause worrisome side effects .
In mice , for instance , delivery of melatonin increases the risk of tumor development , and the over - production of growth hormone leads to kidney problems , premature heart and lung failure , and an increased probability of early death .
Human adults given growth hormone have suffered from acromegaly ( excess bone growth ) and carpal tunnel syndrome .
Estrogen replace -
ment therapy may offer health benefits to some postmenopausal women ; however , this form of therapy has recently been challenged and has risks of its own , such as breast cancer and blood clots .
In short , hormone replacement therapy has a place in the treatment of specific age - associated disorders , but evidence that it affects the rate of aging is lacking .
Some people might wonder whether following today ’s public health recommendations for diet and exercise can serve as a more natural Fountain of Youth .
Good nutrition and regular exercise do reduce the risk of various diseases and , in that way , may extend the duration of life for many people — thereby serving as the best current prescription for a long and healthy life .
As is true of other interventions , though , no one has shown that diet or exercise , or both , directly influences aging .
What Science Says
We find it ironic that a phony anti-aging industry is proliferating today , because serious efforts to understand aging have advanced greatly in recent years .
Biologists who work with yeast , roundworms , fruit flies and mice have extended life by manipulating the genes of those species .
These genetic alterations did not affect what is believed to be an important hallmark of aging in a population ( an exponential increase in the risk of dying with time after puberty ) , which means that the longevity extensions in those experiments cannot safely be interpreted as resulting from an intervention in the aging process .
Nevertheless , further study of those genes could offer clues to the influences on longevity and to approaches that might postpone infirmity and age - related disorders .
Another avenue of research may also lead to true aging interventions .
Investigators have known for decades that caloric restriction extends life and the duration of good health in all species in which it has been studied , as long as the diet includes enough nutrition for routine maintenance of the body .
These findings suggest that caloric restriction might have similar effects in humans .
Given that few people would ever reduce their food intake enough to lengthen their lives , biologists are now trying to discover the mechanism that underlies the benefits of caloric restriction and to find agents that might mimic those helpful effects in people without forcing them to go hungry .
A number of scientists look at current research trends and feel hopeful .
They can envision a time when treatments based on an understanding of aging can help slow its progression and when not yet specialized ( stem ) cells can be coaxed to repair and rejuvenate damaged tissues , enabling people to remain vigorous longer than they would without medical assistance .
Not all researchers share that optimism , though .
Some assert that aging ’s complexity will forever militate against the development of anti-aging therapies .
One thing is indisputable : the number of elderly people is growing worldwide , and opportunists stand ready to cash in on the burgeoning market for anti-aging products .
The researchers who wrote and endorsed the position paper linked here do not necessarily agree on every word written there , but everyone realized that we had to set aside our minor differences to raise awareness of the growing scam .
The public needs to know that the products sold as anti-aging remedies at longevity clinics and elsewhere have no scientifically proven efficacy and may at times be harmful .
Systematic investigations into aging and its modification are in progress and could one day provide methods to slow our inevitable decline and extend health and longevity .
That day , however , has not dawned yet .
People might well recognize the paucity of proof but decide to try a putative anti-aging intervention anyway , thinking they have little to lose .
They should think again .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration will have to persuade the world that the U.S. strong dollar policy is for real this time as it prepares to borrow $ 2 trillion to revive the U.S. economy from its worst crisis in decades .
Less than 48 hours after Barack Obama became president , his choice for U.S. Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , said a strong dollar is in the United States ’ interest .
That phrasing -- first used by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin more than 14 years ago -- lost its weight and credibility when it was over - used by the Bush administration .
The greenback lost about 40 percent of its value versus the euro and more than 15 percent versus the yen between 2000 and 2008 .
A weaker currency was an important step for the Bush White House in rebalancing a global economy plagued by a U.S. trade deficit and huge Chinese surplus .
“ This time around the administration probably means it when it says it backs a strong dollar .
They have to be dead serious about it , ” said Samarjit Shankar , a director for global strategy at the Bank of New York Mellon , in Boston .
“ Trillions worth of U.S. debt is coming soon to the markets .
Which foreign central bank or institution will buy this debt if they are not fully convinced the dollar will remain strong ? ” he added .
The challenge for Obama ’s team , analysts said , will be to support the dollar ’s value without direct manipulation in the markets , with the economy in recession , interest rates near zero , and a ballooning current account deficit .
Moreover , Washington will have to achieve all that without antagonizing China , the biggest holder of U.S. Treasury debt , the analysts said .
“ It will be a real test .
One thing is to finance a $ 450 billion deficit and another is to finance $ 2 trillion , ” said Chris Rupkey , a senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi in New York .
“ We are always worried foreigners could ditch the dollar .
But they have no incentive to do that , ” he added .
“ The amount they own is so large that they ca n’t get out of it without impacting their own currencies and economies in the process .
And that includes China . ”
Geithner , in written response to questions from the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday , said a strong dollar “ is in America ’s national interest . ”
For details , see [ ID : nN22364222 ]
But while stressing the need for a stronger dollar Geithner also said the administration would be vigilant against currency manipulation , in particular that stemming from China .
President Obama “ believes that China is manipulating its currency ” and that he has pledged to use “ all the diplomatic avenues open to him to see change in China ’s currency practices , ” he said in his response .
DOLLAR BULL -CYCLE
“ In the case of China , the U.S. may actually favor a weaker dollar , ” said Daniel Katzive , a director for global foreign exchange at Credit Suisse Securities in New York .
“ But despite all the talk , practical policy implications are likely to be minimal . ”
The U.S. trade gap with China totaled $ 246.5 billion year - to - date through November and the country holds $ 681.9 billion of U.S. Treasury securities .
Katzive said the dollar will stay strong in coming months as the financial crisis deepens in other regions , notably in Britain and the euro zone .
“ As long as the euro is weak , the dollar will remain strong , ” he said .
“ Those are the only two reserve currencies in the world and no matter the fundamentals of the U.S. economy , dollar weakness will not be a problem for now . ”
Risk aversion and the spread of the credit crisis boosted demand for the greenback and it gained about 20 percent versus the euro since the single currency touched a record above $ 1.60 last year .
The euro was last trading at $ 1.2960 , rounding up a 7.1 percent drop since the start of the year .
“ The dollar ’s relative strength is here to stay and may last years , not months or weeks , ” said Brian Belski , a U.S. strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York .
“ It ’s not going to be a gangbuster move , but the U.S. will be the first to recover . ”
According to Merrill , strong - dollar cycles tend to last an average of 10 years .
“ We are going to have much more verbal back - up for the dollar during Obama , ” said Shankar at Bank of New York .
“ And if they keep repeating the mantra , they will be heard . ”
The euro will not be around in the next 20 years , but Britain would have been better off had it joined the single European currency when it had a chance , legendary investor Jim Rogers told a British newspaper .
" Not being in the euro is a competitive disadvantage , " Rogers told UK paper " Metro . "
" It makes it more expensive and more cumbersome to do business with the rest of the world .
But I am not sure the euro will last 20 years , " he said .
" The Italians and Germans will be in chaos because they have no plan B . "
Also in the next 20 years China " may well be the largest economy in the world , " Rogers said .
He reiterated his view that the pound will continue to weaken , as the City of London suffers because of the financial crisis and North Sea oil is drying up .
Britain is " a deeply indebted nation , the government is spending gigantic amounts of taxpayer money propping up banks which should have been allowed to fail , " Rogers said .
" If I was a British taxpayer I 'd be totally outraged ! "
He could not forecast an end for the economic troubles .
" We 're certainly not out of whatever we 're in and whatever we 're in is getting worse , " Rogers said .
For those worried about their future prospects , his advice was : " if you speak Chinese , go to China .
Or try farming .
I 'm more optimistic about agriculture than any other industry .
If not farming , anything to do with raw materials or natural resources . "
Women ’s Makeup Draws 33 % More Men
Painting of the face and body has a history dating back at least 10,000 years .
According to Pliny the Elder even 2,000 years ago the Romans were using natural products in ways we would instantly recognise : they had rouge , deodorants , hair dye , wrinkle removers , breath fresheners and much more .
Over the years those using cosmetics have attracted admiring glances from others for all sorts of reasons – including ritualistic and honorific – but often , especially in modern times , the context has been sexual .
But does the application of these products make any difference to the way other people behave ?
While it might affect perceptions both positively and negatively , does it actually encourage others to make the first move ?
A direct approach
Now some answers come in a new study by social psychologist Nicolas Geuguen ( Geuguen , 2008 ) .
In his experiment , reported in the North American Journal of Psychology , Geugen had two young women sit in a bar in France , in the first condition with makeup on , and in the second condition with their faces simply cleaned and moisturised .
Then they waited for men to chat them up .
When a man tried to start a conversation ( nonverbal behaviours did n’t count ) one of the women signalled to experimental confederates that contact had been made by crossing her arms .
Then she politely turned the man down , saying they were waiting for friends to arrive .
This procedure was repeated over 60 observational periods of one hour in two different bars .
Here ’s what happened :
No makeup condition :
The first man ‘ made contact ’ with the two women after an average of 23 minutes , and thereafter they were hit on 1.5 times per hour .
: The first man ‘ made contact ’ with the two women after an average of 23 minutes , and thereafter they were hit on 1.5 times per hour .
With makeup condition :
The first man tried it on after only 17 minutes and the average number of chancers per hour was 2 .
These results certainly suggest the makeup was effective in changing men ’s behaviour , with one third more men approaching the two women when they were made - up .
But while this study is good fun , there are a couple of problems the authors acknowledge .
First wearing makeup could have given the two women more confidence , subtly changing their behaviour and encouraging men to approach .
This may well have accounted for the men ’s behaviour instead of the makeup .
Second it may be difficult to generalise as the study was carried out in France – men in very different cultures might respond in quite another way .
How does makeup work ?
These aside , though , the other interesting question it raises is exactly how makeup works .
While makeup seems to work by increasing perceived attractivity , it can also signal a willingness to interact or even availability .
Further , cosmetics can send signals about status : one study published in the International Journal of Cosmetics Science has found that people judge women wearing cosmetics as higher earners with more prestigious jobs ( Nash et al. , 2006 ) .
Researchers have even looked at which components of makeup are most attractive to men .
A recent study has found that eye makeup has the most powerful effect on female perceived attractivity , followed by foundation ; lipstick , surprisingly , was found to have little independent effect ( Mulhern et al. , 2003 ) .
Nowadays , though , discussions about makeup seem tame , even quaint , considering the more radical methods people use for changing their appearance , like cosmetic surgery .
But one aspect is still cutting - edge : men wearing makeup .
So , I wonder how long it will be until Nicolas Geugen is returning to these bars on the west coast of France , this time with two young men wearing makeup , ready to see who approaches ?

Dave Morin , 28 , sits at the epicenter of the Facebook Economy , and at first glance , the backdrop looks pleasant .
Outside Facebook 's headquarters in Palo Alto , gentle sunshine bathes the wine bars , sushi restaurants and coffee shops along University Avenue on a criminally beautiful , 70 - degree Monday in January .

But Morin 's job is n't so carefree .
As a senior manager of the Facebook Platform , the technology on top of which people can build applications and games to run on the world 's largest social network , Morin 's decisions affect not only the marketers , advertisers and venture capitalists who have bet millions on Facebook 's technology being the most important innovation in computing since the invention of Microsoft Windows , but also the fate of 650,000 third - party software developers who build Facebook applications .
" We were , and still are , completely humbled by the response to the technology , " Facebook 's Morin says .
" We 've had to learn how to scale and manage a community of this size . "
A growing number of those developers say the complex Facebook ecosystem has hit real trouble , hurting large and small developers alike and dooming some shops that built businesses around the platform .
In the fall of 2008 , a redesign that Facebook deemed critical for its 150 million users forced large companies with some of the most popular Facebook apps to immediately retool their strategies and tweak their product designs .
Worse , the redesign eviscerated some small developer shops overnight as the Web traffic of their applications — and the subsequent money they made by selling advertisements on top of those apps — plummeted .
" It was pretty horrible for them , and most people would tell you the same thing if they were being honest with you , " says Murtaza Hussain , president of Peanut Labs , a market research firm that has partnered with social networks ( including Facebook ) and application developers .
" A lot of apps were lost overnight .
Many developers hate Facebook for it because they left their day jobs , and they put a significant amount of their time and money developing stuff for Facebook . "
Can the Facebook platform flourish despite the current developer dissatisfaction ?
Not everyone agrees .
For its part , Facebook knows that the future of the Facebook Platform relies heavily on the input and innovations of the developer community , Morin says .
That future centers around Facebook Connect , a project aimed at enabling users to take their Facebook identity along with them while visiting third - party sites .
Connect plays into Facebook 's desire to build a sort of Web - based operating system , to be the logical starting - point on the Internet for many users , just as Google would like to do .
Trouble Starts : Redesign Makes Developers Scramble
Ever since Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ( " Zuck " to Morin and other Facebook staffers ) announced in May 2007 that the Facebook Platform would be open to developers all over the world , the evolution of the technology has been sporadic and unpredictable .
A Wild West environment emerged in the first few months .
Individual developers got rich overnight ( at least on paper ) as their applications spread across the social network in a matter of hours .
Some entertained million dollar buyouts or took funding to grow into full - fledged start - up companies .
Now , a year and a half later , critics say this community has been used by Facebook to buoy its own traffic growth and left with this rule of law :
What the social network gives it can take away .
Not everyone wants to hear it , says Scott Rafer , a Silicon Valley veteran who has worked with blogging technologies and now runs Lookery , a company that does ad targeting for publishers on social networks including Facebook .
Three months ago , speaking at a Facebook developer conference in Berlin , Rafer told members of the Facebook ecosystem that in his estimation , the Facebook platform was dead .
" A lot of people got screamingly angry , " Rafer says .
" I was talking to a crowd of folks that were looking into building more Facebook apps .
I was like , ' Are you nuts ? ' "
Though he editorialized a bit , Rafer says he was simply sharing what he knew from cold hard numbers .
The traffic on his clients '
Facebook applications fell by nearly 50 percent after the redesign .
Blogs following the Facebook ecosystem and research firms support some of his conclusions , at least by the numbers .
An analysis by Inside Facebook , an independent blog that follows the social network and its ecosystem , found that two of the top three applications on Facebook , built by Slide , declined in users in the first several weeks following the redesign going sitewide .
One of Slide 's apps , called FunSpace , fell sharply ( by 37 percent ) in monthly active users .
The top app at the time , Super Wall ( built by RockYou ) , held 18 million monthly users before the redesign .
Today , according to AppData , it has 12 million .
During the same first month after the redesign , Hussain 's Peanut Labs estimated that 66 percent of the top 250 applications on Facebook decreased in daily users .
When the Facebook platform first launched , many successful applications appeared in small boxes ( known in the social networking industry as " widgets " ) on a user 's profile page , allowing that user 's friends to engage with the apps upon visiting the page .
Ideally , these friends would be compelled to install the applications themselves , increasing the app's pervasiveness across the network .
When Facebook redesigned the site , the company sought to de-emphasize the profile pages and focus on the newsfeed — a column that runs down the center of a user 's homepage and keeps the user updated on actions taken by their friends on the service , such as posting a picture , updating personal status or attending an event .
Facebook moved the majority of third - party widgets into a new " boxes " tab .
" The redesign decreased the chance of serendipitous discovery of an interesting application , " says Keith Rabois , VP of business strategy at Slide .
" One of the best and most healthy ways to discover a new application is by seeing it on a friend 's profile .
Tabs are a very poor interface for discovering new things . "
After Facebook Traffic Spikes , Relationship Changes
But the redesign represented what Rafer calls the " coup de grace " in a sequence of events during the last year that showed Facebook was clamping down on the number of ways that application developers could enable their products to incubate across the social network .
When the Facebook platform first launched , the company put few restrictions on how developers could market their products .
After a Facebook user installed a new app , the application maker would often invite the user 's friends to install it as well , flooding homepages with invitations in what became known by blogs and publications covering the space as " app spam . "
Facebook , one by one , began closing or constraining these channels .
Rafer says Facebook kept the platform so open for a period of time to gain traffic , and when they had garnered the eyeballs and surpassed MySpace as the largest social network , they closed the door a bit .
" They had this huge amount of traffic by then , and they were big enough to get Madison Avenue 's attention , " Rafer says .
" So they clamped down on some of the apps , which , frankly , many of which were trash anyway .
The developers thought the Facebook platform in its 1.0 version was their God - given right .
They thought it was Facebook 's moral duty to maintain it .
Well , it 's their [ Facebook 's ] playground and they can do what they want . "
Since the fall 2008 redesign , the smaller Facebook app developers have likely fallen hardest off the monkey bars , since these developers relied heavily on the profile pages for their applications .
Without the clout extended to bigger shops like RockYou and Slide , they also feel much less inclined to complain about Facebook 's move publicly , for fear their situation could worsen , especially if they have investors funding their long - term business plans .
Today , many of these smaller developers wo n't talk on the record .
An organization called SF Beta arranges a monthly mixer cocktail party for members of the Bay Area start - up community .
Earlier this month , at an event held at 111 Minna St. , a bar in San Francisco 's South of Market district , some young application developers were in attendance mingling over six dollar beers and colorful drinks .
Many developers who had started small companies talked with passion about the effects of the Facebook redesign , now that they 've had several months to monitor the effects .
When asked how his apps fared after the redesign , one developer made the sound of a plane crashing .
Some small shops do say publicly that the new Facebook Platform landscape has evolved into a more challenging business environment .
Game developers have fared better than others , because in addition to ads , their applications derive money from users paying them directly for extra features .
Akron , Ohio - based developer Matt Maroon has taken $ 20,000 in funding from yCombinator , a venture capital firm that gives small rounds to start - ups in their infancy .
His company , Blue Frog Gaming , builds fantasy sports applications that run on top of social networks , including Facebook .
He says the redesign hurt big and small developers alike , especially if they were n't mindful that the rules could change .
Facebook " really hurt the Slides and RockYous and those guys , " he says .
" As a developer you 're always cognizant of the fact you 're playing in someone else 's backyard .
They put display ads on [ those apps ] which pay almost nothing .
The games are making money and no one else 's seems to be . "
Chrys Bader got out of the Facebook app - making business nearly a year ago , before the trouble really began , he says .
He co-created an application that integrated Yahoo !
Answers on top of Facebook , then sold his half of the business in February 2008 .
The app today still enjoys a small following , but it would n't be a big business , he says .
" At first , the platform opened up and there was n't any limits , " Bader says .
" You could automatically invite anyone to the app .
If someone was coming to me now and saying they want to create a Facebook app , I 'd tell them all the problems and how hard it is . "
All the developer shops also live with the knowledge that Facebook might someday push any third - party app aside by providing similar services to users itself .
iLIke , a service that allows people to share music interests and playlists , is one of the of the most popular applications on Facebook .
Rumors have gone around Silicon Valley that Facebook would make its own version of just such a service .
Rafer says it would be better for Facebook 's image to purchase iLike .
i Like declined comment for this article .
But some other leading Facebook developer firms say they 're confident that Facebook does n't want to allocate the amount of necessary resources to compete in that way .
" If you build an application really vibrantly , and you 're incredibly dedicated to it , it 's actually very difficult for Facebook to copy and improve the user experience , " says Rabois of Slide .
" As an example , we have a whole team that does nothing but innovate on top of the Top Friends application . "
Facebook Connect : The Operating System of the Future ?
Facebook CEO
Zuckerberg regularly handles the interviews where he 's asked the same set of questions that boil down to one : How will Facebook make money ?
Zuckerberg has not answered the question to the satisfaction of many industry - watchers and Wall Street analysts .
It could ultimately be Morin and his group that answer that tricky question .
They remain out of the spotlight , steadfastly focused on a pretty heady mission : make Facebook the modern version of the operating system , an OS that makes the Web fundamentally social across all sites and applications .
If the next wave of Internet wars takes place between Facebook and Google , Connect might be Facebook 's strongest weapon , leading the company to focus mightily on building out ways to support sites that work with Connect , Rafer says .
Both Facebook and Google have ripped pages from Bill Gates ' Microsoft approach of being the first - stop on a user 's computing experience .
Google says the modern day operating system , or at least the starting off point on the Web , starts with search .
Facebook believes it starts with people connected via social networking .
Despite the criticisms of Facebook 's fall 2008 redesign and their governance of it , Morin and his group emphasize the importance of the developer community in this effort .
Unlike some past technology gurus , they also admit their own mistakes .
Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows the police to stop and search people .
In 2008 :
Number of people stopped nationwide by British Transport Police using s 44 : 160,000
Number of people stopped in London by the Metropolitan Police using s. 44 : 200,000
Number of people amongst the 360,000 stopped under s. 44 and found to have any terrorist material or links : 0

Dear friends ,
My brother and I recently spent a wonderful day with sculptor and all - round eccentric Alan Ross of ArtInSteel .
The result of Alan ’s patient help was that my welding improved immensely , and he humoured my ambitions when I said I wanted to make a sculpture of a bird in the afternoon .
Well , here it is .
I ’ve not tried my hand at sculpture before , and I think it came out pretty well .
And , yes Alan , a tall bike is definitely on my to - do list now .

It snowed again !
It does n’t snow very often in London , so we have to make the most of it .
The old electric snowmobile was pretty unstable , so today I rebuilt it with a new and much improved front end .
I also built a sledge to tow behind – this was originally supposed to be a set of shelves for my son ’s bedroom , but needs must , and now it ’s a sledge .
My son is delighted by this change of plans ; my wife , somewhat less so .
Here it is in action :
Dear friends , Last Saturday my youngest son came into my bedroom early in the morning carrying a big pile of cardboard he ’d collected and declared that he wanted me to make him a scary mask , just like his big brother .

Dear friends , On Sunday afternoon I was all alone .
My wife and kids were stuck in Denmark by the snow , and I was by myself .
Bored .
Bored , with a welder .
But no - one to play in the snow with .
And then it struck me – what I needed to do was to build a snowmobile .
Not that we get much snow in London , but as we had some for a change , it needed to be exploited properly .
And so six hours of frantic cutting , welding , and soldering later , here it is – the mark 1 electric snowmobile .

Dear friends ,
It ’s Easter , and in the Fzz family that can only mean one thing : the Easter Challenge .
Last year we built an Egg Cannon , but this year the challenge was to build a device to take an aerial photograph of my father ’s house .
Extra points are awarded for style and the use of mad science .
With those bonus points in mind , my son and I set out to build a hydrogen reconnaissance balloon , complete with a remote control camera and mounting .
But we only had a week from idea to challenge , so we had to work fast .
Read on for how we faired , or look here for construction details .

Dear friends , Before our Steam Rocket leaked fuel into the top of it , I used to have a wireless basestation on my desk , and I ’d got it the habit of looking at the activity lights when a download was taking longer than it should to see if anything was actually happening .
Being a creature of habit , I kept glancing at where it used to be whenever I was waiting for a web page ; clearly a replacement was needed .
Well , here at last it is : a steam gauge to measure the pressure in the tubes of the Internet .
Read on for how it works …
Dear friends ,
Thanks to a suggestion from OutaSpaceman , we journeyed down to the Hollycombe Steam Collection in Hampshire for their Festival of Steam .
My youngest son is obsessed with trains , but even he was occasionally enticed off the rails onto the fabulous Edwardian steam - powered fairground rides today .
A wonderful day out and a great hit with the kids .
If you ’re ever in the area , please pay them a visit .

Dear friends ,
It ’s midsummer and we had a beautiful sunny day today .
Perfect to demonstrate the awe - inspiring power of the sun , focused through our giant lens into the heat ray of death ( at least to any ants that wander into its path ) .
Cardboard catches fire instantaneously , wood burns in a few seconds , plastic melts and water boils .
And the swirling smoke in the sunlight makes the focus of the light wonderfully clear .
Lots of fun for apprentice pyromaniacs .
Cheers , Fzz More pictures are here .
In the musky Sierra foothills , as the January sun sank , six cyclists stopped for a reality check .
Ben Lieberson , a Los Angeles chef , laid out the challenge .
" We 've got to go 40 miles in an hour - and - a - half , " he said , no despair in his British accent .
" We can do it .
Let 's hammer it , " replied Cole Maness , a Tennessee transplant to L.A. known to crack open a beer on a mountaintop or jump off - road for impromptu cyclocross .
They took off behind their mechanic 's car and a hulking white van crammed with energy bars and water bottles , duffle bags and dirty clothes .
From the wheel , Carey Schleicher - Haselhorst navigated the California back roads .
Daniel Wakefield
Pasley leaned out the passenger window from the waist of gray jeans he'd worn all week -- strawberry - blond hair flying as his camera clicked .
" This is rad ! " he often called to the world .
Half an hour later , back on flat ground , the crew waited to watch the team veer into farm country .
Like so many passers - by , two women cyclists asked about the spectacle .
The explanation :
These guys were riding the Tour of California a month before the real deal .
This week , pros take on America 's eight - stage , 780 - mile answer to the Tour de France .
But , for one week in January , the course belonged to a half - dozen speedy amateurs testing their limits .
Cameras recorded the whole crazy ordeal , from the ride itself to the small towns and larger - than - life characters .
As if on cue , cyclists whipped around the corner , a blur of yellow and black .
" They could ride with Lance Armstrong , " one of the women said .
You 'd never know this was marketing , except for five cursive letters on the riders ' clothing : R a p h a .
A small British company , Rapha makes expensive , high - performance cycling gear .
The mother ship opened North American headquarters last year on Portland 's North Mississippi Avenue and hired three thirtysomethings , who could 've introduced Rapha to the United States with magazine spreads , say , or online banner ads .
Instead , they invested in a project called the Continental .
A band of cyclists -- fast but not pro , thoughtful but not geeky , a touch wacky -- embarked on America 's most epic rides .
They pushed hard , but not so hard they missed wildflowers and cafes .
They fixed their own flats .
And their journeys were documented online , creating a real - life sports drama .
Eventually , the stories might be published as a travelogue and guidebook .
The Continental is an extreme example of a national advertising trend .
Consumers do n't want to be manipulated ; they want to be part of the adventure .
So Adidas invites women to share training sagas .
Red Bull stages contests for human - powered flying machines .
And Rapha devotes more than one - third of its U.S. staff time and marketing budget to the Continental , in hopes it will inspire people to ride .
And , maybe , drop a few hundred dollars on their wardrobes .
The idea took root a couple of years ago , before Rapha had a Portland connection .
Pasley , an avid rider who worked in sports marketing here , got hooked on the company .
He sent an e-mail , asking to document the glory of physical suffering and roadside Americana .
Simon Mottram , Rapha 's founder , loved the concept .
" It 's about adventure and self - discovery and the great outdoors and all that stuff , " he said .
Before long , he hired Pasley to launch the Continental as a freelance gig .
Just a few riders at first , and a shoestring budget .
By chance , when Mottram decided to open a U.S. headquarters , Nike veteran Slate Olson was a finalist to run it .
Rapha 's founder flew to Portland to interview the man -- and the city .
He was sold on both and joined a growing list of cycling - related companies in Oregon .
" If we launched in New York or San Francisco , that 's where people would expect us to be , " Mottram said .
" Portland adds a bit more edge , and we like that . "
Olson rounded out the Portland office with Pasley and Schleicher - Haselhorst , who worked for Raleigh bicycles in the Seattle area .
She fell for Rapha 's sleek design and old - school outlook , especially the early Continental site .
" Here I am , lusting after this brand for all it encompasses .
And then there 's a position open , " she said .
As the staff grew , so did the scope of the Continental .
Rapha added an East Coast team last year and , coast to coast , nearly two dozen new rides .
Each is accompanied by maps , photos and riders ' reflections .
Expectations are high .
About one - third of Rapha 's sales come from the United States , but Mottram hopes to boost that to one - half .
He 's banking on Lance Armstrong mania and the environmental , pro-riding movement .
And the Continental .
Initially , he does n't expect the dramatic response he'd get from traditional ads .
But , even if the Continental is a slow burn , Mottram believes it will connect with his target audience : cyclists in their 30s and 40s , with disposable income and wanderlust .
Or , as Olson put it , " It 's a project that really has no business in a company that 's 4 1/ 2 years old and trying to make a profit . "
But he 'll take the risk .
This is a make - or - break year .
Through Continental Calling , fans compete to lead the crew this summer on a favorite route .
And last month , the team tackled the Tour of California route .
It was the most grueling ride yet , day after day of 100 - plus miles , through forests , up mountains , past farms , from Sacramento south almost as far as San Diego .
" We want to celebrate the route , the people , the places that make this a great tour , in a Continental - style way , " Pasley said a few days before takeoff .
Even for pros , the tour is a test .
But coaches give advice , police officers close roads and direct traffic , a lead pack breaks the wind .
Massage therapists , mechanics and chefs attend to cyclists each evening .
Plus , the pros maximize recovery time by riding really fast .
If anybody was nervous , though , it did n't show when the Continental team arrived at Rapha headquarters on a sunny Saturday morning .
The rental van was clean , doors flung open and a bike rack on top .
In the second - story office , a conference table was stacked with hats , base layers and jackets for the six riders who signed on .
Cyclists do n't earn a Rapha salary .
But they get free gear , and do n't pay for gas or hotels .
As Lieberson put it , unless you 're world - class , " You do n't get rich cycling .
But you might see some interesting places . "
He and Maness , the two Los Angeles riders , arranged to meet the gang at the start of the race in California .
The rest of the team -- two East Coast riders and two Northwesterners -- packed up for the long van ride south .
Hahn Rossman , who runs a metal shop in Seattle , was drawn to the Continental philosophy of riding .
But , given the rainy season and a recent surgery , he would n't normally ease into race shape with such a beastly ride .
" This is either the best preparation ever , " he said , " or the worst . "

Ryan Thomson , a designer and 3 - D artist at a Portland architecture firm , started riding as a kid in southern Oregon and races for an un-team called the Gentle Lovers .
And , of course , Rapha .
" You always try to validate it .
Is this worth the time and effort ? " he said .
" The people I 've met and the experiences I get are irreplaceable . "
A few days in , the group settled into a routine .
Meet at 6 every morning for granola and yogurt at the night 's motel , usually a cheap roadside joint .
Weigh in .
Pasley , the chief documentarian , snaps photos .
Schleicher - Haselhorst assembles a loaf of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , and loads the van .
And cyclists squeeze in to drive to the start of the next stage .
Tuesday morning , while Barack Obama 's inaugural address boomed from an Italian cafe in downtown San Jose , the guys stripped T - shirts and pulled on gear .
They massaged sunscreen onto their faces and pain - relief cream onto already - burning leg muscles .
Schleicher - Haselhorst dispensed Advil .
" The big climb of the day comes right away , " Pasley announced .
As their legs pumped , the guys spread out and found their own rhythms .
San Jose faded into the background , a fuzzy grid of ranch houses giving way to cows in green fields .
" Up , up , up , up ! " Schleicher - Haselhorst called out the driver 's window .
" Beautiful . "
Along the roadside , a brown calf loped next to Jeremy Dunn , the baby of the group at 28 and the founder of a Boston - based cycling magazine called Embrocation .
Dunn pedaled slower and held out his hand -- a peace offering .
But his bovine friend gave up .
At the top , the guys jumped off their bikes to hug and refuel .
" Every time it started hurting , I just looked around and thought , ' This is gorgeous , ' " said Dan Langlois , the second East Coast rider , who has a story for every tattoo : scissors because " they 're a handy tool , " a bowling ball from a trip to Fargo , N.D. , the word " ACTION " because that 's his nickname .
Seven hours , 90 miles and a few wrong turns later , a golden sunset and the stench of manure welcomed the group to Modesto .
The van pulled up to replace water one last time for Thomson , the Portland rider , known as " Evil " since his bike messenger days .
He said he'd love a Gardenburger and a salad with vinaigrette .
" Really ? " Schleicher - Haselhorst asked , incredulous .
" No .
I could eat six tacos , then a steak . "
She laughed .
" Five more days ? " he asked .
" Five more days , Evil . "
The next day , while the team battled daylight through the Sierras , Pasley had another mission : documenting roadside attractions .
He shot film , ripped from packages with his teeth , and used every conceivable vantage point -- lying on his belly , standing on the van .
Pasley knew he was onto something in Cathey 's Valley , a wayside that consisted of a post office and the Oasis Market ( daily special , beanie weenie soup ) .
The more photos he took , the more people emerged .
" Where are these pictures going ? " one bystander asked .
" The FBI ? " another chimed in .
" On the Internet ? "
But nobody objected .
In Mariposa , a mountainside hamlet , Pasley approached a woman in bright red slacks with his usual query .
" Excuse me , can I take your photograph ? "
Turned out she was a nanny from France and once lived close to the Tour de France route .
She wanted to know everything about the Continental .
Several miles down the road , Pasley photographed a stern - looking woman tending a fire in her front yard .
" I feel like some kind of 18th - century crier , " he said when he returned to the van .
" ' The Tour of California is coming !
The Tour of California is coming !'
' Really ?
Like the Tour of France ?
Right here on this very road ? ' "
In the final stretch , a motorcycle cop asked about the cyclists .
Of course , Pasley asked to take his picture .
And , of course , the officer said yes .
He explained that he 'll block roads for the tour ; he uses his radar gun to clock the pros .
Ten minutes later , the riders pulled into a field a few miles shy of Clovis .
It was n't safe to ride anymore , with traffic whizzing by in the dark .
So the guys loaded their bikes and changed clothes behind orange trees .
Just before they left , the officer showed up again .
He turned on his lights and escorted the team to the town brewpub .
Thursday began as one big problem .
Rain , a flat tire .
Rossman desperately wanted to find a replacement for a broken coupler on his bike , although the mechanic from Sram -- a component company that partners with Rapha -- had rigged a temporary solution .
Pasley called for advice from Ira Ryan , a Portland bike builder who had to sit out this trip .
" We 're on day five of 100 miles , in the rain , in a town that smells like skunk , on a highway , " he announced gloomily .
When a strained thigh got so bad he could barely ride , Dunn pulled out for the day .
He changed into long underwear and stretched out in the van to rest up for tomorrow .
" You know you 're doing the right thing , " Pasley told him .
" I know .
It 's just hard to stomach . "
Rain pounded harder , splattering mud on riders ' faces and sucking color from the landscape .
The Rapha crew had n't seen a town in hours .
Rossman quit , too , nervous about his tenuous bike .
While he tracked down a part , the sky dried up .
" I think I 'm collecting heroes this week , " Schleicher - Haselhorst said softly .
" What do you mean ? " Rossman asked .
" You guys .
Look at them up there . "
Four riders zoomed ahead , down a road that stretched green and brown forever .
" Sorry , " she said .
" I 'm just having a moment . "
The team kept moving .
To a farm field with an inexplicable floral couch in the middle .
To the curve where James Dean died .
To that night 's destination , and on and on .

Last week , at the height of Operation Cast Lead , a group of Israeli firemen threw their hats into the political ring , albeit in somewhat undiplomatic and uncivilised fashion .
During a peaceful anti-war vigil outside a Tel Aviv air force base , several members of the fire brigade turned on one protester , drenching her relentlessly with water from their hoses , before approaching her and ordering her into the station in order to " give us all head " .
Their actions were , while wholly illegal , none the less emblematic of a massive shift in Israeli public opinion over the last few years , according to Sharon Dolev , the woman on the receiving end of the assault .
A veteran activist , Dolev has suffered a great deal during her 20 years of campaigning in the Israeli peace camp ( " death threats , being shot with rubber bullets , hate mail , beatings " ) , but said that this incident was " the first time that the establishment felt safe in [ taking action such as this ] " .
" It used to be a big deal if bus drivers criticised protests and vigils in public , " she recalls , " since as employees of the state , they were not allowed to express political opinions in uniform . "
Now , however , the firemen felt so secure of escaping punishment that they even bombarded her with firecrackers during the attack , telling her " now you know what it 's like to live in Sderot " .
When video evidence emerged on an Israeli news website of her ordeal , readers ' comments were predictably scathing of Dolev and her fellow protestors for daring to speak out in the first place against the IDF 's operation .
" Of the 380 comments , all but 10 were in support of the fire brigade , " said Dolev .
" Some readers even called openly for our murder , urging the police to shoot us , or saying ' Why use water – use acid instead ' . "
In her view , the inexorable shift of the Israeli public towards out and out hostility and hyper - defensiveness was inevitable from as far back as 1967 , when the West Bank was first conquered .
" We used to hold signs at protests reading ' The occupation will corrupt ' , " she told me .
" Now , we can see that it has [ come to pass ] .
As a society , we have lost our ability to see clearly ; we have let fear blind us .
Once , calling someone a racist was the harshest accusation you could make .
Later , you began to hear people say ' I know I 'm a racist , but ...' ; nowadays [ during Cast Lead ] , we heard ' I know I 'm talking like a Nazi , but at least the Nazis knew how to deal with their enemies ' . "
Despite others employing Nazi comparisons to describe Israeli military actions , Dolev is n't comfortable with such terminology herself , not least because it derails the debate about the issues at hand .
" It 's all too easy for the Israeli authorities to say 'we did n't build an Auschwitz for the Palestinians , so everything 's ok ' , but in reality everything is not ok . "
She believes that history has come full circle , and that instead of learning the lessons of the Holocaust , " we have become the racists ourselves " .
" Is n't Gaza a ghetto ? " she continues .
" OK , we do n't use the Palestinians ' hair for cushions , but the [ stage is being set for the ] same kind of process of dehumanisation here . "
Working in a joint Israeli - Palestinian organisation in Gaza in 1989 gave Dolev her first exposure to " the banality of evil " , she says .
" It was n't seeing a soldier get scared and shoot into a crowd , but rather seeing a girl sitting in her house and getting shot by a stray bullet .
And then , when she needed to be transferred to a Cairo hospital , the Shabak officers saying only she could cross , and no one else .
A 12 - year - old girl , in a vegetative state , and they would n't even let her mother accompany her .
That is the banality of evil . "
In her eyes , the Israeli public has allowed its leaders and military to get away with such punitive measures simply because they have allowed fear to override all other emotions : " Fear turns us into beasts , " she says flatly .
" I remember in my first week at school , aged six , we were taught how to blockade the classroom in case a terrorist got into the playground .
While some fear is justified , there is not enough reason to make the public terrified on a daily basis . "
The media are just as responsible as the government for perpetually scaring ordinary Israelis , she believes .
" Fear sells papers , " she says cynically .
Such defensiveness allowed the police to get away with imprisoning some 700 activists over the course of Operation Cast Lead , she believes ; many on the most spurious of charges .
" They arrested some on the charge of disturbing public order , others on even vaguer charges .
And some were even detained for ' damaging the nation 's morale ' – a charge which does n't even exist [ in the statutes ] .
There is no law in Israel anymore . "
As well as her experience at the hands of the fire brigade , Dolev also points to the kind of sloganeering in the election campaign as proof that the bedrock of democracy on which Israel is founded is beginning to look far less solid .
" When you have Lieberman declaring ' No loyalty , no citizenship ' , you start to worry about what point we 've come to . "
However , she is undeterred in her struggle on behalf of the peace camp , believing that hope is not lost in terms of convincing the Israeli public of an alternative to perpetual war and aggression .
A firm promoter of the Arab Peace Initiative , she is convinced that the proposal is the best way to resolve the decades - old conflict .
" It 's the biggest carrot ever offered to the Israeli people , " she says .
" One -state or two - state is a non-issue ; whatever the two peoples agree on I would take with both hands .
All that matters is that there are borders , and that those living within the borders are given full rights and citizenship .
However , I worry about [ Israeli Jews ] becoming a minority , because after all we 've taught them over 60 years of how to treat minorities , it 's become dangerous to be a minority ourselves ... "

WASHINGTON
As Barack Obama got to town , one of the first things he did was seek the counsel of past presidents , including George Bush senior .
As W. was leaving town , one of the last things he did was explain why he never sought the counsel of his father on issues that his father knew intimately , like Iraq and Saddam .
When Brit Hume did a joint interview last week with Bush father and son , dubbed “ 41st guy ” and “ 43rd guy ” by W. , the Fox anchor asked whether it was true that “ there was n’t a lot of give and take ” between them , except on family matters .
“ See , ” the Oedipally oddball W. replied , “ the interesting thing is that a president has got plenty of advisers , but what a president never has is someone who gave him unconditional love . ”
There was no way , for example , that the Daschle flap was going to derail the forward march of a man who had survived the Rev. Jeremiah Wright fiasco .
It ’s early , but there are signs that Mr. Obama may be the kind of president who is incomprehensible to the cynics among us  one who is responsible and mature , who is concerned not just with the short - term political realities but also the long - term policy implications .
He has certainly handled himself much better than some of the clowns carrying leadership banners for the G.O.P. Michael Steele , the new Republican Party chairman , could barely contain his glee over the fact that no Republicans voted for the stimulus package in the House .
“ The goose egg that you laid on the president ’s desk was just beautiful , ” he said .
“ This bill stinks , ” said Lindsey Graham of South Carolina during the Senate debate on the package .
Representative Pete Sessions of Texas , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , made it clear that his party was committed to the low road when he talked about picking up pointers from the Taliban .
I ’m not joking .
“ Insurgency , we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban , ” said Mr. Sessions , in an interview with Hotline , which is part of NationalJournal.com .
The simple truth is that most Republican politicians would like Mr. Obama to fail because that is their ticket to a quick return to power .
I think the president is a more formidable opponent than they realize .
Mr. Obama is like a championship chess player , always several moves ahead of friend and foe alike .
He ’s smart , deft , elegant and subtle .
While Lindsey Graham was behaving like a 6 - year - old on the Senate floor and Pete Sessions was studying passages in his Taliban handbook , Mr. Obama and his aides were assessing what ’s achievable in terms of stimulus legislation and how best to get there .
I ’d personally like to see a more robust stimulus package , with increased infrastructure spending and fewer tax cuts .
But the reality is that Mr. Obama needs at least a handful of Republican votes in the Senate to get anything at all done , and he ca n’t afford to lose this first crucial legislative fight of his presidency .
The Democrats may succeed in bolstering their package somewhat in conference , but I think Mr. Obama would have been satisfied all along to start his presidency off with an $ 800 billion - plus stimulus program .
Toujours Tingo : Weird words and bizarre phrases
Toujours Tingo , a book by Adam Jacot de Boinod , lists weird words and bizarre phrases from around the world .
The " tingo " of its title is an Easter Island word , meaning to borrow objects from a friend 's house one by one until there are none left .
Most news reports last week on the double political murder in Moscow focused on Stanislav Markelov , the intended target of the assassination , rather than Anastasia Baburova , his fellow victim .
With reason – Markelov was a prolific lawyer , who excelled in taking on human rights cases that few others in Putin ’s Russia would take .
He had long demonstrated a courage in pursuing these cases that earned him enemies far and wide – something that would make it hard to identify who had him killed even if anyone in a position to do so would want to .
At RFE / RL , Zoya Svetova runs through the list .
Was it the Russian colonel who raped and strangled a Chechen woman , and whose early release from prison Markelov was trying to stop that very day ?
Maybe it was the major from a special police forces unit , who once threatened to kill Anna Politkovskaya ( the journalist who was assassinated in 2006 ) and went on to torture a Chechen student to death ?
Markelov represented both Politkovskaya and the Chechen .
Perhaps it had to do with the case of a local newspaper ’s editor - in - chief , who had gotten in the crosshairs of the mayor and was mysteriously assaulted ?
He is still in a coma ; Markelov represented him in court .
Maybe it was the fascists , because of the anti-fascists Markelov defended ?
Maybe Markelov was killed because of his involvement in the case of a man who disappeared last year after accusing the Chechen authorities of running secret prisons ?
Svetova ’s commentary ( “ Russia ’s ‘ Open Season ’ Of Murder Continues ” ) lists some of the recent victims on the “ unending list ” of political assassinations .
Just a week before it was Markelov ’s turn , a Chechen was assassinated in Vienna as he left a grocery store .
It was Umar S. Israilov , who had fled Russia after he ’d accused Chechnya ’s president of participating in kidnappings and torture sessions .
( They ’d already tried to force him back by abducting and torturing his father . )
The Washington Post highlighted the trend most pointedly ( “ Two More Critics of Vladimir Putin Take Bullets in the Head ” ) : “ The larger story here is of serial murders of Mr. Putin ’s opponents , at home and abroad .
Ms. Baburova [..] is at least the 15th journalist to be slain since Mr. Putin took power .
No one has been held accountable in any of the cases [.. ] . ”
But amidst the dismay about Markelov ’s death , there were fewer personal notes about Baburova , a friend of Markelov and a journalist at the opposition Novaya Gazeta , who wrote about racism and the frequent attacks on ethnic minorities .
She was the daughter of a factory worker in the Crimea , and was studying journalism at the Moscow State University in the evenings .
She was also a radical activist , who had joined the anarchist group Autonomous Action the day before she was murdered .
According to the group ’s tribute , she “ was into physical sports such as parachute jumping [ and ] well trained in martial art ” .
It did n’t save her ; she was shot while trying to apprehend the gunman .
Her colleagues from the Novaya Gazeta paid tribute to her .
Markelov was their legal advisor ; Baburova was one of their newest colleagues .
You will forgive them a sense of pathos ; Baburova is the fourth NG journalist to be murdered ( NG co-owner Aleksandr Lebedev has now requested that his journalists be permitted to carry guns ) .
This baby has been cooking for way too long .
If there 's no show - stoppers reported , PyOpenGL 3.0.0c1 should be the same as the final release .
The only big change from the last beta is that it now includes GLUT and GLE implementations packaged as data - files for Win32 deployments .
3.0.0 is a complete rewrite of PyOpenGL using the ctypes library .
It has a number of small incompatible changes , can use numpy arrays , has pluggable support for other data - format types , provides access to most modern extensions and core OpenGL up to 3.0 .
PyOpenGL 3.0 has not yet been tested with Python 2.6 , and definitely will not work with Python 3.0 .
You should expect a small slowdown with PyOpenGL 3.x , as the ctypes based wrapping system is inherently slower then the SWIG system used in the 2.x series .
If you are using deprecated functionality ( such as using individual calls for vertices , colours and the like ) you may find PyOpenGL 3.x unacceptably slow .
You should convert your code to use array - based drawing ( or vertex buffer objects ) , as OpenGL 3.1 and beyond are intending to drop support for the legacy APIs .

It is possible to do all of this , and more : - no rebuilding of the whole list on updates to the list - the update operation takes constant time ( for lists longer than 32 elements on 32 - bit platform ) - both cyclic and terminated lists can be handled , uniformly - no monads used or mentioned - let alone no IORef , STRef , TVars , etc .
The algorithm is essentially imperative ( and so permits identity checking and in - place `updates ' ) but implemented purely functionally .
No destructive updates are ever used .
Therefore , all the changes can be undone and re-done , and the code is MT - safe .
The code is easily generalizable to 2D .
Here are the tests > testl = fromList [ 1..5 ] > testl_s = takeDL 11 testl * FL > testl_s [ 5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5 ] > testl1 = update ( - 1 ) testl > testl1_s = takeDL 11 testl1 * FL > testl1_s [ - 1,1,2,3,4,-1,1,2,3,4,-1 ] > testl2 = update ( - 2 ) . move_right ' . move_right ' $ testl1 > testl2_s = takeDL 11 testl2 * FL > testl2_s [ - 2,3,4,-1,1,-2,3,4,-1,1,-2 ] > --

Before Vh1 , or Dr. Drew Presents Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew Starring Dr. Drew , or the new Dr. Drew 's House Of Pain ( Dr. Drew Pinsky is the Tyler Perry of addiction medicine ) , drug addicted pseudo - celebrities looking to quit had to get clean without the extra self - exploitation high that a VH1 rehab reality show can give ( aka Fameadone ) .
Some went cold turkey ; some went to non-televised rehab ; and some — well , really just Alec Baldwin — went to the video arcade .

From The NY Post :
Baldwin would end the night at an arcade warehouse playing " Galaga . "
" I would play video games from , like , 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. , and I would wind down .
Then I 'd go home and go to bed , " Baldwin writes .
" This was the only way I could go ' beta ' and go into that state I needed to be , where I could calm down and take my mind off everything .
I did n't want to see anybody , talk to anybody , deal with anybody . "
A " moment of clarity " came when he saw pity in the face of Julian , the person who ran the parlor .
" I was doing a show then [ ' Knots Landing ' ] , making tens of thousands of dollars a week , which was part of the problem , " he writes .
" Julian would put the key in the lock and open the door , and he would just kind of look at me like , ' Wow , I 'm glad I 'm not you . ' " Baldwin agreed .
" You got no idea , Julian .
Julian , I need you .
I need you to get that key and open the f- - - ing door and let me in .
I got to play ' Galaga . ' "

Mornings when Julian was late opening the arcade , a wild - eyed Baldwin would roam the streets looking for a hit of Ms. Pac Man , Centipede , Megawars , anything that flashed or beeped or featured crude graphics .
He knew he'd hit rock bottom when he was thrown out of a Toys R Us one morning after a store employee found him screaming " Zap !
Zap !
Take that , spacebugs ! " underneath a pile of 20 Lite Brites ripped from their packaging .
Some " moments of clarity " are just better than others , you know ?
Thankfully , Alec Baldwin has both a job and a future as an actor .
If he did n't , Vh1 would already be signing him up to be the next Dr. Drew .
By this time next year , he'd be overseeing Celebrity Rehab : Chase The Joystick With Alec Baldwin , and Dr. Drew would ( finally ) be exiled to Animal Planet to host Loveline For Dogs With Dr. Drew .

The Truth About Gun Control And Partisanship Posted by Pile ( 31400 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ BSAlert * exclusive * ]
Ever since Obama was elected to the White House , conservatives and gun enthusiasts have been screaming about how likely Barak Obama is to take away peoples firearms .
People talk of the " Clinton ban " which restricted assault weapons in 1994 and claim another Democrat in the White House is bad news for gun owners .
But is this truthful ?
Are Democrats more for gun control than Republicans ?
We examine historical and recent legislation to reveal that a lot of what people are saying is total BS ...
Reagan 's administration passed more restrictive gun laws than any other administration ( including the dubiously - named " Firearm Protection Act of 1986 which banned citizens owning automatic weapons without special permission ) .
And the " Clinton ban " was actually named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary after James Brady was shot by a nutjob .
In 1969 , journalist William Safire asked Richard Nixon what he thought about gun control .
" Guns are an abomination , " Nixon replied .
According to Safire , Nixon went on to confess that , " Free from fear of gun owners ' retaliation at the polls , he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses for hunting rifles . "
It was President George Bush , Sr. who banned the import of " assault weapons " in 1989 , and promoted the view that Americans should only be allowed to own weapons suitable for " sporting purposes . "
It was Governor Ronald Reagan of California who signed the Mulford Act in 1967 , " prohibiting the carrying of firearms on one 's person or in a vehicle , in any public place or on any public street . "
The law was aimed at stopping the Black Panthers , but affected all gun owners .
Twenty - four years later , Reagan was still pushing gun control .
" I support the Brady Bill , " he said in a March 28 , 1991 speech , " and I urge the Congress to enact it without further delay . "
One of the most aggressive gun control advocates today is Republican mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City , whose administration sued 26 gun manufacturers in June 2000 , and whose police commissioner , Howard Safir , proposed a nationwide plan for gun licensing , complete with yearly " safety " inspections .
Another Republican , New York State Governor George Pataki , on August 10 , 2000 , signed into law what The New York Times called " the nation ? s strictest gun controls , " a radical program mandating trigger locks , background checks at gun shows and " ballistic fingerprinting " of guns sold in the state .
It also raised the legal age to buy a handgun to 21 and banned " assault weapons , " the sale or possession of which would now be punishable by seven years in prison .
Gun control crusaders argue that the Republicans are simply yielding to grassroots pressure , to gain political advantage .
But polls show little evidence of such pressure .
The ominous Assault Weapons Ban that passed in 1994 was a key part of H.R. 3355 , The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 .
Despite some people saying the bill was authored by Joe Biden , they 're wrong .
The author was Rep. Jack Brooks from Texas .
Biden was n't even a sponsor .
Right wing gun enthusiasts claim Democrats are the bad guys , trying to take away their guns , but an examination of the voting record shows nothing of the sort .
In the House of Representatives , the vote was not even close .
A " verbal vote " was cast so there is not even a record in the House of who voted for / against .
There was not enough opposition to even require more detailed voting processes .
In the Senate , the story is much the same , but the senators ' votes are on record , and we can see in no-uncertain terms that the Republicans supported the assault weapons ban just as much as the democrats .
Here 's how the actual vote went down :
Number of Democrats voting for the AWB : 50/53 ( 94.3 % )
Number of Republicans voting for the AWB : 45/47 ( 95.7 % )
Yes , among Republicans in the Senate , a higher percentage supported the AWB than Democrats !
Republicans :
Richard Shelby ( AL ) , Frank Murkowski , Ted Stevens ( AK ) , JOHN MCCAIN ( AZ ) , Christopher Bond ( MO ) , Conrad Burns ( MT ) , Judd Gregg , Bob Smith ( NH ) , Pete Domenici ( NM ) , Alfonse D'Amato ( NY ) , Duncan Faircloth , Jesse Helms ( NC ) , Don Nickles ( OK ) , Robert Packwood ( OR ) , Arlen Specter ( PA ) , John Chafee ( RI ) , J.

David Durenberger ( MN ) , Mark Hatfield ( OR )
Democrats voting against :
Paul Simon ( IL ) , Russell Feingold ( WI )
Not voting : Byron Dorgan - Democrat ( ND )
Is n't calling that " The Clinton Ban " disingenuous ?
This comes at the same time another bill is making the rounds in Congress :
H.R. 6257 [ 110th ] : Assault Weapons Ban Reauthorization
Act of 2008 which coincedentally is authored by three Republicans and NO Democrats
EDIT ....
This just in :
Dear Attorney General Holder :
As strong supporters of the Second Amendment , we were very concern to see your recent remakrs suggesting that the administration will push for the reinstatement of the 1994 ban on " assault weapons " and ammunition magazines .
We believe that this ban was ineffective during the 10 years it was law , and would oppose its reenactment .
Crime began falling before the ban was passed in 1994 , and continued falling during and after the ban .
The last time the murder rate was at its current level was more than forty years ago .
Even the Urban Institute study of the ban 's effectiveness mandated by the 103rd Congress found that it could only have a limited effect because " the banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders . "
It is hard to believe the ban would be any more effective in controlling crime by well - funded international drug traffickers , who regularly use grenade launchers , anti-tank rockets and other weapons that are not available on the civilian market in the United States .
The gun control community has intentionally misled many Americans into believing that these weapons are fully automatic machine guns .
They are not .
These firearms fire one shot for every pull of the trigger .
Some of the guns that would be banned under proposed bills have been around for more than 70 years , and are often passed down from generation to generation .
Many of our constituents lawfully own and use these firearms and ammunition magazines that would be affected by a new ban .
Indeed , these are commonly owned firearms throughout the country .
Law - abiding
Americans use these guns for all the same reasons they use any other kind of gun - competitive shooting , hunting , and defending their homes and families .
Our constituents also have very real and serious problems that we in Congress urgently need to address .
People are worried about keeping their jobs , paying for their families ' health care , educating their children , and retiring with the kind of security their parents and grandparents enjoyed .
A long and divisive fight over a gun control issue will only distract us from giving these more important issues the attention they deserve .
Again , we would actively oppose any effort to reinstate the 1994 ban , or to pass any similar law .
We urge you to abandon this initiative and to focus instead on effective law enforcement strategies to enforce our current laws against violent criminals and drug traffickers .
Sincerely ,

I 'm pretty sure I 'm the reddit user that this is targeted at .
So I 'll expose the partisan dishonesty of this here too .
First the author claims the Republicans are pushing it .
A whole six Republicans cosponsored a bill last year , but in 2007 66 Democrats cosigned a much more infringing bill .
The Democrats also have a new Assault Weapons Ban as of their published agenda .
Why is the author being so blatantly misleading ?
When I say that Biden wrote the Assault Weapons Ban , I 'm just quoting his words .
His statement starts around 1:30 in the video here .

Illusions Dispelled
Posted by MLappy on 2009-01-28 12:22:11 1 . Biden did n't write the AWB .
He has no credits on the bill .
2 . We can talk all day about bills that never passed .
That is a bullshit argument .
You know as well as I , what counts is what get 's passed .
The point of this article is to point out BOTH PARTIES are no friend to the gun enthusiast crowd who is against controls .
You keep trying to suggest the Democrats are worse , or ignoring the Republican complicity .
This story debunks that illusion .
And once again , gun - totin ' wingnuts are screaming about how bad it is that Obama has gotten in office ...
AS IF the President can unilaterally implement gun control .
Either you people are stupid , or you 're just trying to mislead people .
And you continually ignore the rampant support all these bans and controls have had among Republicans .
That 's the fact of the matter .
I 'm not saying there are n't Democrats too that are involved , if not spearheading these efforts in some places .
I 'm merely saying , there 's no substantive evidence to indicate that the GOP cares any more about gun rights than the Democrats , and the facts back that up .
If the gun lobby wants to be more effective , they need to not alienate a majority in Congress and a majority of the American people by engaging in partisan mud-slinging , strawman arguments and misinformation .
So wrong
Posted by chunky_bacon on 2009-01-28 14:58:03
Biden authored the original AWB - he has no credits because it was taken over by others leaving committee .
Fact is the Democrats are anti-gun enough to have made it ** part of their party platform **.
There are certainly Republicans deserve a beating for their support of crap like the AWB ( just as there are a very few dems that deserve accolades for resisting such infringements ) but by and large it * is* a partisan issue .
Contrary to MLappy 's assertion , legislation that does n't pass is a great indication of where things stand .
There are many who will pile on to a bill once they are sure that it will go in a particular direction - it 's just political pragmatism , but the core supporters - the sponsors and drafters are the ones who ' count ' .
Posted by MLappy on 2009-01-28 22:14:25
Very weak argument .
Biden has no writing credit formally for the AWB .
The fact that you keep harping about something like this illustrates the shallow , partisan nature of your argument .
As I said before , the point is , both parties have worked for and against gun control .
To suggest one party is primarily behind these things is a lie .
Posted by Pile on 2009-02-02 13:15:20
I remain convinced the main reason why conservative gun enthusiasts make a big deal about democratic ( or virtually any regime change anywhere ) is in an effort to scare people into buying more guns .
The conservatives are the most gullible in terms of believing whatever is told to them ( i.e. Fox News ) without checking it out themselves .
Most of the people screaming " Obama / Biden gonna take away yer gunz ! ! " are people in the gun industry that know scaring the crap out of weak - minded wingnuts is good for business .
The original assault weapons ban is a good example .
It did n't really curtail the sale of assault weapons .
All it did was raise their prices for several years .
There were more loopholes in that legislation than a prenup written by Anna Nicole Smith 's lawyers .

Pile , you 're right .
I bet you all the folks who sell firearms could n't wait to see Obama elected , giving them the opportunity to stoke the fears of folks who think Obama / Biden will take away their guns , and , voila , you have record gun sales !
I 'm a gun owner , and I cherish my gun rights .
I 'm not worried about Obama / Biden taking away any of my fourteen guns .
Oh Really
Posted by Nobama on 2009-02-18 08:51:55
So if the democrats are so pro-gun , why exactly did Obama have reinstating the CLINTON gun ban and making it permanent posted on change.gov ?
Remember where this toolbag comes from , IL , one of the worst states in the union when it comes to gun rights .
More dem gun laws
Posted by Peobody on 2009-02-23 16:32:52
You people are in denial thinking it's the Repbulicans not the Dems who are hard pushing very restrictive gun laws .
Take a look at HR 45 Posted by Pile on 2009-02-23 19:55:33
The point is , you partisan idiots , is that both parties are both for and against gun control .
Yet most gun enthusiasts naively think it 's the democrats who are the main problem .
This is a non-partisan issue .
Geeeeez

Just watch how the democrats vote now .

Microsoft is adopting technology from EMC's RSA security division for Windows to police data and prevent loss and theft of information .
The companies announced Thursday Microsoft will license RSA 's data loss prevention ( DLP ) engine for future versions of Exchange Server , SharePoint Server , and " similar " products .
Microsoft would not be drawn on whether the DLP engine will be built into Office or the forthcoming Windows 7 .
Office would be logical move given it features the Outlook client used by Exchange and is where potentially sensitive documents can be created in Word , Excel , and PowerPoint .
Neither would Microsoft be drawn on when DLP engine will work with its client - side identity management system CardSpace or the Geneva authentication and authorization system , released to its first beta last month .
What Microsoft was willing to say was RSA 's DLP Suite 6.5 will be " integrated tightly " with its Active Directory rights management services ( RMS ) in Windows Server 2008 later this month .
RSA 's suite finds data and lets you monitor and control its use across networks and on devices .
The companies said they are working together so customers do n't need to buy different rights management point products for use with " infrastructure " software , such as Windows .
Also , they want to make it easier for organizations to implement security according to domain instead of device - i.e. establish a security policy for use in healthcare or financial services instead of simply setting access rights according to the importance of a given database .
In licensing RSA 's core engine , it seems Microsoft will rely on RSA 's expertise in finding information and putting it in it 's context .
The classification engine will identify information in file systems , databases , data centers , and devices and pass it on to Active Directory RMS .
Active Directory will then trigger enforcement - such as not allowing a person lacking access rights the ability to open or print a protected document . ®
People of the Screen
Christine Rosen
What is lost in the switch from paper to pixel ?
The book is modernity ’s quintessential technology — “ a means of transportation through the space of experience , at the speed of a turning page , ” as the poet Joseph Brodsky put it .
But now that the rustle of the book ’s turning page competes with the flicker of the screen ’s twitching pixel , we must consider the possibility that the book may not be around much longer .
If it is n’t — if we choose to replace the book — what will become of reading and the print culture it fostered ?
And what does it tell us about ourselves that we may soon retire this most remarkable , five - hundred - year - old technology ?
We have already taken the first steps on our journey to a new form of literacy — “ digital literacy . ”
The fact that we must now distinguish among different types of literacy hints at how far we have moved away from traditional notions of reading .
The screen mediates everything from our most private communications to our enjoyment of writing , drama , and games .
It is the busiest port of entry for popular culture and requires navigation skills different from those that helped us master print literacy .
Enthusiasts and self - appointed experts assure us that this new digital literacy represents an advance for mankind ; the book is evolving , progressing , improving , they argue , and every improvement demands an uneasy period of adjustment .
Sophisticated forms of collaborative “ information foraging ” will replace solitary deep reading ; the connected screen will replace the disconnected book .
Perhaps , eons from now , our love affair with the printed word will be remembered as but a brief episode in our cultural maturation , and the book as a once - beloved technology we ’ve outgrown .
But if enthusiasm for the new digital literacy runs high , it also runs to feverish extremes .
Digital literacy ’s boosters are not unlike the people who were swept up in the multiculturalism fad of the 1980s and 1990s .
Intent on encouraging a diversity of viewpoints , they initially argued for supplementing the canon so that it acknowledged the intellectual contributions of women and minorities .
But like multiculturalism , which soon changed its focus from broadening the canon to eviscerating it by purging the contributions of “ dead white males , ” digital literacy ’s advocates increasingly speak of replacing , rather than supplementing , print literacy .
What is “ reading ” anyway , they ask , in a multimedia world like ours ?
We are increasingly distractible , impatient , and convenience - obsessed — and the paper book just ca n’t keep up .
Should n’t we simply acknowledge that we are becoming people of the screen , not people of the book ?
To Read or Not to Read
Every technology is both an expression of a culture and a potential transformer of it .
In bestowing the power of uniformity , preservation , and replication , the printing press inaugurated an era of scholarly revision of existing knowledge .
From scroll , to codex , to movable type , to digitization , reading has evolved and the culture has changed with it .
In A History of Reading , Alberto Manguel reminds us that the silent reading we take for granted did n’t become the norm in the West until the tenth century .
Far from the quiet contemplation we imagine , monasteries were actually “ communities of mumblers , ” as critic Ivan Illich once described , where devotional reading was constant and aloud .
Just as our styles of reading have changed , so too have our reasons for reading and the amount of time we devote to it .
“ Read in order to live , ” Flaubert wrote .
Critic Harold Bloom views reading from the other end of the human lifespan .
“ One of the uses of reading is to prepare ourselves for change , ” he argues in How to Read and Why , “ and the final change alas is universal . ”
But however much we read and for whatever reasons , literacy has long been prized as a marker of civilization and a measure of a society ’s success .
Literacy is now nearly universal in the United States and the rest of the developed world — a remarkable historical achievement , and yet one that has sparked more complacency than comment .
That may be changing .
In 2007 , the National Endowment for the Arts ( NEA ) published a report , To Read or Not To Read : A Question of National Consequence , which provided ample evidence of the decline of reading for pleasure , particularly among the young .
To wit : Nearly half of Americans ages 18 to 24 read no books for pleasure ; Americans ages 15 to 24 spend only between 7 and 10 minutes per day reading voluntarily ; and two thirds of college freshmen read for pleasure for less than an hour per week or not at all .
As Sunil Iyengar , director of the NEA ’s Office of Research and Analysis and the lead author of the report , told me , “ We can no longer take the presence of books in the home for granted .
Reading on one ’s own — not in a required sense , but doing it because you want to read — that skill has to be cultivated at an early age . ”
The NEA report also found that regular reading is strongly correlated with civic engagement , patronage of the arts , and charity work .
People who read regularly for pleasure are more likely to be employed , and more likely to vote , exercise , visit museums , and volunteer in their communities ; in short , they are more engaged citizens .
Not everyone endorses this claim for reading ’s value .
Bloom , for instance , is not persuaded by claims that reading encourages civic engagement .
“ You can not directly improve anyone else ’s life by reading better or more deeply , ” he argues .
“ I remain skeptical of the traditional social hope that care for others may be stimulated by the growth of individual imagination , and I am wary of any arguments whatsoever that connect the pleasures of solitary reading to the public good . ”
Whether one agrees with the NEA or with Bloom , no one can deny that our new communications technologies have irrevocably altered the reading culture .
In 2005 , Northwestern University sociologists Wendy Griswold , Terry McDonnell , and Nathan Wright identified the emergence of a new “ reading class , ” one “ restricted in size but disproportionate in influence . ”
Their research , conducted largely in the 1990s , found that the heaviest readers were also the heaviest users of the Internet , a result that many enthusiasts of digital literacy took as evidence that print literacy and screen literacy might be complementary capacities instead of just competitors for precious time .
But the Northwestern sociologists also predicted , “ as Internet use moves into less - advantaged segments of the population , the picture may change .
For these groups , it may be that leisure time is more limited , the reading habit is less firmly established , and the competition between going online and reading is more intense . ”
This prediction is now coming to pass : A University of Michigan study published in the Harvard Educational Review in 2008 reported that the Web is now the primary source of reading material for low - income high school students in Detroit .
And yet , the study notes , “ only reading novels on a regular basis outside of school is shown to have a positive relationship to academic achievement . ”
Despite the attention once paid to the so - called digital divide , the real gap is n’t between households with computers and households without them ; it is the one developing between , on the one hand , households where parents teach their children the old - fashioned skill of reading and instill in them a love of books , and , on the other hand , households where parents do n’t .
As Griswold and her colleagues suggested , it remains an open question whether the new “ reading class ” will “ have both power and prestige associated with an increasingly rare form of cultural capital , ” or whether the pursuit of reading will become merely “ an increasingly arcane hobby . ”
There is another aspect of reading not captured in these studies , but just as crucial to our long - term cultural health .
For centuries , print literacy has been one of the building blocks in the formation of the modern sense of self .
By contrast , screen reading , a historically recent arrival , encourages a different kind of self - conception , one based on interaction and dependent on the feedback of others .
It rewards participation and performance , not contemplation .
It is , to borrow a characterization from sociologist David Riesman , a kind of literacy more comfortable for the “ outer - directed ” personality who takes his cues from others and constantly reinvents himself than for the “ inner - directed ” personality whose values are less flexible but also less susceptible to outside pressures .
How does a culture of digitally literate , outer - directed personalities “ read ” ?
Promiscuous , Diverse , and Volatile
The NEA ’s study was not without its critics , many of whom focused on the report ’s definition of reading as limited to print content .
Steven Johnson , author of Everything Bad Is Good For You : How Today ’s Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter ( 2005 ) , was miffed that the report did n’t include screen reading in its analysis .
“ I challenge the NEA to track the economic status of obsessive novel readers and obsessive computer programmers over the next ten years , ” he wrote in the London Guardian .
“ Which group will have more professional success in this climate ? ” he asked .
This question is obtuse and misguided , although not surprising coming from a reflexive techno- utopian like Johnson .
Most of the people immersed in screen worlds are not programmers .
They are consumers who are reading on the screen , but also buying , blogging , surfing , and playing games .
How can we differentiate among these many activities , not all of which might contribute to the success Johnson prizes ?
Johnson would have done better to compare obsessive novel writers and obsessive computer programmers ( I would guess that Danielle Steele ’s paychecks measure up to those earned by the programmers of Grand Theft Auto ) .
More importantly , although computer programmers undoubtedly enjoy great success “ in this climate , ” as Johnson notes , he entirely misses the point : that “ this climate ” itself is what the NEA report is challenging .
Johnson ’s dismissive response is akin to praising people who react to global warming by becoming nudists .
Besides , the NEA was well aware of the difficulties involved in measuring screen and print reading .
As Iyengar told me , “ In terms of working definitions of reading — reading on computers or online — these pose challenges to survey methodologists . ”
But he recognizes the need for such data .
“ For the future , we need better ways to get at the question of reading on the screen versus not .
We have a massive amount of data on reading in the traditional sense .
I think the jury is out on whether or not those same benefits transfer to screen reading . ”
But the jury is nearing a verdict .
While the testimonials of digital literacy enthusiasts are replete with abstract paeans to the possibilities presented by screen reading , the experience of those who do it for a living paints a very different picture .
Just as Griswold and her colleagues suggested the impending rise of a “ reading class , ” British neuroscientist Susan Greenfield argues that the time we spend in front of the computer and television is creating a two - class society : people of the screen and people of the book .
The former , according to new neurological research , are exposing themselves to excessive amounts of dopamine , the natural chemical neurotransmitter produced by the brain .
This in turn can lead to the suppression of activity in the prefrontal cortex , which controls functions such as measuring risk and considering the consequences of one ’s actions .
Writing in The New Republic in 2005 , Johns Hopkins University historian David A . Bell described the often arduous process of reading a scholarly book in digital rather than print format : “ I scroll back and forth , search for keywords , and interrupt myself even more often than usual to refill my coffee cup , check my e-mail , check the news , rearrange files in my desk drawer .
Eventually I get through the book , and am glad to have done so .
But a week later I find it remarkably hard to remember what I have read . ”
As he tried to train himself to screen - read — and mastering such reading does require new skills —
Bell made an important observation , one often overlooked in the debate over digital texts : the computer screen was not intended to replace the book .
Screen reading allows you to read in a “ strategic , targeted manner , ” searching for particular pieces of information , he notes .
And although this style of reading is admittedly empowering , Bell cautions , “ You are the master , not some dead author .
And that is precisely where the greatest dangers lie , because when reading , you should not be the master ” ; you should be the student .
“ Surrendering to the organizing logic of a book is , after all , the way one learns , ” he observes .
How strategic and targeted are we when we read on the screen ?
In a commissioned report published by the British Library in January 2008 ( the cover of which features a rather alarming picture of a young boy with a maniacal expression staring at a screen image of Darth Vader ) , researchers found that everyone , teachers and students alike , “ exhibits a bouncing / flicking behavior , which sees them searching horizontally rather than vertically .... Users are promiscuous , diverse , and volatile . ”
As for the kind of reading the study participants were doing online , it was qualitatively different from traditional literacy .
“ It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense , indeed there are signs that new forms of ‛reading ’ are emerging as users ‛ power browse ’ horizontally through titles , contents pages , and abstracts going for quick wins . ”
As the report ’s authors concluded , with a baffling ingenuousness , “ It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense . ”
That is precisely what Jakob Nielsen , a former software engineer and a widely respected expert on Web page usability , found in his research on screen reading .
Rather than reading deliberately , when we scan the screen in search of content our eyes follow an F - shaped pattern , quickly darting across text in search of the central nugget of information we seek .
“ ‛ Reading ’ is not even the right word ” to describe this activity , Nielsen pointedly says .
Evidently not .
In a spate of recent stories about changes in literacy , writers have taken to using scare quotes to signal the now - liminal status of the printed word .
Last year , when the New York Times interviewed the chief executive of Scholastic Publishing , he was remarkably unworried about the effects of screen time on traditional reading skills .
“ We ’ll see more about the impact of technology and the interaction between graphics and words , ” he said , but since reading is “ visualizing in your mind , there could easily be a rebirth of intellectual activity , whether you call it ‛reading ’ or not . ”
“ I think we have to ask ourselves , ‛ What exactly is reading ? ’ ” said Jack Martin , assistant director for young adult programs at the New York Public Library , in another Times story .
“ Reading is no longer just in the traditional sense of reading words in English or another language on paper . ”
As the Times went on to report , rather uncritically , “ Spurred by arguments that video games also may teach a kind of digital literacy that is becoming as important as proficiency in print , libraries are hosting gaming tournaments , while schools are exploring how to incorporate video games into the classroom . ”
The MacArthur Foundation is pouring money into an effort to use video games to promote learning in public schools in New York .
“ I would n’t be surprised if , in ten or twenty years , video games are creating fictional universes which are every bit as complex as the world of fiction of Dickens or Dostoevsky , ” said Jay Parini , a writer who teaches English at Middlebury College .
Little Dorrit , meet Dora the Explorer !
The new caveats about “ reading ” are part of a broader argument that advocates of digital literacy promote : digital literacy , unlike traditional print literacy , they argue , is not “ passive . ”
The screen invites the player of a video game to put himself at the center of the action , and so it must follow that “ games are teaching critical thinking skills and a sense of yourself as an agent having to make choices and live with those choices , ” says James Paul Gee , one of the chief cheerleaders of video games as learning tools .
As Gee told the Times , “ You ca n’t screw up a Dostoevsky book , but you can screw up a game . ”
Parini’s and Gee ’s statements suffer from a profound misunderstanding of the reading experience and evince an astonishing level of hubris .
The reason you ca n’t “ screw up ” a Dostoevsky novel is that you must first submit yourself to the process of reading it — which means accepting , at some level , the author ’s authority to tell you the story .
You enter the author ’s world on his terms , and in so doing get away from yourself .
Yes , you are powerless to change the narrative or the characters , but you become more open to the experiences of others and , importantly , open to the notion that you are not always in control .
In the process , you might even become more attuned to the complexities of family life , the vicissitudes of social institutions , and the lasting truths of human nature .
The screen , by contrast , tends in the opposite direction .
Instead of a reader , you become a user ; instead of submitting to an author , you become the master .
The screen promotes invulnerability .
Whatever setbacks occur ( as in a video game ) are temporary , fixable , and ultimately overcome .
We expect to master the game and move on to the next challenge .
This is a lesson in trial and error , and often an entertaining one at that , but it is not a lesson in richer human understanding .
My Own Digital Dickens
In a.d. 1000 , the Grand Vizier of Persia , an avid reader , faced a peculiar logistical challenge when he traveled .
Unwilling to leave behind his precious collection of 117,000 books , as historian Alberto Manguel tells us , he hit upon a unique strategy for transporting them : four hundred camels trained to walk in an alphabetically - ordered caravan behind him on his journey .
What the Grand Vizier needed was a Kindle .
Since its much - hyped launch in 2007 , Amazon ’s portable electronic reader ( if it is the “ reader , ” what does that make you ? ) has received outsized media attention .
In a characteristically enthusiastic article about the device in Newsweek , Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was quoted as saying , “ This is the most important thing we ’ve ever done ....
It ’s so ambitious to take something as highly evolved as the book and improve on it .
And maybe even change the way people read . ”
The market for e-books , although growing rapidly , is still less than 1 percent of the total publishing business : perhaps 400 million paper books will be sold in the United States in 2008 , and Amazon expects to sell 380,000 Kindles in 2008 , resulting in an unknown number of book downloads .
Much has been written about the Kindle ’s various features : wireless service that allows for rapid delivery of e-texts ; the ability to search the Web ; a service called “ NowNow ” that performs real - time searches ( using human beings ! ) to answer questions ; a dedicated “ Search Wikipedia ” function .
These features are remarkable — and remarkably distracting .
The screensaver on the Kindle I used featured literary personages of British descent : Oscar Wilde tricked out in fur - trimmed velvet , for example , and the ghostly visage of Virginia Woolf .
Another more self - serving screensaver popped up later with a definition of “ kindle ” and the cloying explanatory sentence —
By reading to me at bedtime when I was a child , my parents kindled my lifelong love for reading — in a weird evocation of childhood nostalgia for the very printed page the e-book ’s pushers mean to supplant .
( Kindle users have already figured out how to hack the Kindle screensaver function to use images other than the default ones , of course . )
A friend of mine who was an early Kindle user noted how much he enjoys the fact that the Kindle delivers the day ’s newspapers to his device overnight , so he can read them first thing in the morning .
He uses his Kindle for work travel a lot as well , and as one of those people who always ambitiously packed too many books for long plane flights , now enjoys the convenience of being able to bring dozens of books stored on one device .
The Kindle also appeals to people who deal with a lot of paper in their jobs ; publishers such as Random House are now distributing e-readers to editors to read manuscripts .
When Amazon sent me a Kindle to try , I had been reading a worn copy of Dickens ’s Nicholas Nickleby — a Penguin classic edition from the 1970s , with its distinctive orange paperback spine ( and a list price of $ 3.95 ) .
Dickens seemed a good choice to read on the Kindle — after all , he was one of the great serial novelists , and the Kindle seems to lend itself to serial reading .
Dickens ’s adoption of monthly serialization — approximately thirty - two pages per month , sold in cheap editions for a shilling apiece ( at a time when most Victorian novels were several volumes long and a great deal more expensive ) represented a gutsy experiment in marketing and mass publishing — not unlike the Kindle .
And his novels are all still in print .
The Kindle and other similar devices , such as Sony ’s e-Reader , train users to read on screens intended to replicate the readability of paper and minimize eye strain ; unlike bright computer monitors , the screens on these e-books are dull gray with black lettering , using a sophisticated “ E Ink ” display developed by M.I.T. ’s Media Lab .
Although mildly disorienting at first , I quickly adjusted to the Kindle ’s screen and mastered the scroll and page - turn buttons .
Nevertheless , my eyes were restless and jumped around as they do when I try to read for a sustained time on the computer .
Distractions abounded .
I looked up Dickens on Wikipedia , then jumped straight down the Internet rabbit hole following a link about a Dickens short story , “ Mugby Junction . ”
Twenty minutes later I still had n’t returned to my reading of Nickleby on the Kindle .
I found that despite the ability to change the font size and scroll up and down the screen , reading was much slower on the Kindle than in book form .
I ’d want it on a long trip , but not for everyday use .
There are practical concerns as well : Despite Kindle ’s emphasis on accessibility — get any book , anywhere , instantly — this is true only if you can afford to own the device that allows you to read it .
You ca n’t share the books you ’ve read on your Kindle unless you hand the device over to a friend to borrow .
There are other drawbacks to the Kindle , more emotional than practical .
Unlike a regular book , where the weight of the book transfers from your right hand to your left as you progress , with the Kindle you have no sense of where you are in the book by its feel .
It does n’t smell like a book .
Nor does the clean , digital Kindle bear the impressions of previous readers , the smudges and folds and scribbles and forgotten treasures tucked amid the pages — markings of the man -made artifact .
The printed book is the “ transformation of the intangible into the tangibility of things , ” as Hannah Arendt put it ; it is imagined and lived action and speech turned into palpable remembrance .
Such feelings of partiality to the printed book are impossible to quantify , and might well strike the critic as foolish attachment to an outmoded medium , as rank sentimental preference for the durable over the delible and digital .
To be sure , “ I just like the feel of it ” is hardly firm intellectual footing from which to launch a defense of the paper book .
But it is at least worth noting that these tactile experiences have no counterpart when reading on the screen , and worth recalling that for all our enthusiasm about the aesthetics of our technologies — our sleek iPhones and iPods — we are quick to discount the same kind of appreciation for printed words on paper .
Kids and Kindles
It is also worth questioning what role the Kindle will play in the lives of younger readers .
If there is such a thing as a culture of reading , it begins in the home .
Regardless of their parents ’ educational background or income level , children raised in homes with books become more proficient readers .
Does this apply to the Kindle ?
Sven Birkerts , author of The Gutenberg Elegies ( 1994 ) , describes how our screen technologies exert a “ conditioning impact ” on all of us who use them ; that is , “ they make it harder , once we do turn from the screen , to engage the single - focus requirement of reading . ”
This seems a particular danger for children .
We already know that electronic books marketed for children , far from being helpful in teaching literacy , can hamper it .
Researchers at Temple University ’s Infant Laboratory and the Erikson Institute in Chicago who studied electronic books aimed at children described a “ slightly coercive parent - child interaction as opposed to talking about the story , ” and concluded , “ We should n’t use e-books to replace traditional books . ”
Anyone who has read a book to a toddler knows that one experience with an e-reader would yield more interest in the buttons and the scroll wheel than the story itself .
Meanwhile , older children and teens who are coming of age surrounded by cell phones , video games , iPods , instant messaging , text messaging , and Facebook have finely honed digital literacy skills , but often lack the ability to concentrate that is the first requirement of traditional literacy .
This poses challenges not just to the act of reading but also to the cultural institutions that support it , particularly libraries .
The New York Times recently carried a story about the disruptive behavior of younger patrons in the British Library Reading Room .
Older researchers — and by old they meant over thirty — lamented the boisterous atmosphere in the library and found the constant giggling , texting , and iPod use distracting .
A library spokesman was not sympathetic to the neo- geezers ’ concerns , saying , “ The library has changed and evolved , and people use it in different ways .
They have a different way of doing their research .
They are using their computers and checking things on the Web , not just taking notes on notepads . ”
In today ’s landscape of digital literacy , the old print battles — like the American Library Association ’s “ Banned Books Week , ” held each year since 1982 — seem downright quaint , like the righteous crusade of a few fusty tenders of the Dewey Decimal system .
Students today are far more likely to protest a ban on wireless Internet access than book censorship .
Not every librarian is pleased with these changes .
Some chafe at their new titles of “ media and information specialist ” and “ librarian - technologist . ”
One librarian at a private school in McLean , Virginia , described in the Washington Post a general impatience among kids toward books , and an unwillingness to grapple with difficult texts .
“ How long is it ? ” has replaced “ Will I like it ? ” he says , when he tries to entice a student to read a book .
For an increasing number of librarians , their primary responsibility is teaching computer research skills to young people who need to extract information , like little miners .
But these kids are not like real miners , who dig deeply ; they are more like ’ 49ers panning for gold .
To be sure , a few will strike a vein , stumbling across a novel or a poem so engrossing that they seek more .
But most merely sift through the silty top layers , grab what is shiny and close at hand , and declare themselves rich .
The Kindle will only serve to worsen that concentration deficit , for when you use a Kindle , you are not merely a reader — you are also a consumer .
Indeed , everything about the device is intended to keep you in a posture of consumption .
As Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has admitted , the Kindle “ is n’t a device , it ’s a service . ”
In this sense it is a metaphor for the experience of reading in the twenty - first century .
Like so many things we idolize today , it is extraordinarily convenient , technologically sophisticated , consumption - oriented , sterile , and distracting .
The Kindle also encourages a kind of utopianism about instant gratification , and a confusion of needs and wants .
Do we really need Dickens on demand ?
Part of the gratification for first readers of Dickens was rooted in the very anticipation they felt waiting for the next installment of his serialized novels — as illustrated by the story of Americans lining up at the docks in New York to learn the fate of Little Nell .
The wait served a purpose : in the interval between finishing one installment and getting the next , readers had time to think about the characters and ponder their motives and actions .
They had time to connect to the story .
We are so eager to explore what these new devices do — particularly what they do better than the printed book — that we ignore the more rudimentary but important human questions : the tactile pleasures of the printed page versus the screen ; the new risks of distraction posed by a device with a wireless Internet connection ; the difference between reading a book in two - page spreads and reading a story on one flashing screen - display after another .
Kindle and other e-readers are marvelous technologies of convenience , but they are no replacement for the book .
The Book Is Dead .
Long Live the Book !
A parallel debate about the meaning of texts and the future of reading is going on with regard to the efforts of Google ( and others ) to digitize the world ’s libraries ( a debate wherein , oddly , the word “ bibliophile ” is often hurled as an epithet but the word “ technophile ” is rarely uttered ) .
John Updike ’s cri de coeur at the 2006 BookExpo called on booksellers to “ defend your lonely forts ” against these and other challenges to the book , reminding his listeners , “ For some of us , books are intrinsic to our human identity . ”
Perhaps the most excitable dispatch from this front came from former Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly in a 2006 article in the New York Times Magazine .
This ode to gigajoy included the obligatory prediction that paper books would be replaced with handheld devices .
“ Just as the music audience now juggles and reorders songs into new albums , ” Kelly writes , the universal digital library that Google is bringing into the world “ will encourage the creation of virtual ‛bookshelves ’ — a collection of texts , some as short as a paragraph , others as long as entire books , that form a library shelf ’s worth of specialized information . ”
Kelly anticipates the day when authors will “ write books to be read as snippets or to be remixed as pages . ”
But what would a mash - up of George Eliot ’s Middlemarch and the latest best - selling mystery look like ?
There are some extraordinary lines in Eliot ’s novel .
Writing of Lydgate and Rosamond , for example , Eliot says , “ He once called her his basil plant ; and when she asked for an explanation , said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man ’s brains . ”
But devoid of the complicated context of the rest of the novel , how can we understand why this observation is poignant , apt , and true ?
Kelly ’s hope for the book is to turn it into a kind of digital Frankenstein monster , a contextless “ text ” that is no more than the sum of its scattered and remixed parts :
“ What counts are the ways in which these common copies of a creative work can be linked , manipulated , annotated , tagged , highlighted , bookmarked , translated , enlivened by other media and sewn together into the universal library , ” he writes .
And he is confident that “ in the clash between the conventions of the book and the protocols of the screen , the screen will prevail . ”
Perhaps it will , but Kelly might want to include in his own future e-book another snippet from Eliot ’s masterpiece , one which might serve as a warning for us all : “ We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our future selves , and see our own figures led with dull consent into insipid misdoing and shabby achievement . ”
If reading has a history , it might also have an end .
It is far too soon to tell when that end might come , and how the shift from print literacy to digital literacy will transform the “ reading brain ” and the culture that has so long supported it .
Echoes will linger , as they do today from the distant past : audio books are merely a more individualistic and technologically sophisticated version of the old practice of reading aloud .
But we are coming to see the book as a hindrance , a retrograde technology that does n’t suit the times .
Its inanimacy now renders it less compelling than the eye - catching screen .
It does n’t actively do anything for us .
In our eagerness to upgrade or replace the book , we try to make reading easier , more convenient , more entertaining — forgetting that reading is also supposed to encourage us to challenge ourselves and to search for deeper meaning .
In a 1988 essay in the Times Literary Supplement , the critic George Steiner wrote ,
I would not be surprised if that which lies ahead for classical modes of reading resembles the monasticism from which those modes sprung .
I sometimes dream of houses of reading — a Hebrew phrase — in which those passionate to learn how to read well would find the necessary guidance , silence , and complicity of disciplined companionship .
To those raised to crave the stimulation of the screen , Steiner ’s houses of reading probably sound like claustrophobic prisons .
For those raised in the tradition of print literacy , they may seem like serene enclaves , havens of learning and contentment , temples to the many and subtle pleasures of the word on the page .
In truth , though , what Steiner ’s vision most suggests is something sadder and much more mundane : depressing and dwindling gated communities , ramshackle and creaking with neglect , forgotten in the shadow of shining skyscrapers .
Such is the end of the tragedy we are now witness to : Literacy , the most empowering achievement of our civilization , is to be replaced by a vague and ill - defined screen savvy .
The paper book , the tool that built modernity , is to be phased out in favor of fractured , unfixed information .
All in the name of progress .
SHANGHAI 
The former chairwoman of one of China ’s biggest dairy producers pleaded guilty on Wednesday to selling tainted powdered baby formula and acknowledged for the first time that the company knew of the problem months before alerting local officials to what has become one of the country ’s biggest food - safety crises , according to the state - run news media .
The former executive , Tian Wenhua , is one of the highest ranking corporate executives to go on trial in China and could face life imprisonment or even the death sentence if convicted .
Since September , when the scandal became public , investigations have shown how widespread the problem of tainted milk is in China , with watered - down milk being doctored with a chemical used in plastics and fertilizer to falsely raise its protein count .
The chemical , melamine , can cause kidney stones and other ailments , and the tainted formula sickened nearly 300,000 children and killed 6 .
The government has accused Sanlu and other big Chinese companies of failing to monitor the quality of their powdered baby formula , and in some cases covering up knowledge that their products contained high levels of melamine .
The scandal , which follows others in China ’s food and drug industries , has devastated the country ’s dairy industry , prompted global recalls of suspect food products , and forced the Chinese authorities to try to demonstrate a new seriousness in enforcement .
Avoiding detection just got harder for drug cheats who try to use a particular range of untested , but potentially enhancing , compounds .
In the past , tests have been developed once a drug is known to be in circulation .
Now a German research team has developed tests for a class of drugs that they believe could be used in the near future .
On the face of it , the Beijing Olympics were remarkably drug free with only six athletes being caught during the games and three further suspect cases identified after the games closed .
Rumours suggest that many athletes were in fact using performance - enhancing drugs that could not be detected using standard tests .
One possibility is that some athletes were using compounds that have not yet been tested in humans , but have shown performance enhancing properties in animal trials .
Because these compounds are in the early stage of development no test has been developed , so their use will go undetected .
A new test will help sports officials stay one step ahead of the game by allowing them to screen for some of these emerging drugs , as well as others in the same class that have not yet reached the market .
The test detects a core chemical structure belonging to a class of compounds called benzothiazepines .
These compounds stabilise protein channels that would otherwise " leak " calcium from muscle cells during strenuous exercise .
Calcium is needed for muscle contraction and this " leaking " effect weakens the contractions and is a causal factor in muscle fatigue .
JTV -519 and S - 107 , benzothiazepines currently in development for the treatment of heart abnormalities , are known to increase endurance in mice .
Although they have not yet entered human clinical trials , both can be detected using the test .
" As soon as these drugs enter human clinical trials , there is a huge potential for them to be misused in sports .
This preventive research lets us prepare before these compounds are officially launched , " says Mario Thevis , Director of the Center for Preventive Doping Research at the German Sport University of Cologne , Germany , who led the research .
The researchers think the simple nature of the compounds means they are easy to make and sell to drug cheats as endurance boosters on the black market .
The study characterises the compounds according to their weight and molecular structure .
This gives the researchers a molecular " fingerprint " by which to identify the compounds .
Thevis and colleagues show that , using high resolution mass spectrometry , JTV - 519 and S - 107 can be detected in spiked urine at concentrations as low as 0.1 nanograms per millilitre .
" We used the common approaches that are employed for detecting anabolic agents .
Our work showed that we could identify the right compounds and that we have a sensitive test , " says Thevis .
The next step is to look for the molecules created by the metabolic breakdown of the compounds once they have entered the human body .
This will give researchers a wider scope of compounds by which to identify cheats when screening samples .
However , the compounds can't be given to humans until they have been approved for clinical trials , so the researchers must focus on bench studies using human microsomes .
These are tiny vesicles that mimic cell metabolism and so can be used to predict how the drugs might be broken down .

Mozilla has a lot of Makefiles , and although we ’re not completely happy with our current recursive - make build system , converting to something else is a very difficult task .
In order to consider other solutions , we have to have a seamless migration path from our existing infrastructure .
Unfortunately for any potential migration , Mozilla uses pretty much every make feature and quirk imaginable .
It is n’t sufficient to get by with some simplistic importer : any migration needs to understand the arcane details of makefile syntax and parsing rules .
So finally , after two years of considering whether it ’s feasible and a good idea , I bit the bullet and wrote a make replacement in python .
It was almost as mind - numbingly difficult as I thought it would be .
But after two solid weeks , I have a tool which will mostly build Mozilla , and seems to be doing it correctly .
Why would you do such a thing ?
Mark Pilgrim was right : only a crazy person says “ I ’m going to build my own build system ” .
So rather than creating a whole new build system with a new syntax , I wanted to start out replicating an existing build system exactly .
Then we can make incremental changes if appropriate .
What kind of incremental changes ?
First up are speed increases .
Our Windows builds are currently very slow , in part due to the large number of processes that are spawned .
There are several ways to attack this :
Each makefile command currently spawns an MSYS shell and then ( usually ) the actual binary .
The MSYS shell is expensive and in most cases unnecessary .
pymake should be able to skip the shell for simple command lines .
Mozilla runs `nsinstall` a lot .
Axel has already implemented nsinstall as a python module : our makefile rules should be able to run commands in python and skip the external process .
We can use recursive make without launching additional make processes by recursing within the same pymake process .
Where can I see this monstrosity ?
The pymake website .
You can also just pull or browser the pymake sources directly from hg.mozilla.org using Mercurial .
Why do n’t you just hack GNU make itself ?
There are some improvements we ’re interested in doing which just are n’t possible within a C codebase :
implementing rules directly in Python
Condensing multiple invocations of make into a single process
.
Python is also about a zillion times easier to hack quickly .
pymake is mostly GNU - make compatible .
What are the differences ?
The known differences are documented in the README file .
Does it perform well ?
Not yet .
pymake currently takes more time than GNU make .
Almost all of this time is spent reading and parsing makefiles .
Parsing autoconf.mk/config.mk/rules.mk from the Mozilla tree takes 0.3 seconds on my Linux machine , where GNU make takes 0.03 seconds .
Dependency resolution and execution is as fast or faster than GNU make .
I ’d love to have some help profiling and fixing the parsing .
Also , pymake does not yet support parallel execution .
Next week sometime , I promise to write about some of the difficulties I encountered writing pymake , and how test - driven development saved me from terrible pain and suffering .
In the immediate wake of Prop 8 's victory in California , much of the conversation in the blogosphere was dominated by anger – real and perceived – by some gay activists toward African Americans , acrimony grounded in eventually refuted claims that black voters provided the margin of victory .
While Prop 8 opponents were understandably frustrated , the way some lashed out at African Americans was counterproductive at best .
Although the Right is still trying hard to drive a wedge between blacks and gay rights activists , the broader conversation has mostly moved on .
This weekend 's historic grassroots protests against Prop 8 , organized via Join the Impact , have people thinking about the future again .
And that 's where our focus belongs .
Prop 8 's supporters have the past on their side , but we have the future .
My advice to the marriage ban supporters is to savor their victories now because they 're going to find out what it 's like to be on the wrong side of history .
Even in defeat we can see the signs of victories to come .
According to a CNN exit poll , 61 % of voters aged 18 - 29 opposed Prop 8 , while 61 % of 65 and older voters backed it .
That tells you where we 're headed , especially if you compare those results to 2000 , when according to an LA Times exit poll 18 - 29 year old voters supported the anti-gay Proposition 22 by a margin of 58 - 42 .
The final vote tallies tell a similar story .
Prop 22 passed in 2000 with 61 % of the 7.5 million votes cast , but Prop 8 passed with just 52 % of the 12 million votes cast .
Prop 8 was also defeated across a much broader area of the state than Prop 22 ( results by county for Prop 22 & Prop 8 ) .
As I see it , the biggest story about Prop 8 is the California electorate 's strong shift in favor of marriage equality in just a matter of years .
A majority of white voters backed Prop 22 but opposed Prop 8 .
We 'll be able to say the same thing about African Americans and Hispanics in the future if we commit ourselves now to doing the necessary outreach , education , and relationship - building activism – something our opponents have been doing for years .
The Religious Right is the real obstacle to equality .
They bankrolled Prop 8 and led an aggressive and misleading campaign that convinced many voters that voting ' yes ' on Prop 8 was a vote to protect their religious freedom and their children .
There are millions of voters , of all races and ethnicities , many of whom are religious , who might vote today to support a marriage ban , but only because they 've heard the lies spread by opponents of equality , and have n't had the opportunity to have a real conversation about the impact of discrimination on same - sex couples and their families .
We may have history and momentum on our side , but as we saw on November 4 , progress is not inevitable , especially when the Right is willing to do and say anything to prevent it .
It 's time to learn our lessons , revise our strategies , and commit ourselves to strategic , respectful outreach to those Americans who need to hear from us .

( CNN ) --
The California home where Nadya Suleman plans to raise her 14 children is at risk of foreclosure , CNN affiliate KTLA reported Wednesday .
Records show a notice of mortgage default was filed Feb. 9 against the home where the octuplets ' mother is living .
Los Angeles County property records show a notice of mortgage default was filed Feb.
9 against the home of Suleman 's mother , Angela Suleman , the station reported .
Angela Suleman is $ 23,225 behind in her mortgage payments and the three - bedroom house could be sold at an auction beginning May 5 , documents say .
Suleman has said that she was raising her six children in her mother 's home and planned to raise her newborn octuplets there .
News of the foreclosure is the latest twist in the tale of Suleman and her children .
Suleman , 33 , had the octuplets through fertility treatments , despite being single and already having six young children and no clear source of income .

The television station could not reach Suleman or her mother for comment , because the phone number at the home had been disconnected .
A spokeswoman for Suleman recently quit because she had been flooded with death threats from people angry that Suleman is receiving disability payments and food stamps to help raise her children .

That spokeswoman , Joann Killeen , told CNN's Larry King on Monday that grandmother Angela Suleman had taken care of Suleman 's six children at the home while Suleman was on bed rest for 10 weeks before giving birth to the octuplets .
" Grandma is tired , " Killeen said .
" Grandma and grandpa are in their 70s .
You know , they 've raised a daughter .
I 'm sure they did n't think that they were going to be helping to raise six children . "
All About Angela Suleman
It ’s been nearly two months since the beta of Windows 7 was officially released to the general public , and some of us have been getting fidgety to know just what bugs have been reported and what will be fixed .
Microsoft was biding its time , letting the information collect and nearly stagnate , when we finally got official word on some of the results of the testing process .
The reason it took so long , so says Steven Sinofsky , senior vice president for Windows and Windows Live Engineering Group at Microsoft , is from the sheer feedback , and apparently not just from the Send Feedback option on every Windows 7 program title bar .
What we can say for certain , is that we are listening to each and every comment , blog post , news story , MS Connect report , Send Feedback item , and of course all the data and telemetry .
So if you want to get a word in to Microsoft , do n’t shoot an email .
They wo n’t read it .
Instead write a blog post including the term “ Windows 7 , ” and you ’ll be set .
Sarcasm aside , if what this man says is even half - true ( can you really read every blog , comment , and news story about Windows 7 out there on the free web ? ) , then they ’re sifting quite the load of information .
As it is , the Send Feedback items alone were quite monumental .
According to Sinofsky , Microsoft received over 500,000 reports — over 500 reports for each developer on the team to read through and address .
During a “ peak week in January , ” they were receiving one report about every fifteen seconds .
Concerning device compatibility and driver issues , Microsoft recorded over ten million devices on systems running Windows 7 , 75 percent of which ran using drivers preinstalled with the system .
Almost all of the remaining 25 percent of drivers were able to download drivers from Windows Update or directly from manufacturers .
Sinofsky goes on to describe just what a “ bug , ” according to the developers , is .
It sounds rather broad , especially with that phrase , “ any one of dozens of different ways that the software can behave in a way that is n’t expected . ”
He probably could have said just that and left it and we would have been content , but you know how long - winded people can be when dealing with public relations :
For us a bug is any time the software does something that someone one was n’t expecting it to do .
A bug can be a cosmetic issue , a consistency issue , a crash , a hang , a failure to succeed , a confusing user experience , a compatibility issue , a missing feature , or any one of dozens of different ways that the software can behave in a way that is n’t expected .
A bug for us is not an emotional term , but just shorthand for an entry in our database representing feedback on the product .
Bugs can be reported by a human or by the various forms of telemetry built into Windows 7 .
This broad definition allows us to track and catalog everything experienced in the product and do so in a uniform manner .
To the man ’s credit , he has personally answered over 2,000 emails from beta testers since August , and that ’s actually quite a feat ; I ’ve personal experience in the matter of answering back hundreds of confused emails from angry parents and students since the exact same month , and it can wear on a body .
Speaking of “ bugs , ” he also said that Microsoft already has plans to fix a fair 2,000 of them in Windows 7 , and I ’m willing to bet that there ’ll be plenty more before this beta is finished in August .
Go , go , Windows .
As a side note , do n’t you think I ’m entitled to 1/250,000th of the profits made on 7 for my two Send Feedback items ?
Maybe if I play their games and sue Microsoft , I ’ll get recompense .
The machine was giving too much money for about six hours Crowds queued at a cash machine in Manchester which gave double the amount of cash requested .
Word spread quickly about the error at the machine at the BP garage on Barton Road in Stretford on Thursday .
The giveaway went on for about six hours before the fault was reported to Nationwide building society .
The firm said it was " disappointing " that no - one reported it earlier .
Those who took extra cash may now have to pay it back .
The machine gave £ 60 every time it was asked for £ 30 , but also gave away more cash in different multiples depending on the money requested .
It is disappointing some people were deliberately using the machine to take extra money
Nationwide Some customers reportedly used several cards to withdraw money .
The Nationwide said it appeared the employee of a firm they use to top up the machine had loaded the notes in the wrong way .
A spokeswoman for the Nationwide said : " There was a problem .
We are investigating what transactions took place .
" It is disappointing no one reported the matter earlier in the day when lots of people were aware and it is disappointing some people were deliberately using the machine to take extra money .
" Legally , recipients of payments made by mistakes are not entitled to benefit from it .
" We will reserve the right to contact people about the matter on an individual basis . "

While some people can’t become friendly with their colleagues and acquaintances no matter what they do , others make friends easily .
Quite often , favorites do n’t have beautiful or handsome looks .
Neither are they brilliant speakers or talented people .
Their secret lies in good genes .
Popularity and Genes
Gene experts supposed that the gift to attract attention and be in limelight is “ programmed ” ability like intellect and character .
It means that this phenomenon is rooted in our DNA .
Scientists got the insight when they were observing the behavior of apes , our closest evolutionary “ relatives ” .
Namely , Robert Wright , evolutionary psychologist from the University of Pennsylvania , found that the leaders of chimpanzee pack had higher levels of serotonin compared to other apes .
It occurred to the scientists that he could also establish the link between hierarchy status and hormones among humans .
According to his genetic studies conducted among students , college informal leaders had higher serotonin levels in the blood compared to non-leaders .
Becoming the Leader
However the link between serotonin and social status became clear , it does n’t suggest that our social position is genetically pre-determined .
For example , a politician who was elected president or an actor who woke up celebrity have normal serotonin levels before they got into spotlight .
Wright says that the nature does n’t train leaders .
According to the scientist , the nature gives an opportunity of becoming a leader and drives us to leadership providing support when we need it .
Leadership Hormones
Therefore , the hormone points to higher status and helps maintain it rather than pre-determines it .
In addition , serotonin is not the only leadership hormone .
There are other biochemical elements involved such as testosterone , adrenalin - noradrenalin ratio and oxitocine .
Popularity and Nonconformity
Scientists found another curious link .
Popularity is always accompanied by nonconformity .
For example , student leaders were more likely to reject established standards and break the rules .
Gene experts believe that provocative behavior is a kind of social signal saying about leadership potential and higher hormonal status .
This study clearly explains why movies with “ bad guys ” as main characters are so popular or why Britney Spears enjoys that much success .

Praise be to Allah .
Allaah has enjoined jihad for His sake upon the Muslims , for the great benefits that result from that and because of the harm caused by abandoning jihad , some of which are mentioned in Question no .
34830 .
Some of the reasons why jihad for the sake of Allaah is prescribed in Islam are as follows :
1 – The main goal of jihad is to make the people worship Allaah alone and to bring them forth from servitude to people to servitude to the Lord of people .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ And fight them until there is no more Fitnah ( disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allaah ) and ( all and every kind of ) worship is for Allaah ( Alone ) .
But if they cease , let there be no transgression except against Az - Zaalimoon ( the polytheists , and wrong - doers ) ”
[ al - Baqarah 2:193 ]
“ And fight them until there is no more Fitnah ( disbelief and polytheism , i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah ) , and the religion ( worship ) will all be for Allaah Alone [ in the whole of the world ] .
But if they cease ( worshipping others besides Allaah ) , then certainly , Allaah is All - Seer of what they do ”
[ al - Anfaal 8:39 ]
Ibn Jareer said :
So fight them until there is no more shirk , and none is worshipped except Allaah alone with no partner or associate , and trials and calamities , which are disbelief and polytheism , are lifted from the slaves of Allaah on earth , and religion is all for Allaah alone , and so that obedience and worship will be devoted to Him alone and none else .
Ibn Katheer said : Allaah commands us to fight the kuffaar so that there will be no fitnah , i.e. , shirk , and the religion will all be for Allaah alone , i.e. , the religion of Allaah will prevail over all other religions .
The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) said : “ " I have been commanded ( by Allaah ) to fight the people until they testify that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah , and they establish regular prayer and pay zakaah , then if they do that , then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning will be with Allaah . "
Narrated by al - Bukhaari ( 24 ) , Muslim ( 33 ) .
And he ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) said : “ I have been sent just before the Hour with the sword , so that Allaah will be worshipped alone with no partner or associate . ”
Narrated by Ahmad , 4869 ; classed as saheeh by al - Albaani in Saheeh al - Jaami ’ , 2831 .
This purpose of jihad was present in the minds of the Sahaabah ( may Allaah be pleased with them ) during their battles with the enemies of Allaah .
Al - Bukhaari ( 2925 ) narrated that Jubayr ibn Hayyah said : ‘ Umar sent people to all the regions to fight the mushrikeen … so ‘ Umar recruited us and appointed al - Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin to lead us .
When we were in the land of the enemy , the representative of Chosroes came out to us with forty thousand troops .
An interpreter stood up and said : “ Let one of you speak to me . ”
Al - Mugheerah said : “ Ask whatever you want . ”
He asked , “ Who are you ? ” He ( al - Mugheerah ) said : “ We are some people from among the Arabs .
We used to lead a harsh and miserable life , sucking on animal skins and date stones because of hunger , wearing clothes made of camel and goat hair , worshipping trees and rocks .
While we were in this state , the Lord of the heavens and the earth , exalted be His name and glorified be His greatness , sent to us a Prophet from amongst ourselves , whose father and mother we know .
Our Prophet , the Messenger of our Lord , ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) , commanded us to fight you until you worship Allaah alone or pay the jizyah .
Our Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) told us the message from our Lord , that whoever among us is killed will go to Paradise to enjoy delights such as no one has ever seen , and whoever among us is left will become your master . ”
This is the truth that the Sahaabah and leaders of the Muslims proclaimed in their military campaigns .
Rab ’i ibn ‘ Aamir said , when Rustam the commander of the Persian armies asked him , “ Why have you come ? ” : “ Allaah has sent us to bring forth whomsoever
He wills from the worship of man to the worship of Allaah .
When ‘ Uqbah ibn Naafi ’ reached Tangiers , he rode his horse into the water until the water was up to its chest , then he said : “ O Allaah , bear witness that I have done my utmost , and were it not for this sea I would have travelled throughout the land fighting those who disbelieve in You , until none is worshipped except You . ”
2 – Repelling the aggression of those who attack the Muslims .
The scholars are unanimously agreed that repelling the aggression of those who attack the Muslims is fard ‘ ayn ( an individual obligation ) upon those who are able to do that .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you , but transgress not the limits .
Truly , Allaah likes not the transgressors ”
[ al - Baqarah 2:190 ]
“ Will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths ( pagans of Makkah ) and intended to expel the Messenger while they did attack you first ?
Do you fear them ?
Allaah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers ”
[ al - Tawbah 9:13 ]
3 – Removing fitnah ( tribulation )
Fitnah is of different types :
( i) That which is caused by the kuffaar who persecute the Muslims or apply pressure to them to make them give up their religion .
Allaah has commanded the Muslims to fight in jihad in order to save those who are weak and oppressed .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah , and for those weak , ill - treated and oppressed among men , women , and children , whose cry is : “ Our Lord !
Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors ; and raise for us from
You one who will protect , and raise for us from You one who will help ”
[ al - Nisa ’ 4:75 ]
( ii ) The fitnah of the kuffaar themselves and their preventing others from hearing and accepting the truth .
That is because the kaafir systems corrupt the innate nature and reason of people , and make them get used to worshipping and submitting to things other than Allaah , getting addicted to alcohol , wallowing in the mire of sexual licence , and losing all characteristics of virtue .
Whoever is like that can rarely tell truth from falsehood , good from evil , right from wrong .
So jihad is prescribed in order to remove those obstacles that prevent people from hearing and accepting the truth and getting to know it .
4 – Protecting the Islamic state from the evil of the kuffaar .
Hence the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) ordered that the leaders of the kuffaar be killed , those who incited the enemies against the Muslims , such as the Jews Ka’b ibn al - Ashraf and Ibn Abi’l - Haqeeq .
Another aspect of jihad is to protect the borders against the kuffaar .
The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) encouraged that as he said : “ Guarding the border for one day for the sake of Allaah is better than this world and everything in it . ”
Al - Bukhaari , 2678 .
5 – Frightening the kuffaar , humiliating them and putting them to shame .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ Fight against them so that Allaah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people ,
And remove the anger of their ( believers ’ ) hearts .
Allaah accepts the repentance of whom He wills .
Allaah is All - Knowing , All - Wise ”
[ al - Tawbah 9:14 - 15 ]
“ And make ready against them all you can of power , including steeds of war ( tanks , planes , missiles , artillery ) to threaten the enemy of Allaah and your enemy ”
[ al - Anfaal 8:60 ]
Hence it is prescribed to fight in a manner that will strike terror into the heart of the enemy .
Shaykh al - Islam [ Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him ] was asked whether it is permissible for a soldier to wear silk or gold or silver when fighting or when the envoys of the enemy come to the Muslims .
He replied :
With regard to wearing silk in order to frighten the enemy , there are two scholarly views , the more correct of which is that it is allowed .
The soldiers of Syria wrote to ‘ Umar ibn al - Khattaab saying : “ When we met the enemy we saw that they had covered their weapons with silk and we found that this struck terror in our hearts . ”
‘ Umar wrote back to them saying : “ You should cover your weapons as they do . ”
And wearing silk is a kind of showing off , and Allaah likes showing off at the time of fighting , as it is narrated in al - Sunan that the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) said : “ There is a kind of showing off that Allaah likes , and a kind of showing off that Allaah hates .
The showing off that Allaah likes is when a man shows off at the time of war .
The kind of showing off that Allaah hates is showing off for the purpose of pride and boasting . ”
On the day of Uhud , Abu Dujaanah al - Ansaari showed off among the ranks , and the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) said : “ This is a kind of walking that Allaah hates except in this situation . ” Majmoo ’ al - Fataawa , 28/17
6 – Exposing the hypocrites
Allaah says ( Interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ But when a decisive Soorah ( explaining and ordering things ) is sent down , and fighting ( Jihaad — holy fighting in Allaah ’s Cause ) is mentioned ( i.e. ordained ) therein , you will see those in whose hearts is a disease ( of hypocrisy ) looking at you with a look of one fainting to death ”
[ Muhammad 47:20 ]
At times of ease and plenty , the Muslims may be joined by those who seek to make worldly gains , and they do not want to make the word of Allaah prevail over the word of kufr .
These people may conceal their real nature from many of the Muslims , and the most effective means of exposing them is jihad , because jihad means sacrificing oneself but these hypocrites are only indulging in hypocrisy in order to save themselves .
Exposing the hypocrites was one of the major purposes that Allaah wanted the believers to achieve on the day of Uhud .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ Allaah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now , until He distinguishes the wicked from the good ”
[ Aal ‘ Imraan 3:179 ]
Ibn al - Qayyim said :
This means : Allaah will not leave you in the state in which you are , where the believers are indistinguishable from the hypocrites , until the believers are made distinct from the hypocrites , as they were distinguished by the test on the day of Uhud , and Allaah will not disclose to you the unseen matters by which the one group is distinguished from the other , for they are distinguished from one another in the knowledge of the unseen that He has , but He wants to distinguish them from one another in a clear and visible manner , so that His unseen knowledge will become known and visible .
7 – Purifying the believers of their sins and ridding them thereof
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ And so are the days ( good and not so good ) , that We give to men by turns , that Allaah may test those who believe , and that He may take martyrs from among you .
And Allaah likes not the Zaalimoon ( polytheists and wrongdoers ) .
And that Allaah may test ( or purify ) the believers ( from sins ) and destroy the disbelievers .
Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allaah tests those of you who fought ( in His Cause ) and ( also ) tests those who are As - Saabiroon ( the patient ) ? ”
[ Aal ‘ Imraan 3:140-142 ]
8 – Acquiring booty
The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) said : “ I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword so that Allaah will be worshipped alone , and my provision has been placed in the shade of my spear , and humiliation has been decreed for those who go against my command , and whoever imitates a people is one of them . ”
Narrated by Ahmad , 4869 ; Saheeh al - Jaami ’ , 2831 .
Al - Haafiz said :
This hadeeth indicates that war booty is permissible for this ummah , and that the provision of the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) has been placed in war booty and not in other kinds of earnings .
Hence some of the scholars said that it is the best kind of earnings .
Al - Qurtubi said :
Allaah sent provision to His Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) by means of his striving and He made it by means of the best kind of striving which is earning it by means of force and strength .
The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) went out for the battle of Badr to meet the caravan of Abu Sufyaan .
Al - Qurtubi said :
The fact that the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) went out to meet the caravan indicates that it is permissible to take booty because it is a halaal source of income .
This refutes Maalik ’s view that this is makrooh , when he said that this was fighting for worldly gains .
Al - Shawkaani said : Ibn Abi Jamrah said :
The scholars of hadeeth are of the view that if the primary motive is to make the word of Allaah supreme , it does not matter what else is also achieved .
9 – Taking martyrs .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ If a wound ( and killing ) has touched you , be sure a similar wound ( and killing ) has touched the others .
And so are the days ( good and not so good ) , that We give to men by turns , that Allaah may test those who believe , and that He may take martyrs from among you .
And Allaah likes not the Zaalimoon ( polytheists and wrongdoers ) .
And that Allaah may test ( or purify ) the believers ( from sins ) and destroy the disbelievers ”
[ Aal ‘ Imraan 3:140-141 ]
Martyrdom is one of the highest statuses before Allaah , and the martyrs are the closest of His slaves to Him .
There is no status higher than that of siddeeq apart from martyrdom .
Allaah loves to take martyrs from among
His slaves , who shed their blood for His love and to earn
His pleasure , preferring His pleasure and His love above themselves .
There is no way to attain this status except by circumstances that may lead to it such as enemies coming against the Muslims .
This was said by Ibn al - Qayyim in Zaad al - Ma’aad .
This is the great wisdom and those who try to put the Muslims off jihad and make them fear it , and say that jihad is no more than death , and making women widows and children orphans , pale into insignificance .
10 – Ridding the world of corruption .
Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another , monasteries , churches , synagogues , and mosques , wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely , have been pulled down .
Verily , Allaah will help those who help His ( Cause ) .
Truly , Allaah is All - Strong , All - Mighty ”
[ al - Hajj 22:40 ]
“ And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another , the earth would indeed be full of mischief .
But Allaah is full of bounty to the ‘ Aalameen ( mankind , jinn and all that exists ) ”
[ al - Baqarah 2:251 ]
Muqaatil said :
Were it not that Allaah checked the mushriks by means of the Muslims , the mushriks would have overrun the earth and killed the Muslims and destroyed the mosques .
Shaykh al - Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al - Jawaab al - Saheeh , 2/216 :
So the kuffar are repelled by means of the Muslims and the worse of the two parties is repelled by the better , just as the Magians ( Persians ) were repelled by the Christian Byzantines , then the Christians were repelled by the believers of the ummah of Muhammad .
Al - Sa ’di said :
The world would be corrupted if the kuffaar and evildoers were to prevail .
These are some of the reasons why jihad is prescribed .
We ask Allaah to bring the Muslims back to their religion .
May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad .
INTELLECTUAL BANKRUPTCY ….
Why is it so painfully difficult to take the Republican Party seriously in the 21st century ?
Because they have n’t quite figured out that credibility comes with a degree of political maturity .
Take Sen. Richard Shelby ( R ) of Alabama , for example .
( via Ben Smith )
Another local resident [ in Cullman County , Alabama ] asked Shelby [ yesterday ] if there was any truth to a rumor that appeared during the presidential campaign concerning Obama ’s U.S. citizenship , or lack thereof .
“ Well his father was Kenyan and they said he was born in Hawaii , but I have n’t seen any birth certificate , ” Shelby said .
“ You have to be born in America to be president . ”
According to the Associated Press , state officials in Hawaii checked health department records during the campaign and determined there was no doubt Obama was born in Hawaii .
The nonpartisan Web site Factcheck.org examined the original document and said it does have a raised seal and the usual evidence of a genuine document .
In addition , Factcheck.org reproduced an announcement of Obama ’s birth , including his parents ’ address in Honolulu , that was published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13 , 1961 .
This kind of stupidity took a right turn at annoying quite a while ago , and now rests comfortably in the realm of madness .
When Alan Keyes launches into a ridiculous tirade about the president ’s birth certificate , it ’s not especially surprising — Keyes , based on all available evidence , is apparently not well .
Anyone looking for lucidity from the poor man is bound to be disappointed .
It ’s far more annoying to have elected Republican officials in Tennessee signing on as plaintiffs in a lawsuit “ aimed at forcing ” the President to “ prove he is a United States citizen . ”
But the Shelby example is a different magnitude of idiocy .
Shelby is n’t just some random yahoo with a right - wing radio talk - show ; he ’s a four - term United States senator .
He ’s the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee , for crying out loud .
It ’s incumbent on him to be somewhat coherent and conduct himself with at least a little sanity .
In the broader context , the Republican Party is still unsure how to get back on the road to electoral success after years of failure and defeat .
While the party mulls its options , we have a leading House Republican comparing the GOP to the Taliban ; a prominent Senate Republican wanting to position the party as “ freedom fighters ” taking on the “ slide toward socialism ” ; and a leading Senate Republican publicly questioning the President of the United States ’ birth certificate .
What an embarrassment .
It seems a little early in Obama ’s presidency to see Republicans become this deranged .
I shudder to think how unhinged they ’ll be in , say , a year .
Update : Shelby ’s office says the local news account is n’t a full reflection of the senator ’s comments , and that the senator “ does n’t have any doubt ” about Obama ’s citizenship and eligibility .
Second Update : While Shelby claims the local paper misconstrued his comments , the paper stands by its story .
There are rumors that a video might be available .
I ’ll keep you posted .
Having a bum knee sucks , so I decided to come up with a bulletproof plan to get your knees feeling healthy and working as well as humanly possible .
Wait !
Were you about to X out of this article already ?
Maybe go check and see if any new hotties have posted their photos elsewhere on the site ?
Well , do n't .
Why ?
Because you do n't want to go through this , do you ?
I did n't think so .
Yes , this article is about knee health .
No , that 's not as sexy as biceps and big bench presses , but maybe I can scare you into caring with the photo above .
You see , a year and a half ago , I had perfectly healthy knees , and I was coming off the best training cycle of my entire life .
Long story short : A ski trip led to an arthroscope and a knee that may never return to normal .
Fixing knees is my business .
I 've studied their architecture , how they function , the most cutting edge research , common injuries , and what the best and the brightest in the industry are doing to fix even the most stubborn knees .
I 'd love to say I 'm doing it all for you , but obviously there 's a little self - interest involved here as well !
If you 've ever had a knee injury , this is the article for you .
I 'm going to get you up - to - speed with some new concepts ( along with reviewing some old ones ) that are sure to get your knees as healthy as possible .
Never had a knee injury ?
Then this is an even better article for you .
If you follow the ideas here , you 'll be a lot less likely to have a knee injury in the first place .
18 Tips for Bulletproof Knees
1 – Purchase some knee sleeves .
I 'll make this first one easy on you .
Go out , buy some knee sleeves , and wear them every time you train your legs .
This could be quad - dominant day , hip - dominant day , " leg " day , or whatever you want to call it .
Just put them on before the workout , warm - up thoroughly , and bask in the joy that healthy knees bring to you .
2 – Do n't skimp on your warm -up !
This idea is beautiful in its simplicity , yet often ignored for various reasons such as " I 'm in a hurry " or " I do n't need to warm - up because I 'm 22 and therefore ten feet tall and impervious to harm . "
Well , I 'd love to see what that lack of warm - up is doing to your joints , pal !
Beyond improving your training performance for numerous reasons , warming up reduces the viscosity of synovial fluid ( the stuff that fills your joint space ) , providing better lubrication and healthier joints in general .
3 – Want healthy knees ?
Focus on ankle and hip mobility !
It may sound counterintuitive , but when we have knee issues , where do we focus most of our attention ?
The knees , right ?
You know what else ?
That 's a big part of the problem !
The fact of the matter is that knee issues are typically due to issues at other areas of the body , not the knees themselves .
Lack of hip mobility in all planes can not only lead to knee pain , but back pain as well .
Eric Cressey and I covered about a zillion hip mobility exercises in our Magnificent Mobility DVD , so I 'd highly suggest checking it out .
However , one area we did n't cover as in - depth was ankle mobility , and this area is often poorly addressed , or worse yet , not addressed at all !
After reviewing Mike Boyle 's Functional Strength Coach DVD series , I realized how poor sagittal plane ankle mobility is in many athletes .
Here are some drills to help out :
In the first exercise , all you 're going to do is set up next to a wall with your feet a few inches away from it ( you may even want to start with your toes touching the wall at first ) .
Rest your hands on the wall , place all your weight on your heels , and then stay tall and try to " shoot " your knees over your toes .
In this second exercise , you 're going to place a small board underneath your toes to put you into a dorsiflexed position .
I find it easiest to place this board in front of the wall so you can balance yourself with your hands .
While staying tall , you 're again going to try and " shoot " your knees over your toes .
Do n't worry if there is n't a ton of range of motion at first ; it 'll improve as you practice it .
4 – Get your glutes firing .
This is another area that not nearly enough of us are addressing , as most who have patello - femoral pain are only worried about isolating the vastus medialis obliquus ( VMO ) .
In research by Ireland et al. ( 1 ) , they found that athletes with patello - femoral pain had significantly decreased strength in both hip abduction and hip external rotation .
How much is significant ?
These subjects were 26 % weaker in hip abduction and 36 % weaker in hip external rotation !
Now that we know what movements to train , what muscles are most affected ?
Specifically , we 're talking about getting your gluteus maximus and posterior fibers of the gluteus medius firing .
So before we do low - body work , we should be getting some activation work in to make sure those muscles are stimulated and ready to go .
X - Band walks are perfect here .
You 'll see in the video that the set - up is a little funky , so hopefully seeing it will make it easier than me trying to explain it !
Big things to focus on here include turning the toes out slightly and bracing the core throughout .
This will prevent you from using the " Weeble - Wooble " substitution pattern that typically occurs in hip abduction movements .
Stay tight , tall , and use those glutes and you should be just fine .
In maintenance phases ( where I 'm focusing on max strength ) , I may only do one set before training .
In phases where motor control and recruitment are the priority ( for instance , in the early off - season or a transition phase ) , I may perform three or even four sets of these exercises before training .
5 – Forget about isolating the VMO !
A lot of athletes and lifters are interested in getting that VMO to fire , especially those with patello - femoral ( PF ) pain .
This anterior knee pain , in many cases , is due to soft - tissue imbalances between the stronger / tighter lateral knee structures and the weaker / inhibited medial knee structures ( the VMO ) .
This muscle imbalance leads to a lateral ( outside ) pulling of the patella into the femoral condyle , resulting in knee pain .
The obvious solution here would be to isolate and then strengthen the VMO , but it just does n't seem to be that easy .
In fact , there does n't appear to be any true VMO " isolation " exercises .
Sure , terminal knee extensions ( TKEs ) hit the VMO , but it 's not " isolated . "
In an article discussing muscular control of the patella , Malone et al. ( 2 ) flat out state , " The concept of VMO isolation through specific exercise should no longer be part of our lexicon . "
Instead , I feel a more comprehensive plan of attack is necessary .
For instance , a comprehensive patello - femoral pain program could include any ( or all ) of the following :
Foam rolling of the lateral structures ( primarily the vastus lateralis and iliotibial band )
Direct soft tissue work ( e.g. massage / ART ) for the lateral structures ( all of the above plus the lateral retinaculum )
Improving general quad strength ( via quad sets , leg extensions etc. )
TKEs could definitely be part of the program ; just understand they are n't a true isolation exercise .
Improving the motor control and strength of the gluteals
Stretching the quads and calves
It should be noted that each and every knee is different , requiring a specific and individualevaluation and treatment program .
I 'm not trying to rehab people here , rather help them prevent the need for rehab !
However , I just do n't see the need for direct VMO " isolation " exercises in that treatment program , as their use has n't been justified in research at this point in time .
6 – Get some balance in your training .
I 'm still shocked at how many people do n't adhere to this rule .
They 'll squat , then lunge , then do leg extensions , and then maybe get some hamstring work in if they are n't totally wiped at the end of their workout .
If you do n't follow this rule , your knees may not hurt now , but I can guarantee they will in the future !
When I say that we have to balance your training , we are n't talking within the training day or even the training week .
You need to address the long - term health of your body when you lay out your programming !
Do n't just plan one cycle , follow it , and then forget about it when planning the next one .
What you did ( or did n't do ) in this cycle directly affects ensuing cycles .
So if you did a ton of quad - dominant work in one cycle , you better make up for it with some serious hamstring and glute dominant work down the line .
As Alwyn Cosgrove always says , " Time magnifies all programming errors . "
7 – Stop pain provoking activities !
This is the simplest tip I 'll give , but for whatever reason people still fail to listen to their body and grasp the concept :
If it hurts , stop doing it !
This can include squatting , lunging , running , playing basketball , or any other pain - provoking activities .
Your second grade PE teacher could give you the same advice .
Remember that sometimes taking an extra day or two off is n't a bad thing if you can train harder ( or pain - free ) the next time around .
As well , there are also those times when you need to take a step back and work toward a total - body overhaul .
If your body has been functioning in an ineffective fashion for a long time , it can take some time to get things sorted out .
Take the time sooner rather than later to do this .
Each and every time you step in the gym you need to work on being better , and if you 're injured , that just can't happen .
8 – Do n't be afraid to isolate after traumatic injury .
Most of the time , isolation exercises totally suck , especially if strength and / or performance are your primary goals .
However , in a rehabilitation setting the rules can , and need , to change .
Following my knee scope , I started back into training with basic proprioceptive exercises , working on regaining mobility , and then progressing back into single - leg exercises .
Problem was , my quads were flat - out weak .
Just like any other time one muscle is weak , another one is forced to compensate .
So by not isolating my quads , I was reinforcing another muscle imbalance .
So I begrudgingly got on the leg extension machine and watched myself struggle with 40 pounds .
Seriously , I 'd rather have a bullet in my head than be seen struggling with 40 pounds on the leg extension , but it's what I needed to get my strength back .
If nothing else , remember this motto : " A muscle that 's weak in isolation will be weak in integration . "
Do what it takes to get the strength back , even if it means resorting to machines for a short time .
The end - goal is to increase tissue tolerance and get to a point where we can perform single - leg exercises without compensation .
9 – Do some single - leg work .
Why do single - leg work ?
Here are just a few reasons I cited in my Single Leg Supplements article :
Decrease strength imbalances between right and left legs Providing a change of pace in your training Improved balance and proprioception Strengthen key knee stabilizers , specifically the VMO and gluteals Destroy the " light bulb " effect
Let 's focus briefly on point number four .
Remember how we discussed above that those with knee issues need to improve general quadriceps strength , and also need to improve gluteal strength as well ?
For these reasons alone , single - leg exercises can do wonders for preventing ( or rehabilitating ) injuries .
Beyond that , far too many of us stick solely to the " big " exercises in the gym .
I 'm all for big squats , good mornings , and pulls , but single - leg exercises move us out of the sagittal plane and force our bodies to learn stabilization patterns in the frontal plane .
I'm a firm believer that the better our stability is in the frontal ( and transverse ) planes , the better we 'll be able to perform in sagittal plane exercises .
In layman 's terms , the more proficient you are at single - leg exercises , the better you can become at double - leg exercises !
10 – Get your glutes and hamstrings stronger !
We discussed above how people with patello - femoral pain have significantly less strength in their gluteals .
So what 's the easiest way to rectify the situation ?
If you said " Get their glutes stronger , " you get the gold star for the day .
By working to activate the gluteals pre-workout , and then working to strengthen them within your workout , you 'll be well on your way to healthier knees in the future .
But what about the hamstrings ?
Have you ever seen someone who just can't sit back when they squat ?
Or lands on their toes when they lunge ?
Flat out , these people have terrible posterior chain strength .
It 's important to note that we want the glutes to be our primary hip extensor , but we can't forget about our other big hip extensors , the hamstrings .
Finally , it 's important to note that while a lot of women who suffer ACL tears are genetically predisposed ( via a large Q - Angle and wide pelvis ) , they could do a lot for themselves by following this tip alone .
This genetic predisposition lends them to flawed posture and movement patterns where the quads and adductors do most of the work , while the hamstrings and glutes do minimal work .
Couple this flawed posture with the fact that more and more females participate in quad dominant sports such as basketball , soccer and the like , and you have a recipe for disaster !
Every female athlete I work with is going to get a steady dose of posterior chain work : glute - hams , RDL's , deadlifts , reverse hypers , and pull - throughs .
It can be difficult , but try to focus on bringing up total strength of the posterior chain while also optimizing recruitment patterns .
Focusing on squeezing the glutes at the top of all movements can go a long way .
11 – Learn to absorb force .
As I 'm writing this , I can envision people taking it to the Nth degree and performing depth drops off a ten foot wall .
Before we take it there , let me clarify my point a little bit .
What I 'd like all trainees to have is at least a basic knowledge of how to absorb force .
If you were to jump up in the air and then land with your knees straight and a loud " thud , " you 're not allowing your muscles and tendons to absorb force .
Instead , all the force is being absorbed by your joints , and this just is n't a good thing if you value your knee joints ( or ankles , hips , or lumbar spine for that matter ! )
The vertical jump is actually a great test and exercise to utilize .
Jump up in the air and try to minimize the sound when you hit the ground .
Land with soft knees , soft feet , and lower into a half squat to absorb the force .
I 'm not trying to make you into an elite athlete with this recommendation , just give you some food for thought .
It would n't kill you to be a little more athletic , would it ?
12 – Get your body in proper alignment !
Ever see a car that 's out of alignment ?
Notice how it wears down those tires quickly ?
And the gas mileage you get is downright atrocious to boot .
So what if your body is out of alignment ?
Well , just walking around could be a chore , and I can virtually guarantee one part of your knee joint is taking the brunt of the load .
To make it worse , you 're probably squatting , deadlifting , and lunging heavily as well , which is kind of like speeding with that same faulty alignment .
It 's going to catch up to you one of these days when the tires blow !
Check out the Neanderthal No More series if you 're in need of a tune - up .
Optimal alignment may not be easy , but the benefits far outweigh the time and energy it takes to get you there .
13 – Learn how to lift !
This may sound really stupid , but you'd be amazed at how many clients and athletes I work with who tell me , " I ca n't do X exercise ; it hurts my ( insert body part here ) . "
Since this is a knee article , we 'll assume it hurts their knees .
Here 's the problem though :
It 's not the exercise that 's hurting them ; it 's their god-awful lifting technique that 's the problem !
I 'm amazed at how many people can't perform even the most basic exercises in the weightroom , yet they 're so convinced it 's the exercise that 's at fault , not their performance of that exercise that 's the real problem .
The squat is a great example , as it's been the scapegoat for everything from sore knees to bad backs .
There have been numerous technical articles written on T - Nation for everything from single - leg exercises to squats and deadlifts , so if you think your form may be off , read through them and make sure your technique is spot-on .
Improving your technique is one of the best things you can do to stay healthy , as well as improving your strength and physique .
14 – Beware the irritated rectus femoris !
I used to think the psoas was the devil when it came to flawed posture and injuries , but now I 'm not so sure .
Sure , it can be troublesome for a number of reasons , but for those with knee issues I 'd like to take a closer look at the rectus femoris instead .
First off , I 'm sure you 're wondering , " How do I know if my rectus is a problem ? "
Try the modified Thomas Test to find out :
Sit on the edge of a table or counter with your buttocks on the edge .
From here , grab one knee and pull it to your chest while laying all the way back with the head and neck relaxed .
What you 're looking for here is the position of the lower leg in relation to the ground .
If your lower leg is perpendicular to the ground , you 're fine .
However , if your lower leg is not at perpendicular , you have a short or stiff rectus femoris .
The gentlemen in the picture below is a great example .
Notice how his upper thigh is parallel to the ground , but his lower thigh is n't perpendicular .
I 'd be willing to bet that more than a few of you are going to fail this test miserably !
So what do you need to do if this is the case ?
Rather than stretching your one joint hip flexors , you need to focus on your rectus femoris , a two - joint hip flexor that crosses both the hip and the knee .
If you failed the test above , try this stretch :
It 's very similar to a regular lunge stretch , but by having your back foot elevated we take your hip into extension and knee into flexion , effectively stretching the rectus femoris from both sides .
Focus on staying tall throughout .
Coaching cues would include keeping the chest up , posteriorly tilting the pelvis , and squeezing the stretch - side glutes .
To get even more bang - for - your - buck , try pairing this stretch with some glute activation work to further restore the balance around your hips .
15 – Eat an anti-inflammatory diet .
A healthy diet plays a big role when it comes to maintaining healthy joints .
While we do n't have all the answers yet , we 're quickly learning that an inflammatory diet is NOT a good thing ; whether you 're at risk for heart disease , have asthma , or just want to keep your joints healthy .
While we 've known for quite some time that poor biomechanical alignment , being excessively heavy , and general wear - and - tear can wreak havoc on your joints , we 're also seeing that joint destruction could very well be systemic too .
Positive changes in your diet could be a huge influence on your joint health later in life .
Granted , this is n't my area of expertise , so I called in the big guns for this topic .
Here 's what Tammy Thomas , MS , RD , CSCS and a specialist in the realm of autoimmune disease , had to say on the topic :
" There are too many scientific articles to cite regarding joint destruction and inflammation .
You can do a search on PubMed with ' joint destruction ' and ' inflammation ' and see the number of hits you get .
Researchers know that inflammation plays a definite role in joint destruction .
Diet plays a role in inflammation , especially dietary fats .
The fats , more specifically the fatty acids , we ingest directly affect our body 's production of eicosanoids ( hormone - like substances ) and the ratio of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory prostaglandins .
Cutting back on saturated fat , and even omega - 6 fatty acids ( arachadonic acid ) , which tend to be pro-inflammatory , while increasing the intake of omega - 3 fatty acids ( alpha - linolenic acid ) , which are anti-inflammatory , will help to prevent the occurrence and progression of systemic inflammation associated with mild infection , poor diet , and obesity . "
Balancing our fatty acid profile is n't just one of the best things we can do to improve our overall health , but the health of our joints as well .
( If you 'd like to learn more about Tammy , please check out her website at www.proactivitysupport.com).
16 – Take Joint Regenerating / Protecting Supplements
While the jury may be out on the ability of certain supplements to protect and / or regenerate our joints , I 'll be frank here – I 'm not willing to wait around to find out !
What if we found out in 15 or 20 years that glucosamine and chondroitin really do what they say ?
Would n't you be kicking yourself for not taking them sooner , when your joints were in far better shape ?
I know I would be .
But what else is out there ?
I believe to keep our joints healthy we need a three - pronged approach with our supplements :
Glucosamine and chondroitin ( for their possible joint - regenerating effects )
Fish oil supplements ( to help balance fatty acid profile ) Antioxidants ( for healthy connective tissue )
Here 's what I take on a daily basis :
1500 mg glucosamine / 1200 mg chondroitin
500 mg Vitamin C
200 IU Vitamin E
100 mcg Selenium
4 caps Flameout ®
While some of these practices may be on the fringe , I 'm willing to take calculated risks , especially if the rewards are as great as some say .
Heavy weight training may look great on the outside , but it does have a few drawbacks on the inside ( especially concerning the joints ) .
However , proper supplementation could be a great way to minimize the effects of those drawbacks .
17 – Get some soft tissue work done .
This is another addition to your program that can give you huge paybacks over the long - term .
First , if you have n't purchased a foam roller yet , what are you waiting for ?
I 'd venture to say almost any performance coach worth his salt is using one , so why are n't you ?
If you are n't sure how to use one , check out our Feel Better for 10 Bucks article .
Something we did n't discuss in the foam rolling article is changing the length of the muscle while you 're working it .
This allows you to work different areas of the muscle and get an even better response .
For instance , try this for your rectus femoris and quads :
Roll these areas like you normally would , and then continue rolling but bend your knee .
You may not feel it at the bottom of the quads , but I think you 'll notice a big difference when rolling the top of your thigh !
Now as great as the foam roller is , it still pales in comparison to specific soft - tissue work performed by a specialist .
If you 've never had soft - tissue work done before , I 'd start with a solid ART provider , as they 'll be able to get rid of adhesions and scar tissue that have built up over the course of your training career .
After that , a more general deep tissue massage will help normalize your tissue tone and help you realize better quality of movement .
This is n't really something that can be described in words , but you 'll know the feeling when you effortlessly drop into a deep squat for the first time !
18 – Stretch your quads and calves !
I recently came across an interesting prospective study regarding patello - femoral pain .
While most studies are retrospective in nature ( e.g. they examine an issue afterthere 's a problem ) very few look at it in the opposite fashion .
This prospective study ( 3 ) examined 282 athletes enrolled in phys ed classes and took them through a battery of tests to determine baseline statistics .
Two years later they followed up , and 24 of the 282 had developed patellofemoral pain .
After running statistical analyses on these subjects , researchers determined that athletes who had developed PF pain had significantly tighter quadriceps and gastrocnemi than their healthy counterparts .
So what 's the moral of this story ?
Stretch your quads and calves !
As well , it 's interesting to note that the gastrocnemius can wreak havoc on both sides of the joint .
The gastrocnemius is the " calf " muscle that crosses your knee joint , and can therefore contribute to posterior knee pain as well .
All the more reason to stretch those puppies out if you ask me !
Conclusion
You have all the tips you need to keep your knees healthy and feeling great .
Now all you have to do is use the info to reap the benefits !
I 'm looking forward to some great success stories to follow !

Israel 's offensive in Gaza has been under way for nearly two weeks Israeli forces shelled a house in the Gaza Strip which they had moved around 110 Palestinians into 24 hours earlier , the UN quotes witnesses as saying .
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) called it " one of the gravest incidents " since the beginning of the offensive .
The shelling at Zeitoun , a south - east suburb of Gaza City , on 5 January killed some 30 people , the report said .
Israel says it has looked into the allegations and they are unfounded .
Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said no Israeli soldiers had been in the area on the day the incident was supposed to have happened .
The OCHA report said : " According to several testimonies , on 4 January Israeli foot soldiers evacuated approximately 110 Palestinians into a single - residence house in Zeitoun ( half of whom were children ) warning them to stay indoors .
" Twenty - four hours later , Israeli forces shelled the home repeatedly , killing approximately 30 . "
The UN said those who survived and were able walked 2 km to the main north - south road to be transported to hospital in civilian vehicles .
" Three children , the youngest of whom was five months old , died upon arrival at the hospital , " the report said .
' No safe haven ' Allegra Pacheco , of OCHA in Jerusalem , said they were not accusing the Israelis of a deliberate act , but said the incident needed to be investigated .
She also said they were concerned at claims by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) that ambulances were only allowed access to the neighbourhood on Thursday - four days after the alleged incident .
The ICRC on Thursday accused Israel of failing to fulfil its duty to help wounded civilians in Gaza .
" In Gaza , there is a severe protection of civilians crisis .
There is no safe haven , no safe space , for all the civilians , particularly children , " Ms Pacheco told the BBC .
" Since the ground operation , the number of children killed has risen by 250 % . "
An estimated 770 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died in nearly two weeks of Israel 's air and ground offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas .
The UN Security Council has called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza .

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW C h a p t e r 1 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
Budget 2009  Canadas Economic Action Plan Introduction
The world is passing through an extraordinary time .
Canadians share in the global consensus that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures .
Budget 2009 will help Canada to meet the challenges of our times .
It aims to protect our country from an immediate economic threat while providing the solutions we need to secure our long - term growth and prosperity .
Canadians in all regions have begun to feel the effects of the deepening global economic crisis .
They worry about their jobs , their hard - earned savings and their homes .
They are concerned about their families , their businesses and their communities .
Fulfilling Canadas G20 Commitment Canada is not acting alone but in full cooperation and coordination with other industrialized countries .
The world economy is highly globalized .
It is only by acting together to boost global economic growth that countries can derive maximum impact from their actions .
The Governments actions in this budget fulfill Canadas commitments at the recent G20 leaders  summit to provide timely stimulus to domestic demand , while maintaining long - run fiscal sustainability .
The International Monetary Fund has suggested that countries in a position to do so should inject fiscal stimulus of 2 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) to reduce the effects of a damaging global recession .
Canada must join this effort .
It is now clear that Canada has entered a recession .
We entered it later than other G7 countries , and it is shallower here than elsewhere .
Budget 2009 not only will help Canadians affected by the current crisis but also position Canada to emerge from this recession in a stronger position .
9
Consulting with Canadians The Government has listened to the concerns of Canadians .
In putting together Budget 2009 , it has undertaken an unprecedented consultative effort .
It has consulted the provinces and territories .
It has considered the views of private sector economists , academics , business leaders and thousands of Canadians who participated in on - line consultations .
The Minister of Finance also sought advice from his Economic Advisory Council and Members of Parliament from all parties .
Budget 2009 is a reflection of this extensive effort .
Budget 2009 reflects a strong consensus among Canadians that the Government must deliver a potent economic stimulus to encourage growth and restore confidence in our economy .
The Economic Action Plan is based on three guiding principles that stimulus should be timely , targeted and temporary .
Timely .
Canada is in recession today .
Measures to support the economy must begin within the next 120 days to be most effective .
Targeted .
Measures that target Canadian businesses and families most in need will trigger the largest increase in Canadian jobs and output .
Temporary .
The stimulus plan should be phased out when the economy recovers to avoid long - term structural deficits .
The Governments Economic Action Plan will provide almost $ 30 billion in support to the Canadian economy , or 1.9 per cent of our gross domestic product .
It will create or maintain close to 190,000 Canadian jobs .
Improving Access to Financing , Strengthening the Financial System Budget 2009 begins where the global recession began : with financial markets .
By providing up to $ 200 billion through the Extraordinary Financing Framework , this budget will improve access to credit for Canadian consumers and allow businesses to obtain the financing they need to invest , grow and create new jobs .
10
The Government is also taking steps , in partnership with willing provinces and territories , to establish a single securities regulator for Canada to simplify its regulatory system , reduce costs and attract investment to our financial markets .
Action to Help Canadians and Stimulate Spending The Government is providing $ 8.3 billion for the Canadian Skills and Transition Strategy .
This includes extra support for people who have lost their jobs , including enhancements to Employment Insurance and more funding for skills and training development to help Canadians get better jobs , while giving Canada a more flexible , knowledgeable workforce and a competitive edge in the global economy .
Budget 2009 takes action to build on the Governments impressive record of tax relief to further stimulate the economy and help Canadians face the global recession with $ 20 billion in personal income tax relief over 2008 - 09 and the next five fiscal years .
Action to Stimulate Housing Construction
The Government is providing $ 7.8 billion to build quality housing , stimulate construction , encourage home ownership and enhance energy efficiency .
Measures include a Home Renovation Tax Credit providing up to $ 1,350 in tax relief to an estimated 4.6 million Canadian families , up to $ 750 in tax relief for first - time home buyers , funding for energy retrofits , investments for social housing to support low - income Canadians , seniors , persons with disabilities and Aboriginal Canadians , and low - cost loans to municipalities .
Immediate Action to Build Infrastructure Budget 2009 accelerates and expands the recent historic federal investment in infrastructure with almost $ 12 billion in new infrastructure stimulus funding over two years , so that Canada emerges from this economic crisis with more modern and greener infrastructure .
This includes funding for shovel - ready projects that can start this upcoming construction season , including roads , bridges , clean energy , broadband internet access and electronic health records across the country .
11
Action to Support Businesses and Communities Budget 2009 protects jobs and supports sectoral adjustment during this extraordinary crisis with $ 7.5 billion in extra support for sectors , regions and communities .
This includes targeted support for the auto , forestry and manufacturing sectors , as well as funding for clean energy .
Protecting our Fiscal Advantage
A strong consensus emerged from the Budget consultation process that Canada needs to run a temporary deficit to protect our economy and invest in our future growth .
Although many of the measures presented in Budget 2009 are extraordinary , they are consistent with the Governments long - term economic plan , Advantage Canada .
The Government followed this long - term plan by reducing taxes for families and businesses , reducing debt and investing in knowledge and infrastructure .
The Government also took early action in 2007 to protect Canadas businesses and the economy as the global financial crisis was beginning .
This course of action has placed Canada in a stronger position than most other countries to face the present crisis .
We can afford to spend what is necessary in todays plan of action to secure our future prosperity .
The Government will preserve Canadas fiscal advantage by focusing spending measures in two years , to allow an early return to balanced budgets , so that Canada emerges from recession in at least as strong an economic and fiscal position relative to other countries as it is today .
12
Building a Stronger Canada With this Economic Action Plan , Canada will emerge from this economic crisis with a more modern and greener infrastructure , a more skilled labour force , lower taxes and a more competitive economy .
In Budget 2009 , the Government is protecting the Canada we have built and the values we share , while investing in the foundations of long - run economic growth .

Highlights Recent Economic Developments and Prospects ü
The global economy is in the most synchronized recession in the post - war period and the ongoing financial market crisis is the worst since the 1930s .
ü
The economic slowdown is particularly evident in the United States and other advanced economies where the economic outlook has deteriorated markedly in recent months , but is also increasingly apparent in emerging market economies .
ü
Weaker expectations for global growth have led to a further decline in the prices of many of the commodities produced in Canada .
ü Global credit markets remain seriously disrupted , with credit conditions remaining tight both in terms of the cost and availability of credit .
ü
As a result , the private sector outlook for real and nominal GDP in Canada has been revised down significantly since the time of the Economic and Fiscal Statement : 
There is now a broad - based consensus that the Canadian economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Private sector forecasters expect the recession to last three quarters .
 Real GDP is now expected to contract by 0.8 per cent in 2009 , compared to a forecast of 0.3 per cent growth at the time of the Statement .
 Nominal GDP is expected to fall by 1.2 per cent for 2009 , compared to an increase of 0.8 per cent in the Statement .
ü
The risks to the outlook for real and nominal GDP remain tilted to the downside .
ü
In light of this risk , the Government has judged it appropriate to adjust downward the private sector forecast for nominal GDP for budget planning assumptions .
The planning assumption is for a contraction of 2.7 per cent in nominal GDP in 2009 , rather than the - 1.2 per cent average private sector forecast .
ü
This means that the budget planning assumption for the level of nominal GDP is forecast to be about $ 30 billion lower than expected by the private sector in 2009 and 2010 .
ü
The Government will continue to evaluate economic developments to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to maintain the adjustment for risk in future budgets and economic and fiscal updates .
14

Fiscal Outlook ü
The deterioration of the economic outlook has led to a significant reduction in projected revenues , particularly in 2009 10 and 2010  11 .
ü
The projections in this budget are based on the average of private sector economic forecasts .
However , given the degree of uncertainty in the global economy , the Government is including an explicit adjustment for the risks to the private sector forecasts .
This adjustment amounts to a reduction in the budgetary balance of $ 0.8 billion in 200809 , $ 4.5 billion in 2009 10 and 2010  11 , $ 3 billion in 2011  12 , $ 1.5 billion in 201213 and $ 0.8 billion in 2013  14 .
ü
After this adjustment for risk and before accounting for the impact of the actions proposed in this budget , the Government is projecting a small surplus in 200809 , followed by deficits of $ 15.7 billion in 2009  10 , $ 14.3 billion in 2010  11 , $ 8.3 billion in 2011  12 , $ 2.3 billion in 201213 and a surplus of $ 5.5 billion in 2013  14 .
ü
After taking into account the cost of the measures proposed in Budget 2009 to support the economy , the Government is projecting deficits of $ 1.1 billion in 200809 , $ 33.7 billion in 2009  10 , $ 29.8 billion in 2010  11 , $ 13.0 billion in 2011  12 , $ 7.3 billion in 201213 and a surplus of $ 0.7 billion in 2013  14 .
27
ü The Government has designed its Economic Action Plan to concentrate new spending in 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11 , when the economy is expected to be weak .
Starting in 2011 - 12 , the fiscal position of the Government is projected to improve rapidly , as time - limited stimulus measures expire and the economy recovers .
By 2013 - 14 , the budget is projected to be in a small surplus .
ü Program spending is expected to increase through 2010 - 11 , reflecting the impact of the measures in this budget .
Over the medium term , spending as a share of GDP is expected to return close to its 2007 - 08 level .
The Government remains committed to ensuring that spending is focused and disciplined .
ü
The debt - to - GDP ratio is expected to increase from 28.6 per cent in 2008 - 09 to 32.1 per cent by 2010 - 11 , as a result of projected deficits .
The debt - to - GDP ratio is projected to be below its 2008 - 09 level by 2013 - 14 .
ü Canadas net debt - to - GDP ratio will remain below other G7 countries over the forecast horizon .
ü The Governments priority is to support the economy .
The Government will use budget surpluses first of all to repay the deficits expected in the upcoming four years .

Introduction
The global economic outlook has deteriorated markedly in recent months .
This is particularly evident in the United States and other advanced economies but is also increasingly apparent in emerging market economies .
Weaker global growth has led to a further decline in the prices of many of the commodities produced in Canada .
As a result , the near - term outlook for output , employment and income in Canada is also weaker than forecast in the November 27 Economic and Fiscal Statement .
This chapter reviews the major global and Canadian economic developments since the Statement , describes the economic forecast that forms the basis for the fiscal projections outlined in Chapter 4 , and discusses the risks and uncertainties associated with this economic outlook .
To address the uncertainty about the economic outlook and the downside risks to that outlook , this chapter also proposes that the assumptions used for budget planning should be more prudent than suggested by the private sector average forecast .
Global Economic Developments and Outlook The Canadian economy faces three major challenges : 
The impact of tighter credit conditions and equity market losses stemming from global financial market dislocations .

The economic slowdown in the U.S. and other key economies , and its impact on demand for Canadian exports . 
The sharp drop in prices for many commodities produced in Canada , which is dampening Canadian profit and income growth .
All of these challenges are rooted in developments in the global economy .
The negative impacts stemming from them have increased since the time of the November 2008 Statement .
Global financial markets continue to be characterized by very high risk aversion .
As a result , credit markets remain seriously disrupted , with credit conditions remaining tight both in terms of the cost and availability of credit .
33
The Canadian financial system is better equipped to cope with the challenging global financial situation than financial systems in most other countries .
Canada has a less - leveraged and better - capitalized banking sector compared with other countries .
As a result , wholesale borrowing costs paid by Canadian banks have risen less than for banks in other countries ( Chart 2.1 ) .
Nevertheless , Canadian banks  wholesale costs remain high and this is affecting a wide range of consumer and business borrowing rates in Canada .
Of particular concern is the fact that financing costs for businesses are elevated .
Yields on Canadian corporate bonds remain significantly higher than pre-crisis levels , with yields increasing further after September 2008 ( Chart 2.2 ) .
The increase has been highest for less creditworthy bonds , but even yields for AAA corporate bonds have risen significantly .
Further , over the past several months , Canadian businesses have seen their access to capital markets for financing impaired as a result of the global financial crisis .
Surveys of senior loan officers in chartered banks also suggest that non-price borrowing conditions for Canadian businesses have tightened to the highest levels on record , along with the increase in the cost of borrowing ( Chart 2.3 ) .
34

The credit situation for Canadian consumers is somewhat better .
The prime loan rate , which influences a broad range of consumer loan rates , has declined by 300 basis points since the beginning of 2008 ( Chart 2.4 ) .
Over this period , the conventional 1 - year mortgage rate has decreased by 245 basis points , while the 5 - year mortgage rate has declined by about 160 basis points .
However , as a result of conditions in financial markets , the reduction in consumer borrowing costs relative to the sharp easing in the Bank of Canadas policy rate has been somewhat less than in past easing periods .
As well , consumer access to credit in some market segments , such as through financing companies , has been curtailed .
The impact of tighter credit conditions for businesses and consumers has begun to affect the domestic economy in Canada .
This will likely intensify in coming months .
36
The Government and the Bank of Canada have taken a number of steps to help ensure the stability of the Canadian financial system and to improve access to credit .
Since September 2007 , the Bank of Canada has cut policy rates by a total of 350 basis points .
As of January 22 , the Bank had also added $ 33 billion in the provision of term liquidity to the Canadian financial system .
In addition , since the fall of 2008 the Government has put in place a number of programs to help ease the tension in financial markets , including the purchase of up to $ 75 billion in insured mortgage pools from Canadian financial institutions through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the provision of a guarantee for banks  borrowings through the Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility .
Late last year , the Government approved a $ 2 - billion increase in the borrowing authority of EDC and a $ 1.8 - billion increase in BDCs borrowing capacity , which is enabling them to offer additional credit to their clients .
This is in addition to $ 350 million in capital committed to each financial Crown Corporation to support about a further $ 3 billion in increased credit granting .
The global financial turmoil , together with the decline in commodity prices and weakening global economic outlook , has contributed to a decline of about 40 per cent in the Canadian stock market since the middle of 2008 .
As a result of the decline in equity prices , household net worth declined 3.2 per cent in the third quarter , with a further large decline likely in the fourth quarter .
This reduction is significantly less pronounced than in the U.S. where a sharp decline in home prices combined with stock market declines have dramatically reduced household net worth ( Chart 2.5 ) .
37
The fall in household net worth is expected to dampen consumer spending over the next year .
The extent to which this materializes is difficult to estimate precisely .
It will depend upon the extent to which consumer spending patterns were previously influenced by the past run-up in assets and the extent to which recent equity losses are perceived to be permanent .
Also , a mitigating factor is that debt financing costs as a share of disposable income are low and likely to continue falling , given recent reductions in interest rates .
38
Recent Global Economic Developments and Outlook United States
The sharp deterioration of the U.S. economy over the past few months points to a deeper and longer downturn than was previously expected .
Private sector economists now expect that the loss of output in the current episode will match the loss experienced in the 1981  82 recession .
The current U.S. recession , which started in January 2008 , was temporarily masked by a sharp increase in export growth as well as the positive boost to consumer spending from the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act .
However , since June 2008 , the impact of the temporary tax rebate has receded and personal consumer spending has contracted sharply ( Chart 2.6 ) .
39
Output fell 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 .
Recent economic data suggest that the contraction intensified in the fourth quarter .
Indeed , private sector forecasters currently estimate that output has contracted by 5 per cent at an annual rate .
Employment losses have accelerated , reaching almost 2.6 million for 2008 as a whole , while the unemployment rate has reached 7.2 per cent , a 16 - year high ( Chart 2.7 ) .
Deteriorating employment prospects and tighter credit conditions have led to further substantial cutbacks in discretionary spending , as evidenced by the weakest level of auto sales since the early 1980s .
Manufacturing activity has contracted sharply , while the export sector , which has supported the U.S. economy since early 2007 , is now weakening as a result of the global downturn and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar since August 2008 .
Housing starts and building permits have plunged to new record lows , while home sales and prices continue to decline ( Chart 2.8 ) .
Housing - related losses have led to a further tightening in lending standards and delinquency and foreclosure rates for residential mortgages have reached record highs ( Chart 2.9 ) .
40
41
In response to the deteriorating outlook and ongoing financial market stresses , the Federal Reserve cut its target for the federal funds rate on December 16 from 1 per cent to a range of 0 to 0.25 per cent .
The Federal Reserve has now lowered its key policy rate by 500 basis points since September 2007 .
The Federal Reserve has stated that weak economic conditions will likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the target rate for some time .
Further , the Federal Reserve stated that it will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability .
On the fiscal front , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill of 2009 , which proposes US $ 825 billion in fiscal stimulus , was tabled in the U.S. House of Representatives on January 15 , 2009 and is currently being discussed by Congress .
The bill includes infrastructure spending , personal tax cuts for lower - and middle - income households , business tax cuts designed to boost investment , as well as additional transfers to state governments .
As a result of the developments reviewed above , the private - sector near - term outlook for U.S. real GDP growth has been lowered significantly since the publication of the Economic and Fiscal Statement .
Based on the most recent projections of private sector forecasters surveyed by the Department of Finance , U.S. real GDP is now expected to decline by 1.8 per cent in 2009 , before strengthening to 2.1 per cent in 2010 ( Chart 2.10 ) .
Relative to the forecasts prepared at the time of the Statement , the private sector outlook for U.S. economic growth has been revised down by 1.4 percentage points in 2009 and is unchanged for 2010 .
42
With U.S. housing construction now at extremely low levels , inventories of unsold houses should stabilize .
Nevertheless U.S. housing demand and prices will likely decline further owing to the ongoing recession and rising unemployment .
As inventories are worked off over the course of 2009 and in the first half of 2010 , housing starts and house prices are expected to stabilize .
The eventual stabilization and recovery of the housing market is also expected to help credit conditions return to normal .
However , there remains an unusually large degree of uncertainty surrounding the outlook .
While it is expected that the new fiscal stimulus , together with actions taken to improve the functioning of credit markets , will begin to have an impact on economic growth in mid-2009 , the ultimate magnitude and timing of the recovery remain uncertain .
Moreover , the pace of economic recovery will also depend on the degree of improvement in the U.S. housing market together with a restoration of the smooth functioning of credit markets .
This in turn should lead to a rebound in confidence and equity markets .
This scenario underlies private sector expectations of moderate growth in the U.S. in 2010 .
43
Global Economy Similar to the situation in the U.S. , prospects for the world economy have also deteriorated since the release of the Statement .
At that time , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) was projecting world GDP growth to slow from 3.7 per cent in 2008 to just 2.2 per cent in 2009,1 well below the pace usually associated with a global recession .
Since then , however , global conditions have continued to worsen and private sector forecasters now estimate , on average , that world growth in 2009 will slow to about 1 per cent ( Chart 2.11 ) .
2
The recent deterioration of global prospects mainly reflects a downward revision to the outlook for advanced economies , linked to the ongoing global financial crisis .
However , emerging markets are also projected to experience a more pronounced slowdown than previously expected as capital spending and export growth taper off .
1
The IMF reports world real GDP growth on both a purchasing power parity ( PPP ) and a market exchange rate basis .
On a market exchange rate basis , the IMF expected world real GDP growth to ease from 2.6 per cent in 2008 to 1.1 per cent in 2009 in its November 2008 World Economic Outlook Update .
2 Estimated by the Department of Finance based on private sector forecasts ( Consensus Forecasts and Blue Chip Economic Indicators ) and IMF implicit PPP weights ( 2007 estimates for real GDP ) .
44
In the Euro area , output contracted in the second and third quarters of 2008 .
Recent data releases suggest that ongoing weakness is likely as labour markets , consumer spending , business investment and industrial production have all deteriorated more than expected .
The European Commission has responded by announcing the European Economic Recovery Plan in which the Commission recommends that member countries implement  200 billion of fiscal stimulus measures ( about 1.5 per cent of GDP ) to restore confidence and stimulate investment and spending .
In support of this recommendation , several individual member countries have already announced fiscal stimulus plans .
As well , the European Central Bank has significantly eased monetary policy .
After rising by 2.6 per cent in 2007 , the Blue Chip consensus now estimates that real GDP growth in the Euro area was about 1.0 per cent in 2008 , and is expected to contract by 1.2 per cent in 2009 .
Japan is also in recession , reflecting weak consumer spending and declines in business investment and net exports .
Japanese authorities cut policy rates for the first time in seven years and announced a series of stimulus packages to shore up the economy .
With weaker external and domestic demand , economic activity is projected to remain weak in the coming quarters .
According to the Blue Chip consensus , Japanese real GDP growth is expected to slow from 2.4 per cent in 2007 to 0.4 per cent in 2008 and then turn negative in 2009 at - 1.4 per cent .
Growth in the emerging market economies has moderated further as the financial crisis has spread .
In China , year - over - year growth slowed to 6.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
The slowdown mainly reflected weaker export growth and a slower pace of capital formation .
For 2008 as a whole , growth slowed to 9.0 per cent from 13.0 per cent in 2007 .
The Blue Chip consensus projects growth in China to slow further to 7.1 per cent in 2009 , the slowest pace of economic activity since 1990 .
In response , the Chinese government has introduced a significant package to stimulate demand and announced its biggest interest rate cut in 11 years .
45
Overall , the global economy is facing an exceptional period of heightened volatility and uncertainty .
Reflecting this , growth forecasts for 2009 for all the major advanced and developing economies have been marked down repeatedly and significantly over the past several months ( Chart 2.12 ) .
46
Canadian Economic Developments Weaker U.S. and global demand , combined with the ongoing global financial market turbulence and lower commodity prices , are all weighing on the Canadian economy .
These developments have resulted in declines in exports , slower income growth and upward pressures on borrowing costs , all of which are expected to have reduced output in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Over the first three quarters of 2008 , output growth averaged just 0.4 per cent , largely reflecting continued declines in exports of goods in response to the U.S. slowdown and the lagged impact of a high Canadian dollar .
This was offset by continued , albeit slower , growth in final domestic demand ( the sum of household , government and business spending ) .
However , starting in the third quarter of 2008 , final domestic demand growth has also slowed further , as household and business spending growth continued to moderate ( Chart 2.13 ) .
47
Growth in personal consumption expenditure on goods and services has decelerated over 2008 following strong growth in 2007 in response to a slowdown in real income growth .
More recently , consumption growth has slowed further owing to the impact of weaker confidence and lower investment income .
The impact of these factors has been particularly evident on spending on new motor vehicle sales , which fell to their lowest level in more than 10 years in December ( Chart 2.14 ) .
48
Following a period of rapid growth from 2002 to 2007 , Canadian housing investment fell in the first three quarters of 2008 , with both new construction and resale activity declining ( Chart 2.15 ) .
More recently , housing starts fell to their lowest level in seven years in December while existing home sales also fell significantly in the fourth quarter .
These recent declines have brought housing starts back to their historical averages from unusually high levels in the past six years .
This has been accompanied by a moderation in price growth and some declines in prices in regions where prices had increased sharply .
Some further weakening of housing activity and prices is likely as the current period of economic weakness depresses income growth and the demand for housing .
49
The current adjustment in the Canadian housing market is fundamentally different than the correction that has been underway in the U.S. since 2006 .
This reflects the fact that the conditions that led to the U.S. housing market collapse are not present in Canada .
In particular , the growth of the Canadian housing market was not fuelled by aggressive marketing of high - risk , sub - prime mortgage products that led to unsustainable growth in demand and prices in the United States .
As a result , while the United States is in the midst of a severe housing correction to compensate for excesses in previous years , the Canadian housing market is experiencing a cyclical slowing in prices and activity ( Chart 2.16 ) .
50
Growth in business investment has also slowed in 2008 in response to tighter credit conditions and a weaker economic outlook .
In particular , investment in machinery and equipment ( M&E ) declined in the second and third quarters of 2008 , following sharp declines in capacity utilization and the rising costs of imported M&E due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar ( Chart 2.17 ) .
51
More recent information suggests that the Canadian economy weakened further in the fourth quarter .
As a result of the slowdown in the domestic economy , employment losses in export - oriented sectors are no longer being offset by gains in domestically oriented industries .
This has weakened labour markets noticeably in recent months .
Total employment fell by 105,000 jobs in November and December , and the unemployment rate increased to 6.6 per cent in December , its highest level in almost three years ( Chart 2.18 ) .
Some regional labour markets are more affected than others .
For example , the unemployment rate in Ontario has risen sharply in recent months and has been above the national average unemployment rate for two years .
Weaker labour markets together with recent sharp equity market declines resulted in Canadian consumer confidence falling to its lowest levels in more than a decade .
These developments are being reflected in weaker consumer and residential spending .
52
But , overall , the domestic economic situation remains better than in most other major industrialized countries , in particular the United States .
This is particularly evident when comparing labour market performance in the two countries .
Since January 2008 , the month when the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that the U.S. recession began , the U.S. has lost more than 2.5 million jobs .
Canada to date has fared much better with 98,000 net new jobs created in 2008 , despite significant employment losses in November and December ( Chart 2.19 ) .
As of the third quarter of 2008 , Canada was the only G7 country to have posted positive real GDP growth over both the second and third quarters .
Canadas relatively stronger outlook than that of the U.S. in part reflects the fact that Canada has not had the same excesses in spending and borrowing in recent years .
For this reason , the financial position of households and businesses remains solid , both relative to their historical positions and relative to the U.S. , where excessive debt and leveraging have led to significant retrenchment .
53
Commodity Prices
The deteriorating global economic conditions have led to sharp declines in commodity prices ( Chart 2.20 ) .
While the declines have been broad - based , the fall in energy prices has been particularly large with oil declining the most despite announcements by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of cumulative daily production cuts of 4.2 million barrels from the September production levels .
Crude oil prices have been volatile in recent months , with daily closing prices having fluctuated in a range of US $ 31 to US $ 49 per barrel since the beginning of December .
Future contracts suggest that crude oil prices will average about US $ 50 per barrel in 2009 which is about 30 per cent below levels anticipated by private sector forecasters in the November Economic and Fiscal Statement .
Crude oil futures also remain extremely volatile .
54
Low commodity prices are reducing Canadian export income and have put downward pressure on the Canadian dollar .
This in turn is reducing nominal GDP , which is the broadest indicator of the tax base in Canada , and will ultimately mean lower - than - expected tax revenues .
This will also translate into a deterioration of the countrys current account balance , net foreign indebtedness as well as Canadians  purchasing power .
In this context , the volatility in commodity prices witnessed in recent months has introduced significant uncertainty into the outlook for nominal GDP , and therefore into the fiscal planning framework .
Over the near term , the risks to the commodity price outlook are tilted to the downside , reflecting uncertainty over global economic conditions and continued financial market dislocation .
Private sector economists expect that commodity prices will recover over the medium term , given the expected recovery in global demand together with tight supply conditions .
However , the volatility of the past year and the current high degree of uncertainty underscores the need to assume a prudent path for commodity prices going forward .
55
Private Sector Canadian Outlook
The Department of Finance surveys private sector economic forecasters on a quarterly basis for their outlook of the Canadian economy .
Due to the rapid deterioration of the global economic situation in recent months , private sector forecasters have frequently revised their forecasts downward .
The economic forecasts reported here were updated as of January 16 , 2009 .
Private sector forecasters expect that the Canadian economy will contract by 0.8 per cent in 2009 .
This compares to a forecast of 0.3 per cent growth at the time of the November Economic and Fiscal Statement ( Chart 2.21 and Table 2.1 ) .
56
Private sector forecasters believe that the Canadian economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of 2008 ( Chart 2.22 ) .
Forecasters expect the recession to last three quarters with the deepest contraction occurring in the first quarter of 2009 .
Output is expected to reach bottom in the second quarter of 2009 and to start recovering thereafter .
The recession is expected to be milder than the last two Canadian recessions and significantly less pronounced than the U.S. recession , which is forecast to be one of the deepest recessions in U.S. post - war history ( Chart 2.23 ) .
The outlook for GDP inflation in 2009 has been revised down to - 0.4 per cent from 0.5 per cent in the 2008 Statement .
This mainly reflects downward revisions to the outlook for commodity prices stemming from a weaker global economic outlook than expected at the time of the Statement .
The outlook for GDP inflation in 2010 has been revised down to 1.7 per cent from 1.8 per cent in the Statement .
57
58
Weaker real economic growth combined with weaker GDP inflation has reduced the outlook for nominal GDP growth in Canada to - 1.2 per cent in 2009 from 0.8 per cent just two months ago .
As a result , nominal GDP , which is the broadest indicator of the tax base for government revenue , is forecast to be $ 25 billion lower in 2009 and $ 30 billion lower in 2010 than anticipated at the time of the Statement .
At the time of the Economic and Fiscal Statement , private sector forecasters expected short - term interest rates to average 1.9 per cent in 2009 and 2.7 per cent in 2010 .
Private sector forecasters have revised down the outlook for short - term interest rates to 0.8 per cent in 2009 and 1.7 per cent in 2010 .
The outlook for long - term interest rates has also been significantly revised down to average 2.8 per cent in 2009 and 3.4 per cent in 2010 , from 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent , respectively , at the time of the Statement .
Slower growth is expected to translate into an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.5 per cent in 2009 and 7.7 per cent in 2010 , compared to 6.9 per cent in 2009 and 6.7 per cent in 2010 as forecast in the Statement .

Risk Assessment and Planning Assumptions
There continues to be a large degree of uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook , with the risks to that outlook tilted to the downside .
The main risk to the global economy is that financial market dislocations could be more prolonged than currently expected , resulting in a longer period of high business and consumer borrowing costs and reduced credit availability .
Should this transpire , global consumer spending and business investment would be weaker than currently forecast .
For Canada , the risk to the global economy is compounded by the risk stemming from low and volatile commodity prices .
As a result , there is considerable uncertainty about how commodity prices will affect nominal income growth in Canada .
Overall , the outlook for commodity prices poses a significant downside risk to the average private sector forecast for nominal GDP , reported in Table 2.1 .
Nominal GDP is the broadest single measure of the tax base .
Therefore , lower nominal GDP also reduces the projected level of budgetary revenues described in Chapter 4 .
The risks to the downside are larger for 2009 and 2010 .
In light of these risks , the Government has judged it appropriate to adjust downward the private sector forecast for nominal GDP for budget planning assumptions .
With this adjustment , the budget economic planning assumption for 2009 is now close to the bottom of the range of individual private sector forecasts for nominal GDP growth ( Chart 2.24 ) .
62
As a result , the planning assumption is for a contraction of 2.7 per cent in nominal GDP in 2009 ( Table 2.2 ) .
This means that the budget planning assumption for the level of nominal GDP is about $ 30 billion lower than expected by the private sector in 2009 and 2010 .
Starting in 2011 , the gap with the private sector forecast for nominal GDP begins to close and is closed by 2014 when risks to the private sector outlook are more balanced .
The Government will continue to evaluate economic developments and risks to determine whether or not it would be appropriate to maintain the adjustment for risk in future budgets and economic and fiscal updates .

Chapter CANADAS ECONOMIC ACTION PLAN
Overview
These are extraordinary times for the global economy and they call for extraordinary global measures .
The global economy is in the most synchronized recession in the post - war period fuelled in part by the worst financial market crisis since the 1930s .
The Government has developed an Economic Action Plan to boost confidence and economic growth and support Canadians and their families during this period of economic weakness .
With this stimulus plan , Canada will emerge from this recession stronger , with a modernized , greener infrastructure , a renewed science and research base , a more skilled labour force , lower taxes and a more competitive economy .
The Governments Economic Action Plan comprises five main elements :  Improving Access to Financing and Strengthening Canadas Financial System .
Providing up to $ 200 billion through the Extraordinary Financing Framework to improve access to financing for consumers and allow businesses to obtain the financing they need to invest , grow and create jobs .
 Action to Help Canadians and Stimulate Spending .
Providing $ 8.3 billion for the Canadian Skills and Transition Strategy .
This will help workers directly affected by the economic downturn with enhancements to Employment Insurance and funding for skills and training .
As well , the budget proposes $ 20 billion in personal income tax relief over 200809 and the next five fiscal years that will benefit all Canadian taxpayers , including doubling the tax relief provided by the Working Income Tax Benefit to make work more financially attractive for low - income Canadians .
 Action to Stimulate Housing Construction .
Providing $ 7.8 billion to build quality housing , to stimulate construction and enhance energy efficiency .
Measures include a renovation tax credit providing up to $ 1,350 to an estimated 4.6 million Canadian families ; funding for energy retrofits ; investments in social housing to support low - income Canadians , including seniors , persons with disabilities and Aboriginal Canadians ; as well as low - cost loans to municipalities for housing - related infrastructure .
67
 Immediate Action to Build Infrastructure .
Accelerating and expanding recent historic investments in infrastructure with almost $ 12 billion in new infrastructure funding over two years for the construction and repair of roads , bridges , small craft harbours , broadband internet access , electronic health records , laboratories and border crossings across the country .
This will support economic growth and employment this year and next , while also bolstering Canadas long - run productive capacity .
 Action to Support Businesses and Communities .
Addressing short - term economic challenges facing sectors , regions and communities as a result of the global economic crisis and helping sectors position themselves for long - term competitiveness .
The Governments Economic Action Plan is based on three guiding principles that stimulus should be timely , targeted , and temporary to :  Support the economy when it is most needed .
 Support Canadian families and sectors most affected .

Ensure maximum impact for Canadian jobs and output .
 Protect Canadas fiscal position by targeting new spending in the next two years .
Budget 2009 will provide almost $ 40 billion in support of the Canadian economy over the next two years .
In total , these measures are equivalent to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Including incremental funds from other orders of government , Budget 2009 will provide almost $ 30 billion , or 1.9 per cent of GDP , in support of the Canadian economy in 2009 alone .
Over the next two years , the Economic Action Plan will invest over $ 50 billion , or 3.2 per cent of GDP ( Table 3.1 ) .

These cost estimates reflect projected cash expenditures over the next two years .
The budgetary impact is somewhat smaller because some of these expenditures relate to construction and renovation costs of federal assets ( for which only depreciation is recorded on a budgetary basis ) and loans to third parties ( where there is a budgetary impact only in the event that there is a risk of loss ) .
The Economic Action Plan builds on tax relief provided in the October 30 , 2007 Economic Statement , delivered just before the U.S. economy entered recession .
At that time , the Government stated :  Given this global economic uncertainty , now is the time to act ... to make broad - based tax reductions that will strengthen our economy , stimulate investment and create more and better jobs . 
These tax reductions will continue to support growth and job creation .
As described in Annex 1 , measures in this budget will create or maintain 190,000 jobs .
When combined with the actions set out in the October 2007 Economic Statement over 250,000 jobs will be created or maintained by the end of 2010 .

Fulfilling Canadas G20 Commitment
The response to the global economic crisis will only succeed if governments work cooperatively and in a coordinated manner .
In implementing this stimulus plan , Canada is joining other nations in taking significant steps to offset the impacts of the global economic downturn ( Table 3.2 ) .
The Governments actions in this budget fulfill Canadas commitments at the recent G20 leaders  summit to provide timely stimulus to domestic demand , while maintaining long - run fiscal sustainability .

Sources : Government releases ; analyst estimates .
Comparing the size of fiscal stimulus measures across countries is difficult .
In Canadas case , the estimate consists of the measures announced in this budget , including the expected contribution of provincial governments .
The estimate does not include the impact of the permanent tax reductions announced in the 2007 Economic Statement and taking effect in 2008 and 2009 .
In contrast , the estimate for the U.S. stimulus package includes tax reductions that offset the expiration of temporary tax cuts in 2008 .
These tax reductions account for about one - third of the proposed U.S. package .
This means that in economic terms the stimulus package proposed in this budget is about equal to that under discussion in the United States .
70
As well as contributing to global efforts to provide economic stimulus , Canada will also do its part to implement global agreements that strengthen the governance and legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , which are key international institutions that promote global growth and stability .
Improving Long - Term Growth Prospects
In addition to the positive short - run support to the economy , the Governments Economic Action Plan and other measures in this budget contribute to achieving objectives set out in Canadas long - term economic plan , Advantage Canada .
Specifically , Budget 2009 will ensure that Canada develops strategic economic advantages to make the country more competitive and help promote long - run growth by :  Accelerating and expanding planned infrastructure spending so that Canada establishes an infrastructure advantage sooner .

Ensuring that Canada maintains a knowledge advantage by offering substantial additional support for skills and training programs , plus significant investments in university and college research infrastructure .
 Strengthening Canadas tax advantage with permanent personal income tax reductions , as well as tax reductions aimed at stimulating business investment .
 Giving Canada an entrepreneurial advantage with the introduction of a Canadian securities regulator as well as reforms to our competition and investment laws .
 Preserving Canadas fiscal advantage by focusing spending measures in two years to allow the budget to improve rapidly over the medium - term , which means our country will emerge from this global recession in a much stronger fiscal position than other industrialized countries .
71
Stimulus Accountability Framework
The Government plans to move forward aggressively to implement these measures , appropriately balancing effective stewardship and governance of taxpayer dollars with speed of implementation .
To expedite implementation of measures in this budget , the Government will seek Parliamentary authority to make payments totalling close to $ 4 billion under the Budget Implementation Act .
The Government is also tabling a Notice of Ways and Means Motion to seek Parliamentary approval to implement the tax reductions proposed in the budget .
In addition , the Government will adjust the Main Estimates for 2009  10 to ensure that new funding flows quickly .
The measures proposed in this budget are of sufficient breadth and magnitude to have a significant impact on the economy in the near term .
Consistent with the focus on stimulus , in cases where time - limited spending does not evolve as set out in this budget , amounts will lapse and will not be carried forward beyond 2010  11 .
The Government is expecting all partners in this stimulus plan to act with urgency and will reinforce this with a strong , consistent , use it or lose it theme .
Over the spring and summer of 2009 , the Governments focus will be on implementing the measures set out above .
The Government will provide an initial report on progress this summer , and responsible ministers will provide an update to Parliament the first week following the summer recess .
The Government will reassess and , if necessary , reallocate funding in the 2009 Economic and Fiscal Update .

Introduction
The turmoil in global financial markets has revealed serious weaknesses in the international financial system .
It has also clearly demonstrated how essential strong financial institutions , capital markets , and financial sector regulation are to economic growth and prosperity .
Canada has shown exceptional resilience through the deepening crisis .
Our financial system is better equipped to cope with the challenging global financial climate than those of many other nations .
Nevertheless , Canada is not immune to this global crisis and Government action has been required in a number of areas to support financial sector stability .
A notable example was the decision taken by the federal government , in conjunction with three provincial governments , to support the restructuring plan for non -bank asset - backed commercial paper .
This action enhanced financial stability and the health of Canadas capital markets in challenging times .
Dislocations in global credit markets have raised wholesale borrowing costs for Canadian financial institutions and have sharply reduced the liquidity of private sector financial assets .
Parts of Canadas credit markets have ceased to function well , and there has been a significant re-pricing of risk in financial assets , increasing the cost to business borrowers .
Further , policy actions taken in other countries to support their financial institutions risk putting Canadian institutions at a competitive disadvantage .
Tighter credit conditions are now rippling into the real economy .
If the Government did not take further action , this could deepen the economic downturn in Canada .
77
Ensuring Canadians Access to Financing 
The Extraordinary Financing Framework
The Government has taken a number of significant and effective measures to mitigate the impact of the global credit crunch on Canadian financial institutions so that they can continue to provide Canadian consumers and businesses with access to financing .
The Government is taking further action to strengthen the capacity of Canadian financial institutions to expand credit and to respond to gaps in credit markets .
It is providing up to $ 200 billion in existing and new measures to support the extension of financing to Canadians and Canadian businesses during the current extraordinary period .
Under the Extraordinary Financing Framework ( EFF ) , action will be taken when it is necessary to :  Correct market failures in segments of the credit markets .
 Mitigate systemic risks .

Prevent possible competitive disadvantage to Canadian firms as a result of policy decisions taken by foreign governments .
Interventions under the EFF will aim to :  Provide financing on a commercial basis whenever possible .

Protect the taxpayer by controlling risk .
 Encourage partnership with the private sector .
 Restore confidence and encourage private sector lending .
To help manage the EFF , the Government will form the Advisory Committee on Financing .
This committee will include users and suppliers of financing , along with other experts .
The committee will advise on financing conditions and the design , scope and scale of initiatives under the EFF .
Together with the rest of the Governments comprehensive Economic Action Plan , the EFF will provide a solid foundation for economic recovery .
78
The EFF is expected to generate a positive return for the Government overall and therefore has no expected fiscal cost .
The Government will undertake additional borrowing to make the EFF possible ; this will increase the amount of Government of Canada debt sold to financial markets ( Annex 4 ) .
As this debt will be matched with sound assets , the EFF will not lead to any increase in the federal debt ( accumulated deficit ) .
Extraordinary Financing Framework 
The Government will purchase $ 50 billion of insured mortgage pools in the first half of 2009 10 under the Insured Mortgage Purchase Program ( IMPP ) , in addition to the $ 75 billion of purchases already authorized , increasing the total size of the program to $ 125 billion .
This will provide long - term stable funding to lenders and help them continue lending to Canadian consumers and businesses .

The Government will enhance the resources and scope of action available to the financial Crown corporations and will provide $ 13 billion in incremental financing .
This will allow Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada to extend additional financing to Canadian businesses in the current extraordinary circumstances , and allow the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to support low - cost loans to municipalities . 
At least $ 5 billion of this incremental financing will be delivered through enhanced cooperation between these financial Crown corporations and private sector financial institutions under the new Business Credit Availability Program . 
To further help small businesses access financing , the Government will increase the maximum eligible loan amount under the Canada Small Business Financing Program for loans made after March 31 , 2009 .
These changes could increase lending under the program by some $ 300 million per year .

The Government will allocate up to $ 12 billion to a new Canadian Secured Credit Facility to purchase term asset - backed securities backed by loans and leases on vehicles and equipment .
This new facility will help consumers and businesses access financing for these products .

The Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility ( CLAF ) , announced in November 2008 , will allow Canadas deposit - taking financial institutions to access competitive global credit markets by providing a guarantee on their term debt similar to those offered to banks in other countries .
The Government will extend the period for issuing guaranteed instruments under the CLAF from April 30 , 2009 to December 31 , 2009 .
79
Extraordinary Financing Framework ( contd ) 
To ensure that life insurers are not put at a competitive disadvantage relative to foreign insurers that benefit from guarantee programs provided by their home governments , the Government will create the Canadian Life Insurers Assurance Facility , modelled on the CLAF .

In Budget 2008 , the Government modernized the authorities of the Bank of Canada to support the stability of the financial system , and the Bank has used this modernized framework to increase its provision of extraordinary liquidity through a number of facilities .
The Bank of Canadas provision of liquidity peaked at $ 41 billion in December , and currently stands at $ 33 billion . 
In the fall of 2008 , the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation launched a new quarterly 10 - year Canada Mortgage Bond maturity .
Over the year , the new maturity is expected to raise up to $ 10 billion in supplementary funding for financial institutions .
Extension of the Insured Mortgage Purchase Program The Government will extend the Insured Mortgage Purchase Program ( IMPP ) by authorizing the purchase of up to an additional $ 50 billion in insured mortgages in the first half of 2009 10 .
This is in addition to the $ 75 billion to be purchased in 200809 announced earlier .
Extending and enhancing this successful program will reassure lenders that stable long - term financing will continue to be available , helping them to continue lending to Canadian consumers and businesses .
As the mortgages that will be purchased already carry government backing , they represent no additional risk to the taxpayer .
The competitive auction process used to purchase the mortgages is also designed to protect taxpayers by ensuring that the rate of return on the purchased mortgages exceeds the Governments cost of borrowing .
As a result , the IMPP program will continue to earn a positive financial return for the Government while at the same time filling a key gap in financing markets .
The program has facilitated a reduction in prime and mortgage rates since its introduction .
New Flexibilities and Resources for Financial Crown Corporations
An increasing number of creditworthy Canadian businesses are experiencing difficulty in obtaining adequate access to financing either because their credit limit has been reduced or their traditional sources of financing are no longer available .
80
The Government will therefore enhance the resources and scope of action available to Export Development Canada ( EDC ) and the Business Development Bank of Canada ( BDC ) so that they can extend additional financing to Canadian businesses in the current extraordinary circumstances .
EDC and BDC are financial Crown corporations whose mandates are to assist Canadian businesses through all phases of the economic cycle .
BDC focuses on small and medium - sized businesses whose financial needs exceed the parameters of conventional financing .
EDC provides trade finance and risk - management services to Canadian exporters and investors .
The Government will increase the authorized capital limits of EDC and BDC by $ 1.5 billion each , and increase their associated borrowing limits as necessary .
The Government will also increase EDCs contingent liability limit to $ 45 billion to enable EDC to grow and enhance its guarantee and insurance programs , and increase the Canada Account limit from $ 13 billion to $ 20 billion .
These actions follow on the additional $ 350 million in capital committed to both EDC and BDC in the November 2008 Economic and Fiscal Statement .
As it is very important to be able to bring this additional financing to market quickly , the Government will enable EDC to support financing in the domestic market , including in the area of accounts receivable insurance , for a temporary period .
This measure will allow EDC to fill gaps and complement the activities of financial institutions and insurance providers in the domestic market .
EDC and BDC will be working closely to ensure that their activities are complementary .
Business Credit Availability Program
One way in which BDC and EDC will make use of these additional flexibilities and resources is the new Business Credit Availability Program ( BCAP ) .
This program will improve access to financing for Canadian businesses during this period of economic uncertainty through enhanced cooperation between private sector financial institutions and the financial Crown corporations .
Through this program , EDC and BDC will provide at least $ 5 billion in additional loans and other forms of credit support and enhancement at market rates to businesses with viable business models whose access to financing would otherwise be restricted .
By working in close cooperation with private sector financial institutions , this program will fill gaps in market access and lever additional lending by private sector institutions where joint participation facilitates private action .
81
Participating private sector lenders will commit to :  Working with the financial Crown corporations to find solutions for creditworthy business clients who would otherwise have insufficient access to credit .

Ensuring that the extension of credit by financial Crown corporations is incremental for Canadian businesses and does not displace or substitute for private credit in aggregate .
The Government will monitor the program with participating lenders to ensure it is meeting its objectives .
How the availability of financing is supported under the EFF A lobster fisherman in PEI supplies many high - end restaurants along the Eastern seaboard .
Due to the U.S. economic downturn , sales are slumping and some customers are becoming delinquent in their payments .
As a result , the fisherman is having to rely more on his working capital line of credit with his local bank to finance inventories and ongoing operations .
The fisherman recently sought an increase in his credit line to carry him over to the new season .
The bank notified him that although he remained a valued client and was current in his payments , it could not accommodate an increase to his line of credit due to competing pressures for limited financial resources .
Through the BCAP , however , the bank will be able to get support from a financial Crown corporation to allow the fishermans financing needs to be met on commercial terms .
Other Financial Crown Initiatives
The additional $ 350 million in capital committed to each of EDC and BDC in the November 2008 Economic Statement taken together will support about $ 3 billion in increased credit granting capacity that the financial Crown corporations will make available to businesses affected by the financial crisis .
In addition , the Government has increased the provision of financing in the economy by making available $ 2 billion in low - cost loans to municipalities through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation .
The Government , through EDC , has contributed almost $ 3 billion in short - term loans to support the automotive industry in Canada . 82
Total additional credit provision by the financial Crown corporations under the Extraordinary Financing Framework is therefore about $ 13 billion .
Canada Small Business Financing Program
The Government will increase the maximum eligible loan amount a small business can access under the Canada Small Business Financing Program for loans made after March 31 , 2009 .
The current limit , which has not changed in the past 15 years , will be raised from $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 and to $ 500,000 for loans made for acquiring real property .
Under the program , the Government guarantees 85 - per-cent of loans made by eligible institutions to qualifying businesses .
Currently , institutions with a portfolio of eligible loans above $ 500,000 can claim reimbursement on losses of up to 10 per cent of the value of their portfolio .
Budget 2009 increases this limit to 12 per cent for loans made after March 31 , 2009 in order to encourage increased lending to small business .
In addition , regulatory amendments will reduce the programs associated paperwork burden .
These changes are expected to result in more than $ 300 million in additional lending .
Canadian Secured Credit Facility
As noted above , the disruption in financial markets has created a shortage of available financing in some areas .
Chief among these is financing for vehicles and equipment for consumers and businesses , large and small .
The Government will create the Canadian Secured Credit Facility , with an allocation of up to $ 12 billion , to purchase term asset - backed securities ( ABS ) backed by loans and leases on vehicles and equipment .
The facility will be run under high standards for transparency and credit enhancement to protect the taxpayer .
This facility will be priced on commercial terms , and will therefore be expected to generate a positive return for the Government .
Federally regulated financial institutions are eligible to sell into the facility and provincially regulated financial institutions may be eligible on the approval of the Minister of Finance .
Other firms interested in the facility must work with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to establish a plan to become subject to federal regulation .
The Government will consult market participants on the potential merits of changing the legislative and regulatory regime governing leasing activities by federally regulated financial institutions .
83
Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility and Canadian Life Insurers Assurance Facility The Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility ( CLAF ) , announced in November 2008 , will allow Canadas deposit - taking financial institutions to access competitive global credit markets by providing a guarantee on their term debt similar to those offered to banks in other countries .
To further support the sector , the Government is announcing its intention to extend the deadline for issuing guaranteed instruments under the CLAF from April 30 , 2009 to December 31 , 2009 .
To ensure that life insurers , who access credit and compete for business at a global level , are not put at a competitive disadvantage relative to foreign insurers that benefit from guarantee programs provided by their home governments , the Government will create the Canadian Life Insurers Assurance Facility ( CLIAF ) .
The CLIAF will provide insurance on the wholesale term borrowing of federally regulated life insurance companies .
The facility will be modelled on the Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility .
The CLIAF will also be made available to provincially regulated life insurers on the same commercial terms as other eligible institutions on the approval of the Minister of Finance and with an indemnity from the relevant provincial government .
Contributing Measures
The Bank of Canada has contributed importantly to improving access to financing through supporting the liquidity of the financial system .
In Budget 2008 , the Government modernized the authorities of the Bank of Canada to support the stability of the financial system .
The Bank has used this modernized framework to increase its provision of extraordinary liquidity through a number of facilities .
The Bank of Canadas provision of liquidity reached as high as $ 41 billion in December 2008 .
The Bank of Canada stands ready to provide extraordinary liquidity as required to support the financial system .
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation maintains the Canada Mortgage Bond ( CMB ) program , whose overall objective is to improve access to lower cost mortgages for Canadians and enhance liquidity in the mortgage market .
During the financial market turmoil , the program has been providing an important and growing source of funds for f

How Universal Health Care Changes Everything
With one fell stroke , giving Americans universal access to health care will undermine some of the deepest and most persi
Mass demonstrations in France against the Israeli assault on Gaza
By Senthooran Ravee , Stephane Hugues and Antoine Lerougetel
12 January 2009
At the Place de la Bastille
The revulsion felt worldwide against the indiscriminate massacre of the people of Gaza by Israel was expressed in France by mass demonstrations Saturday in 90 cities and towns .
At a conservative police estimate of 123,000 ( 30,000 in Paris and 93,000 in the rest of France ) , they far surpassed the already large mobilisations of January 3 , when 21,000 demonstrated in Paris .
Organisers claimed over 100,000 in the capital January 10 .
News agencies spoke of “ a human tide . ”
A force of 3,800 police officers was on duty to prevent a repetition of incidents after the January 3 demonstration .
Organised by the National Collective for a Just and Enduring Peace between Palestinians and Israelis , the protests were supported by the NPA ( the New Anti-capitalist Party of Olivier Besancenot ) , the Communist Party , the Independent Workers ’ Party ( formerly the Workers Party of Pierre Lambert ) and the Greens , as well as by the CGT ( General Confederation of Labour ) , the FSU teachers union , the UNEF students union and Palestinian , Arab and Muslim organisations .
Banner in background reads , " Israel terrorist - Europe accomplice "
All these organisations put forward a policy of pressurizing French , European and US imperialism to intervene and halt the massacre and propose nationalist , two - state solutions to the Palestinian tragedy .
Marie - George Buffet of the Communist Party , marching at the head of the Paris demonstration , told the press , “ The European Union must be told : ‘ You have the means to stop this war , to intervene in the UN for the setting up of an international protection force and for political discussions to start again . ”
Riot police and gendarmerie were on every side street with body armour and lorries with grills attached for pushing the crowd .
There were police at every Metro station entrance in constant radio contact , probably with orders to close the Metro entrances in case of a confrontation with youth .
Some of the riot cops in body armour were videotaping the protest march .
The march started off with only the hardcore members and supporters from the different parties and organizations , but then from about 3.45 pm there was a surge of people that filled the whole street .
There were many youth from the working class suburbs and whole families including babies and the elderly .
Some youth burned American and Israeli flags when they got close to the beginning of the march .
Many immigrant and French workers came independently of the organisers to express their bitter anger at Sarkozy ’s support for Israel .
Young people were in the majority and there was a strong presence of immigrant girls and women .
Banner reads , " Palestinian resistance "
Near the Place de la Bastille , some protesters sat down and sang songs in sympathy with the Palestinian people .
A man climbed onto the Bastille fountain and brandished a banner proclaiming , “ Arab governments , enough cowardice , stop collaborating ! ”
One speaker shouted : “ This place is the symbol of the French Revolution , it gave us justice and equality and fraternity .
In this historical place , we demand the same for the Palestinian people . ”
Other banners proclaimed “ Israel murderer , Sarkozy complicit , ” “ Rama Yade [ the French minister for human rights ] : where are Gaza ’s human rights ? , ” “ Bush ―Olmert murderers , Obama ―Sarkozy accomplices ! , ” “ Palestinians , Afghans , Iraqis , immigrants : the same enemy , the same fight , ” “ The enemy of the Palestinians is in our country : he ’s Bush ’s friend Monsieur Sarkozy ! ”
Women protestors brought baby dolls with the words , “ Israel kills the children of Gaza ” printed on them .
Referring to the Warsaw Ghetto a placard read , “ Warsaw , Gaza the same massacre , the same executioners ” and “ Stop the Holocaust in Gaza . ”
Near the Opera Bastille a woman demonstrator stood up on its steps holding a homemade placard inscribed with red letters :
“ The day will come when you will have to pay for your war crimes . ”
Protestors brought the photos of young victims of the Israeli bombardment .
The World Socialist Web Site interviewed people on the Paris demonstration .
Djamel
Djamel , 26 , a student said , “ People in my neighbourhood are saying we must demonstrate , cry out , tell them to stop .
It ’s a small country and nobody ’s there to save them .
All states must intervene and set up a force to stop Israel .
Sarkozy thinks that because there are a lot of Muslims in France it would be good to intervene to give France a good image . ”
Ahmed
Ahmed , 56 , said , “ The Israelis have a free hand to do what they want .
As long as this problem goes on , we will be heading for catastrophe , not only in the region , but in the whole world .
Sarkozy is playing politics .
He ’s blowing hot and cold .
Long live peace ….
For that what ’s needed is for the Americans to want it , but they do n’t . ”
Zouere
Zouere , 21 , a student said , “ It ’s wrong to kill innocent people who are already destitute .
We must try to send aid , medicine .
We know what Sarkozy does , he mainly just talks .
He just makes promises . ”
Julien
Julien , 25 , a postgraduate student said , “ I ’m afraid Obama wo n’t be any different from Bush , and Europe is the same .
The UN should be the only armed force there .
What is needed is the political merger of Israel and Palestine .
It ’s a long way off but they must go in that direction . ”
Reda and Kamel
Reda , 32 , a social worker and Kamel , 35 , an architect , had handed out 5,000 leaflets listing the companies which finance Israel and calling for them to be boycotted .
Reda said , “ Apart from my Arab origins … I would be against what is happening in Gaza .
Kamel said , “ You do n’t know where you are with Sarkozy .
Indirectly he supports Israel , but he goes to see the Arabs , but the bad Arabs , those who support Israel , such as the Syrian president .
We are witnessing a genocide . ”
Noureddine
Noureddine , 58 , an oil expert , said , “ I went to Palestine from 1971 to 1973 … What is happening was elaborated with the assistance of French policy ―let ’s be clear , not that of the French people ―to the advantage of Israel .
Sarkozy ’s intervention and that of the Egyptian president are identical .
They ’re working for Israel .
Sarkozy is defending French interests , the big companies like Alsthom ―what he was elected to do .
Obama has kept quiet about Gaza because there are American interests which he ca n’t touch at the moment . ”
The horse tranquilliser ketamine is increasingly replacing cocaine as the substance of choice among Britain 's recreational drug users , according to charities and experts .
Use of the drug , known as " Special K " or " Raver 's Smack " , was found to be on the rise in nine out of 20 areas surveyed by the charity DrugScope .
The British Crime Survey shows that use of the drug last year increased nationally by 10 per cent on 2006 - 07 .
Once seen as a drug exclusively for the rave and dance scene , its popularity is now growing among Britain 's middle - class users due to its price – a gram of ketamine costs £ 20 , half as much as the same amount of cocaine – and the fact that it is seen as a " safe " and " clean " drug .
However , a survey carried out by Professor David Nutt , the chairman of the Government 's drug advisory panel , ranks the class C drug as the sixth most dangerous illegal drug available – more harmful than Ecstasy and cannabis .
The mistaken belief that the substance is risk - free is encouraging more young people to try ketamine and to take it in increasingly higher doses .
But experts say that it can cause heart or lung failure and point to the fact that it has been linked to 23 deaths between 1993 and 2006 .
In 2006 it was classified as a class C drug .
Martin Barnes , chief executive of DrugScope , said : " There is worrying evidence that people are experimenting with larger amounts or are even injecting the drug .
Evidence of young people using ketamine is a particular concern , especially as many users may underestimate the risks involved . "
The popularity of the drug , which can be snorted , swallowed , injected and even smoked , has grown from an estimated 60,000 users between 1998 and 2000 to about 113,000 in 2008 .
At last year 's Glastonbury festival , police seized double the amount of ketamine than they did at the 2007 event .
The DrugScope survey shows that use of drug is increasing in Portsmouth , London , Bristol , Ipswich , Birmingham , Nottingham , Sheffield , Blackpool and Newcastle .
And police forces in many of these areas say they are aware of the increased prevalence of the drug .
Its popularity is illustrated on the internet , with some users posting videos of themselves , high on the substance , on the video - sharing website YouTube .
Mr Barnes added : " It is becoming very popular and it's a drug that a lot of people are talking about .
The very fact that the price is falling shows how popular it is becoming .
Three years ago , when we started this study , it was selling for about £ 30 a gram , now it is £ 20 . "
He added : " The fall in price does suggest that the people who are selling the stuff have no problems getting hold of it . "
What is ketamine ?
Originally used to treat injured soldiers in Vietnam , ketamine is most commonly used now as a horse tranquilliser .
It has also been experimented with to treat depression and alcohol and heroin addiction .
It was classified as an illegal drug in 2006 by the UK Government .
It is usually sold in powder or liquid form for about £ 20 per gram .
Unlike cocaine and heroin , it is not physically addictive , but , like cannabis and Ecstasy , it is psychologically addictive .
User 's view : ' You forget about your normal life '
David first tried ketamine as a 20 - year - old student at university in London .
Now a 27 - year - old marketing executive , living in Shoreditch , east London , he still takes the drug once a month .
" I see it as a fun , sociable drug , " he said .
" I do it at house parties or if I 'm having a big night out .
I used to do cocaine , but I suppose I gradually replaced coke with ket .
Coke is much more expensive and it generally makes everyone very loud and aggressive .
Ket is different .
It costs less and you use it in smaller quantities so it lasts a lot longer .
The feeling you get is different too .
It makes you feel anaesthetised to your worries .
You forget about your normal life and everything is euphoric .
Sometimes I 've had bad trips , but I 've never felt angry when on ketamine .
I think it is a lot safer too .
I 've read it can have long - term effects on your health , but it does n't seem as dangerous as cocaine .
When on coke I used to feel my heart pounding and it did n't feel right .
The other reason I changed is because of the classification .
I 've got a proper job and a career and I do n't want to lose that .
Ketamine is a class C drug so if I get caught I 'm probably only going to get a slap on the wrist . "

Nine people died and scores were injured yesterday when a Turkish airliner crashed into a field near Schiphol airport in Amsterdam .
The Boeing 737-800 plunged to the ground seconds before it was due to land from Istanbul .
It broke into three sections in the soft earth .
There was no explosion or fire and dozens of passengers scrambled unhurt from the wreckage .
Nine people were killed during the crash – mostly in the tail section and cockpit – and 49 were injured , 25 seriously .
Relatives waiting for the arriving passengers told how they had received mobile phone calls from loved ones trapped injured in the wreckage .
One man said he had received a call from his anguished daughter screaming that both her legs were broken .

There were reports in the Dutch media that Turkish Airlines flight TK 1951 , carrying 127 passengers and seven crew , had run out of fuel and lost power just before it reached the runway of Europe 's fifth busiest airport .
Investigators refused to comment last night .
Rather like the accident in the Hudson River in New York earlier this month , the pilots appear to have been attempting to make a controlled crash landing .
Witness accounts , from passengers and motorists on a nearby motorway , suggested the plane had spun out of control at the last moment and hit the ground tail - first .
Dutch media said the Schiphol control heard the pilot say : " It 's very serious but we will try to land now . "
One witness report said that the aircraft seemed to be struggling to avoid crashing on to the busy motorway .
A crash investigator said last night that three bodies were still in the plane 's cockpit , believed to be those of the two pilots and an apprentice pilot .
Investigators said the relatively low death toll may partly have been due to the pilots ' efforts to make an emergency landing .
They also pointed out that the six - year - old aircraft had both its engines torn off and had come to rest in damp , newly - ploughed earth two miles short of the runway .
This , and improved safety standards for new aircraft may help to explain why it failed to explode or catch fire , they said .
The Turkish Transport Minister , Binali Yildirim , said it was " a miracle " so many people had survived .
" The fact that the plane landed on a soft surface and there was no fire helped keep the number of fatalities low , " he said .
Anguish and frustration was growing last night among relatives who had been waiting for the plane to arrive .
They complained that they had originally been told that there was only one person killed .
They protested that officials had been slow to give out the names of the dead and injured .
" I just want to know if my nephew is still alive , " said Yabhab Yabib , who had been taken with other friends and relatives to a nearby sports centre .
The Anatolia agency said there were 72 Turks and 32 Dutch people on board but the nationality of other passengers was not immediately known .
The crash happened in light mist but good visibility , around 10.30 am local time .
The aircraft came to rest with its back broken and its tail section sliced away and turned towards the nose .
Margo de Witt , who was driving along the A6 motorway near the crash scene , told Dutch TV : " I glanced left to check for other cars and suddenly saw this plane going down with ... its tail sticking down .
I saw one of the engines drop out and a huge amount of fumes but luckily no flames . "
Mustapha Bahcecioglu , a passenger who emerged unscathed , said : " I was asleep in the plane and woke up because of the plane shaking so hard .
We were out of balance and the pilot tried to straighten it up .
But it did n't work and 10 seconds later we hit the ground . "
" We came down with a big bang and screams broke out .
We all got out through the exit doors and tried to help all the children out of the plane but there were people at the back we could not reach .
The ambulances came very quickly .
I saw several dead bodies and I saw very many people injured , very many . "
Gideon Evers , spokesman for the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations , rejected suggestions that the crash may have been caused by shortage of fuel .
Regulations required all commercial flights to carry ample reserves , he said .
" Certainly it appears to be an unusual circumstance but as always the sensible course of action is to wait for the results of the investigation , " he said .
Turkish Airlines had a poor safety record in the 1970s , when 608 lives were lost in accidents involving its aircraft in the space of two years , but its performance has improved dramatically in recent times .
Yesterday 's crash was the airline 's second fatal accident this decade .

The worst effects will be in the regions where the poorest people already live -- the tropics and subtropics , the researchers wrote in the journal Science .
But temperate regions will see very warm average temperatures , they added .
“ In temperate regions , the hottest seasons on record will represent the future norm in many locations , ” David Battisti , a University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor , and Rosamond Naylor , director of Food Security and the Environment at California ’s Stanford University , wrote in their report .
The two combined direct observations with data from 23 global climate models .
They found a greater than a 90 percent probability that by 2100 , growing - season low temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will be higher than the highest current temperatures .
“ We are taking the worst of what we ’ve seen historically and saying that in the future it is going to be a lot worse unless there is some kind of adaptation , ” Naylor said .
There have been some recent tastes of what is to come , such as a heat wave that struck Europe in summer 2003 and resulted in deaths and reduced food production , they said .
Record temperatures hurt key crops including maize and fruit and accelerated crop ripening by 10 to 20 days .
Livestock were stressed , the soil was dryer and more water was used in agriculture , they said .
Italy experienced a record drop in maize yields of 36 percent from a year earlier , and in France maize and fodder production fell by 30 percent , fruit harvests declined by 25 percent and wheat harvests declined by 21 percent , they wrote .
“ I think what startled me the most is that when we looked at our historic examples there were ways to address the problem within a given year .
People could always turn somewhere else to find food , ” Naylor said .
“ But in the future there ’s not going to be any place to turn unless we rethink our food supplies . ”
Battisti said 3 billion people live in the areas that will be worst affected .
The researchers urged investment in development of crop varieties that can withstand higher heat .
“ You are talking about hundreds of millions of additional people looking for food because they wo n’t be able to find it where they find it now , ” he said .
“ The stresses on global food production from temperature alone are going to be huge , and that does n’t take into account water supplies stressed by the higher temperatures . ”

“ What can change the nature of a classic RPG ? ” Answer – a resolution - tweaking mod .
A couple of you have previously pointed out The Gibberlings Three ‘s marvellous Infinity Engine res hack in our comments , but though I cooed with interest and immediately saved it to my bookmarks ( three times , it appears ) , I ’ve not had a chance to take a look until now .
Yesterday , though , was Finally Replaying Planescape Torment day for me , and word of a resolution - raising tool that saved this incomparable tale of destiny , identity and tragedy from pixels - the - size - of - fists graphic - o - horror excited me enormously .
Turns out it ’s a thing of beauty .
It ’s a mod that ’s superficially a wholly aesthetic tweak , but in fact it changes the entire game to a fairly profound degree .
The standard compliment and criticism for Planescape is that it ’s essentially a novel hiding in games ’ clothing .
Mostly that ’s because of its wonderfully ridiculous slew of text , but partly it ’s because , on a technological level , it ’s an ugly game .
Bear with me before you get angry about that .
The blurry pixelisation is one thing , but the greater problem is how little of the world you see – just narrow , blocky slices of screen , each offering only the vaguest sense of where you were .
That ever - overflowing text box thus became the player ’s focus , and the lavish artwork underneath it so often overlooked .
Playing PST at 1680 ×1050 thanks to this mod – the pixels not stretched , but rather the game world expanded , a vast amount more of it now visible at any one time – I ’m constantly struck by how beautiful it is .
It seems less a thing of pixels now , and more like the vast painting it was created as .
Particularly , the cursed , sinister city of Sigil is no longer a collection of short , dingy alleyways and squat , disconnected buildings , but this grand expanse of gothic metropolis – bustling with NPC life , sprawling and darkly gorgeous .
I get the sense this is Planescape as it was intended to look .
It ’s a different game for it , and now I stop to stare at the world as much as I do the elegiac prose .
Unfortunately , the increased resolution does make said prose ( and much of the UI ) squinty - small , but I ’m more than happy to make do .
Oblivion , NWN2 , The Witcher – losers in the 2D vs 3D RPG war .
Give me this any day .
The Widescreen Mod ( something of a misnomer , as it can do full - frame tweakery too ) also works with both Baldur ’s Gates and Icewind Dales .
Changing the resolution seems like such a minor thing , but the degree to which it transforms these graphically - hamstrung games into sharp , presentable modernity is genuinely astonishing .

It 's been no secret that Ziff Davis has been looking to sell 1up.com and its associated video game publications for quite some time .
Rumors that the magazine publisher was shopping its video game publications around have been circulating for approximately two years ; at one time it was even reported that Dell would be acquiring 1up.com .
While that turned out to be false , Ziff Davis finally succeeded in unloading 1 up to Hearst - owned UGO Network , whereupon things took a definite turn for worse .
The sale , it was announced , would bring 1up.com , Mycheats.com , Gametab.com , and GameVideos.com under UGO 's control .
In the official announcement , UGO CEO J Moses made it sound like his company would n't actually be changing too much about 1 up .
" The acquisition of 1 up , with its authentic voice , tenured editorial personalities and bustling user community , allows us to expand our base of quality content and represents a major step forward in UGO 's mission to become the leader in the games space . "
The announcement also stated that 1 up would " stand beside UGO as a flagship brand . "
A few hours later , though , it was revealed that this was far from the truth , as Ziff Davis seemed intent on thoroughly gutting its online publications before it changed hands .
Even though Ziff Davis CEO Jason
Young claimed — via an internal e-mail sent to his employees shortly after the sale was announced — that " many of our employees will travel with this business and become part of the UGO team , " it seems that this was not to be .
Gamasutra received some inside information that , at roughly the same time , a large percentage of Ziff Davis ' Game Group suddenly found itself unemployed .
According to various reports , 30 members of the editorial , podcast , and video production staff was promptly told that it was fired .
The detailed list of those who are now jobless is rather staggering .
This is well beyond a corporate bloodbath , it 's a scorched - earth policy with only a few survivors .
Adding another nail to the coffin was the simultaneous announcement that Ziff Davis would be shutting down production on its popular Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine , which has been in production for nearly twenty years : this month 's issue will be its last .
" With demand for print continuing to decline amongst both advertisers and readers , " Young said in his e-mail , " and the content being produced by 1 up no longer available for use in the publication , it simply did not make sense for us to move forward with this business any longer . "
When asked about the massive layoffs , 1 up site director Sam Kennedy told MTV Multiplayer the answers lay with his former bosses .
" Honestly , questions like that have to go to Ziff Davis at this point , " said Kennedy .
" All I can say to that is UGO held onto as many people as they could to run the business going forward and [ kept ] a lot of all - star key players . "
To say this news is staggering is to put it lightly .
1 up has been one of the major players in the industry of video game journalism since it was launched in 2003 , and it managed to survive for quite some time in spite of the deaths of several excellent sibling magazines like GMR , Official U.S. Playstation Magazine , and Computer Gaming World .
Meanwhile , the fact that Ziff Davis is resorting to cost - cutting measures like these implies that things may be far worse at the magazine publisher than has been let known : while no one expected things to be pretty after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , it seems safe to say that no one saw this coming , either .
WASHINGTON  President Obama , seeking to broaden the appeal of his signature initiative , said Saturday that a proposed $ 825 billion package of spending programs and tax breaks was crucial not only to turn around the economy but also to rebuild the nation for a new era .
In his first weekly video address as president , Mr. Obama made the case that the package would help students go to college , protect workers from losing health care , lower energy bills and modernize schools , roads and utilities .
“ This is not just a short - term program to boost employment , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ It ’s one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education , health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century . ”
The speech was part of a developing campaign by the White House to build momentum behind the plan and propel it to passage by mid-February .
The White House released a report Saturday revealing details about the package , which would pay for a variety of projects , like laying 3,000 miles of transmission lines for a national electric grid , securing 90 major ports and guaranteeing health insurance for 8.5 million Americans in danger of losing coverage .
CNBC is reporting Three Big Banks Are Halting Foreclosures for Now .
Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said they had placed a moratorium on foreclosing on some home loans to give the government time to launch a $ 50 billion mortgage relief program .
The moratorium announcements come days after major bank chief executives committed to pausing mortgage foreclosures at a Congressional hearing .
As reported Thursday , Obama officials are working on a plan to spend $ 50 billion on foreclosure prevention and establish national standards for modifying home loans .
The program would include possible government subsidies for homeowners who qualify .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Tuesday announced a plan to stabilize the financial system .
One element of the plan is $ 50 billion of assistance to " prevent avoidable foreclosures " of middle - class homes occupied by their owners , according to a document Geithner released .
The Obama plan under consideration would seek to help homeowners before they fall into arrears on their loans .
Current programs only assist borrowers that are already delinquent .
Under the evolving plan , homes would undergo a standardized reappraisal and homeowners would face a uniform eligibility test , sources said .
In an interview , James Lockhart , the regulator that oversees government - controlled mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , told Reuters the industry was eager to have a standardized loan modification standard .
" I 've talked to all the major servicers — both the big bank ones and the big independent ones — and they are all ready to go , they 're chomping at the bit , '' Lockhart , the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , said .
" The other thing they 're asking for standardization . ''
Chomping At The Bit
As part of Apple 's plans to help trim the footprint of Mac OS X Snow Leopard , the new system will cease the customary installation of several gigabytes of printer drivers and instead load only the files necessary for existing devices , relying on Software Update to obtain new drivers in the future as needed .
Prepared for anything
Back in the late 80s , Apple began bundling PPD files for various PostScript printers with its System Software .
The files identified features specific to each model , making it simple for users to take full advantage of each model .
However , as the consumer market for printers expanded , expensive PostScript licensing was left behind for simpler and cheaper alternatives that relied on custom driver software unique to each printer manufacturer .
Microsoft began installing lots of third party printer drivers with the installation of Windows to make it simpler for users to install their printer without needing to obtain printer software themselves , a practice Apple also adopted .
However , as printer manufacturers have expanded their printer software offerings to differentiate their hardware with special software features such as ink management and other add on utilities , the size of driver software has expanded rapidly .
Additionally , printer drivers are being updated more frequently and new printer models are appearing quickly enough to make it hard for operating system releases to stay current .
Both Apple and Microsoft now support the ability of printer installation software to search for new or updated drivers online ; Leopard began handling updates for HP drivers in 2007 .
Just in time downloads
With the release of Snow Leopard this spring , Apple will put an end to the default installation of tons of drivers , according to people familiar with the latest test releases of the software .
Instead , it will only install a select subset of drivers , including support for any currently attached printers or those that had been installed on the same Mac under previous versions of Mac OS X .
Sources say the system will review devices attached via USB and will scan the network for any printers advertised as available via Bonjour in order to create a short list of drivers that need to be installed .
Any new printers that are attached after the installation of Snow Leopard will cause Software Update to check for drivers online .
This new policy will shave several unnecessary gigabytes from the Snow Leopard footprint , compounding the savings related to the new HFS + file compression for compacting read only files and the compression and / or removal of unnecessary NIB files that will result in a greatly reduced size of applications on the new system .
Skinny new software
A similar practice has been put into place in GarageBand 09 , which offers a series of free video instructions for learning how to play instruments .
Rather than installing all of the videos by default , the new app allows users to download just the lessons they want , saving considerable disk space .
The same policy could also be applied to foreign language localization files and fonts , which currently consume lots of disk space but are only used by relatively small portions of the Mac OS X user base .
Merkel : German cars need to ' go green ' to compete in market Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday January 11 , 2009
Print This Email This BERLIN ( AFP ) 
Germany 's renowned car industry must start producing cleaner , more innovative models if it hopes to remain competitive , Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview published Sunday .
Merkel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that the sector that invented the world 's first automobile more than a century ago must remain on the cutting edge by developing " green " models .
She said her government was willing to help by financing research that could be used in the development of more innovative cars and trucks but offered no details .
" Now Germany is in a new kind of competition to see whether its industry can produce the model of the 21st century , " Merkel said .
She said there would be fresh help for the ailing automobile industry in a new 50 - billion - euro ( 67 - billion - dollar ) stimulus package to be finalised this week , possibly in the form of car tax relief pegged to lower greenhouse gas emissions .
Berlin already came to the sector 's aid in November with the temporary suspension of new car taxes as part of a raft of economic recovery measures .
The automotive sector is Germany 's largest industry and biggest exporter with one out of seven German workers directly or indirectly employed by it .
But the global economic recession has delivered a crushing blow with giants such as Daimler and Volkswagen reporting a collapse in demand for their models .
The auto manufacturers federation VDA reported last week that 2008 was the worst year for Germany 's auto sector since the country unified in 1990 , with sales nosediving in November and December .

Jonathan Freedland makes three criticisms of " the liberal left " concerning protests against Israel , especially in connection with operation Cast Lead , the recent military operation in Gaza .
First , while " liberal voices " speak out against Israel 's war , they are silent about the attacks on British Jews that have occurred in the wake of that war .
Second , the liberal left either uses or tolerates rhetoric that equates Israel with Nazi Germany , the effect of which is to stoke the fire of anti-Jewish prejudice .
Third , liberals make an " implicit demand " on Jews to disassociate themselves from Israel .
These are serious allegations ; and coming from someone – himself a liberal British Jew – who has been outspoken in condemning Cast Lead , they deserve to be taken seriously .
I have no doubt , moreover , that there is some truth in each of the criticisms he makes .
And anyone who cares about human rights and social justice , whether in the Middle East or on the streets of Golders Green , should stop to evaluate these criticisms carefully .
But this is difficult to do , partly because the brushstroke – " the liberal left " ( or similar phrases ) – is so broad , and partly because he presents these criticisms as though they go hand in hand .
I think they need to be considered one by one .
In at least two cases , it transpires that matters are complicated .
The first claim might be the exception .
I am not sure how to assess the extent to which " progressive voices " have protested against the recent spate of attacks on Jews .
But I completely share Freedland 's insistence that such protest must be made , loudly and publicly , time and again .
It is totally unacceptable to scapegoat individual Jews – or Jewish institutions such as synagogues – on account of the actions of the State of Israel .
It is as simple as that .
Yet even here there is a small complication .
There has been " a curious silence " not on the liberal left but in the mainstream Jewish world about another source from which Jews are under attack .
I wrote about this recently when describing the abuse hurled at those of us who took part in a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on 11 January opposing a rally in support of Israel .
" The contempt and hatred for us , as Jews , was palpable .
But it did not come from fanatical jihadists or from fascists in the British National party ; it came from fellow Jews . "
Where are the Jewish community leaders , whether lay or religious , who condemn such behaviour , rather than repeatedly speaking and acting in ways that tend to reinforce it ?
In making the second claim , Freedland refers to " a commonplace image : the Jewish Star of David equated with the swastika " .
This is a mite misleading .
The equation is with the flag of the State of Israel , not with a Jewish symbol per se .
It is Israel , not the protesters , who have used a Jewish symbol to identify the state .
However , I share Freedland 's concern up to a point .
When Israel is equated , on the one hand , with Nazi Germany and , on the other hand , with the Jewish people , inevitably it suggests – whether or not this is intended – the equation of Jews with Nazis .
Since the genocide of the Jews was at the heart of the Nazi project , this is a particularly vicious equation to make .
I dare say it is mostly unintended by the groups that use or tolerate this image .
But , as the Jewish socialist Steve Cohen wrote in his study of antisemitism on the left : " Any group which claims to be against antisemitism should be ultra-vigilant in the imagery it evokes . "
That said , it is perfectly legitimate to make careful , measured comparisons .
Many Jews themselves do so .
In fact , it is precisely the fact of the Nazi Holocaust that has sensitised many of us to the horrors of ethnic nationalism , in Israel and elsewhere .
Freedland cannot mean that we should not draw upon this collective experience in order to keep us on our moral toes when others , such as Palestinians , suffer as a group from the power of a state .
Furthermore , not only do Israeli politicians often represent their state as acting on behalf of Jews everywhere , but also this false impression is reinforced by bodies around the world that claim to represent Jews collectively .
Thus , the 11 January rally in support of Israel was organised not by the Israeli embassy or the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland but by the Board of Deputies of British Jews , which calls itself " the voice of British Jewry " .
To adapt a sentence from Freedland : " Now what , do you imagine , is the effect of repeating , again and again , that Israel is the state of the Jews ? "
Finally , Freedland refers to the long history of " distinguishing between good and bad Jews " .
He says , in making the third of his criticisms , " Now the dividing line is affinity for Israel " .
I know just what he means .
I dare say that this has some application today .
But mostly , it applies within the Jewish mainstream rather than in the liberal left ; and it works the opposite way .
" Good Jews " are those who " love Israel " , " bad Jews " are ones who feel no affinity with the state or whose criticism fails a loyalty test .
Freedland should know : he has been regarded as a " bad Jew " himself – on account of his criticism of Israel .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson withdrew his name Sunday from consideration to be commerce secretary , citing a federal investigation into a company that has donated to his political organizations -- the first serious snag in Barack Obama 's transition efforts .
Mr. Richardson , a former presidential candidate and one of three Hispanics nominated to Mr. Obama 's cabinet , said he stepped aside " with great sorrow . "
In a statement , he said a " pending investigation of a company that has done business with New Mexico state government promises to extend for several weeks , or , perhaps , even months . "
The governor has said he is not guilty of any wrongdoing .
But a source close to him said there was too much uncertainty about the investigation to go before potentially hostile Republican senators in upcoming confirmation hearings .
A federal grand jury is investigating how CDR Financial Products of Beverly Hills , Calif. , won more than $ 1.5 million in work advising the state of New Mexico and its state bond operations after making contributions to two of Mr. Richardson 's political action committees .
The " pay to play " investigation seeks to determine whether the governor 's office had any role in the contracting decisions .
The focus of the probe is on fees paid to CDR by the New Mexico Finance Authority in 2004 -- soon after the firm donated $ 100,000 to Mr. Richardson 's political - action committees .
Much of that money went to his efforts to register minorities to vote , but some may also have covered expenses for the governor and his staff at the Democratic National Convention in Boston that summer , according to New Mexico and federal election financial - disclosure statements .
Barack Obama has now been president for 21 days , following an inauguration that was supposed to have pressed the reset button on America 's relations with the wider world and ushered in a new period of global cooperation against common threats .
Here 's what pressing reset has accomplished so far :

Since President Obama 's inauguration , Iran has launched a satellite into space and declared ( with an assist from Russia , which is providing the nuclear fuel ) that it would complete its long - delayed reactor at Bushehr later this ...
As countless photos from space can attest , Earth is round — the " Blue Marble , " as astronauts have affectionately dubbed it .
Appearances , however , can be deceiving .
Planet Earth is not , in fact , perfectly round .
This is not to say Earth is flat .
Well before Columbus sailed the ocean blue , Aristotle and other ancient Greek scholars proposed that Earth was round .
This was based on a number of observations , such as the fact that departing ships not only appeared smaller as they sailed away but also seemed to sink into the horizon , as one might expect if sailing across a ball says geographer Bill Carstensen of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg .
Isaac Newton first proposed that Earth was not perfectly round .
Instead , he suggested it was an oblate spheroid — a sphere that is squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator .
He was correct and , because of this bulge , the distance from Earth 's center to sea level is roughly 21 kilometers ( 13 miles ) greater at the equator than at the poles .
Instead of Earth being like a spinning top made of steel , explains geologist Vic Baker at the University of Arizona in Tucson it has " a bit of plasticity that allows the shape to deform very slightly .
The effect would be similar to spinning a bit of Silly Putty , though Earth 's plasticity is much , much less than that of the silicone plastic clay so familiar to children . "
Our globe , however , is not even a perfect oblate spheroid , because mass is distributed unevenly within the planet .
The greater a concentration of mass is , the stronger its gravitational pull , " creating bumps around the globe , " says geologist Joe Meert at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
Earth 's shape also changes over time due to a menagerie of other dynamic factors .
Mass shifts around inside the planet , altering those gravitational anomalies .
Mountains and valleys emerge and disappear due to plate tectonics .
Occasionally meteors crater the surface .
And the gravitational pull of the moon and sun not only cause ocean and atmospheric tides but earth tides as well .
In addition , the changing weight of the oceans and atmosphere can cause deformations of the crust " on the order of a centimeter or so , " notes geophysicist Richard Gross at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" There 's also postglacial rebound , with the crust and mantle that were depressed by the huge ice sheets that sat on the surface during the last ice age now rebounding upward on the order of a centimeter a year . "
Moreover , to even out Earth 's imbalanced distribution of mass and stabilize its spin , " the entire surface of the Earth will rotate and try to redistribute mass along the equator , a process called true polar wander , " Meert says .
To keep track of Earth 's shape , scientists now position thousands of Global Positioning System receivers on the ground that can detect changes in their elevation of a few millimeters , Gross says .
Another method , dubbed satellite laser ranging , fires visible - wavelength lasers from a few dozen ground stations at satellites .
Any changes detected in their orbits correspond to gravitational anomalies and thus mass distributions inside the planet .
Still another technique , very long baseline interferometry , has radio telescopes on the ground listen to extragalactic radio waves to detect changes in the positions of the ground stations .
It may not take much technology to understand that Earth is not perfectly round , but it takes quite a bit of effort and equipment to determine its true shape .
Whew !
Over the past week , I ’ve completely overhauled the Everett True archive in the Comic Supplement .
It was a gargantuan task , bordering on insanity , but it seemed the least we could do for a fellow who ’s been so good to us for so long .
I went through every paper I could find the strips in , from its debut in 1905 up to the month - long hiatus in 1909 , and pulled every comic in the best condition I could find .
This meant downloading and comparing thousands of images to select the five hundred that made it to the archive .
This task was compounded in difficulty by the haphazard publishing of early comic strips .
There were no firm publication dates or sequences ; editors would receive packages of strips to publish according to their own whims .
This meant that no cranny could remain unsearched , as some small paper from Muskogee might have a strip that was never published in any of the other scanned papers .
Search them I did , and I ’m pretty proud of the results .
There are some that are in poorer condition than I ’d like , but they were the best I could find , and there are n’t too many that are in really terrible condition .
We ’re posting a dozen favorites from each year on our Twitter feed , so if you ’re not over there , be sure to follow us and join in on the fun .
I ’ll also note that , after a week in the weeds , my eyes are a little crossed .
I think I ’ve done a good job at avoiding duplicates , but if you come across any strays , please comment here to let me know !
Note :
In part , this post is an answer to a query by Mark Hatlie .
While it is perilous for any historian to predict the future , we may well be headed for the Waterloo of Keynesianism ( both military and domestic ) and that is a good thing .
Crudely put , Keynesianism ( so named for the British economist John Maynard Keynes ) is the theory that government ’s can speed long - term recovery by running high deficts so as to stimulate aggregate demand or investment .
It is the entire basis of Obama ’s stimulus plan .
To some extent , Keynesian ideas were the basis of Bush ’s massive bailout and big spending policies , most especially his now forgotten “ stimulus checks .
” The popularity of the Keynesian theory is something a puzzle ( at least to me ) .
Few ideas more defy ordinary common sense .
Taken in today ’s context , it seems akin to telling an individual who has recklessly run up a hundred thousand dollar credit card debt to spend even more on fixing a driveway or garage ( infrastructure ) .
For some reason , such advice ( which would be considered utter lunacy when applied to individuals ) is widely accepted as the best method of economic recovery when taken by governments .
Probably no event is more commonly cited as a Keynesian spending success story than World War II .
Variants of this thesis can be found among across the political spectrum .
On the right , neocon Conrad Black argues that World War II “ had restored prosperity after the free market had failed . ”
On the left , Paul Krugman similarly writes :
“ There 's nothing magic about spending on tanks and bombs rather than roads and bridges .
The reason World War II worked more effectively than the WPA [ in terms of promoting economic growth ] as that it was * bigger .
*” While Krugman might prefer that this “ bigger ” spending be on roads and bridges , rather than bombs , this does not change the fact he still accepts the overall premise that spending on wars can be good for the economy .
If this is true , one wonders why he never praised Bush ’s bloated military budgets .
If anyone should have greater reason to call this theory into question , it is antiwar historians .
Fortunately , one has .
In a seminal article for the , Robert Higgs convincingly challenged the Keynesian theory of World War II as put forward by Krugman , Black and others .
While unemployment disappeared during the war , it was hardly a step forward .
Moving men and women from the unemployment lines to the killing fields of Anzio did not represent economic progress in any meaningful sense .
During the war , Americans at home suffered from rationing , shortages , more accidents on the job , longer hours , and many other measures of economic deprivation .
Moreover , as Higgs points out , “ real personal consumption declined .
So did real private investment .
From 1941 to 1943 real gross private domestic investment plunged by 64 percent ; during the four years of the war it never rose above 55 percent of its 1941 level ; only in 1946 did it reach a new high . ”
According to Higgs , genuine prosperity did not begin to return until the last months of 1945 and 1946 .
This prosperity occurred under a policy of reverse Keynesianism which included massive reductions in spending because of demoblization , rapid steps toward price decontrol , and scaled back deficit spending .
Higgs sums it up
In my view , Obama 's best hope to bring lasting recovery is to let the economy go through a short , but sharp , readjustment .
He needs to remove the malivestments , not perpetuate them .
Obama can facilitate this readjustment to a more sustainable level by cancelling the bailout , cutting spending , and pruning deficits .
Another worthy goal would be to dismantle the Federal Reserve which helped to create this mess through its easy credit policies .
Most of all , however , Obama should end our costly empire by closing down our overseas bases and bringing home the troops .
Only then , can we start to get our financial house in order and move towards genuine economic well being .
What is it with marketing people ?
Until recently I thought that us writers had the corner on being insane .
Having worked in both film and television , I can pretty much say that the writer is the most crazy person on set ( aside from some actors - but they 're of a different species altogether ) .
However , after taking a look at these ads , I 'm starting to wonder exactly how far advertising firms will go before they actually discover a deep - end to go off of .
I 'm gonna start off gentle .
But trust me ... this ride 's gonna get worse .
1. Hyundai
I was once relegated to the back seat of a convertible while my ( now ex - ) wife 's aunt 's dog rode shotgun .
That dog had a tongue akin to what you see above .
And the amount of drool that flapped out of that tongue , whipped through the wind , and smacked me in the face could be measured in gallons .
2. Concordia Children 's Services
Um ... Yuck .
I do n't really have a problem with the children suckling on the pig .
But everything 's just so ... dirty !
In small print the ad states , " If you do n't help feed them , who will ? "
Arnold from Green Acres , that 's who .
3. Lifebuoy Soap
As disturbing as this ad is ( particularly with the tagline , " You eat what you touch " ) , I can't help but find the hamster - muffin cute .
You can just imagine the little chirpy voice coming out of it , asking you to read it today 's headlines .
It would be a happy hamster - muffin , as its generous teeth would insure that you would n't dare try to eat it .
4. Keimling Vegetarian Restaurant
If you somehow did manage to eat hamster - muffin , this is what would happen .
I think .
It 's sort 'a like barfing up the food chain ...
Which I guess is the point .
After all , it is an ad for a vegetarian restaurant ...
5. McDonald's
Okay , I 'm just going to state this now : clowns scare the hell out of me .
They freak me out .
I do n't know why and I do n't want to experience intense sessions of psychoanalysis to find out .
That being said , it 's quite easy to see why this ad is just plain frightening to me .
The idea of a clown that is small enough to squeeze into tiny places ( just so it can slit my throat with a large knife ) is enough to make me curl into a ball and squat in a corner , rocking and making little mewling sounds .
6. Thai Food Express
Thank God for whatever ultra - hot weapon Thai Food Express has in their arsenal .
I can sleep nights knowing that there is something to keep that clown baby from under my bed . *
7. Just Liquid Hand Wash
I warned you .
This is the tip of the iceberg in freaky / gross stuff .
Where to begin ...
Well , the maggots are bad enough , right ?
I mean ... holy crap .
But what 's up with the guy taking the medicine ?
He looks dead already .
Eyes all rolled up in his noggin and stuff .
Why give him medicine ?
After years of research in this area , I can tell you that the undead do n't need medicine .
They 're ... well , zombies .
And you know that the undead guy is making some horrific groaning sound because somebody with maggots all over their arms is trying to force medicine down his throat .
Tick Tock Diner , Nevada Diner , Eagle Rock Diner — N.J .
Greek civilization seems to have peaked a while back , at least in terms of philosophy , science , and epic poetry , but that does n't mean they do n't honor the tradition of serving a killer breakfast in dozens of diners across the breadth of northern New Jersey .
It 's a heritage : In Plato 's Symposium , there 's a dialogue between Socrates and some yold named Agathon , clarifying the true nature of the feta - and - spinach omelet .
Agathon finally yields to the logic behind the bagel on the side instead of toast , there being nothing to sop up .
" I can't find any way of withstanding you , Socrates , " he says .
" Let it be as you say . "
" Not at all , " says Socrates .
" It is truth that you find impossible to withstand .
Truth , and the way the butter melts , filling the bagel 's creviced form . "
This ancient expertise is on display around the clock at two of the three local diners I frequent , the Nevada and the Tick Tock .
I can't vouch for the Eagle Rock 's hours or breakfast : I eat there only after bowling with my son , which means two or three sides of bacon , fries , a vanilla shake , and a spirited dialogue about gutter balls and anger management .
The Nevada and the Tick Tock both offer vast menus , gigantic plates , and lousy coffee .
The major difference is that the Tick Tock is on Route 3 , a major artery between here and New York City , which means it attracts a breakfast clientele ranging from seething truckers just beginning their day to seething drunks just ending theirs ; the Nevada is a local joint packed by seething Bloomfield cops .
At both diners , what the waitresses lack in beauty they make up for with grim indifference , not that you really want another cup of that coffee — you 're just waving hi to the drunk with the torn , bleeding earlobe .
I 'm telling you , none of this matters .
I 've never had a breakfast at either place that was n't superb .
Omelets of many nations , pancakes the size of hubcaps , sausage links fat with flavor , eggs over easy atop mounds of corned beef — all hot , all tasty as hell , and plenty of it .
I can't honestly say that the hash browns are as crisp on top and tender below as I like them every time , or that the kitchen wo n't short the lox in my lox - and - onion omelet once in a while .
It happens , but not often .
And if it should happen to you , blame me .
Just do n't stiff the waitress — not unless you want your tires slashed .

By Evo Morales Ayma , president of the Republic of Bolivia
October 9 , 2008 -- Sisters and brothers , on behalf of the Bolivian people , I greet the social movements of this continent present in this act of continental solidarity with Bolivia .
We have just suffered the violence of the oligarchy , whose most brutal expression was the massacre in Panda , a deed that teaches us that an attempt at power based on money and weapons in order to oppress the people is not sustainable .
It is easily knocked down , if it is not based on a program and the consciousness of the people .
We see that the re-founding of Bolivia affects the underhanded interests of a few families of large landholders , who reject as an aggression the measures enacted to favour the people such as a more balanced distribution of the resources of natural gas for our grandfathers and grandmothers , as well as the distribution of lands , the campaigns for health and literacy , and others .
To protect their power and privileges and to evade the process of change , the ruling elite of large landholders of the so - called Half Moon ( Media Luna ) clothe themselves in the movements for departmental autonomies and the rupture of national unity , lending themselves to the yankee interests of ending the re-founding of Bolivia .
However , in the revocation referendum of August 10 , we just received the mandate of two - thirds of the Bolivian people to consolidate this process of change , in order to continue advancing in the recovery of our natural resources , and to insure the well being of all Bolivians , to unite the distinct sectors of society of the countryside and the city , of the east and the west .
Sisters and brothers , what happened with this revocation referendum in Bolivia is something that is not only important for Bolivians but for all Latin Americans .
We dedicate it to the Latin American revolutionaries and those throughout the world , reaffirming the struggle for all processes of change .
I was going to express the way to recover the life ways of our peoples , called Live Well ( el Buen Vivir ) , to recover our vision of the Mother Earth , that for us is life , because it is not possible for the capitalist model to convert Mother Earth into a commodity .
Once again we see the profound correlations between the indigenous movement and the organisations of the social movements , which also throw in their lot in order to Live Well .
We greet them so that together we can seek a certain balance in the world .
10 commandments to save the planet
Along these lines , I want to share and propose for debate some 10 commandments to save the planet , for humanity and for life , not only at this level but also to debate among our communities , and our organisations .
First , if we want to save the planet earth to save life and humanity , we are obliged to end the capitalist system .
The grave effects of climate change , of the energy , food and financial crises , are not a product of human beings in general , but rather of the capitalist system at it is , inhuman , with its idea of unlimited industrial development .
Second , to renounce war , because the people do not win in war , but only the imperial powers ; the nations do not win , but rather the transnational corporations .
Wars benefit a small group of families and not the people .
The trillions of millions of dollars used for war should be directed to repair and cure Mother Earth wounded by climate change .
Third proposal for debate : a world without imperialism nor colonialism .
Our relationships should be oriented to the principle of complementarity , and to take into account the profound asymmetries that exist family to family , country to country , and continent to continent .
And the fourth point is oriented to the issue of water , which ought to be guaranteed as a human right to avoid its privatisation into few hands , given that water is life .
As the fifth point , I would like to say that we need to end the energy debacle .
In 100 years we are using up fossil energies created during millions of years .
As some presidents are setting aside lands for luxury automobiles and not for human beings , we need to implement policies to impede the use of agro-fuels and in this way to avoid the hunger and misery for our peoples .
As a sixth point : in relationship to the Mother Earth , the capitalist system treats the Mother Earth as a raw material , but the Earth cannot be understood as a commodity ; who could privatise , rent or lease their own mother ?
I propose that we organise an international movement in defence of Mother Nature , in order to recover the health of Mother Earth and re-establish a harmonious and responsible life with her .
A central theme as the seventh point for debate is that basic services , whether they be water , electricity , education or health , need to be taken into account as human rights .
As the eighth point , to consume what is needed , prioritise what we produce and consume locally , end consumerism , decadence and luxury .
We need to prioritise local production for local consumption , stimulating self - reliance and the sovereignty of the communities within the limits that the health and remaining resources the planet permits .
As the next to last point , to promote the diversity of cultures and economies .
To live in unity respecting our differences , no only physical , but also economic , through economies managed by the communities and their associations .
Sisters and brothers , as the tenth point , we propose to Live Well , not live better at the expense of another , a Live Well based on the lifestyle of our peoples , the riches of our communities , fertile lands , water and clean air .
Socialism is talked about a lot , but we need to improve this socialism , improve the proposals for socialism in the XXI century , building a communitarian socialism , or simply Live Well , in harmony with Mother Earth , respecting the shared life ways of the community .
Finally , sisters and brothers , certainly you are following up on the problems that exist .
I have reached the conclusion that there will always be problems , but I want to tell you that I am very content , not disappointed or worried because these groups who permanently enslaved our families during the colonial time , the time of the republic and this period of neoliberalism , they continue as family groups , resisting us .
It is our struggle to confront these groups who live in luxury and who do not wish to lose their luxury , or lose their lands .
This is a historic struggle and this struggle lives on .
Sisters and brothers , in the hope that the Continental Gathering of the Social Forum of the Americas culminates with strong bonds of unity among you and a strong action plan in favour of the people of Bolivia and of our peoples , I repeat my fraternal greeting .

Autism is more often diagnosed in boys Many children have mild autistic " symptoms " without ever having enough problems to attract specialist attention , say UK researchers .
The Institute of Child Health team says diagnosed children have severe versions of character traits probably shared by millions of others .
The 8,000 child study found even these mild traits could impair development .
Boys - who make up the bulk of autism diagnoses - were most likely to be affected , the US journal study found .
Clinicians and those involved in education need to aware that there are children who do not have autism but who nevertheless have somewhat elevated levels of autistic traits
Professor David Skuse
Institute for Child Health Scientists have understood for some time that the " autistic spectrum " covers a wide range of children with differing levels of problems , from relatively mild cases to severely disabling problems .
However , a relatively small number of children - approximately 116 per 10,000 - are said to have an autistic disorder .
The UK research , published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry provides further evidence that the same traits do not begin and end there , but continue at into the whole population of children , just at a level which does not lead parents to seek medical help .
Seeing autism as a " distinct illness " was probably wrong , they said .
Even at this mild level , however , these characteristics - particularly problems communicating with peers and teachers - can be a disadvantage .
The findings confirmed that IQ was not an issue - the traits could be present regardless of levels of intelligence .
However , it cast some light on the differential in the numbers of boys and girls diagnosed with autism .
Girls with autistic traits appeared to be able to compensate for social communication problems if they had sufficient " verbal IQ " - a natural ability to use language well .
However , even boys with high " verbal IQ " seemed less able to overcome their communication problems .
Education awareness Professor David Skuse , one of the researchers involved , said the results did not downplay the genuine impact of more severe autism .
However , he added : " What this does suggest is that drawing a dividing line between those with autism and the rest of the population involves taking an arbitrary decision . "
" Clinicians and those involved in education need to aware that there are children who do not have autism but who nevertheless have somewhat elevated levels of autistic traits - our research suggests that these children are at slightly greater risk of developing behavioural and emotional problems . "
In an accompanying editorial , Professor John Constantino , from Washington University , said that the idea that autism represented the " severe end " of a natural distribution of abilities could help scientists looking for the genetics underlying the condition , or for ways to treat it .
It could also help the development of children who were affected , but not to the level of an autism diagnosis .
He wrote : " The approach of teachers and family members to such children can vary dramatically on the basis of the perceived origins of the behaviour , and recognition of the contribution of subthreshold autistic impairments can result in far more appropriate and supportive responses than typically occur when antisocial motives are presumed .

I love electronic music .
I love it so much that , in order to show my love , I ’ve compiled a list of artists that have blown my socks off over the years , complete with music videos of some of their more rocking tunes .
These are artists that have been around , released multiple albums , and have continued to make a splash with each new release they put out .
Some of these you may recognize , while others might become new favorites .
Either way , take a look , have a listen , and experience these masters of electronic music here in this definitive online collection .
... and hey , at the very least , the videos are full of hot babes , so check them out !
The GNOME Foundation has launched a new web site for the Friends of GNOME program , which allows users and community members to support the GNOME desktop environment by donating money .
Friends of GNOME has been around for a long time , but the new web site will make it more visible and could increase donations .
Last year , financial contributions from GNOME friends helped fund GNOME 's accessibility project and GTK + hackfest .
The new web site introduces an Adopt a Hacker option , which allows donors to contribute $ 10 a month .
Participants receive a set of GNOME stickers and a postcard from their favorite GNOME hacker .
After a year of monthly donations , contributors will also get a GNOME t- shirt .
The Friends of GNOME program also allows has options for making one - time donations with rewards ranging from a GNOME mousepad to a framed print of the GNOME logo signed by the organization 's board of directors .
Donations can be made with PayPal or sent by check .
" Friends of GNOME is a way for individuals to support the GNOME project 's mission of providing a free and open source desktop for everyone regardless of ability , " GNOME Foundation executive director Stormy Peters told us in an e-mail .
" People have requested an easier , more consistent way to donate and we hope our $ 10 / month program will fill that need .
We will use the additional funds raised to continue to support our volunteer community in accomplishing our mission of a free and open source desktop . "
The current economic conditions have compelled a lot of people to close their wallets and give less enthusiastically to non-profit organizations .
Despite the rough economy , free culture causes seem to be doing well .
Creative Commons met its $ 500,000 fundraising goal last month and Wikipedia collected $ 6 million despite growing skepticism about the organization 's spending habits .
GNOME might see similar success with its new Adopt a Hacker initiative .

LXer Feature : 13 - Feb -2009
In the weekend of 7 and 8 February , the 9th Free & Open Source Developers ' Europe Meeting ( FOSDEM ) took place at the Université Libre Bruxelles ( ULB ) in Brussels .
Your editors Sander Marechal and Hans Kwint attended this meeting to find out for you what 's hot , new in the area of the Linux environment and might be coming to you in the near future .
This is our report of the second day covering the talks about Thunderbird 3 , Debian release management , Ext4 , Syslinux , CalDAV and more .
Coverage of the first day can be found in our previous article .

How the social networking site Hyves benefits from Pupput - Marlon de Boer
By Hans Kwint [ back to top ]
Hyves.net is one of the Netherlands biggest social Network sites .
However , not everybody might be familiar with Hyves .
To give you an idea what this means for the requirements for the servers , Marlon gives some figures : " 200 million pageviews daily and at busy moments reaching eighteen million pageviews per hour " .
All these requests are served by 2500 servers decentrally located in the area of the largest internet exchange in the world in Amsterdam .
From time to time servers have to be replaced or new servers have to be added .
The Hyves administrators team is able to unpack and connect the wires of a server and the configuration of thenew server in seven minutes .
Interestingly these servers run Gentoo Linux .
Great " Get the facts " titles came to my mind such as " Read how Hyves manages 2500 servers and puts new servers up online in seven minutes using Gentoo Linux and Puppet " .
Back to Puppet : Puppet is a front - end for remote system administration tasks written in Ruby .
Also , it uses Augeas , the topic of the last talk of the previous day .
Puppet uses a client - server architecture , and it uses SSL for authentication .
It makes use of templates to enable quick configuration of new servers and it also supports types and functions .
Hyves now uses the PXE boot protocol in combination with puppet to quickly configure new servers .
Puppet amongst others handles DNS , NTP , Firewall and package management .
Of course , as a Gentoo user I was curious why Hyves chose Gentoo ; which may not seem the most logical choice .
One of the developers told someone else asked exactly that question , they use it because of the ease in writing custom packages .
" I write an ebuild within five minutes " he said , " something that cannot be done that quickly with Debian packages for example " .
A long line op people at the keysigning party
Thunderbird 3 - Ludovic Hirlimann and David Ascher
By Sander Marechal [ back to top ]
There was already a Q&A session going on when I entered the Mozilla dev room for the Thunderbird 3 talk .
The room was packed to the brim and some people could not get in anymore .
Many points were discussed before the talk even began , the biggest one probably being the biggest setback for people awaiting Thunderbird 3 and Mozilla dropping integration of the Lightning Calendar for the 3.0 release .
The talk itself began with a short overview of the history of Thunderbird and Mozilla Messaging .
Mozilla itself has been very focused on Thunderbird ( See also the Mozilla opening keynote in the previous article ) but Thunderbird had been pushed to the background a bit .
The spin -off of Mozilla Messaging is meant to correct that because like the web , messaging is under serious threat lately .
Messaging as a whole ( not just e-mail ) is under threat from a variety of big , centralized and closed systems , in particular Facebook .
Ludovic estimated that at the current growth rate of closed messaging networks like Facebook , soon more messages will travel over these closed networks than over e-mail ( spam excluded ) .
Just because these messages travel over HTTP does not mean that the messaging networks are open .
Data ownership matters , as does decentralized innovation and user - level hackability .
Currently most innovation is happening in the closed centralized networks .
Mozilla Messaging is therefor not just about Thunderbird and e-mail but about messaging as a whole .
For the immediate future the focus is on Thunderbird though , and Mozilla Messaging has quite a big job ahead of it .
There are thousands of open bug reports and feature requests going back years that need to be addressed .
Mozilla also wants to add new features in order to grow it 's market the way that Firefox has but that is more difficult than it seems .
Thunderbird is pretty feature - packed as it is so in order to add new features , old ones need to be removed or pushed into extensions in order to keep the Thunderbird base from becoming too bloated .
Also , the internals of Thunderbird are quite complex , changes that appear to be easy to do often turn out to be very complex or even impossible and ( too ) many of the APIs are still in C ++.
It has a code base of well over 500,000 lines , only a handful of developers and 2 - 3 QA people to maintain it .
The plan for Thunderbird 3 is to upgrade Gecko to version 1.9.1 ( the same as Firefox 3.1 ) , upgrade the platform and make a lot of improvements to the overall user experience .
The core of Thunderbird is being reworked to take modern computing into account ( cheap disk space and high bandwidth ) and do most of it's work asynchronously .
For example , when you delete a message it immediately disappears but the actual delete from your inbox files will be run at leisure in the background .
The UI is also getting an overhaul in order to provide faster access to the most used functions and simplify account setup from a 7 page wizard to a single form with three fields .
When all this is done Thunderbird 3 will be released .
Beta 2 is expected around the end of this week .
After that the team plans to make contributing easier with higher level ( JavaScript ) API , a new indexing database called Gloda , HTML / CSS - based views which are easier to customize and a set of extensions to experiment with even more drastic UI layout changes .
Upstart - Scott James Remnant
By Hans Kwint [ back to top ]
Before attending this presentation , I only new Upstart as an alternative way of booting used by Ubuntu to speed up the boot process .
However , Scott Remnant , the writer of Upstart who also works at Canonical says that Upstart is much more : " It 's an API for processes to communicate . "
It has also been used in Fedora as of late and it promises to improve the boot process by way of trying to eliminate the time the computer spends doing nothing but sleep ( ) and avoiding race conditions .
The unique characteristic of Upstart is that it makes use of simple grammar :
While Q running , until P , while R start / stop S , else T , V also W , X and Y , Z or N .
The capitals here may represent boot processes which have or have not been started .
As you may be guessed , these requirements may be combined as well .
As a result , it 's the intention that runlevels are history .
" Just tell what you want to start , or when it needs to be run " , Scott explains .
Upstart also intends to make cron obsolete , by means of supporting timed events .
These are the ones like ' in 2 hours ' , ' 24 seconds after startup ' , ' every 10 minutes while eth0 up ' and so on .
These timed events allow for a greater flexibility of running conditional commands ; because these commands can be coupled to services that are running or not .
Scott also explained more about the road map : Upstart 0.5.2 will be available this month , and 0.10.0 is planned for June 2009 and will feature new job syntax .
After that , 1.00 will probably come sometime in September of 2009 ; or if it 's not progressed far enough it will be called 0.50 .
Release management in Debian : Can we do better ?
- Frans Pop
By Hans Kwint [ back to top ]
Frans
Pop is not a Debian release engineer but works as the release engineer of the Debian installer , even though he temporarily resigned for a few months .
In that function he is an important part of the Debian release cycle because if anything in Debian is broken , users will logically blame the installer .
In the past , there have been serious issues with Debian releases leading to broken features in the distribution .
For example , when Etch had been released the Sarge installer was broken for some time .
This is a problem because certain users have policies , for example that they might have decided to continue using old - stable for a year to year and a half .
Frans was not out to blame people personally , however he did make some suggestions on how release engineers can improve their behaviour to prevent problems such as has happened in the past .
It basically can be summarized as follows :
There has been too little public communication .
The communication between those involved with the release process was mainly on IRC , resulting in those not being in IRC at that time not knowing what had happened .
Also , the team of release engineers lack a thorough summary of what tasks are part of a release and how long these tasks take .
For example , some of the release engineers pulled out new release notices without being aware these notices have to be translated before the release .
Some not widely known parts of the release are sometimes a bit forgotten : Key distribution , documentation on an upgrade path and the documentation on the Debian website .
Frans pleaded for a more open communication and better understanding of how long certain tasks take and a better planning of all these tasks .
Arthur Huillet showing FreeDroidRPG in action
Lightning talk : Introducing FreeDroidRPG
- Arthur Huillet
By Sander Marechal [ back to top ]
FreeDroidRPG is an isometric action / adventure game in the style of Diablo starring Tux as the main protagonist against the evil robots that are running the MegaSys operating system , a poorly secured operating system that nevertheless runs on the majority of robots .
Arthur took the audience around a quick tour of the features of the game , such as fighting , magic inventory and the ability to hack the OS of the droids so you can reprogram them and turn them to your side .
The game is purely single player and no multiplayer options are planned .
Arthur and his team want to focus to be on the storyline and character development .
The base code is pretty much done but they are looking for people who can add characters , quests and levels in order to increase the games length because at the moment it only takes about six hours to finish the game .
Syslinux and the dynamic x86 boot process - H. Peter Anvin
By Hans Kwint [ back to top ]
SysLinux is a lightweight dynamic bootloader which can be used to boot various operating systems in different ways .
Peter developed it because when working late into the night , he became incensed at not being able to boot something .
As of recent SysLinux has included gPXE support and it can also boot over HTTP using Apache and cgi .
Peter showed this by means of booting his virtual computer in Brussels from an Apache server in California .
SysLinux has a modular design .
It consists of the user interface , diagnostic tools , policies and filesystem modules .
The filesystem modules can boot binary formats .
For example , recently someone asked Peter to support the Microsoft SDI format .
Peter tells : " I did n't know that format , but it turned out to be some ramdisk using a Windows kernel " .
SysLinux uses a system called " shuffle " :
It 's fed with parameters defining which parts of a boot file are at what place in a binary boot file .
Because of this system adding new formats is quite easy .
Supporting the Microsoft SDI format only took 139 lines of code , most of which was error checking .
SysLinux also comes with policy modules .
For example , these can say " Boot kernel X when on a 32 bit system , boot kernel Y when on a 64 bit system , else boot kernel Z " .
These modules also enable some quite sophisticated uses .
One of them is probing the PCI bus when booting , mapping the devices found to kernel modules , and building an initramfs with all the needed modules .
The astonishing thing is all of this can be done on the fly !
Syslinux is a work in progress .
As a result of a historical error , much of the FS - code has been written in assembly .
Work is being done to rewrite these parts amongst others to make sure it 's easy to write support for brtfs in the near future .
Also , Peter intends SysLinux to have an LUA - interpreter in the future to allow usage of simple to write LUA - scripts instead of the current modules .
LUA is chosen because it is small and clean .
Another point of attention is EFI support .
For all of these things , Syslinux needs feedback from users and distributions .
Currently it also lacks newbie - friendly documentation .
Lightning talk : Games done good - Steven Goodwin

Steven Goodwin is the main developer of the SGX Engine , a 3D graphics engine for games and the author of " Cross - Platform Game Programming " and " The Game Developers ' Open Source Handbook " .
He started off describing that there is a fundamental disconnect in the way people write libraries for use in games and the game developers that actually write the games that causes game developers to re-use far less libraries that most non -game projects .
This is usually because the developers of the library are making far too many assumptions and game developers are not going to try too hard to adapt .
They simply try out a library and if it does n't work they throw it out and try another one .
If none of them work then they write it from scratch , again .
Library developers need to find common ground with the game developers , but what common ground is there ?
Steven gave some nice examples to show that there is far less common ground than expected .
For example , the size of an int is different across platforms .
The standard library is different across platforms .
Even GCC is different across platforms with many options not being available everywhere and to make matters worse , people do n't even agree on the definition of an " engine " or " object " .
Libraries for games need to be built in a different way ; everything needs to be abstracted and no assumptions must be made .
For example , it is nearly impossible to write an input toolkit for games .
What ' i a " click " when you 're running on a Wii with four controllers connected ?
What is a cursor on a touch screen ?
In that same vein , a graphics engine should not expect to find a graphics card on a machine .
Just think of a World of Warcraft server .
SGX has been built in a way that is truly cross platform .
Everything is abstracted and organized into loosely coupled modules ranging from memory to CRC , math , geometry , graphics , physics , sound and more .
It is used by various games ( although Steven was not allowed to say which ones ) and should run everywhere , from your PC to your Wii , XBox , server and hand - held device .
A large crowd gathered to watch Theodore Ts'o speak on Ext4
Ext4 - Theodore Ts'o
By Sander Marechal [ back to top ]
Theodore started his presentation with an apology .
He had prepared a very nice demonstration of ext4 on his laptop but it had been stolen at the train station .
Luckily he did have a backup of his presentation , just not the demo .
He gave a quick overview about the ext3 filesystem and what is so good about it ; ext3 is widely used and is pretty much the de facto Linux filesystem .
It also has a very diverse developer community with contributors from all the major distributions .
That is a bigger point then you would at first assume because until recently Red Had did not officially support the XFS filesystem and it did not have any of its own developers working on it .
JFS is a great filesystem but the fact that pretty much all contributors are IBM employees has likely contributed to JFS ' lack of success .
Big distributions want someone who knows the ins and outs on their own team before they can support something as important as a filesystem and ext3 developers are everywhere .
The ext3 filesystem has its fair share of problems which ext4 should fix .
Currently ext3 filesystems can only be up to 16 TB in size and there is a limit of 32,000 directories .
The resolutions of the timestamps on files is only one second and there are performance problems , ext4 fixes all these issues .
Ext4 is not a new filesystem , just like ext3 was not a new filesystem .
Ext3 is just ext2 with a number of new features added such as journaling and ext4 is simply ext3 with even more features , such as extends .
Google has even contributed a patch that you can use to mount ext2 filesystems as ext4 .
The reason : Google is still using ext2 because it does n't believe in journaling .
When something goes wrong on one of the machines at Google it is simply easier to wipe the system and re-flash it from another node than it is to recover it .
But they did want to make use of some of the new features that ext4 adds .
Ext4 is n't all good news though , the new allocator that it uses is likely to expose old bugs in software running on top of it .
With ext3 , applications were pretty much guaranteed that data was actually written to disk about 5 seconds after a write call .
This was never official but simply resulted from the way ext3 was implemented .
The new allocator used for ext4 means that this can take between 30 seconds and 5 minutes or more if you are running in laptop mode .
It exposes a lot of applications that forget to call fsync ( ) to force data to the disk but nevertheless assume that it has been written .
Two of the major culprits appear to be Gnome and KDE who each write hundreds of dotfiles to a users home directory .
A sudden crash of the machine means that all these files will appear to have disappeared .
Users think that the filesystem is to blame but in reality it is the applications .
The situation appears to be a bit tricky to solve because the last thing you want to do is call fsync ( ) too often because that would force your hard drive out of power saving mode .
One of the possible solutions under investigation is a sort of callback system whereby an application can be notified when data has actually reached the platters of your hard drive .
Automated web translation workflow for multilingual Drupal sites - Stany van Gelder
By Hans Kwint [ back to top ]
As of Drupal 6 , Connexion offers an automated web translation workflow module for Drupal .
Of course there are machine translators , but normally these are not good enough .
A human translator will still be necessary .
However , much of the work such as a human translator does can be automated .
The AWTW - module meant to do just that ; this process is called Computer Aided Translation , or just simply CAT .
The module is mainly aimed to automate repetitive tasks , however it should consider local differences like websites for different countries that may have different contact persons .
Stany presented a demo of how these things can be filled in using the XML editor Déjavu .
He also explained how ATWT can save several days of time in the translation process .
In the future this module will also be able to map internal links , making sure links in one translation link to that topic in the same language .
Helge
Heß explaining the ins and outs of CalDAV
CalDAV , the open groupware protocol - Helge Heß
By Sander Marechal [ back to top ]
CalDAV is a relatively new standard that allows users to store and retrieve calendar events from a central server .
Helge noted that CalDAV is just a transport ; the actual data formats used , iCal and vCard are much older .
CalDAV is built on top of several well known technologies such as HTTP ( REST - style ) , WebDAV and WebDAV - ACL .
CalDAV itself is relatively simple , but the underpinnings of WebDAV and especially WebDAV ACL can make it quite complex .
That is why a new protocol has emerged in the open source world called GroupDAV [ really , this talk should have been titled GroupDAV and not WebDAV -- Sander ] .
GroupDAV is a subset of CalDAV , CardDAV and WebDAV .
Helge recommended that anyone who tries to implement CalDAV first implement proper GroupDAV support because any GroupDAV client is able of talking to a CalDAV server because they are completely compatible .
Full CalDAV clients simply have a couple of extra functions like REPORT which make some types of queries easier to do .
One of the more interesting design goals behind GroupDAV is that it is completely compatible with Apache + mod_webdav .
That means you do not need a special server to store your groupware data .
Helge then went into a more technical explanation of the protocols and how you can implement them , demonstrating various things with a simple command line client that showed the HTTP requests and responses between the server and client .
He finished with an overview of existing server and client implementations .
DaviCal ( PHP ) and CalendarServer ( Python ) are pretty complete CalDAV server implementations .
On the client side the choice is wide .
Evolution , Mozilla , Funambol , Mulberry , Chandler and even MS - Outlook ( using the OpenConnector ) are all able to speak CalDAV .
Wrap up
By Sander Marechal [ back to top ]
All in all I think FOSDEM 2009 has been a great success .
The talks were great , the people friendly and the atmosphere was buzzing .
The LXer editors would like to congratulate the FOSDEM 2009 staff on a job well done .
We will certainly be there next year for FOSDEM 2010 .
BAGHDAD
Eleven - year - old Mahmoud al - Obaidi walks seven km every morning to get to work at a carpentry factory in Baghdad so he can save his bus fares .
Al - Obaidi is the only male in his family of four , as his father disappeared five years ago and he works to support his family .
On average he spends nearly 10 hours a day in the factory earning a living .
" I did n't have a choice .
Work was the only option .
I cannot deny that I would like to be at a school , learning like other children .
But I know the responsibility that I have to carry , " al - Obaidi told IRIN , as he walked to work .
He boy is only one of thousands of Iraqi children forced by poverty to work at an early age .
More than a million youngsters work often enduring hazardous conditions , as well as being vulnerable to sexual abuse and violence , according to a report released at the end of 2004 .
The report was based on a nationwide survey in which 19,610 Iraqis participated .
The project was a joint effort between the United Nations Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) and several Iraqi ministries , including the Ministry of Health ( MoH ) , Ministry of Public Works and Social Affairs ( MoPWSA ) and the Ministry of Education ( MoE ) .
Nearly 250 students aged between nine and 14 dropped out of school to begin work between January and March , according to a report by the MoE .
Officials say that number is likely to increase following the downturn in the country ’s economic fortunes in the post - Saddam era .
“ Our children are leaving schools and they represent the future of Iraq .
If the government guarantees a better life for their families for sure they wo n’t have to work and for this reason urgent action should be taken by the new Iraqi government , ” a senior official at the MoE , Khalid Youssef , told IRIN .
CHILDREN WORKING TO SURVIVE
The main reason for child labour in Iraq is poverty .
Nearly 25 percent of the country ’s population lives below the poverty line , according to the interim government .
There is also a strong culture of child labour in Iraq .
Even with free schools and universities in the country , many families wo n’t allow youngsters to attend school , saying that it is important for them to go out and work as early as possible according to experts .
“ I believe that we marry and have children to alleviate our lives from work .
My father made me work at the age of nine and I sent my children to work when they were 10 .
There is nothing wrong with that , especially for families who do not have good financial support like mine , " Omar Adnan , a father of three , told IRIN .
Most street children in the capital work and can be seen selling cigarettes , newspapers and other small household items .
Markets and industry also employ large numbers of children who are usually forced undertake dangerous , arduous jobs for low pay , enduring long hours , according to the Ministry of Industry ( MoI ) and Ministry of Trade ( MoT ) .
STATISTICS
According to the 2004 survey , nearly 1,300,000 children , aged between eight and 16 were working .
This represents 6.1 percent of the country 's population .
In addition , the survey revealed long working hours , with 27 percent of children working for more than eight hours daily .
Those who start working at an early stage were found to be mainly from the rural areas , the survey said , because of more harsh economic conditions there .
" The lack of security and political uncertainties have left economic activities stunted and social safety nets disrupted , while unemployment and poverty have deepened .
Under these circumstances , more children and youths have been driven to work or beg on the streets , or toil at various labour sites , often under hazardous conditions , in order to supplement dwindling family incomes , ” a spokeswoman for UNICEF , Ban Dhayi , told IRIN from the Jordanian capital , Amman .
Some of these children and youths are the sole breadwinners of the family due to the death , disability or unemployment of their parents , Dhayi added .
“ Working children were already researched and documented in northern Iraq and were seen in southern and central Iraq before the war , but the socio / economic circumstances of Iraq following the war in 2003 are seen to have pushed more children to the streets and worksites , ” the UNICEF official said .
Many children also make a living through drugs and prostitution , perceived to be easier ways of earning money , according to the Iraqi Red Crescent Society ( IRCS ) .
" Children should be in schools and not on the streets or working in dangerous places where no one will take responsibility for them , " a spokeswoman for the IRCS , Firdous al - Abadi , told IRIN .
HAZARDOUS WORK
Nearly nine percent of child workers had been injured , according to the UNICEF 2004 survey and nearly 58 percent of working children interviewed had suffered violence .
Doctors in the capital said they treat at least one child injured at work every day , most hurt by exposure to dangerous chemicals .
Dr Haydar al - Yassin , at the Yarmouk hospital , the largest emergency facility in the country , told IRIN that it is common for employers to lie about how the injuries were sustained , so they do n't have to take responsibility .
" Children work in hazardous environments and there is no law to protect them .
Sometimes the child dies in hospital due to the injuries .
Last week we had a case where a child 's entire body was burned after a gas cooking cylinder exploded in a kitchen at a local restaurant , " al - Yassin explained .
The MoH also reported that sick children only seek medical help after becoming seriously ill .
In addition , a January 2005 study by the MoH , in partnership with the MoPWSA , found that nearly 55 percent of children , who work in rural areas , suffer from skin diseases .
Those in workshops and large industries also showed high incidences of respiratory problems following exposure to harmful chemicals and gases .
GOVERNMENT ACTION
Projects to prevent the abuse of working children and to promote more schooling have been implemented .
In April , the government banned shopkeepers and industry from employing children under the age of 14 .
Those who do not obey the law may be subjected to huge fines .
The penalty varies from US $ 100 to $ 300 but persistent offenders may be closed down .
Whether the law will be implemented remains to be seen .
In addition , youngsters found working in these industries may receive a payment of $ 50 and continued support from the government , so that they do not have to go back to work and can return to their studies .
" Our ministry has had success and hundreds of children have returned to schools and left work where they were being abused and were receiving poor salaries , " minister of public work and social affairs , Leila Abdul - Lattef , told IRIN .
The MoPWSA also supported the opening of Mercy House in Baghdad , a place where the poorest children and most disadvantaged members of Iraqi society are offered assistance .
Street children , who beg or are forced to work , receive support at the centre , which offers education and protection from abuse and violence .
The MoPWSA has also asked the new Iraqi government to ensure children are protected under the new constitution .
" The abuse on the streets against children ’s rights is frequent and we will continue our work to change this and bring security and a better future for each Iraqi child , " Abdul - Lattef added .

Karen --- according to Grist.org , there is language in the bill that includes $ 3.4 billion for " fossil energy research and development , " so some of that could conceivably be used for carbon - capture and storage projects ( CCS ) .

How about some concise one sentence analysis with the cursory announcements on the Green News Report !
It 's easy to say there is no such thing as clean coal ... and there is n't ... but why not get people to think and use common sense .
You can even be cute about it .... something like ....
" What goes up must come down or as applied to clean coal .... what goes down must eventually come up .
We 've heard no realistic plan for dealing with the CO2 in the future .
Sounds like another major long - term pollution issue like nuclear waste . "
You can also point out that the CO2 emissions and global climate change are only one major concern with processing coal into electricity .... do n't forget the thousands of toxic heavy metal ash sludge ponds like the one in Tennessee that inundated a beautiful landscape and is ruining the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people , or the smokestack emissions still polluting the air .
On the bird front ...
I grew up waiting for the first Robin of spring to show up in March to know that warmer weather is coming soon .
Up here in Vermont I 've already seen flocks of Robins since January 21st , and just saw a flock of Cedar Waxwings yesterday .
We 've also had the warmest February that I can remember .

when mattoon won the future gen project the bush doe decided not to fund it .. i felt bad for the peops of mattoon because they had spent like a quarter million bucks on lobbying / researching then when they beat out tx for the plant .. the idea was killed that being said , i still think working to make coal clean power plants is a good idea , it couldnt happen everywhr because if i understand this correctly , u need a large , water tight cave to pump the emissions into ... now the questions i would have r... what happens to the life cycles in those caves ?
can we make sure it affects only the cave thats used ... because yes if it can spread then its a disaster waiting to happen as far as the sludge disaster goes , if i am remembering and understanding things correctly , that sludge pond was part of a public utility , whoever was in charge of maiteniance deserves criminal neglect charges so of course we have to maintain safe sludge ponds and recycle that sludge when ever possible sadly no matter what we do with china / india building a coal plant a week we probably cant stop global warming ... that doesnt mean i think we can give up trying , i think it is our moral responsibility to try drum roll plssssssssssssssssssssss my house has cut our electric usage in half since last yr at same time

That was an excellent show .
Your voices worked beautifully together and the off - the - cuff humor was very nice .
One of the problems with many of the on - line ' radio ' type commentators I 've heard ( even the ones I listen to reoccurring ) is that the voice is grating and / or there is no humorous touch except for very heavy handed ( and hard on the ears ) sarcasm .
Your audio was very easy on the ears .
Desi has a great voice .

TEL AVIV ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. foreclosure filings in 2008 rose 81 % from 2007 and tripled from 2006 , RealtyTrac reported on Thursday .
A total of nearly 3.16 million foreclosure filings -- measured by default notices , auction - sale notices , and bank repossessions -- were reported in 2008 .
The Irvine , Calif. , consultant also said that 1.84 % of all U.S. housing units -- 1 of every 54 -- received at least one foreclosure filing during the year , up from 1.03 % in 2007 .
In December , foreclosure filings were reported on more than 303,000 U.S. properties .
That 's up 17 % from November and 41 % from the year - earlier month , Realty Trac reported .
In the fourth quarter , foreclosure activity rose 40 % from the year - earlier quarter .
" Clearly the foreclosure - prevention programs implemented to date have not had any real success in slowing down this foreclosure tsunami , " Chief Executive Officer James J. Saccacio said in a statement .

The government has come under fire after banning a Dutch MP from entering the UK over anti-Islamic remarks .
Former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo said by turning away Geert Wilders , ministers had made a " populist twit and bigot " world famous .
The Freedom Party MP had been invited to a House of Lords screening of his film , linking the Koran to terrorism .
Muslim groups backed the government 's decision and labelled Mr Wilder " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
' Free speech ' Mr Wilders , who faces trial in his own country for inciting hatred , caused outrage across the Muslim world last year when he posted his film , Fitna , on the internet .
Now he is at the centre of further controversy following an invitation from the UK Independence Party 's Lord Pearson to show his film in the House of Lords .
Lord Pearson told the BBC it was a " matter of free speech " and the film would only be offensive to violent Islamists .
I do n't agree with everything that Geert Wilders has to say , but I believe he has the right to say it in a democracy
Crossbench peer Baroness Cox Fitna 's opening scenes show a copy of the Koran followed by footage of the 9/11 attacks in the US and the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 .
The Lords screening went ahead as planned , despite Mr Wilders ' absence , although only five peer and no MPs were present .
But Mr Portillo expressed concerns those who did attend would not be the only people to view it .
Speaking on BBC1's
This Week , he said the MP held " unattractive " opinions but had he been allowed in he would have arrived " unnoticed to show his film to 30 fairly eccentric peers " .
Instead , he said , he has become a " globally famous figure " with thousands of people going on the internet to watch the film .
Differences and debate Crossbench peer Baroness Cox , who hosted a later screening for the media , accused the British government of " succumbing to threats of intimidation " .
She said it was " a very sad and a very disturbing day for British democracy when a European parliamentarian has not been allowed into this country " .
" I do n't agree with everything that Geert Wilders has to say , but I believe he has the right to say it in a democracy . "

Mr Wilders defended his visit to the UK , saying he had visited two weeks ago and planned to return in the future .
He said : " I 'm not doing anything wrong .
I 'm not protesting or running through the streets of London .
" Democracy means differences and debate .
It 's a very sad day when the UK bans an elected parliamentarian . "
He went on to accuse Gordon Brown of being the " biggest coward in Europe " .
Mr Brown 's spokesman said the prime minister fully supported the decision taken by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
Mohammed Shafiq , chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation , also supported the Home Secretary 's decision .
RECENT CASES Jamaican reggae singer Bounty Killer ( real name Rodney Pryce ) allowed entry despite using controversial lyrics about homosexuals and gang culture Muslim cleric Dr Yusuf al - Qaradawi refused entry in order to protect community cohesion .
He has described suicide bombers as " martyrs " and homosexuality as " a disease " Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan barred on the grounds that his allegedly racist and anti-Semitic views could threaten public order Martha Stewart and US rapper Snoop Dogg denied entry because of criminal convictions
Who is barred from Britain ?
Profile : Geert Wilders
" His fascist views are not welcome in our country where we pride ourselves as a multi - faith society , " he said .
" This is not about freedom of speech but about stopping the incitement to religious hatred this man promotes . "
Earlier , the Muslim Council of Britain said Mr Wilders was " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
The home secretary has the power to stop people entering the UK if she believes there is a threat to national security , public order or the safety of UK citizens , but she cannot exclude people simply because of their views .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the home secretary made a decision on an individual case .
" We have profound commitment to freedom of speech but there is no freedom to cry ' fire ' in a crowded theatre and there is no freedom to stir up hate , religious and racial hatred , according to the laws of the land , " he added .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said even with freedom of speech , there was a line to be drawn .
The Dutch government said it " regretted " the decision to bar Mr Wilders from the UK , saying it believed all its MPs " should be able to travel freely in the European Union " .

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own .
Are you looking for the fast track to starting your business ?
You want to make sure you hit all the high points but do n't get bogged down in too many fine points that lead you nowhere , right ?
Then read this guide , and get your business running in less than a month .
Week 1
Day 1 : Start with a viable idea .
Start thinking about whether your core idea makes a viable business .
How do you know ?
Well , honestly , you do n't always .
It does help to take a step back from the idea , try to be honest and objective with yourself , and ask these questions :
Does anybody need ( or want ) what we 're going to be selling ?
How bad is the need , or how much do they want it ?
Think about it in commonsense terms .
Vigorous market research will come later .
Will they pay for it ?
While they say people will beat a path to your door for a better mousetrap , that 's not always true .
Think about it in your case .
Are they paying for something else , now , already ?
Can we go from that to honestly believing they 'll pay for what you 're going to offer ?
How will you focus ?
Do you have a strategy , or are you planning to do everything for everybody ?
The answers to these questions may seem obvious , but the point of this exercise is to give yourself a reality check .
Essentially , you 're asking whether there 's a market for your product or service .
If you 're laying out a lot of money , and especially if that 's somebody else 's money ( like investors ) , it 's worth it to do the background research .
Day 2 : Determine ownership
There are no formulas for ownership , and it may seem awkward at first , but if you 're partnering with someone , it 's a thousand times easier to do it now than to wait until after the money starts flowing .
Determine the percentage of ownership , who does what , whose idea it was and how much that matters .
There are no formulas for ownership .
The closest thing to it is money spent , especially if you add in time spent ( so - called sweat equity ) and work that into a money value .
It 's extremely hard to value the original idea - I say the idea has very little real value , because it 's the work that matters .
You have to talk through this .
For now , talk about it first , and leave it to settle for tomorrow .
Day 3 : Get the agreement in writing .
Now that you have mulled over the potential legal issues surrounding ownership , it 's time to get concrete .
Today , get a draft of the agreement in writing .
We do n't mean go to the attorney , but we do mean write down the main points of your agreement with the other people involved .
You do n't need formal legal language .
That will come later ( actually , Day 17 ) .
What you want is a simple , plain agreement : percentage of ownership , money invested , time invested and who owns what .
Day 4 : Name the business .
That might be just using your own name , but usually it 's more than that , including not only coming up with the ideas , but also checking them for availability , and registering the name to make it legally yours .
You do n't have to make it final , at least not yet ( you will later , Day 17 again ) .
Start with the ideas , though , and start thinking about it .
Many people misunderstand what you can and can't do with names .
You can waste a lot of time with those misunderstandings .
Day 5 : Think about the initial sales forecast .
Some people dread the forecasting , but your business wo n't succeed without it .
How can you estimate expenses without knowing sales ?
How can you estimate your initial cash needs , as part of your starting costs , without knowing sales ?
A lot of people think sales forecasting is some highly sophisticated scientific thing they do n't know how to do .
Do n't worry , back here in the real world , a sales forecast is an educated guess .
How can you forecast something brand new ?
Break it down into pieces .
Lay it out onto a spreadsheet over 12 months and make your estimates for each month .
Think about how many tables , how many stalls , how many hours ?
How much per each ?
Multiply those units by the dollars per unit , and you have a sales forecast .
Day 6 : Create an initial expense budget .
Like your sales forecast , lay out a spreadsheet with rows on the left , months along the columns and a sum at the bottom to come up with an initial expense budget .
Think about rent , utilities , marketing costs and payroll .
Note : Remember to include what you 're going to pay yourself .
Day 7 : Estimate starting costs .
Start this with two simple lists : expenses you 'll incur before you start , and the things ( assets ) you 'll need to have .
Expenses are things like legal costs , fixing up the location , setting up your website and so on .
Assets are the stuff ( inventory ) you 're going to sell .
The harder part is estimating how much money you need to have in the bank , to support the company through the normal drain period during the early cash - negative days .
You have to lay this out month by month , comparing your sales to your expenses , watching the way the money goes in and out .
Remember , in most business - to - business settings , you have to wait to get paid .
Tune in next week to find out what to do on days eight through 14 in order to get your business up and running in three weeks .
3 Weeks to Startup : Week 2
Week 2
Day 8 : Plan your marketing strategy .
Think about your target market .
Imagine a hypothetical , ideal customer .
Determine his or her age , gender , job , favorite media and family situation .
It 's important to know your customer well ..
What 's your message ?
Can you say it in a single sentence ?
What if you have just one sentence that your customers will listen to ?
Where would you send that message ?
How would you reach them ?
Think about your marketing strategy and implementation details .
Take the time to go through a short but focused marketing plan to make sure you understand what it will take to market your business .
Day 9 : Develop your look and feel .
Start developing a sense of the look and feel of your company as your buyers will see it .
What will your logo look like ?
What sense will it have convey ?
Old - fashioned ?
Trustworthy ? , Leading edge ?
Everybody has a brand .
What will yours be ?
How will you get that idea across to customers and potential customers ?
Develop you look and feel through logos , signs , letterhead and graphic standards .
These are your branding essentials , and you need to have them in place before you get much further .
Day 10 : Start building your website .
Have you started your website already ?
Have you been thinking about it ?
Today 's the day to get going with that .
If you 're building a Web 2.0 application or any website that 's core to your business , then you might have to settle for simply having begun by the end of the three weeks .
For most businesses , you can have a website built very quickly .
Think about the basics elements of your website , and at least get a site up with basic information about you , your business your products and your services .
These days there are some good shortcuts available : take a look at TypePad , WordPress , and blogger platforms , for example .
These were built for blogging but can apply to many small sites , with little to no formatting work .
Day 11 : Think about how you 're going to get paid .
Think about how your customers will pay you .
If you 're going to be selling to consumers , then you probably want to establish a merchant account so you can accept credit cards .
These days , because of the online vendors , there are a lot more options .
In the old days you had to go straight to your favorite local bank , which had a detailed and time - consuming process .
These days , you have the option of setting yourself up with some web stores ( like Amazon , Yahoo ! and others ) that can handle that part of it for you .
If you 're selling to businesses , then think about invoices and credit policies for business customers .
There 's no underestimating how important getting paid is .
Day 12 : Try making a sale .
Have you been able to make a sale yet ?
Maybe you should take today to peddle your goods .
Even though you 're not fully established yet , lots of businesses ( maybe most of them ) start selling before they 're fully launched .
This is where you get to make sure that people want to buy what you 're selling .
Even if you can't make a sale , because things are ready , talk somebody through it .
The selling will continue for as long as your business is open , but we wanted to include it here as well because so many businesses are born at the moment the first customer says " yes . "
Day 13 : Get an insurance policy .
Time to talk to an insurance broker , and get your business insurance started .
These days , you can do a lot of research or even do the whole thing online .
And if not , remember the old - fashioned telephone tree - style of finding the right people .
Talk to any insurance broker you can think of , ask some questions , and if he or she is n't the right one , ask who else you should talk to .
Find the right person by asking the wrong person who else you should talk to .
In the doing , you 'll find out what kinds of insurance are appropriate for the type of business you 're starting .
Day 14 : Build your dream team .
Have you been thinking about how to build your team ?
Do you know the people you want to bring on ?
It 's time to start ironing down the team and the employees , and start the recruiting process .
Depending on your specifics , you 'll likely need job descriptions , and you 'll need to place ads on the right websites .
Start thinking about your employee list .
Who will you need to help you out when you actually open for business ?
Will it be just you and your business partner ?
Do you need to hire service people ?
Drivers ?
Designers ?
To get started , take another look at the financial planning you did in Week 1 , see who you can afford to hire and start looking .
3 Weeks to Startup : Week 3
Week 3
Day 15 : Think about your location .
Most people know they 're either going to work out of their home or they know where their office will be .
They 're considering the right location , how it should look , where it should be , what else is nearby , and so on .
Even if it 's a home office , you 've probably been thinking about it .
Now 's the time to make sure you 're set up .
Desk , computer , telephone , internet , quiet if you need it , view or not , the whole nine yards .
For a retail shop , workshop or office space , if you have n't done so already , start looking .
It 's almost time to make a decision .
There are brokers to help , and they wo n't charge you because they get their commission from the landlords ( which you should keep in mind as you deal with them because it 's always good to remember who 's paying ) .
Find a broker who'll work with you ; one who listens to you about what you want and do n't want .
Today take steps to establish the location , whether it 's simply adding desks and phones in your home office or making calls to revamp a restaurant or manufacturing plant .
For some people and businesses , this takes more than three weeks .
Sometimes you can't even lock in the location you want in that time .
But start planning the office space in which you want to work , as this can create the most lag time .
Day 16 : Set up your accounts .
With some good accounting software , you can keep track of every transaction -- every check , each invoice you receive and those you send out .
Keep careful track of spending and invoice categories , and before you know it , you 're doing the bookkeeping .
The best way to choose your new accounting software is to check with your bank so your systems will be compatible .
That will save you endless frustration with inputting records .
Day 17 : Create the legal documents .
Way back in Week 1 , you got together with the others involved and wrote down your agreements on who is supposed to own how much of the business , who does what and who is putting in how much money .
And you started looking at possible names for the business .
Today , get it locked in by creating the legal entity online talking to an attorney or both .
Do yourself a favor , though , before you start the attorney 's meter running :
Make sure you understand the basic tradeoffs , so you can spend the billable attorney time making the right choices , rather than just understanding the options .
We do n't recommend setting up your business without an attorney ( online or not ) , but if you get informed first , you 'll reduce the expense .
Day 18 : Start hiring .
You 're nearing the end of your three - week startup .
Just three days left , so if you 're going to have employees , it 's time to hire them or at least begin hiring .
You started the recruiting process last week , so you should have some people in mind .
Do n't do job interviews without first going over a simple review of what you can and can't say .
A lot of what would at first glance seem like common sense is technically illegal .
For example , you 're not supposed to ask someone his or her age or marital status because that information can lead to the appearance or suspicion of discrimination .
Day 19 : Get funding .
This is another one that depends on the details .
It can be as easy as deciding to spend a few thousand dollars you already have or as hard as raising millions of dollars from professional investors .
Your simple startup , involving a home office and a computer , might need nothing more than what you can get at Office Depot in an afternoon .
If you have to raise more money than you have , you need to write a detailed business plan , find potential investors and do a lot more work .
If you 're looking for professional investment , you almost certainly wo n't get that in three weeks ( although there are some rare exceptions ) .
You can still get your business going with the money you can get quickly so that you look that much more attractive to investors .
Day 20 : Think about opening day .
This should be fun :
Imagine the big party , the searchlights beaming into the sky , a brass band .
Well maybe not all that , but opening day is a good event to start your business marketing right .
Plan your opening day , and make sure everyone knows about it .
This is the chance to write a press release , talk to local or trade reporters and generally let people know about your business .
You want to build buzz so that when you open , people are aware of you .
Day 21 : Start your business .
You 're up and running , and in three weeks , just as we had hoped .
That makes today the first day of the rest of your business .
Today you 'll want to take another day to make the sale .
Focus today and see how many customers you can get in the door , figuratively or literally , depending on your business .
On your first day , remember to observe what 's going right , what 's going wrong and to note what could be better .
Your business will quickly become different from what you expected , and that 's OK .
The key is to record what 's different and why , and make course corrections .
In the real world , your planning should become management .
So review your plan vs. actual frequently , and run your business better .
How Not To Do Customer Support

Interview with Former Fatah Security Chief Hamas 's ' Sole Strategy is Destruction and Chaos '
Mohammed Dahlan , 47 , is the former head of security for Fatah in the Gaza Strip .
In a SPIEGEL interview , he discusses the Israeli war against Hamas and why he believes the Islamist organization will lose the next election .
When YouTube burst onto the scene in February 2005 , it was n't long before this simple concept revolutionized the way people connect to each other and the way they define " the media . "
As Vancouver 9/11 Truth activist Michael Hey told The Corbett Report in a recent interview : " I shudder to think where we would be right now if we did n't have YouTube , or if we did n't have the various video hosting services that we have , " he said .
" Think of the example of Montebello in 2007 where there were agents provocateurs who were outed by citizen journalists . "
Indeed , the type of citizen journalism characterized by groups like Vancouver 9/11 Truth ( who have confronted such Canadian politicians as Stephane Dion and Michael Ignatieff ) and We Are Change ( which has made a name for itself engaging in its own unique style of guerilla journalism ) is due in large part to the viral spreading of videos on YouTube , the largest and still most - visited of the video sharing sites .
If a picture is worth a thousand words , then surely a video of Luke Rudkowski confronting Zbigniew Brzezinski about his possible involvement in 9/11 is worth a thousand articles attempting to explain the incident .
But precisely because these videos are having such a large effect on the political landscape , there is now a backlash by the corporations whose interests are threatened by a renaissance of grassroots citizen journalism .
As The Corbett Report has detailed in the past , the fears of insidious corporate control over YouTube generated by Google ’s takeover of the site in 2006 have been realized slowly but surely .
First , GooTube responded to requests by Senator Joe Lieberman to take down videos that the government deems violent or hateful ( including , of course , 9/11 Truth information ) .
Then YouTube 's parent , Google , quietly announced that its staff " pick and choose " what sites appear in its search results , a move with obvious implications for political censorship .
Next , GooTube nixed the highly - popular Bulletin system that helped users quickly spread important videos .
The latest move toward the shutting down of free speech on YouTube is the introduction of algorithms that automatically compare audio and video content against databases of copyrighted material .
YouTube can then either place ads on the content and give the proceeds to the copyright holder ( as happened to this Corbett Report video ) , mute the audio ( as happened here ) or remove the content entirely ( as happened to some previous Corbett Report videos ) .
Of course , the algorithm fails to take into account issues of fair use ( such as the transformative nature of the work or its allowable use for commentary or news - related purposes ) and the " appeal process " offered by YouTube , not being arbitrated by a third party , still gives YouTube dictatorial control over any and all content on its servers .
By now , these facts are well understood by those who use YouTube or any other large , corporate - owned video sharing service .
The question for activists and those with politically - sensitive content that may be in danger of being arbitrarily removed is how to preserve this information for the future .
Although there is certainly no silver bullet that will provide the solution to the problem of internet censorship , there are some very simple things any internet user can do to help insure that important information is not wiped from the internet altogether .
One such idea is simply to propagate the information on multiple websites .
If information is only uploaded to YouTube , there is obviously the danger that it will be suddenly and unexpectedly removed from the web .
This is the electronic equivalent of putting all of your eggs in one basket .
If the original uploader of the video is unwilling or unable to upload the video again , that video is effectively lost forever .
To help combat this problem , all users should help propagate important videos by downloading them and re-uploading them to different video sharing sites .
The process is extraordinarily simple and once mastered can take as little as 10 minutes , yet may help preserve access to the information for the future .
For those unfamiliar with how to download videos from video sharing sites , there are numerous tutorials and instructional videos that will walk you through the process , as well as sites that list dozens of software tools and websites that exist for this very purpose .
Once a video has been downloaded , simply follow the registration instructions for one of the many other video sharing sites out there ( such as LiveLeak , DailyMotion , Blip TV , etc. ) and upload the video there .
A simple process like this can help insure important information is not lost to future activists , researchers and concerned citizens ( as happened here ) .
Another important part of defeating corporate censorship is to support small , independently - operated video sharing platforms .
One such platform is VeracityVideos.com , the video sharing website recently launched by Zeke McLeskey of NewsX.info .
In a recent interview for The Corbett Report , McLeskey explained the importance of using such non-corporate independently - run websites for disseminating important information : " You can't really replace Google Video , but I wanted to make something that people could use to store their videos without the worry or concern of censorship . "
Stressing that the ability to combat censorship was the website 's primary concern , McLeskey added , " I build the servers , I host the servers , I built the website .
Everything is here with me so I do n't have to worry about anyone tampering or censoring any of the media . "
Click on the player below to listen to the full interview with Zeke McLeskey :
Of course , just as putting all of one 's information eggs into one YouTube basket is a recipe for disaster , so too is relying on one alternative site a bad idea .
In order to reach the maximum number of people , reduce stressloads on alternative news source servers and maximize the chances of information being preserved , it would be wise to upload important videos to as many different sites as possible .
Again , there is no magic bullet that will solve all censorship problems , but a concerned public should make every effort to insure that important information becomes as difficult to remove from the public record as possible .
As part of this effort , The Corbett Report will continue to upload new videos ( including upcoming installments of Al Qaeda Does n't Exist ) to a number of different sites , including YouTube , DailyMotion and VeracityVideos .

The New Media ( podcast episode )
A new technique developed by scientists at UC Berkeley and University of Massachusetts Amherst may drastically increase the ability of devices to store things .
Cal officials called the technique " innovative and easily implemented , " on Thursday .
The method lets microscopic nanoscale elements precisely assemble themselves over large surfaces .
Scientists said the technique could soon open doors to dramatic improvements in the data storage capacity of electronic media .
" I expect that the new method we developed will transform the microelectronic and storage industries , and open up vistas for entirely new applications , " said co-lead investigator Thomas Russell , director of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at UMass Amherst and one of the world 's leading experts on the behavior of polymers .
" This work could possibly be translated into the production of more energy - efficient photovoltaic cells , for instance . "
Russell conceived of this new approach with co-lead investigator Ting Xu , a UC Berkeley assistant professor .
They describe their work in the Feb. 20 issue of the journal Science .
" The density achievable with the technology we 've developed could potentially enable the contents of 250 DVDs to fit onto a surface the size of a quarter , " said Xu .
How it Works …
Xu explained that the molecules in the thin film of block copolymers - two or more chemically dissimilar polymer chains linked together - self - assemble into an extremely precise , equidistant pattern when spread out on a surface , much like a regiment of disciplined soldiers lining up in formation .
For more than a decade , researchers have been trying to exploit this characteristic for use in semiconductor manufacturing , but they have been constrained because the order starts to break down as the size of the area increases .
Once the formation breaks down , the individual domains cannot be read or written to , rendering them useless as a form of data storage .
To overcome this size constraint , Russell and Xu conceived of the elegantly simple solution of layering the film of block copolymers onto the surface of a commercially available sapphire crystal .
When the crystal is cut at an angle - a common procedure known as a miscut - and heated to 1,300 to 1,500 degrees Centigrade ( 2,372 to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit ) for 24 hours , its surface reorganizes into a highly ordered pattern of sawtooth ridges that can then be used to guide the self - assembly of the block polymers .
With this technique , the researchers were able to achieve defect - free arrays of nanoscopic elements with feature sizes as small as 3 nanometers , translating into densities of 10 terabits per square inch .
One terabit is equal to 1 trillion bits , or 125 gigabytes .
Because crystals come in a variety of sizes , there are few limitations to how large this block copolymer array can be produced , the researchers said .
They also noted that the angle and depth of the sawtooth ridges can be easily varied by changing the temperature at which the crystal is heated to fine - tune the desired pattern .
" We can generate nearly perfect arrays over macroscopic surfaces where the density is over 15 times higher than anything achieved before , " said Russell .
" With that order of density , one could get a high - definition picture on a screen the size of a JumboTron . "
" It 's one thing to get dozens of soldiers to stand in perfect formation in an area the size of a classroom , each person equidistant from the other , but quite another to get tens of trillions of individuals to do so on the field in a football stadium , " Xu added .
" Using this crystal surface as a guide is like giving the soldiers a marker so they know where to stand . "
Other research teams across the country are engaged in similar efforts to break the size barrier of self - assembled block copolymers , but this new project by the UMass Amherst - UC Berkeley scientists differs in that it does not rely upon advances in lithography to achieve its goals .
In the semiconductor industry , optical lithography is a process in which light passes through a mask with a desired circuit pattern onto a photosensitive material , or photoresist , that undergoes a chemical change .
Several steps of chemical treatment are then used to develop the desired pattern for subsequent use .
To keep up with Moore 's Law and the demand for increasingly smaller features for semiconductors and microprocessors , industry has turned to nanolithography and the use of ever - shorter wavelengths of light at greater cost .
" The challenge with photolithography is that it is rapidly approaching the resolution limits of light , " said Xu .
" In our approach , we shifted away from this ' top down ' method of producing smaller features and instead utilized advantages of a ' bottom up ' approach .
The beauty of the method we developed is that it takes from processes already in use in industry , so it will be very easy to incorporate into the production line with little cost . "
An added benefit , said Xu , is that " our technique is more environmentally friendly than photolithography , which requires the use of harsh chemicals and acids . "
UC Berkeley and UMass Amherst have filed a joint patent on the technology .
The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation helped support the research .
LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Traveling by train in Britain is generally more expensive than in any other European country , especially for those who use London commuter services , according to a survey by a consumer watchdog released on Thursday .
The study by Passenger Focus , carried out at the government ’s request , found that travelers were unhappy about the value for money train travel offered , although they were generally content with the quality of rail services .
“ Price of tickets is a key factor behind this , but so is performance , overcrowding and managing delays , ” said Colin Foxall , Passenger Focus chairman .
“ By comparison with some other European countries , Britain ’s railways are generally more expensive , especially in London and the south east . ”
There has been growing anger among rail users about the rise in the price of tickets , with regulated fares -- season , saver and standard day return tickets -- allowed to rise annually by at least the rate of inflation plus 1 percentage point .
That meant these tickets rose by an average of 6 percent in January this year , although some commuters to the capital saw tickets go up by 8 percent .
“ Tackling overcrowding and continuing to improve punctuality are key , ” said Anthony Smith , the watchdog ’s chief executive .
“ In the short - term we believe removing train companies ’ ability to increase some prices by more than the headline inflation plus 1 percent can help . ”
The survey did find that British travelers did fare better than their European counterparts in terms of train frequency .
It also said long - distance travel to London could be cheaper than fares to many European destinations such as Paris , Milan , Amsterdam , Madrid and Zurich if people were able to buy advance tickets .
However , it said the system for buying tickets for long - distance journeys was too complex , and needed to be more transparent and made fairer for passengers who needed to change their travel plans .
The Campaign for Better Transport said the survey showed the government needed to take action to cut fares .
“ Passengers already know fares are higher than anywhere else in Europe , and they ’re sick of the government making them pay above - inflation fare increases every year , ” said Cat Hobbs , the group ’s public transport campaigner .
Second Danish bank bailout in four months
By Jordan Shilton
23 January 2009
A new rescue package for Denmark ’s banks was agreed late Sunday night .
Amounting to 100 billion Danish kroner ( DKK ) — or roughly € 14 billion — it was the second bank bailout in four months .
The bailout is expected to be officially ratified later this month .
According to Politiken , the plan involves the government buying up bank stocks in order to sell them when conditions permit .
Given the gloomy outlook for the world economy in the coming years , there is no likelihood of such an upturn any time soon .
Despite making token appeals for executive pay to be limited in the institutions taking part in the scheme , the opposition Social Democrats supported the bailout , along with all the parliamentary parties except the small Red-Green Alliance .
At the start of October , as financial markets crashed across the world , the government offered an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits , including some forms of unsecured debt , and set up a bank rescue fund worth DKK35 billion that the banks would pay in to over a three year period .
This followed moves by Denmark ’s central bank to take over EBH bank , the country ’s sixth largest , as well as the collapsed Roskilde bank , the country ’s tenth largest , last summer .
Since then the government has been forced to admit that the economy will be in recession throughout 2009 , and that levels of unemployment will increase .
Whilst the current rate of joblessness remains comparatively low at 2 percent , it has increased by 12 percent since August , with economists forecasting that it could double in the coming period .
A recent central bank report substantiates such forecasts , predicting that unemployment will reach 200,000 in the next two years , up from the current level of around 50,000 .
The report , released earlier this month , threatened that 2009 would likely see further banking failures as economic conditions deteriorate .
The Danish Confederation of Industry ( DI ) suggested that exports would see the worst decline since World War II due to falling demand and the increased strength of the kroner compared to other international currencies .
Towards the end of 2008 , the central bank was compelled to raise interest rates twice within one month in a desperate bid to maintain the kroner ’s peg to the euro .
The result was a 1.75 percent difference in interest rates between Denmark and the Eurozone .
A fifth of all foreign currency reserves were used in October alone in further efforts to defend the currency .
While interest rates were reduced by 0.5 percent in December , this was a result of the dramatic worsening of the outlook for Denmark ’s economy .
On January 16 , interest rates were reduced for the second time within a month , from 3.75 percent to 3 percent .
The economic uncertainty has prompted a re-emergence of the question of Danish membership in the euro .
Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has urged that a referendum be held on the euro during this electoral term , which expires in 2011 .
The outcome of such a vote would be far from certain , with polls indicating substantial opposition to the euro .
While few details have been forthcoming on the proposal , it is clear that ordinary people will pay for the bailout .
The government is pushing forward with a proposal to reduce the top level of income tax .
Cutbacks in welfare spending are also under way .
In its budget for 2009 , the government did not provide an increase for the welfare budget , in spite of the anticipated jump in those who will be out of work .
A recent report in Politiken stated that the government would have to take “ radical action ” .
This could involve severely limiting access to unemployment benefits , as well as increasing the retirement age .
Plans to slash budgets for public services in other areas have been implemented .
In the education sector , government support for Denmark ’s universities has been cut by 2 percent .
This has resulted in a drop in student enrollment in some of the main universities this academic year , as well as plans from some institutions to reduce the courses on offer and the length of their semesters .
Copenhagen University has been left with a budget shortfall of DKK45 billion as a result , raising the threat of job losses .
Helge Sander , the science and technology minister , showed little concern stating that , “ The schools have to streamline like every other institution ” .
As the recession deepens , lay - offs have been announced across the economy as a whole .
The first came last September in the banking sector , but have since spread to construction and the service sector .
At least 13,000 jobs were lost in the construction industry by the end of 2008 , including 8,000 skilled positions .
Recent announcements of job losses include the brewer Carlsberg , which is laying off 200 workers , stereo and television manufacturer B&O , also reducing its workforce by 200 , and the pension company PFA Pension , which will reduce its staff by 10 percent .
Problems have also hit some newspapers and printing companies with the free popular daily Nyhedsavisen forced to halt publication last September due to financial problems .
Then in November , it was announced that Denmark ’s largest printing company , Trykkompagniet , would be closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs .
The company , which is owned jointly by two of the country ’s main publishers , had run up a loss of DKK60 billion over the last five years .
Surveys of businesses indicate that the numbers of unemployed will continue to increase .
Of around 800 top executives surveyed in September , 30 percent revealed that they planned to make lay - offs in the next few months .
Amongst small firms , employing between 5 and 10 workers , 25 percent of those surveyed in December declared that lay - offs were imminent .
Another problem confronting ordinary people is the continuing collapse in the housing market .
Last summer , predictions suggested a drop in prices of 10 percent in two years .
But the course of events show this to have been optimistic , since prices fell in 2008 by a record 9 percent nationally , although in some areas prices dropped by as much as 20 percent .
Further reductions will follow , with Handelsbanken predicting a further 10 percent drop in 2009 .
Danish homeowners are some of the most indebted in Europe .
Last year , the Central bank estimated that at least 50 percent of Danes were failing to pay back their mortgages but were instead paying back only the interest under a scheme known as “ deferred mortgage payments ” , which had been introduced in 2003 .
Compounding the problems in the housing markets has been the move of many estate agents to increase charges for selling homes in an effort to boost their financial position .
While it has long been the practise in Denmark that an estate agent is only paid additional fees if the property is sold , this is no longer the case .
The downturn in the housing market played a significant role in the collapse of a number of the banks that failed last year .
EBH , which was taken over by the central bank in September , had extensive involvement in housing , while Roskilde bank was heavily involved in providing loans to property developers .

Back in November , I wrote about my suspicion that we 'd just gotten mugged by the original Troubled Asset Relief Program .
As far as I can tell , we just keep on getting mugged … over and over , and always in the name of averting imminent disaster .
Stick 'em up !
TARP has turned out to be an expensive and chaotic nightmare lacking in accountability or transparency .
For example , a Wall Street Journal article in January pointed to political interference in some bank bailouts that took place under TARP .
OneUnited Bank , a seemingly insignificant name , appeared to be getting TARP money because of the intercession of Rep. Barney Frank , who wrote into the bill a provision specifically intended to help that bank … which just happens to do business in his home state .
This kind of chicanery is by no means uncommon .
In fact , there 's about $ 300 billion in spending in the " new and improved " TARP package that seems a little frivolous , considering how dire we keep being told our circumstances are .
Allotting $ 200 million to " design and furnish " the Department of Homeland Security headquarters ?
Maybe the government can hire John
Thain to advise on ways to waste other people 's money on decorating , since he apparently knows about cool things like $ 35,000 commodes .
So much for the government 's self - righteous indignation about the greediness of the free markets -- apparently , Capitol Hill has some of its own tendencies to engage in self - interest at the expense of others .
Other people 's money
Citigroup ( NYSE:C ) and Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) just keep getting more and more funding from the government .
How is that working out ?
If General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) is any indication , not so well .
The automaker recently said that -- surprise ! -- despite its last dose of highly controversial public money , it already needs of another bunch of billions or it 's going down … suckers .
The stimulus package has also inspired lots of controversy over boneheaded ideas like an ill - conceived " Buy American " provision that many companies drooled over -- although notable standouts such as General Electric ( NYSE: GE ) and Caterpillar ( NYSE : CAT ) took a stand against any such provisions .
Meanwhile , our new Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , has come up a bit short on details -- again , what a shock -- with the new version of TARP .
All we 're getting is exactly the same kind of financial " bazooka " rhetoric that was supposed to instill confidence back in the fall -- even though there was n't a coherent , understandable plan to be found .
If nothing else , the Obama administration is sure keeping the scare tactics from last fall ratcheted up , now that we 've endured the threat of a complete economic catastrophe if the $ 787 billion stimulus package had n't passed .
And do n't even get me started on the ugly irony with Geithner 's tax problems .
Since he 's so busy doling out taxpayer money , I 'd like to think that he -- the Treasury secretary , of all people -- would at least pay his own taxes .
Mugging one 's neighbors
The $ 75 billion plan to attempt to stem foreclosures is supposed to help 9 million borrowers , but here comes moral hazard again .
How many of these borrowers could n't afford their homes in the first place ?
And what about those who saved money , paid their mortgages regularly and on time , or rented and waited for prices to fall to the point where they could buy ?
Those people are screwed .
They get no justice .
In fact , they 'll end up subsidizing all kinds of other people , including those who did n't act as responsibly .
There was always a commonsense , buyer - beware risk that the housing market was in a bubble and that asset prices simply do not always go up , especially when they 've gone up in such an unprecedented fashion in so short of a time .
I think we need a lot more foreclosing , and maybe even a good bit of bulldozing .
Sorry , Toll Brothers ( NYSE : TOL ) and Beazer ( NYSE : BZH ) .
The building frenzy was part of a massive disconnect from reality , and the growth was n't real .
The homebuilders came up with bizarre growth models that reflected the complete dream state that suggested that everybody could have a McMansion .
It 's too bad , but the American dream turned into a nightmare , and trying to coerce some of us to pay for others so that we can attempt a return to that dream state is n't going to put us back on the path to true prosperity .
Grab your Mace … here come the suits again
The bailout mentality -- whether it involves bailing out Wall Street or ( supposedly ) Main Street -- absolutely stinks .
Moral hazard is alive and well and causing a lot of resentment among lots of Americans .
Taxpayers are on the hook , and our future generations are hopelessly indebted as the powers - that - be scramble to save people from their own faulty decisions and reinflate a bubble that was never economically feasible in the first place .
A consumer - debt - driven economic utopia with something close to full employment , and in which we could all have whatever we wanted , whenever we wanted it , with the bill coming due at some indistinct point in the future , was never realistic .
It was a Siren song , and like all Siren songs , it was dangerous and left us in a mess .
What 's real are the trillions upon trillions of dollars in debt that our country is racking up .
And that debt is not only propping up bad players -- it could well take our troubled economy and mess it up even more .
( Fellow Fool Christopher Barker recently came up with a tally of about $ 10 trillion in outlays . )
So there you have it .
We 're all getting mugged , again and again -- and it all gets a little scarier with every passing day .
For all of the talk of restoring confidence , I do n't how we 're supposed to feel better when we just keep on getting rolled .
Do you think these muggings are anywhere near over ?
I sure do n't .
Of course , there 's no use in practicing your self - defense moves ; these guys are n't too worried about you or me , or what we think of their thuggery .
Just get the ice packs ready for your aching head and your bleeding wallet -- and those of your descendants .
See you again in a couple of months .

Meditation helps kids with ADHD
Meditation can help improve symptoms in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , an international psychiatry conference heard this week .
The Australian study in 48 children diagnosed with ADHD found Sahaja yoga meditation led to an average 35 % reduction in symptom severity over six weeks , and enabled many to reduce their medication .
Study co-author , Sydney general practitioner Dr Ramesh Manocha , told the World Psychiatric Association conference in Melbourne this week that improvements occurred in behaviour , self - esteem and relationship quality .
Children said they slept better and were less anxious at home .
They also said they could better concentrate and had less conflict at school .
Parents were happier , less stressed and more able to manage their child 's behaviour .
The trial , at the Prince of Wales Hospital , Randwick , taught the technique to children under 12 taking ADHD medication and their parents .
The technique uses visualisation , music and nature plus one - on - one instruction .
For six weeks they attended two sessions a week at the hospital and meditated twice a day at home while soaking their feet in cool salt water .
" We had remarkable results .
Overall there was about a 35 % improvement in symptoms , which was significant , " Manocha says .
" Six were able to go off medication and their behaviour normalised , 12 halved their medication and another group reduced it by about one - quarter .
" Feedback from children was the best , things like ' I always knew what I was doing was not good and upset people but now I can control it ' . "
In the moment
Manocha , who has taught Sahaja yoga meditation to patients in the past , says the meditation is about being in a state of mental silence and not thinking .
He says it gives people the ability to tap into the present moment .
" Kids are generally naturally meditative ; they think in the moment , " Manocha says .
" Children with ADHD are inattentive , hyperactive , impulsive but meditation is the opposite .
It focuses attention , is still and in control of urges .
" This re-teaches kids who have forgotten these skills and lost their natural ability to meditate because something in their environment is off balance .
" It gives them a tool to get back into the normal zone . "
The study has been published in the journal Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry .
Ever tried out Facebook Lexicon ?
It 's a nifty tool that looks for occurrences of certain terms on Facebook users ' walls and creates a graph that shows how often the term is mentioned over time .
The Lexicon has been around for quite a while now , but while playing with it today I noticed an interesting occurence , which you can see in the image below .
Terms like " happy birthday , " obviously , are mentioned pretty much all the time , while " Obama " has had a huge spike during the presidential elections and the subsequent victory of Barack Obama .
However , the term " sex " has an unexplainable spike on Friday , May 30th of 2008 .
Perhaps it 's just a glitch , or maybe I 'm missing something obvious , but I can't for the life of me remember why people would mention this word more on that particular day than any other day .
Any ideas that can solve the mistery ?
Shoe - throwing journalist Muntather Zaidi told his family he would never apologize to President Bush for hurling his footwear at the American leader , even if he is chopped into pieces , his brother said after visiting him for the first time Sunday .
Muntather has become an unlikely hero to America ’s critics for lobbing his shoes at Bush a week ago during the president ’s surprise trip to Baghdad .
His actions have been praised by religious leaders , ordinary people and governments hostile to the United States and even prompted marriage offers .
Muntather , from the Cairo - based satellite channel Baghdadiya , has been locked away and kept out of the public eye since last Sunday .
The Iraqi government announced earlier in the week that Muntather had written to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki requesting forgiveness for attacking Bush .
But Muntather ’s brother Uday challenged the government ’s assertions after the family ’s first visit with the shoe - thrower .
“ ‘ Muntather said that he was forced to apologize to Maliki and he will never , never apologize to Bush even if they cut him into small pieces , ’ ” Uday told The Times after his visit with his brother .
Uday said his brother had lost a tooth and his nose had required stitches because of the beatings he had suffered in custody .
“ There were multiple bruises all over his body .
There were cigarette burns behind his ears .
He was beaten with metal rods .
His eyes were swollen .
They have assigned two medical doctors … to provide him with treatment in order to hide the evidence of torture , ” Uday said
A judge investigating the case told the Associated Press on Friday that Muntather showed signs of having been beaten in custody .
According to his brother , Muntather had no regrets for attempting to hit Bush at a joint press conference with Maliki .
He said Muntather told him : “ ‘ I do not regret what I did .
If I went back in time , I would do the same thing . ’ ”
Uday said his brother wanted the world to know that he threw the shoe not for money , fame or an ulterior motive and had been ready to die .
“ ' I thought I was going to be shot immediately as I saw the bodyguards with the guns standing there , but I really did not care .
I was prepared for anything because I did this for my country , ’ ” Uday said his brother told him .
Meeting with Iraqi reporters on Saturday , Maliki criticized Muntather for giving the world a “ bad image ” of Iraq and harming the reputation of its journalists .
Even so , Maliki said he made sure the journalist had a pillow , clean sheets and clothing his first night in captivity .
He vowed the courts would decide Muntather ’s fate .
Before speaking , he listened to Iraqi reporters condemn Muntather ’s behavior .

Chicagoist 's " Beer of the Week " : Goose Island 's Mild Winter Ale
By Chuck Sudo in Food on Dec 10 , 2008 8:00 PM
Goose Island 's been working a lot with rye malt recently .
Their Juliet ale , brewed with rye , marionberries and aged for six months in Robert Kraig cabernet casks , has been a popular selection among those Chicagoist staffers who 've tasted it ( Jacy and myself ) .
This week , we 're featuring another rye - based Goose Island offering that 's been flying off shelves .
" Mild Winter " can be read as wishful thinking for the type of winter we 'd like to have .
It 's also Goose Island 's latest brew .
It 's a surprisingly malt - forward and spicy ale , even for one with rye as the primary malt , so we asked Goose Island 's Mary Pellittieri for more info about the ingredients .
Pellittieri did n't disappoint .
Mild Winter is a tawny red ale uses roasted barley and dark chocolate malts , in addition to rye , and hopped using Pilgrim , Willamette and Tettnang .
Pellittieri said that Mild Winter was designed as an English mild ale , but with a high specific gravity and 4.4 percent ABV content , it does n't finish like one .
Goose Island has been hosting pub crawls in conjunction with Mild Winter 's release .
The next one is Saturday in the South Loop form 2 - 9:30 p.m .
The crawl starts at Reggie 's Music Joint ( 2105 S. State St. ) and moves to Krolls Bar and Grill ( 1736 S. Michigan Ave. ) , Weathermark Tavern ( 1503 S. Michigan Ave. ) , Grace O' Malley 's ( 1416 S. Michigan Ave. ) , Wabash Tap ( 1233 S. Wabash Ave. ) , and Blackies ( 755 S. Clark St. ) .
IF you can't make that , get your hands on a sixer of this week 's " Beer of the Week , " Goose Island 's Mild Winter Ale .

Scientists in Florida have come up with a strange way to stop crocodiles from crawling into cities and towns .
[ social_buttons ]
Florida ’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is testing a program to strap magnets onto the heads of crocodiles that wander into developed areas , saying the magnet could “ break the homing cycle ” and prevent them from returning .
When a crocodile is captured , wildlife officials place a magnet on the side of its head , which supposedly disorients the animal .
Before releasing it , they remove the magnet and tag the tail for later identification .
Officials have already tried the procedure on three crocodiles , but it ’s too soon to tell if it worked .
The scientists got the idea from similar programs in Mexico that have reported success .
Crocodiles are known to travel over 10 miles a day to return back to their home habitat — even if the location they were delivered is much more suitable to their survival .
The process hopes to keep more crocodiles in the wild ; typically , if the animals return to a developed area more than three times , they ’re moved to captivity .
Only 2,000 wild crocodiles remain in South Florida , but they ’re on the upswing .
They were moved from endangered to threatened by the US Fish & Wildlife Service in 2007 .

A grog of rum and an issue of The Economist should handle any sleep problems you may have .
But , if you 're one of those who think drinking alcohol is wrong but drinking psychiatric medications is right , then this is for you .
It 's not just less .
It is taking only a certain kind of receptor system , and avoiding others which wake you up .
What do you use to sleep ?
I do n't sleep anymore .
Most people think of sleep as the opposite of wakefulness , a line with two poles , you slide the switch back and forth .
In fact , there are two regions in the brain , working at the same time .
A wakefulness promoting region , and a sleep promoting region , battling each other , and your mind , for supremacy .
Simply as a convenience to me for the purposes of writing this post , I 'll call the " wakefulness promoting region " the tuberomammillary nucleus , and the " sleep promoting region " the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus .
The TMN sends histamine projections all over the cortex .
Histamine causes arousal , increased attention , perhaps increased learning and memory .
All of these are good and holy things .
Antihistamines are competitive blockers of H1 receptors ; they block the histamine from binding and thus prevent arousal , etc .
They are thus the work of Satan .
The VLPO sends inhibitory GABA projections everywhere to turn down / off places which are aroused by projections from the TMN .
It also sends projections to the TMN itself , to turn it down / off , to Dark City you .
GABA agonists -- benzodiazepines like Xanax , Ativan , Restoril , and the " non-benzo " Ambien and Sonata type , and alcohol , delicious , delicious , alcohol , all work this way .
No doubt .
No , not really , individual results may vary but the main difference is how you feel when you wake up .
The problem with these GABA agents is that no matter how aroused you try to make yourself ( through the TMN , coffee , or porn ) you still have the effect of the drug lingering in your body .
Hence , you can be an " awake drunk " or a " caffeinated masturbator . "
People may feel completely refreshed after 8 hours of sleep with Ambien yet still have decreased reaction times and impaired cognition as a result of the Ambien .
It probably is mild enough not to be relevant unless you get up really early to perform surgery , but such people would never dream of getting drunk the night before or taking an Ambien .
Right ?
And the longer the half life of the drug , the longer it is in your body , the longer the effect is there ( again , even if not obviously apparent . )
If , however , you are on a pure H1 blocker , then you could simply release more histamine ( e.g. wake yourself up ) to displace the drug from the receptor .
An H1 blocker may be the way to go if you perhaps have to get up suddenly in the middle of the night .
Ah , many people have this reaction .
You'd be surprised to learn that this is due to , and a screen for , very low levels of testosterone .
Psyche .
The real reason is that it is n't actually an antihistamine .
That 's misleading .
You know how I hate the FDA , and most everyone else in the world , because they use words to distort the truth , and get girls to sleep with them that would never sleep with me ?
Pay attention .
Here is the affinity chart for Benadryl : ( from CNS Spectrums
The drug has the most affinity for H1 receptors , sure , but look what else it does .
M1 blockade ( dry mouth , constipation , confusion . )
It also has significant NE and serotonin reuptake blockade .
Basically , the FDA decided to pick only one of these four properties and slap it on the box , in the same way as labeling a TV dinner as " Rice .
" You 'll also observe that it looks like it works the same way as Effexor or a tricyclic .
You'd be right .
Think about that .
Depends on the dose .
If you eat all of this TV DINNER , you 'll be getting several foods .
But if you only take one single fork of the rice , then the only thing you ate was rice , even though the box says , " TV DINNER .
" If you only take a low dose of Benadryl , then you are only getting H1 blockade .
If you take a medium dose , then you are eating only the rice ( H1 blockade ) and the cogentin ( M1 blockade . )
A high dose gets you all of the TV DINNER and receptors blocked ( and also a heart attack -- hey , the analogy holds ! )
If you imagine that the drug prefers H1> M1>NET >a1>5HTT , then you see that the mistake most people make with Benadryl is that they increase the dose when if does n't work .
What you really want to do isthe dose , to get away from all the other things that could be ( serotonin , NE , anticholinergic . )
Highest bar=highest affinity = " happens at lower doses .
" Trazodone works best around 50 , not 25 , because he first thing trazodone gets you ( at the lower doses ) is serotonin , not H1 blockade .
Elavil is not a good choice , because there 's really no way to dose low enough that you 'll avoid the other stuff ( serotonin . )
The best is tiny doses of Remeron ( 3.25 -7.5mg ) or doxepin ( 1 - 5mg ) .
Doubling the dose is not twice the sleep , it is the addition of entirely new drugs ( receptor systems . ) 3 mg of Doxepin is 3 mg pure H1 blockade .
100 mg of Doxepin is 6mg H1 blockade , some Cogentin ( M1 ) , Effexor ( S/N ) and Hytrin ( a1 ) .

Medium Contacts Nonexistent Brother
Details Written by Harriet Hall Published : 17 February 2009
I 'm always on the lookout for skeptical depictions of mediums in fiction , such as Robert Browning 's delicious poem " Mr. Sludge the Medium . "
I just found another example where I least expected , and I wanted to share it with readers of Swift .
Latin American literature is famous for " magical realism " and its fiction is replete with ghosts and spooky doings .
Yet I found a thoroughly skeptical view of a medium in Mario Vargas Llosa 's novel " Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter . "
The protagonist is taken to a séance by a friend .
The medium is a widower who discovered the spirit world during a phase of abject loneliness after his wife died , and he comments that séances not only allow one to continue seeing and hearing departed loved ones , but they are entertaining and are a great way of killing time .
His description makes it sound like a séance is comparable to watching a movie or a sports event , only more boring .
In his unimaginative version of the other life , the spirits get sick , fall in love , get married , reproduce , travel ... the only difference is that they do n't die .
He calls up several spirits from Purgatory and engages in stunningly inane conversations , " How are you ?
It 's so nice to hear you .
Pray for me .
Give my regards to X . "
The protagonist 's friend asks the medium to call up someone who is in Hell .
The medium , without even hesitating , explains that he can only contact spirits in Hell during the first 3 days of uneven months and even then you can barely hear their voices .
The protagonist asks the medium to contact his brother John , who promptly comes and tells him ( through the voice of the medium ) not to worry about him because he is with God and is praying for him constantly .
The protagonist thinks to himself that his " brother 's " message is a bit surprising , considering that he is an only child !
On the way home , he kids his friend , saying that all the poetry and mystery of the afterlife have been destroyed for him , that he can no longer be agnostic but has been forced to recognize that the afterlife is real - and now he has to live with the certainty that death turns everyone into imbeciles , and he can only look forward to an eternity of cretinism and boredom .
Vargas Llosa is listed as a humanist laureate by the International Academy of Humanism .
Oh Look Out !
Part 27 , The Paul Is Dead Hoax
by John T. Marck
Learn all the facts surrounding the " Paul is Dead " incident of 1969 .
Was it merely a rumor or a planned hoax ?
Find out the songs and album covers that support the theory .
Note :
In the picture at right , Paul is the only one wearing a black carnation ; the other three Beatles ' have red .
Oh Look Out !
Songs and Albums of The Beatles Part 27 The " Paul Is Dead " Rumors Well , Here 's A Clue For You All ... "
So , was the " Paul Is Dead " incident a hoax , or perhaps a marketing ploy , or merely just a coincidence ?
- we may never know for sure .
It all stated , as best as we can determine , like this .
Allegedly , on Wednesday , November 9 , 1966 , at five O'clock , Paul was driving home when he took his eyes off the road to glance at a very attractive meter maid .
As he approached an intersection , he did n't know the traffic light had changed to red .
He passed thru the intersection , against the red light and crashed into another vehicle .
It gets better !
Then as a result of this horrific crash , Paul was disfigured , and because he teeth were knocked out , no dental records could be used to identify him .
Then because there was a fire in the crash , his hair was burned .
What makes this widely known story ever more fascinating , is that the other three Beatles knew this person was Paul .
But , do n't spend much time trying to analyze this as to the car 's identification , or other normal procedures - it is n't worth the time .
Just believe for the moment that the rumor got stated , and by whom we do not know , but that Paul died in this crash .
It is also said that the newspapers were stopped from reporting the accident , and no police report was completed .
Then as the story goes , a Paul McCartney look - alike contest was held , and the winner was a man named William Campbell , although this was never announced .
The story goes on that Campbell received plastic surgery to made him look as close as possible to the real Paul , but had a scar on his lip , etc .
Most of these rumors surfaced in 1969 , when it was discovered that there were many supposed clues as to Paul 's death in their music , especially when some areas were played backwards .
The quest for more and more clues continue today .
There are people who say they have found clues to Paul 's death in their " Butcher Album " which is actually the album " Yesterday and Today , " as well as " Rubber Soul " and " Revolver . "
However , since these albums were all released prior to November 9 , 1966 , that is not likely .
What many people have done is to take words and phrases from their songs and turn them into other meanings .
Anyone can find a different meaning to almost any phrase if you try .
This is one of the reasons I wrote my column on The Beatles , to explain exactly what each song really means .
However , I will admit there are some strange things in their various songs and album covers that make you wonder .
As Sgt. Peppers 's Lonely Hearts Club Band was the first album released after the so - called car crash where Paul was killed , it does get interesting .
So now , here are some of the things and clues that I am aware of in the continuing saga of the " Paul Is Dead " rumor .
When you read these , some make perfect sense , yet others are really stretching the theory .
But it has been fun searching for all these clues over the years , and wondering , what if ?
Is it all just a coincidence or was it planned by The Beatles ?
A marketing ploy maybe - but then why ?
How about the fact that when the rumor really took hold in 1969 , this was just prior to McCartney releasing his first solo album with the breakup of The Beatles imminent ?
As I said earlier , who really knows .
This may go down in history with " Who Killed President Kennedy , " and who is Elton John really talking about in his song , " Someone Saved My Life Tonight . "
We may never know .
There are many more than noted here , but I have only included the most reasonable ones .
Some ideas are really stretching this theory too far ...
And now , Here 's A Clue For You All ... Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band : On the Front Cover : 1 . ) All the people are looking at a freshly dug grave .
2 . ) Paul is holding the musical instrument cor anglais , and it is black , symbolizing death , and the only Beatle holding a black instrument .
Where Paul is holding it with his left hand ( being left - handed ) he is displaying three fingers , meaning only three Beatles left ?
3 . ) This was the first album on Apple Records and the first album that the group wrote their name as " Beatles , " rather than " The Beatles . "
This is inferred to mean that they are no longer a whole as in " The , " but now since there are only three , it is just " Beatles . "
4 . ) The yellow hyacinth in the shape of a left - handed guitar only has three strings .
5 . ) The doll in the red , black and white stripes has a car model on her lap next to her right hand .
This model with red interior is supposed to mean the car in which Paul was killed and the red interior is blood .
6 . ) The other three Beatles ' are standing sideways behind the drum , except Paul who is standing forward .
7 . ) On the drum is written in the center " Lonely Hearts . "
Using a mirror , place it perpendicular to the center of the drum .
Splitting the words " Lonely Hearts " in half , the combined writing reads - 1 ONE 1 X HE DIE .
This means that the " 1 One 1 " equal three , or that Paul is gone , and the " X " is meant to cross out Paul .
Between the words " HE " and " DIE " is an arrow that points directly to Paul .
8 . ) The hand raised over Paul 's head , is to mean " death . "
The Back Cover : 1 . ) Paul is facing the back , which can mean that he is an imposter , or that he is dead .
2 . ) George 's right - hand index finger is pointing directly to the words " five o'clock , " the supposed time of the car crash .
3 . ) That the song lyrics " Within You , Without You , " are printed over Paul 's body .
The Songs : 1 . ) Lovely Rita : " When I caught a glimpse of Rita , " and " I took her home , I nearly made it . "
2 . ) A Day In The Life : " He blew his mind out in a car , he did n't notice that the lights had changed .
A crowd of people stood and stared , they 'd seen his face before ... "
3 . ) Good Morning , Good Morning : " Nothing to do to save his life . "
" People running around it 's five o'clock . "
4 . ) She 's Leaving Home : " Wednesday morning at five o'clock . "
5 . ) Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band :
The reference to Billy Shears is supposed to be that of William ( Billy ) Campbell , the look - alike .
Magical Mystery Tour The Front Cover : 1 . ) Paul is alleged to be the one in the " black " walrus suit .
2 . ) In the booklet , Ringo 's drums read " Love the 3 Beatles . "
3 . ) In the picture where The Beatles ' are wearing white tails , Paul is the only one with a black carnation , the other three have red .
4 . ) When you hold the album cover to a mirror , the word " Beatles " is a phone number , which is 2317438 .
It has been said that if you had called this number back then , a recording came on saying , " you 're getting closer . "
Of course there is no area code etc. , so I doubt this one too .
The Songs : 1 . ) I Am The Walrus :
At the end of the song , where the spoken words from the play King Lear are placed , you here " O , untimely death ! " and of course as we know , " The Walrus Was Paul . "
2 . ) Strawberry Fields Forever : When John Lennon says in the end of the song the words " Cranberry Sauce , " it was long believed to be he saying " I Buried Paul . "
However , it was electronically manipulated to sound like he was saying " I Buried Paul " but he actually is n't .
3 . ) All You Need Is Love :
At the end , Lennon says , " Yes , he 's dead . "
Yellow Submarine The Front and Back Covers 1 . )
Lennon 's hand raised over Paul 's head , indicating " death . "
The Beatles ( The White Album ) 1 . ) Glass Onion :
The term used for a coffin with a glass top .
2 . ) ' Do n't Pass Me By : " You were in a car crash .... "
3 . ) Revolution 9 : The words , " Number nine , number nine , " repeated many times are supposed to say when played backwards , " dead man , turn me on dead man . "
The reference to the number 9 is supposed to be that of McCartney having nine letters .
Abbey Road The Front Cover : 1 . ) The common meaning of the Beatles ' dress - Lennon in white for a priest , Ringo as the undertaker , George as the grave digger , and of course Paul , in his bare feet , holding a cigarette in his right hand ( being lefty ) all means death .
2 , ) The police vehicle parked to the right in the photograph is a morgue wagon .
3 . ) The Volkswagen parked on the left side of the street has a tag that reads , " LMW 28IF .
This has been construed to mean " LMW - Linda McCartney Weeps " and the " 28 IF " means that Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived .
Conclusion :
So there you have it , some of the so - called clues to his mystery , hoax or whatever you want to label it .
Are these clues likely to mean anything close to what they are supposed to mean ?
I seriously doubt it .
Are they coincidences - very likely the only answer ?
I do n't believe for a second that anything happened to the real Paul McCartney .
But , I will tell you this , that on Wednesday , November 9 , 1966 , Paul did have an accident .
On this morning , he was riding a motorcycle on his way to his Aunt Bett 's house , and did have an accident , which resulted in him clipping his tooth and cutting his lip .
He was later displeased with the doctor who cared for him because he received a scar to his lip as a result .
Knowing how the press reports incorrect information all the time , they very easily could have incorrectly reported that Paul died in this accident , which could have started it all .
Although it is unclear as to why this hoax or rumor was started , or exactly by whom , I will say it has been a source of entertainment over the years .
Anyone can look at a song , and if you are looking for clues to a death , can misconstrue any number of words and phrases to lend toward a belief .
I believe that when the rumor surfaced , hundreds of people began searching for clues .
With each new Beatles ' album , people were always trying to figure out what The Beatles ' were trying to say .
As ridiculous as some of these meanings here are , there are also many other absurd incorrect meanings to their other songs .
If you 'd like to learn the history of the various Beatles ' albums and what their songs ' mean , please take a look at my other articles on this site .

A Splendid Time Is Guaranteed For All
Obese older women who never took postmenopausal hormones are at almost double the risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to their normal weight peers , a new study finds .
Among all older women , however , obese women were only at slightly higher risk for ovarian cancer than those of normal weight , the scientists found .
Researchers at the National Cancer Institute looked at differences among women who had never used hormone replacement therapy because it may play a role in the development of cancer .
The comparison helps to tease out the effects of other risk factors , the authors said .
The study is to be published in the Feb. 15 issue of the journal Cancer .
The findings add to an ongoing scientific controversy over the potential association between body weight and ovarian cancer .
“ We speculate that what may be driving the increased risk among the obese is the surplus estrogen produced by the fat cells in the body , ” said Dr. Michael F. Leitzmann , a former investigator at the National Cancer Institute and first author of the paper .
Officials for the dating Web site said that they were approached and they signed a six - figure contract for the ad with PSP Sports , which creates and sells ads in many official programs for sporting events .
But we 've just learned that , even in this economy , not everything is fair game .
Noel Biderman , CEO of AshleyMadison.com , told CNBC that his ad was eventually rejected and was specifically told that the company would n't be allowed to advertise in any NFL game program until the end of time .
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that no one in the league office actually ever saw the ad .
" After realizing what the site was , the sales rep called back and told the company there was a mistake and that his company could not sell an ad to the site . "
Biderman thinks his inability to advertise is hypocritical .
" I find the rejection to be ridiculous given that a huge percentage of the NFL 's marketing content is for products like alcohol , which they sell in their stadiums , promote on their air and clearly have in the magazine , " Biderman said .
" That 's a product that literally kills tens of thousands of people each year .
So if the NFL is worried about legislating behavior and regulating what their audience should be exposed to then it should start with a ban on all alcohol advertising and products being sold , not AshleyMadison.com . "
AshleyMadison.com , a Canadian company , has been in existence for seven years , but has only been advertising in the U.S. for about a year and half .
" We do n't intend to let this pass , " Biderman said .
" This is our core audience and we will find a way to let them know about the existence of this service . "
The last program controversy occurred last year when the NCAA decided to remove a full - page ad for Hooters in its Final Four program .

This is kind of weird .
The Wikimedia Foundation wants to hold a vote on whether to distribute Wikipedia under a Creative Commons license , but
All existing Wikipedia content is licensed under the CC - incompatible GNU Free Documentation License , and
Free Documentation License , and Getting permission from all the contributors to change the license would be impossible , but
Most invocations of GNU / FSF licenses ( including Wikipedia 's ) permit distribution under any later version of the given license , so
/ FSF licenses ( including Wikipedia's ) permit distribution under any later version of the given license , so The Wikimedia Foundation prevailed upon the Free Software Foundation to release a new version of the FDL specifically giving Wikipedia ( and wikipedia - like “ Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Sites ” ) a time - limited option to switch to the Creative Commons Attribution Share - Alike license .
It 's a clever hack .
On a practical level it seems justified given it would be impossible to relicense under any other means .
On the other hand , I do n't really think it 's something that anyone would have had in mind when they placed their work under the FDL .
Update :
While I still have the same reservations , I can understand where this move is coming from .
For quite some time the GNU FDL was the only Copyleft license available that was not specific to software .
As such , many people ( Wikipedia included ) adopted it instead of having to take the trouble to draft their own license .
This move is a recognition on the part of the FSF that the Creative Commons is a more appropriate license for many of these works .
This situation is easy enough to resolve for single - author works or works where copyright was more carefully controlled .
The new exception gives more complicated projects the opportunity to say “ we chose the FDL by default , but if the Creative Commons had existed back then we'd have chosen that instead ” .
released hosted platform version 1.1.9 earlier this week with big boosts in capacity and compatibility .
The new App Engine supports standard HTTP libraries , larger files , triples the response deadline , and removes limitations on CPU - intensive processes .
Standard HTTP libraries
App Engine now supports
Python ’s standard web requesters urllib , urllib2 , and httplib .
Programmers on App Engine were previously required to use Google ’s proprietary urlfetch API , which still provides the best integration for the Google request gateway .
Support for standard Python request libraries means better compatibility with open source libraries developers would like to include in their web application .
30 seconds or die
App Engine scripts now have up to 30 seconds to respond to any incoming request , a big change from the previous 10 second limit .
I often request data from the web , process and interpret results , write to the datastore , and then issue a response to the consuming agent .
The extra headroom opens up new possibilities for data processing , especially in a programming environment without queues or background tasks .
10 MB response sizes
App Engine processes can now send and receive files up to 10 MB in size , a 10 x boost from the previous limit of 1 MB .
Need to share a podcast , PDF , or large image ?
It ’s now possible .
Developers can deploy up to 1000 static files of up to 10 MB each , creating up to 10 GB of geo - distributed static file storage per App Engine instance .
No more high CPU limitations
App Engine scripts are no longer limited to 2 CPU - intensive requests per minute .
Scripts are still limited to 30 active dynamic connections at any given moment ( under the free plan ) .
Processing power is made available on - demand for up to the full 30 seconds of your process .
Datastore now supports IN operator
Google App Engine ’s datastore now supports the IN operator for Megastore queries .
You can now query on a list of values instead of chaining data requests through a for loop , a big efficiency change for me .
Summary
Google App Engine raised its capacity this week and opened up new possibilities for developers creating web applications on its service .
The platform is still in free “ preview release ” without the ability to purchase additional processing headroom but the per-process restrictions have loosened up a lot .

Turbinado has the beginnings of a database ORM built in .
I ’m hoping to make it super simple to interact with a relational DB , but I ’m bumping up again import cycles .
Ticket about import cycles here .
The Problem
import qualified App. Models .
PageModel as Page import qualified App.Models .CommentModel as Comment someFn = do p <- Page.find " tutorial " -- find using a primary key of " tutorial " cs <- Page.findAllChildComment p let c = head cs p2 <- Comment.getParentPage c
Yeah , could be prettier ( hmm … maybe Rails ’ pluralization is good after all … ) , but that ’s a pretty nice way to access related Pages and Comments in a SQL database .
What _doesn ’t_ work , though are the imports .
Since Page.findAllChildComment returns Comments , PageModel needs to import CommentModel .
But , since CommentModel also uses the Page type , CommentModel needs to import PageModel .
And thus the cycle begins …
Fix #
1
The custom seems to be to push the data types out to a Types.hs file .
Assuming that Types.hs is imported and exported by all Models , then the following does n’t work :
import qualified App. Models .
PageModel as PageModel import qualified App.Models.CommentModel as CommentModel someFn = do let p =
Page {title = " blah " , content = " ack " , _id = " page1 " } PageModel.insert p False
Is the Page type the one from PageModel or from CommentModel ?
Both models export the Page type .
Update :
As Twan points out in the Comments , the above would work if I were happy to do either of :
let p = PageModel .
Page {title = " blah " , content = " ack " , _id = " page1 " } let p = CommentModel .
Page {title = " blah " , content = " ack " , _id = " page1 " }
Perhaps it ’s unreasonable of me , but I want to be able to refer to the type without being forced to refer to the module .
Besides , this post is really a gripe about import cycles , so I ca n’t have Fix # 1 work and still gripe …
Fix #
2
Push the data types out to a Types.hs file , but do n’t export Types from the Models .
Now you have to explicitly import Types whenever you ’re using a Model :
import App. Models .
Types --
I 'm not pretty ... import qualified App. Models .
PageModel as PageModel import qualified App.Models.CommentModel as CommentModel someFn = do let p =
Page {title = " blah " , content = " ack " , _id = " page1 " } PageModel.insert p False
Now Page is clearly taken from App. Models .
Types .
But my delicate aesthetic sensibilities are offended .
But wait !
We ’re still broken !
Since PageModel and CommentModel may use functions from each other , import cycles can still be produced .
For example , Page.findAllChildComment uses a function from CommentModel :
instance HasChildComment ( Page ) where findAllChildComment p = CommentModel.findAllWhere " page_id = ? " [ HDBC.toSql $ _id p ]
Now if CommentModel needs a function from PageModel , then an import cycle is formed .
So for the ORM to work relations in the DB can only form an acyclic graph .
That ’s bad .
Fix #
3
Even though PageModel depends on CommentModel , do n’t import it .
Just duplicate the CommentModel code into PageModel .
Ugly :
import App. Models .
Types instance HasChildComment ( Page ) where findAllChildComment p = do conn <- getEnvironment >>= ( return .
fromJust .
getDatabase ) res <- liftIO $ HDBC.handleSqlError $ HDBC.quickQuery ' conn ( " SELECT _id , commenter , page_id , post FROM comment WHERE ( page_id = ? ) " ) [ _id p ] return $ map ( \r -> Comment ( HDBC.fromSql ( r !! 0 ) ) ( HDBC.fromSql ( r !!
1 ) ) ( HDBC.fromSql ( r !! 2 ) ) ( HDBC.fromSql ( r !! 3 ) ) ) res
I ’m Sad
Haskell is such a lovely language , but my workaround for my module import cycles is pretty hideous .
Am I missing something ?
For one , beyond an early reference to the current goals of " sustainability , competitiveness and security of supply " , there is not a word about competition and market mechanisms in the whole Memo on the Strategic Energy Review ( pdf ) .
Not one .
I was amazed .
In fact , this memo , beyond a bit of fluff that can easily be ignored , is almost sensible !
Yesterday , on the basis of press reports , I noted that the new EU Energy Strategy was depressing , if predictable .
But today , the strategy was actually posted on the EU 's website ( you can find it here , with all supporting documents ) and , reading it , I find it much less offensive than the press makes it to be .
The EU approach to energy security Energy security is an issue of common EU concern .
With the integration of energy markets and infrastructures within the EU , specific national solutions are often insufficient .
And while each Member State is in the first instance responsible for its own security , solidarity between Member States is a basic feature of EU membership .
Strategies to share and spread risk , and to make the best use of the combined weight of the EU in world affairs can be more effective than dispersed national
actions .
From a medium to long - term energy security viewpoint , the EU 's 20 - 20 - 20 strategy is the right direction to go in .
An energy system with a diversity of non-fossil fuel supplies , flexible infrastructures and capacities for demand management will be very different in energy security terms than today ’s system .
In the short to medium term , Europe 's dependence on imports means that effective provisions for preventing and dealing with supply crises must be in place .
Europe can and must diminish its vulnerability to energy supply shocks , first and foremost by developing its own strengths , internally and externally .
The focus on solidarity , infrastructure , non-fossil fuel source and - gasp - demand management is not just appropriate - it 's downright refreshing !
Remember that the " 20 - 20 - 20 strategy " can be criticized for lack of ambition , but it certainly goes in the right direction ( the three 20s refer to 20 % share of renewables in energy sources , 20 % increase in energy efficiency , and 20 % reduction in carbon emissions , ie two of the three are effectively demand - side targets ) .
EU energy security and solidarity action plan The Commission proposes a five - point EU Energy Security and Solidarity Action Plan :
Infrastructure needs and the diversification of energy supplies
External energy relations
Oil and gas stocks and crisis response mechanisms
Energy efficiency
Making the best use of the EU ’s indigenous energy resources .
The press has focused on the first items , which include the usual suspects ( Nabucco , groan ) , smart stuff ( reinforcing networks connecting the Baltic countries to the rest of Europe ) and spectacular announcements ( a " supergrid " connecting offshore wind farms in the North Sea to various countries around it ) , and these , with the dubious exception of Nabucco ( which can be built only if gas is found to fill it , the only credible source right now being Russian gas , which rather defeats the stated purpose of reducing dependency on Russia ) , make a lot of sense .
Large - scale infrastructure and network development is definitely what EU energy policy should concentrate upon , and the parallel plans to increase reserves and crisis response mechanisms can only be applauded ( unless what is meant is countries with large reserve capacity - Germany , France , Italy , ie countries with strong long term import policies - being forced to share them with countries that did not bother to build any - the UK and its " efficient " liberalised markets , because that would be looting , not solidarity ) .
Energy efficiency ( with specific focus on construction standards ) and " domestic " energy ( ie renewables ) certainly need to be encouraged and supported - it 's smart policy that pays for itself very quickly , and it 's good to see it figure here prominently enough .
Even the paragraph on external energy relationships is sensible , with a focus on interdependency :
With producer countries outside Europe - notably Russia , Caspian countries - we need to develop a new generation of “ energy interdependence " provisions in our broad - based agreements .
As much as Europe seeks security of supply , external suppliers and industry seek security of demand .
This is quite correct - the only thing that 's lacking is that acknowledgement that longstanding policies by countries like Germany , Italy and France have done exactly this - and the fact that State - owned , or quasi- monopolistic companies ran these policies needs to be seen as part of the solution rather than part of the problem ... but at least the goal is there .
What is heartening is to see this memo dominated by two old - fashioned concepts : energy demand ( the side of the balance we actually control ) and energy infrastructure ( an acknowledgement that public policy is fundamental , both to set rules and to create the field on which other actors play ) .
What is more depressing is to see the media headlines focused almost exclusively on how that policy is " anti-Russia . "
But hey , train them long and hard enough , and they will keep on doing it even when you do n't actually want them to anymore .
In the early 90s , a trend developed among shoot - ’em-ups that was affectionately ( or was it rancorously ? ) dubbed “ bullet hell . ”
The impetus behind it was to add visual flair to 2D games in order to compete with the craze surrounding 3D games .
Arcade cabinets were more powerful than ever before , so these shooters could handle many more sprites and the extra calculations required for the accompanying collision checks .
The approach worked relatively well , providing plenty of “ Holy Shit ! ” moments .
However , there was one major issue : playability .
Shoot - ’em - ups tended to be one - hit kill games , and simply saturating the screen with harmful projectiles made them incredibly difficult ( if not downright impossible ) .
Now arcade games are meant to take your money , but that would n’t happen if no one played ’em .
In order to implement bullet hell without alienating customers , something had to give .
Part of Ikaruga ‘s solution was to make all bullets and your ship one of two colours , and then simply ignore collisions between like - coloured objects .
Other titles used shields and various powerups , but the original solution , and , in a way , the purest to the genre , was the ( roughly ) 1 - pixel collision box .
Instead of surrounding the majority of the player ’s ship with an area susceptible to fire , a single pixel was used to indicate its vulnerable spot .
This was a rather elegant solution as it required no other changes and did n’t present an extra hit to performance .
Players were also less likely to feel cheated if they came out on the positive end of some collision - fiddling .
The end result looked something like this :
The visual oddity of having the player ’s ship fly straight through harmful projectiles was lessened by the nature of the top - down perspective .
This view had issues with representing depth / elevation , and that actually made it easier to imagine bullets just skimming over the player ’s ship .
The 1 - pixel collision box also had the side - effect of making the player feel more skilled at the game , which — in the very least — provided the illusion of empowerment .
As a side note , something of a similar concept was used in an old Amiga shooter called Saint Dragon .
The player ’s ship , the eponymous Saint Dragon , consisted of a head and spiraling tail .
The head used regular collision detection , but the tail was purely aesthetic .
This added scale and personality , and allowed the player to control a vehicle that seemed grandiose despite being virtually identical to countless other shoot - ’em - up ships .
The head could be easily destroyed , but the tail would actually absorb many types of bullets and even damage most of the enemies it touched .
Supplemental :
Since I ’ve posted this article , it ’s gotten a lot of attention from numerous shmup enthusiasts .
Many have been eager to bring up the specifics of the tiny - collision - box phenomenon , as well as variations on the theme .
I think that ’s great , and one of the sites that has been pointed out to me contains a lot of interesting information on the genre .
Of particular note are its threads on shmup strategies , the dos and don’ts of good shmups , and the glossary of common shmup terms .
The Detroit Auto Show is underway , and the world ’s most famous vehicle brands are touting the next generation of cars .
And although yesterday ’s fervent promises of hydrogen - powered vehicles have mostly fallen away , they ’ve been replaced with new promises , this time centered around the idea of the electric car .
Do n’t believe the hype .
Although electric vehicles are almost certainly the way forward , much of the motion is really a show intended to sway the opinion of consumers and legislators in the short term .
Startups hope to build an early niche , and America ’s big auto makers are hoping their fervent hand - waving will bring accolades and government money — but in the near term , we ’ll see little motion in the industry .
Why , you may ask , when all the technology needed for electric cars already exists , and hybrids like the Toyota Prius have already been a sales success ?
If you ’ve been paying attention for the past year , you should know the answer .
For everyone else , here ’s a flashback to the distant year of 2008 , which was intended to start the electric vehicle Renaissance .
Tesla and Think flounder
If not for all the effort Tesla Motors and , to a lesser extent , Norway ’s
Think , put into marketing themselves , their failures last year might not have resounded quite to much .
Yet Tesla went to great lengths to brand itself the savior of the green car revolution and found itself feted by press and public alike .
It also won approval for a big auto - manufacturing plant in San Jose , Calif .
At first , with the exception of a bad transmission and some nasty company infighting , it looked like the plan might succeed .
Then the recession sank its teeth in .
October saw chairman Elon Musk step in as CEO and start layoffs .
From there the bad news kept rolling on : First came reports that Musk had the company on artificial life support in lieu of real funding , then late in the year , he admitted to the SF Chronicle that the San Jose plant , along with the Model S sedan , might not get off the ground .
Now , rather than going mass - market , it looks like Tesla will be going even more high - end .
For those in the know , Think was a close second to Tesla .
Fortune ’s Todd Woody has followed the company most closely — from its promising beginnings to its mid-December layoffs and consideration of a sale .
And an end to Think would obviously spell an end to Think North America , a Kleiner Perkins and RockPort Capital funded subsidiary .
Oil falls , SUV sales rise
Some environmentalists attempted to hide their smug satisfaction when oil prices shot up , putting a serious strain on the country ’s many SUV and truck owners .
Others shouted their scorn to the sky .
Indeed , one could hardly help feeling that a sort of heavenly economic vengeance had fallen upon the arrogant , wasteful owners of large vehicles .
You wo n’t hear much from those environmentalists now , aside from some angry mutters and reproachful tongue - clicking .
One of the year ’s last stories showed that as oil prices fell from their mid-year highs , buyers veered back to their beloved SUVs and away from fuel efficient vehicles .
( Note to those buyers : No , owning a Ford Explorer Hybrid does not make you cool . )
Batteries are really expensive
You can pick up a set of lead acid cells for a few bucks — but , as the saying goes , you get what you pay for .
Lithium -ion is the only battery technology suitable for pure electric cars
today , and although variants are being commercialized , they ’re usually lithium - based .
The price points announced this year for vehicles using lithium - ions , and the sad performance specs of the ones that do n’t , help to illustrate the bind we ’re in .
The bottom line is that all the best batteries use expensive ingredients that are n’t getting cheaper , and widespread use might even drive their price up , offsetting better manufacturing techniques .
Of course , new battery variants are under development , but read on .
Battery technology is really hard to develop
Lithium-ion batteries may be common today , but it ’s easy to forget that they were first introduced in the 1990s and took a decade to start showing up in stores .
What fewer people know is that they were first conceived of in the 1970s .
By contrast , the internet has grown from almost nothing to its current state in about a decade .
Exciting news about battery technology appears regularly .
But the unfortunate reality is that research into new , more effective ( and economic ) batteries is a materials science that takes a very long time to perfect .
Investment will help , but money can’t create technology .
Some might point to an alternative : Ultracapacitors .
Again , read on .
EEStor disappoints , again
To be fair to quiet Lubbock , Texas - based EEStor , the company has n’t made many public claims .
Then again , the company has n’t gone out of its way to dispel the rumors and claims others made about its technology .
One of those was partner Zenn Motors , which promised shareholders that EEStor ultracapacitors would be headed for Zenn electric cars in late 2007 .
That claim did n’t pan out , but the two companies suggested that mid-2008 would see prototypes delivered .
Come Christmas
Time , the ultra - secret energy storage devices were still nowhere to be seen .
Ultracapacitors are especially relevant to the above discussion on batteries , as it ’s hoped the former will improve the efficiency and economics of the latter .
Unfortunately , most companies in the field have yet to provide hard evidence that they can achieve much of anything .
Zap unmasked
One of the longest - operating electric car companies around is Zap , the creator of one of the first electric scooters and currently a seller of low - speed electric vehicles .
The company claims to be nearing completion of a high - tech , highway - speed car called the Zap X . ( Update :
In the comments below , a Zap employee says the X was shelved in favor of the Alias , which is listed on the company ’s website as having a late 2009 delivery date . )
But in March , a Wired exposé outed the company as a borderline - fraudulent operation with no ability to deliver .
The counter - argument is that some Zap vehicles are on the road today , proving that the company can produce a real product .
The company appears to be building a factory in Kentucky .
And chairman Gary Starr has been on a personal campaign to call reporters ( including yours truly ) and refute the Wired article .
Still , it seems a bit unlikely that Wired ’s fact checkers waved through a seven - page list of fabrications .
Silly rumors about solar do n’t help
Rumors intermittently popping up on the Internet throughout the year perpetuated a story of a solar - panel equipped Toyota Prius .
Excited comments suggested that the solar panels would help fuel the car .
Later , even more excited commenters suggest that the panels would provide the entire fuel needs of the car .
Unfortunately , this is just the sort of idiocy that ultimately leads to disappointment .
The reality is that a car plated with theoretically possible 50 percent efficient solar panels — an outlay that could cost more than the car itself , if such panels even existed — might provide enough power for 30 or 40 miles of driving , given a full day of charging in the desert ( or similarly sunny area ) .
But I would n’t try driving it through Death Valley without a wall - socket charge first ( or a spare battery ) .
As for whether a future Prius model will come with solar , that part is true .
But the reality just ai n’t exciting :
The low - power system will only power the ventilation system , not even the air conditioning , as some had hoped .
General Motors halts work on Volt factory
One of the year ’s biggest electric car stories has been the impending arrival of the Chevy Volt , a plug - in hybrid intended to run solely off its electric charge for the average commuter .
But late last month , General Motors announced that it would delay construction of the factory meant to produce the Volt ’s engine .
GM says that the halt will not delay the Volt ’s release in 2010 .
Then again , given the potential public outcry ( and the auto bailout at risk ) , can you imagine them saying otherwise ?
Missing in action
In the beginning of 2008 , I wrote an article listing every electric car company I could find .
Reviewing that list today is rather instructive .
Several companies , like American Electric Vehicle and Spark EV , no longer exist .
New models promised in 2008 by other companies have yet to appear , including Phoenix Motorcars ’ sport utility truck and the Aptera Typ - 1 .
Give ’em some credit :
There ’s a recession on , and having some problems delivering ( or surviving ) is entirely understandable .
But this recession might last for a long time .
The bright spots
It ’s not all doom and gloom .
There have been several shining lights for the electric car world .
Chief among them is Better Place , the electric car charging network that has now announced projects on three continents , including ours .
There ’s encouraging news from the hybrid market , with Toyota making more and better Prius models , and others like the Ford Fusion and Honda Insight appearing .
GM is opening a new battery plant , Tesla confirmed a supply deal , and Kleiner Perkins ’ John Doerr is promising a battery breakthrough .
But at best , it looks like commercializing and selling large numbers of electric vehicles will be a slow and challenging process .
Consumers have proved fickle in their interest ; a number of ventures will fail .
And there are definitely no magic solutions to leap from hybrid to full electric vehicles .
Death Strip Berlin Pays Tribute to Last Person Shot Crossing Wall
Chris Gueffroy died in February , 1989 while trying to flee across the Berlin Wall .
He was the last East German citizen to fall victim to the state 's policy of shooting escapees in the divided city .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. cut California 's credit rating Monday to the lowest level among all 50 states because of a budget impasse between Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers .
Mr. Schwarzenegger and state legislators have been deadlocked for three months over ways to close a budget deficit expected to reach $ 42 billion by mid-2010 .

The cheetah is in danger of becoming the latest casualty in the mass extinction of species .
The United Nations Environment Programme ( Unep ) said the big cat was critically endangered , and wants increased protection for the world 's fastest land animal .
Habitat loss , over - hunting and the lack of an effective captive breeding programme were blamed for the population decline to just 10 per cent of historic levels .
A total of 21 species , including the Irrawaddy dolphin , West African manatee , mako and porbeagle sharks , African wild dog and Egyptian vulture are listed for greater protection by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) .
Governments will be asked to restore habitats , clear migration routes and take other measures .
Unep , which administers the list , said the cheetah should get increased protection in 80 per cent of the countries it lives in , with three nations expected to opt out of the scheme .
A statement said the cheetah is extinct in 18 countries , adding : " Fewer than 10,000 adult cheetahs now live in Africa , and a meagre 50 in Asia , mainly around Iran 's Kavir desert . "
There are also fewer than 8,000 African wild dogs , a fall caused by conflict with humans and disease .
The species has been eradicated from western and most of central Africa .
" Fences on their migration paths further endanger these roaming predators , " Unep said .

What good would technology be if people were n't constantly using it to send naked pictures of themselves to each other ?
I would know , too — since the age of 12 , my inbox has been filled with inappropriate photos of people whether I wanted to see them or not ( in fact , there might be some in there right now ) .
Like most tech trends , however , the oft - inadvisable act of sending nude photos to people on the Internet is being adopted en masse by young Internet users , with fairly large numbers of teenagers posting them online or — even worse — sending them to people they do n't even know .
A survey of 1,280 teenagers ( users age 13 - 19 ) and young adults ( age 20 - 26 ) conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and CosmoGirl.com has revealed that one out of five ( 20 percent ) teens overall have posted nude photos or video of themselves on the Internet — that number goes up to a third when young adults are included .
While 71 percent of teen girls and 67 percent of teen guys who have sent these photos say they 've sent them to a boyfriend or girlfriend , 15 percent overall said they 've sent nude photos to people they only " knew " online .
For women , that percentage stays the same when they turn into young adults , although the percentage of young adult men goes up to 23 percent .
This is , of course , despite the fact that almost three quarters of all teens and young adults surveyed say that sending sexually - suggestive content " can have serious negative consequences . "
Clearly , this is an issue of " do as I say , not as I do . "
And do n't for a minute think that your sexy recipient is necessarily keeping your photos private — a quarter of teen girls and a third of teen boys said that they 've had nude images originally meant for someone else shared with them .
Perhaps unsurprisingly ( to me , anyway ) , that number stays about the same for young adult women , but 40 percent of young adult men say they 've had images meant for someone else shared with them .
Nothing , especially on the Internet , is sacred .
The organizations offer a handful of advice to young people to consider , such as the fact that nothing is truly anonymous , and there 's no changing your mind after posting something online .
Never , ever assume anything you post or send will remain private , and do n't give into pressure to do something you 're not comfortable doing , says the report .
Of course , these are all mantras that most Internet users — young and old — already know , but that has n't stopped most people from making poor decisions when it comes to putting questionable content online .
As a number of young adults have already discovered , having unprofessional materials about you floating around online can hurt your chances of getting ( or keeping ) a job .
Maybe we should all take a step back from that iPhone camera for a minute and think before hitting that " send " button .
No one 's bare butt is that interesting anyway .
For centuries , humans have dreamed of fading into the background .
Hunters have long wished to vanish into their surroundings , and these days , awkward moments at parties can evoke similar desires .
But the ability to truly disappear is still only found in tales spun by writers and filmmakers , as cloaking has remained the stuff of fantasy and science fiction .
Thanks to some pioneering researchers , however , cloaking has moved one step closer to reality .
Six scientists have built a sophisticated metamaterial that literally bends electromagnetic waves , according to a new paper published Thursday in the journal Science .
Ruopeng Liu and Chunlin Li , researchers in David R. Smith ’s lab at Duke University , along with three other colleagues , assembled more than 10,000 specially designed pieces to form a mat 20 inches long and four inches wide .
When finished , the yellow pad sucked microwaves in and spit them out — with a curve .
To test their new invention , researchers first beamed microwaves at a flat , mirrored surface .
The waves behaved as they should , bouncing off at a predictable angle .
Next they shot it at a bump in a mirrored surface .
The microwaves bounced and scattered , carefully obeying the laws of physics .
Then the scientists laid their yellow mat over the bump .
And the wave ignored the bump — or so it seemed .
After reflecting off the curved surface , the radiation veered downward and continued along a flat surface - trajectory .
The mat had cloaked the bump .

... I have a thousand of them , ” Thomas responded .
“ What are you going to do to fulfill your ideals expressed on the campaign trail ?
Or are you going to submit , like most presidents , just . . . try to carry out your promises that have no meaning except for how many people gave you money ? ”
What a different and welcome new era it will be : President Obama will respect Helen Thomas , instead of kicking her out of her well - earned front row seat , and he will then proceed to answer her questions .
In other words , he 'll act like a man instead of a spoiled , flippant , nasty little power - hungry brat .

It is near impossible to imagine any private company not enjoying the " problem " of high demand for its products and services .
Yet there are some products that are repeatedly reported as shortages .
There is one thing these products have in common : government intervention , typically in the form of price controls .
This is especially the case with water in Melbourne , Australia , and has been for at least a decade .
While supply of water is in many ways a complex issue , understanding economic shortages is not .
The government has blamed the shortage of water on drought and climate change .
And while droughts may be created by a shortage of water , water shortages are created by an abundance of government rein .
Despite almost yearly decreases in water storages in Melbourne ( see figure 1 ) , real prices have not increased significantly .
And currently the " Essential Services Commission " will be setting prices for the next five - year period .
This means , regardless of supply or any number of variables and uncertainty , ( real ) prices will remain roughly the same for five years .
In other words , expect continued shortages .
Instead of economical pricing there is political pricing , where pressure groups and special interests are given " rights " to use water during droughts , and at subsidized pricing .
Businesses are able to use water for irrigation in the name of boosting GDP , while individuals are asked ( or forced ) to consume less and less .
Government as the friend of the little guy is simply a myth .
Figure 1 : Total Volume of Water in " Melbourne Water " Storages
Of course one may argue that water is a scarce resource , and , therefore , naturally there may be shortages .
Yet all resources are scarce ; water is no different from wheat or copper in this respect .
Shortages do not exist in a free market because of the price system , including the profit - and - loss mechanism .
Imagine a private company experiencing an increase in demand for a product .
For example , if Australian supermarket chain Coles all of a sudden experienced an increase in demand for Vegemite , it would increase ( a ) its supply , or ( b ) its price .
But if Coles were " managed " by government , and experienced a decrease in the supply of Vegemite ( due to a lower supply of yeast extract for whatever reason ) , we can imagine " solutions " that might be offered : maybe Vegemite will only be offered on certain days of the week , or to those with last names between A–M , or to certain age groups , or only to individuals with red hair ; or maybe customers can only purchase one jar at a time and must make it last for six months before their next purchase .
Perhaps you might think I 'm exaggerating .
A look at the Australian government 's attempts to combat a water shortage should change your mind .
Here are some of the ( current ) restrictions :
A hand - held hose fitted with trigger nozzle , a watering can , bucket , and manual dripper system can be used to water from 6 –8 AM or from midnight to 2 AM .
Even -numbered houses can water on Saturday and Tuesday , odd - numbered houses on Sunday and Wednesday ; no watering is allowed on Monday , Thursday , or Friday .
Households with at least one resident aged 70 years or over may water their gardens manually on specified watering days from 6 –8 AM and 8 – 10 AM .
( Anecdotal evidence confirms that at least one 70 - year old adheres to this faithfully ; he has the only green grass on the street . )
A bucket filled from a tap can be used to clean windows , mirrors , and lights .
New pools or spas of any capacity cannot be filled .
Consult your water authority beforehand .
In addition , rebates are currently offered to customers who consume less water .
Imagine a private company like McDonald 's telling its customers to buy fewer Big Macs — and offering to pay them for it !
Now imagine McDonald 's spending money on an advertising campaign to convince everyone to consume fewer Big Macs .
How about sending you a free packet as a promotion on how to consume less ?
This is , in essence , what the government is doing .
You can even receive a free four - minute timer to make sure showers conserve water .
The government is wasting tax dollars on all of these activities .
What about penalties and enforcement ?
There will be " water patrols … out in force across Melbourne . "
After a warning and continued disobedience to the government 's water restrictions , your water supply may be restricted or you can face prosecution .
Could McDonald 's prosecute you for consuming more and more of its Big Macs ?
" While supply of water is in many ways a complex issue , understanding economic shortages is not . "
It is because of this economic nonsense that higher prices may be welcomed .
Higher prices ?
Are higher prices a good thing ?
Well , yes : in a free market they can be very good .
Higher market prices mean supply and competition will increase , and ( natural ) rationing will be encouraged .
It is important to remember that demand for a product occurs at a specific price .
To understand why higher prices are a good thing requires moving beyond stage - one thinking : it requires looking at the unseen .
Higher prices are a good thing for producers and suppliers of a good .
It encourages them to supply more of the good , and to look at further investment in order to supply the good in the future .
It allows the market to clear .
Since prices act as signals , akin to road signs that orient a driver , entrepreneurs will respond to high prices and innovate in finding alternative sources of water , or by transporting water over longer distances .
Labor and capital will be diverted into a search for more water , or more innovation in conserving and reusing existing water .
But these are up to entrepreneurs who innovate with technological recipes .
Eventually , once supply has increased to meet demand , competition ( or the threat of competition ) will then lead to lower prices .
It is not only water shortages that are caused by government monopolies but other social problems , too , including most activities government is involved in .
Murray Rothbard wrote the following regarding this totalitarian behavior :
Is there traffic congestion ?
Ban all cars !
Water shortage ?
Drink less water !
Postal deficit ?
Cut mail deliveries to one a day !
Crime in urban areas ?
Impose curfews !
No private supplier could long stay in business if he thus reacted to the wishes of customers .
But when government is the supplier , instead of being guided by what the customer wants , it directs him to do with less or do without .
While the motto of private enterprise is " the customer is always right , " the slogan of government is " the public be damned ! "
But can the solution really be so simple as letting the price rise ?
There are two things that need to be done : ( 1 ) let the price fluctuate freely , and ( 2 ) eventually privatize the supply of water .
Murray Rothbard explained :
If the government wants to conserve water and lessen its use , all it need do is raise the price .
It does n't have to order an end to this or that use , set priorities , or decide who should be allowed to drink more than three glasses a day .
All it has to do is clear the market , and let people conserve each in his own way and at his own pace .
In the longer run , what the government should do is privatize the water supply , and let water be supplied , like oil or Pepsi - Cola [ or Vegemite and Big Macs ] , by private firms trying to make a profit and to satisfy and court consumers , and not to gain power by making them suffer .
In a free market , no shortages would exist .
In fact , it is very unlikely any of the earth 's resources would be used up .
This is because the ( futures ) price would rise almost to infinity as supply decreased , which ( again ) would encourage higher prices , lower consumption , a natural rationing , innovation and competition , and an increase in the availability of substitutes .
Government control of the water supply ( or of any resource ) and the use of price controls will inevitably lead to shortages .
Yet that is not the only concern for Austrolibertarians : government control also leads to a loss of liberty , as demonstrated in restrictions , enforcement , and penalties enacted by government .
In order to eliminate a water shortage the solution is simple : let government rein fall .
Israel is not the only nation on the planet with the right to defend itself .
The Palestinian people have the same right to defend themselves from the US - Israeli concentration camps into which they have been forced to live .
The reason that the world signed on to the Geneva Conventions and the International Rules of War was precisely because of this international need for the right of every nation to self - defense .
( 1 ) These are the same conventions and laws that Israel has smashed at every turn in their current slaughter of the Palestinian people .
If every nation does not have the right to self - defense , then no nation can claim to have that right .
' The Bible ' is not a globally recognized basis for anything in secular or civil law , and given its conflicted history between the old and new testaments ; it apparently has no moral authority when it comes down to how any modern nation treats its people today .
The barbarity of the paternalistic order instituted under the terms of the Judeo - Christian ethic is a slander upon the rights and responsibilities of hundreds of millions of men and women everywhere .
Biblical ' CONQUEST ' carries " The Burning Flag of All Nations in its volcanic fist ; and is backed by the pawns of war upon the shield of WAR that has been used and abused since long before there was an " Israel . "
( 2 ) This is especially repugnant when those adhering to these outdated practices attempt to claim that among all the people of the earth ' they and they alone have been chosen above all other people on this earth . '
If Israel continues to cling to this insult , then she will just finish digging that grave for herself which apparently is her chosen goal .
Here 's a classic from Mordechai Eliyahu : " All civilians living in Gaza are collectively guilty for Kassam attacks on Sderot , former Sephardi chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu has written in a letter to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Eliyahu ruled that there was absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during a potential massive military offensive on Gaza aimed at stopping the rocket launchings .
The letter , published in Olam Katan [ Small World ] , a weekly pamphlet to be distributed in synagogues nationwide this Friday , cited the biblical story of the Shechem massacre ( Genesis 34 ) and Maimonides ' commentary ( Laws of Kings 9 , 14 ) on the story as proof texts for his legal decision .
According to Jewish war ethics , wrote Eliyahu , an entire city holds collective responsibility for the immoral behavior of individuals .
In Gaza , the entire populace is responsible because they do nothing to stop the firing of Kassam rockets .
The former chief rabbi also said it was forbidden to risk the lives of Jews in Sderot or the lives of IDF soldiers for fear of injuring or killing Palestinian noncombatants living in Gaza . "
( 3 ) Maybe what ' Israel ' was chosen for , is the example of how not to treat the rest of the planet - maybe this accounts for why she has been evicted from so many nations around the world since the days when Carthage was still powerful .
History matters greatly ; especially when there is such over whelming evidence of such an anti-social society as the one that has co-opted the Jewish state in its efforts to assist the money - changers in the enslavement of this world .
Israel is demanding that Gaza be permanently disarmed and that the Palestinian people never be allowed to resist them , " ever again . '
This despite the fact that virtually everything that Israel has done to what 's left of that nation has been done with the clear threat of exterminating an entire people .
Just take a close look at the Israeli Wall of Shame .
This makes the Berlin Wall look like a kindergarten exercise .
( 4 ) Israel plays with media - spin and global intimidation based on the full and obscene backing the Un - American Administration and especially the congress that has forgotten which country it supposedly represents , which makes everyone that voted for this criminal - act of support for the criminal - state of Israel , guilty of treason , against those Americans that disagree completely with this on - going war - crime in Gaza .
( 5 ) The flaunting of International Law and the contravention of all human rights inside occupied Israel must be terminated before that entire region is buried in clouds of permanent global war .
Obama is not going to do anything except to further the bloodshed in this international farce that is based on nothing but the self - serving lies of Israel and the corporate - state of America , so any attempt to stop this madness must come from the outrage of the world and especially from the Americans that make it all possible by arming and funding Israel to the teeth .

Professor
( Nicolas Cage )
opens a time capsule
with cryptic message ,
that has been dug up at his son’s (

.
which stars Nicolas Cage , Rose Byrne , Chandler Canterbury and Ben Mendelsohn
why he wanted to direct “ Knowing ” : “ As a filmmaker , you ’re always looking for an original story to tell , one that has n’t been told a million times before .
It seems like – in this time of remakes and reboots – if you can find something with even the whiff of uniqueness to it , I think that instantly piques people ’s interest .
It certainly did for me , ” Proyas told .
“ As we got deeper and deeper into this concept , it just kind of created all these wonderful possibilities .
All these notions that , if you knew the day you were going to die , or if you could have that information , would you want to know it or not ?
And it ’s a question that many people find hard to answer .
You can see the merits of both sides of the argument .
So it ’s just one real small example , but there ’s just so much , there was so much possibility in the story that we developed . ”
“ To me , it was a very kind of disturbing , intriguing concept .
That was really the genesis of my interest in it .
” The note in a time capsule has accurately predicted the exact location and timing of various disasters in history …
“ Knowing ” will hit theaters on March 20th .

In this report , we describe how the major international chains and local media do “ disappear ” Israel ’s responsibility in the military extermination in Gaza , using techniques of manipulation of language ( the title ) and “ concealment ” of victims and scene of destruction ( the images ) .
[ postpic=center ] 103505 [/postpic ]
From now on you are going to watch , read or hear the news about Gaza with another “ perspective ” of analysis .
And you will understand why the Israeli slaughter in Gaza , the most unique and unpunished military genocide of the entire modern history , is not considered a “ universal tragedy of all humanity ” .
The manipulative language [ / h3 ]
After more than 15 days of Israeli military extermination , and when the dead Palestinians are more than 910l , 3800 injured , including 270 children killed and another 1,100 injured , the “ news ” strategy of major international media networks controlled by Zionist capital is focused on one goal : Demonstrate that in Gaza there is not a Israeli military slaughter , but a “ conflict ” between Israel and Hamas .
There is a main category and a common approach to guide the objectives of media manipulation with the Israeli massacre of Palestinians in Gaza :
Demonstrate that there is not a military slaughter committed by Israel , but a “ war ” between Hamas and Israel in the same capacity level of destruction and fire power , although one is an urban guerrilla organization and the other is a military superpower with nuclear power .
This in turn refers to a second reading :
In Gaza there is a systematic military extermination by air , sea and land , a military from a superpower against a defenseless people , but a war between “ equal ” .
They equate Israel and Hamas in the same capacity for military destruction and failed to mention who is the attacker ( the invader ) and who is the attacked ( the invaded ) .
Which creates a third category of reading :
In Gaza , both Israel and Hamas , are guilty of violence and death .
Both Israel and Hamas killed and equally under the same conditions .
Omitted ( hidden ) in the first place is the evaluation and discrimination of the official figures of deaths caused by Israel , under the generic classification of deaths caused by the conflict in Gaza .
In more than 15 days of attacks by sea , by air and land , Israel killed over 900 Palestinians , wounded or maimed over 3,800 , 80 % civilians , including 270 children killed and another 1,100 wounded , according to the latest official count .
When spreading the information about the total dead count is not clarified ( hidden ) that Israel not only with their bombings killed and wounded thousands of civilians but also bombarded the infrastructure and destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , also creating with the blockade a situation of humanitarian catastrophe involving a million and half people .
It is not clear that Hamas , with its attacks on the invading troops and the firing or homecrafted rockets , in proportion only killed 5 Israeli civilians and 8 Israeli soldiers , with no children among the victims , and without destruction of the Jewish cities and their infrastructure .
[ banner=center , http://www.usdemise.com]94093[/banner]
And it does not differentiate between attacker and attacked , and the non-discrimination of the causes of this destruction ( how much , how and why each side kills ) which leads to a fourth category for reading this situation :
We must not stop the slaughter of Israel in Gaza , but we have to stop the process of violence in Gaza “ created by Israel and Hamas .
This manipulated concept ( ” violence from both sides ” ) is used both by the United States , the European Union or its “ Arab ” allies to propose a cease - fire covering the status of invader and the military responsibility of the Israeli military for the slaughter .
The rise of Manipulation
[ postpic=center ] 103534 [/postpic ]
The four categories listed ( simultaneous and interactive ) , lead to a conclusion :
In Gaza there is no military slaughter and economic genocide ( by blocking ) perpetrated by the State of Israel , but a “ process of irrational violence ” involving both Israel and Hamas , with responsibility shared by both parties .
In summary , the manipulation with the language of “ information ” generated a result :
A ) The disappearance of the role of attacker and invasive power of Israel in Gaza ( which would relieve the Jewish state to be charged and convicted for crimes against humanity ) .
B ) The disappearance of the overwhelming superiority of its military power with respect to Hamas ( which makes it possible to qualify as a “ war ” when it is clearly this is an unilateral military slaughter ) .
C ) The disappearance of accountability and responsibility of Israel in the mass killing of civilians , the physical destruction of Gaza and the condemnation deserved for causing hunger and a desperate humanitarian crisis by the blockade .
Let us illustrate these three levels with a title last Thursday on CNN ( the flagship chain that leads the manipulation in the world “ ) : ” Israel disobeyed the UN , and continues its war with Hamas .
The dead amount to 773 . ”
In summary , the now more than 910 Palestinians killed ( 80 % civilians ) were NOT produced during more than sixteen consecutive days of indiscriminate Jewish bombing by air , by sea and by land over Gaza and its people , but by the “ war ” between Israel and Hamas .
Titles in this light , are reproduced daily by millions and the rest of other international media channels ( TV and written ) , which in turn are “ copied ” by the local media channels around the world , becoming ” repeaters ” of the Zionists information centers .
Accordingly , and as an “ end product ” , which is handled in the brain of the viewer or reader massively manipulated ( integrated ) to be “ informed ” by the Zionist newspapers and TV system is :
” In Gaza there is a war .
And during a war there are killings and people death , on both sides . ”
In this way , the big media networks and their local “ repeaters ” worldwide converted the military extermination of Israel in Gaza ( a genocide with impunity and with their faces uncovered , unprecedented in human history ) , in a “ bureaucracy ” press release that is repeated in a title , a text of 20 words , and without analysis or comment , every thirty minutes , and mixed with the “ outstanding ” daily entertainment , sports and life idols .
Concealment techniques
[ postpic=center ] 103544 [/postpic ]
A ) What is a “ special coverage ”
When an event happens with tragic mass killing of people , major international media networks launch what is called a “ special coverage of the event .
These “ informational ” processes start happening when “ terrorist acts ” , natural disasters , accidents or events involve any act of killing and / or mass dead of people .
B ) How to instrument a “ special coverage ”
Take for example the CNN :
CNN launches a title , “ catastrophe ” for example : “ Terrorist attack in London .
There are hundreds of dead and wounded . ”
The title is accompanied by a wheel flashing on the screen with the word URGENT ! , and repeated “ presentations ” by the “ star ” news host to report on more details of the event .
When you get the pictures in “ live ” ( provided by international agencies ) , they begin to show the scene of destruction : death , injury , damage to buildings , and details of the event “ live ” by the correspondent installed in the area , including the testimonies of survivors , interviews with representatives of government agencies and civil organizations involved in rescuing the wounded and the dead .
The Live “ special coverage ” , mounted with all the stage of live images of the destruction and testimonies of victims , last according to the information assesment the management of the networkds make ( eg , 9/11 in USA lasted over 24 hours , and something similar happened with the 5/11 in Spain ) .
The “ planetarian leveling ” of these coverages through its rebound by the networks and local media in the five continents “ universalizes the tragedy ” to make the people around the world live the drama in the distance as if it were their own .
That is how they imposed a “ fear to terrorism ” on a global scale .
Once the main “ live ” coverage is abandoned , media networks orchestrate live mini-coverages every fifteen to thirty minutes to develop the same type ” information ” but more limited in time .
During the attacks of 5/11 in Spain , and in London , “ stars ” news host of CNN and other big networks , kept for hours transmitting “ live ” the disaster with images and testimonies , including stories and convictions to “ authors ” of the attack ( ie , in this case , the “ Islamic terrorism ” ) .
In the two “ terrorists ” events together the dead did not reach 300 .
As outstanding detail , it should be noted that in Gaza , where died ( by military murder ) over 900 people , one third of them children and women , they did not deserve the treatment of “ special coverage ” from the big media networks and the local media “ repeaters ” that broadcast their live coverage .
The “ disappearance ” of Gaza
[ postpic=center ] 103576 [/postpic ]
Israeli military extermination in Gaza , which lasted more than 16 consecutive days of bombing civilians in the plot to destroy the “ terrorist bunkers ” of Hamas has no treatment of “ special coverage ” in major media networks and local media .
The Israeli military massacre in Gaza , is not listed as relevant “ primary information ” for the big networks , but as an “ informative aggregate ” in the big package of information every day .
While the news about Gaza are in all segments of news , they have no relevance and the dynamics of a live coverage with correspondents in various scenarios , with views of witnesses involved in the slaughter , telling the tragedy live and direct .
The international news agencies have obtained full information about the slaughter ( part of which is on their websites ) through testimonies , pictures and videos that media networks buy but do not broadcast in their coverage .
By disguising the scene of slaughter and the testimony of victims , in addition to significant distortion of the facts and decontextualization of language ( calling “ conflict ” to what in reality is a slaughter ) media networks alter the understanding of what is happening in Gaza and reduce their impact on the psychology of mass viewers .
Headlines in their networks and local media replaced the word slaughter or invasion ( which is actually happening ) with “ conflict ” , “ confrontation ” or “ war ” removing Israel from its character of attacking power .
Similarly they replace the word ” murder ” ( which really is what Israel is doing in Gaza ) for “ people dead ” , which removes the real meaning to the Israeli military genocide against unarmed civilians .
Therefore , unlike the events that are treated with “ special coverage ” , the Israeli military slaughter in Gaza is not perceived by the media as a stage of “ universal tragedy ” by large majorities who develope their psychology , their behavior and emotions from what they see on the TV screen .
Information ( on screens ) about the military extermination in Gaza does not exceed the framework and format of conventional information or “ news ” , it is not valued as a “ universal tragedy , ” no testimony or live images of the victims and destruction , there are no clear signs of who is the “ author ” ( as with the “ terrorist ” attacks ) , there are no with correspondents in the field talking “ Live ” about the facts and these news are treated with almost no relevance mixed with the rest of the daily information package .
Indeed , in some media networks , the information goes about Gaza after the news about the sports or entertainment events .
During the more than 16 days leading to the Israeli military slaughter in Gaza , uninterrupted 24 hours , the networks and the local media , gave a “ special coverage ” to sporting events or “ individual tragedies ” and “ news ” about the Genocide in Gaza by Israel still has no importance – almost bureaucratically embedded in the “ package ” of daily information .
All major media networks and local media omit to show “ live ” the dead bodies and testimonies of the victims of the military slaughter .
The Final Product
[ postpic=center ] 103587 [/postpic ]
In summary , in Gaza , where more than 900 people were killed and wounded amounted to 3800 ( one third of all women and children ) , a population in humanitarian catastrophe who lack the resources ( food , health and infrastructure ) to survive and where entire cities and the capital were literally demolished by the Israelis missiles and cluster bombs , the heads of CNN and major networks decided ( “ assesing ” the information ) that the event of death and tragedy is not warranted a “ special coverage ” .
That in terms of manipulative power of television on a global scale is equivalent to declare Gaza as ” non-existent ” in the value frame of great human tragedies caused by military extermination .
What is so “ different ” about the blood of Palestinian children , women and men that do not warrant a ” universal tragedy ” character ( or Holocaust ) for large media networks and local media that hegemonize what is and what is not news at a global scale ?
Why to Zionist Jewish Capitalism that hegemonizes ( statistically proven ) the management and stock package of the mass media and television networks on a global scale , Gaza , Iran , Lebanon , and in general all the Islamic world , are a different human class to that of the billions of “ included ” in the capitalist system controlled from the U.S. and central European powers ?
For now , we are left with a specific verification :
For most governments and societies of the “ globalized world ” , the Israeli military slaughter in Gaza is nothing but a conflict between Israel and Hamas which resulted in deaths and injuries .
Period .
Gaza is only a journalistic headline and a set of crystalized images ( frozen ) that occasionally cross the retina of the “ included ” viewers in the capitalist world that look them almost with indifference .
Technically , the genocide of Palestinians by Israel and the human tragedy in Gaza , were “ erased ” from the cerebral program and operative system of large masses of people around the world subject to the existential dynamics of “ I watch TV , therefore I am ” .
Accordingly , for those who carry the brain microchip of the capitalist system ( massively installed as world “ public opinion ” ) , Gaza does not exist .

This explains why the Zionist and Jewish communities in the world can say ( with nobody surrounding their houses and their embassies , or boycotting and blocking their banks and companies in the world ) that ” Israel is only defending against terrorism in Gaza . ”

Leave it to a brainy Indian to come up with the cheapest and surest way to stimulate our economy : immigration .
“ All you need to do is grant visas to two million Indians , Chinese and Koreans , ” said Shekhar Gupta , editor of The Indian Express newspaper .
“ We will buy up all the subprime homes .
We will work 18 hours a day to pay for them .
We will immediately improve your savings rate  no Indian bank today has more than 2 percent nonperforming loans because not paying your mortgage is considered shameful here .
And we will start new companies to create our own jobs and jobs for more Americans . ”
While his tongue was slightly in cheek , Gupta and many other Indian business people I spoke to this week were trying to make a point that sometimes non-Americans can make best : “ Dear America , please remember how you got to be the wealthiest country in history .
It was n’t through protectionism , or state - owned banks or fearing free trade .
No , the formula was very simple : build this really flexible , really open economy , tolerate creative destruction so dead capital is quickly redeployed to better ideas and companies , pour into it the most diverse , smart and energetic immigrants from every corner of the world and then stir and repeat , stir and repeat , stir and repeat , stir and repeat . ”
While I think President Obama has been doing his best to keep the worst protectionist impulses in Congress out of his stimulus plan , the U.S. Senate unfortunately voted on Feb.
6 to restrict banks and other financial institutions that receive taxpayer bailout money from hiring high - skilled immigrants on temporary work permits known as H - 1B visas .

But the Tapeworm Diet has to get as extreme and desperate as the world of dieting tricks and methods come .
The good news is that importing or selling tapeworms in the U.S. is illegal .
Tapeworms though , do occur in undercooked beef or raw meat dishes which are prone to contamination .
So what does a tapeworm in your gut actually do ?
It secretes proteins in our intestinal tract that make our digestion of food much less efficient .
A less efficient digestive systems means that you can consume more calories through your food since your " body guest " is also noshing on them for his own growth purposes .
Some scientists estimate that those infected with a single tapeworm can lose up to one or two pounds each week .
Certain tapeworms can be downright lethal like a pork tapeworm , but for beef tapeworms , you can clear up an infection by taking a dose of antibiotics .
Some diet gimmicks have created tapeworm pills but since then the FDA has intervened and banned these unsubstantiated and dangerous products .
Do You Know the Best Diet Pills of 2020 ?
Weight loss is pretty much guaranteed
A scientist in Japan believes that tapeworms can also help clear up allergies like hay fever
Can be deadly
Banned by the FDA
Medical intervention may be needed to get rid of the tapeworm
There are side effects to having a tapeworm
Ca n't purchase or import one
Once you get rid of the tapeworm , you risk putting weight back if you continue eating like you have a tapeworm
The Tapeworm Diet is anything but a diet .
Since a sizable percentage of what you eat goes to the tapeworm , it 's a virtual dieter 's dream : eat whatever you want and lose weight .
Taking extra vitamins during an infection might help to prevent the massive nutrient loss .
Following an infection , all those lost pounds can be easily put back on if you do n't follow a healthy eating plan for just you and not your parasite .
Treatment for getting rid of a tapeworm varies from grotesque to the less grotesque .
A strong course of antibiotics is prescribed to get rid of the tapeworm .
Let us truly be thankful for the great strides in the hygienic practices of our farms and slaughterhouses and in our water supply .
Even though our bodies have evolutionarily become used to being hosts to a myriad of parasites , our modern day ways have no doubt helped us to stay healthier and live longer .
Voluntarily ingesting a tapeworm to lose weight is legally a difficult thing to pull off , not to mention dangerous .
Your safer and less uncomfortable way to shed some pounds is probably heeding the advice of science and research : Consume less calories and stay active .
Needless to say , this is one approach to weight loss that is not smart nor safe and should not be persued by anyone .

“ Credit , the disposition of one man to trust another , is singularly varying , ” Walter Bagehot , the financial journalist , wrote 135 years ago .
“ In England , after a great calamity , everybody is suspicious of everybody ; as soon as that calamity is forgotten , everybody again confides in everybody . ”
He might have been describing modern - day Wall Street , where trust  and credit  are in short supply .
The financial crisis began in the credit markets , and eventually it will end there .
But as the financial industry rounds out one of the most wrenching years in its history , bankers and policy makers are struggling to see the way out of this mess .
Despite triage by Washington and trillions of dollars of taxpayers ’ money , credit is not flowing nearly as much as many had hoped .
The problem , as Mr. Bagehot observed , is trust  or rather , the lack of it .
Even after receiving millions , in some cases billions , of dollars from the government , banks are reluctant to lend money .
Crucial parts of the financial system have stopped functioning .
The exuberance of the boom , which led bankers to make loans to people who could not repay them , has given way to a seemingly intractable fear of making any loans at all .

( Adds military officials and North Korea media )
SEOUL , Feb 13 ( Reuters ) - North Korea has been assembling its longest - range missile at an east coast launch base and could test - fire the rocket by the end of this month at the earliest , a leading South Korean daily reported on Friday .
South Korean and U.S. officials have warned prickly North Korea not to launch its Taepodong - 2 missile , which is supposed to eventually be able to hit Alaska but has never successfully flown .
It blew apart seconds after it was last tested in 2006 .
North Korea recently transported the first and second stage of the Taepodong - 2 to its missile base on a special train and has been assembling the pieces at an indoor facility to prevent spy satellites from watching , the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported intelligence sources as saying .
" We assume that they are currently assembling the first and second - stage rockets , " the paper , which is South Korea 's largest , reported a South Korean government official as saying .
The missile , thought to be about 36 metres ( 118 ft ) tall , needs to be positioned vertically , sent to a launch pad and fuelled .
These operations can be viewed by U.S. spy satellites , which can give the outside world a warning several days in advance that a launch is imminent , it said .
[ ID : nSEO310845 ]
South Korean military officials would not confirm the report .
If fired successfully , it will likely go over Japan , experts said .
Market players expect sentiment to be dampened by any test but the recent rumblings have not had an impact on shares .
North Korea , which tested a nuclear device in 2006 , does not have the technology to miniaturise an atomic weapon to mount as a warhead .
It also has several hundred ballistic missiles with ranges that can hit all of South Korea and Japan .
CLINTON TRIP
North Korea , which analysts said may be stirring up tension to grab the attention of new U.S. President Barack Obama , will be high on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's agenda when she visits Asia next week , her first trip abroad since taking office .
When she visits Tokyo , Seoul and Beijing , Clinton is likely to discuss how to approach North Korea , which in 2005 pledged to end its nuclear arms programmes under a disarmament - for - aid deal it struck with China , Japan , Russia , South Korea and the United States .
North Korea may also be preparing to launch short - range missiles near a disputed Yellow Sea border with South Korea off the west coast , South Korean officials say .
Analysts said launches may also be aimed at putting pressure on South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , who angered his destitute neighbour by cutting off what once had been a free flow of unconditional aid shortly after taking office last year .
" Missile moves are designed to strengthen ( the North 's ) internal control , " said Choi Choon - heum , a senior research fellow at the South 's Korea Institute for National Unification .
He said the North 's leaders can use the launches to try to show their people the state is powerful enough to stand up to the United States and South Korea despite its poor economy .
The North will celebrate leader Kim Jong - il 's 67th birthday on Monday and a parliament meeting in early March .
Kim appears to have recovered from a suspected stroke in August .
North Korea has been holding celebrations to mark Kim 's birthday with fireworks over Kim 's reported birth place , communist oath - takings and a film festival where documentaries such as " Cherishing the Leader 's Desire " were shown .

Los Angeles ' top financial supervisor on Monday urged the city to privatize dozens of major public operations in order to generate more revenue to offset current and projected budget deficits .
A report released by the office of Controller Laura Chick recommended the city privatize operations in nine broad areas , including an airport , animal shelters and city - owned golf courses .
The report identified the privatization of Ontario International Airport , the third largest airport in the Los Angeles area , as the one that could generate the most revenue for the city .
The report also proposed joint development with private partners of vacant or underutilized city parcels .
Chick said in a letter to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council that the cost of delivering essential services keeps growing at a rate that exceeds the city 's ability to generate revenue , and is a major reason the city has had a structural deficit for years .
" When it comes to looking at how the city can fulfill its obligations to the public , and pay for it , no subject should be taboo , " the official wrote .
Privatization attempts have met with stiff opposition from public employee unions in the past .
Chick said she knew that many suggestions in the report would the touch nerves of public employees and their union leadership , and thus the report recommends including labor as a partner .
State and municipal governments across the United States have been struggling to balance their budgets as tax revenues keep declining amid a deteriorating U.S. economy .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Many Americans applauded President Barack Obama ’s move Wednesday to rein in pay at companies getting taxpayer aid but some felt uncomfortable about the government wading into the private sector .
“ Thank you Mr. President .
It is definitely time , ” said flight attendant Dawn Berry of Obama ’s plans to cap pay at $ 500,000 for executives of struggling Wall Street firms receiving bailout funds .
Berry , standing outside a coffee shop in Scottsdale , Arizona , said Obama ’s move might send a message to other senior executives : “ Do n’t go around living high on the hog when you have employees who are wondering each day if they come in to work if it ’s going to be their last day . ”
Obama , who chided Wall Street chiefs for accepting billions of dollars in bonuses last year while the economy staggered toward collapse , had promised compensation reform as part of a package of stricter regulations on the financial industry .
Obama said the measures were needed to restore trust in the financial system and make certain that “ taxpayer funds are not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street . ”
Chicago realtor Cathy Ivcich agreed .
“ If you come begging for money and you ’re broke , you do n’t get a prize , ” she said , questioning whether executives deserved even $ 500,000 “ after playing loose and free with the company ’s money . ”
The move also requires firms getting exceptional government funds to limit additional compensation to stock that cannot be cashed in until the bailout money is paid back with interest .
“ I think it ’s great , ” said Kevin Jarrott , a small business owner in Atlanta .
“ You get rewarded with bonuses for good business .
If you are not meeting your objectives , you should not be rewarded . ”
GOING TOO FAR ?
The move to limit executive pay drew fire from some on Wall Street , who said it could prompt talented executives to flee companies that fall under the guidelines .
Despite the tarnished image of Wall Street and other firms involved in the financial crisis , the ideal of a free market and small government remains strong in the United States .
Jeff Schnedl , 42 , a real estate agent in Cincinnati , was uncomfortable about the federal government playing a greater role in private sector decision - making and pay .
“ I do n’t like it , ” he said .
“ Someone who is going to rebuild a company and make them more money -- that is the way that business runs .
You ca n’t put a cap on that .
It ’s hard for someone outside an industry to come in and put a cap on bonuses or commissions . ”
For Kevin Washington , 41 , a clothing store worker in San Francisco , the measure was meddling in corporate affairs .
“ A company has a right to pay what they want to pay .
Some of these CEOs do a damn good job and they deserve to get appreciation shown , ” he said .
“ If you do a great job , you deserve to be rewarded for it . ”
Outside a Phoenix area coffee shop , social worker Neill Keller said he felt uneasy about the government intervening to impose pay limits on “ private corporations . ”
“ For me it ’s more of a philosophical problem , ” he said .
“ We want government out of our lives but it seems like we are going the opposite direction . ”

THE newly unearthed remains of the world ’s largest snake could settle a debate over whether global warming will bump up temperatures in the tropics .
Some researchers say tropical temperatures will rise in line with the rest of the world .
Others say the “ thermostat ” theory means there is a limit to how hot they can get .
Jason Head at the University of Toronto , Canada , and colleagues dug up the 60 - million - year - old relative of the boa constrictor in a Colombian coal mine ( Nature , DOI : 10.1038/nature07671 ) .
Temperature can affect body size , and for the snake to grow to 13 metres long and weigh over 1 tonne , the tropics would have to have been at about 33 °C , 7 °C warmer than today ’s average .
This “ refutes the idea of the thermostat ” , says Head , and tells us “ what equatorial temperatures will be as we continue to warm the planet : very hot . ”
The makeup of Congress changes every two years when voters elect Representatives in the House and some members of the U.S. Senate .
So which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives now ?
Which party has the power in the U.S. Senate ?

The 114th Congress was notable because Republicans won their largest majorities in the House and Senate in decades after voters used the midterm election in 2014 to express dissatisfaction with a Democratic president , Barack Obama .
Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 elections .
Said Obama after the results became clear : " Obviously , Republicans had a good night .
And they deserve credit for running good campaigns .
Beyond that , I 'll leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterday 's results . "

The 110th Congress is noteworthy because its members were elected by voters frustrated by the protracted war in Iraq and the continued loss of American soldiers .
Democrats were swept into power in Congress , leaving Republican President George W. Bush and his party with diminished authority .
University of California political scientist G. William Domhoff wrote : " The unexpected Democratic victory hobbled the right wing of the power elite and returned moderate conservatives to the central position they had held on policy issues for decades until the Republicans took control of the White House in 2000 and then both houses of Congress in 2002 . "
Said Bush after the results became clear in 2006 : " I 'm obviously disappointed with the outcome of the election , and as the head of the Republican Party , I share a large part of the responsibility .
I told my party 's leaders that it is now our duty to put the elections behind us and work together with the Democrats and independents on the great issues facing this country . "

Bethesda ’s upcoming DLC for its large scale role playing title Fallout 3 will apparently suffer a delay from the previous target dates of February and March .
Bethesda marketing VP Pete Hines quoted to GameSpot :
“ The next DLC for Fallout 3 , The Pitt , will be out in March , Broken Steel will be out the following month , in April . ”
This contradicts the developer ’s previous statement that the 3 pieces of extra content would be “ set to arrive one per month beginning in January . ”
The Pitt has players exploring the raider infested town of Pittsburgh , while Broken Steel picks up and continues after the main game concludes ; bringing the level cap up to 30 as well .
The first batch of DLC , Operation Anchorage , arrived late January , giving PC and Xbox 360 owners a chance to experience the liberation of Anchorage for a mere $ 10 .
Tuesday , 06 Jan , 2009 Technology
Recently a popular toy manufacturer presented a new game in which players have to guide a small ball through several obstacles using only the power of their mind .
The game is entitled Mind Flex and it comes together with a brain - scanning headset .
The latter measures the brainwaves and then transforms them into energy .
The goal of the mind - game is to concentrate hard enough to be able to produce the necessary amount of energy that could power a fan which makes the ball go up and move it through a course of obstacles .
The game was developed by Mattel , which is the world 's largest toy importing company in terms of revenue .
The company 's products include Barbie dolls , Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars .
Mind Flex debuted in the United States .
Experts consider that the mind - game will be among the most discussed toys at the Consumer Electronics Show 2009 , held in Las Vegas .
It is worth mentioning that the company did not provide any information on how its game would work , but it did inform , however , that Mind Flex would be launched in the United States this year at a price of $ 80 , reports The Telegraph .
It is expected that such games as Mind Flex will be very popular in 2009 , due to the fact that the games industry tries to focus more on making gaming more instinctive .
Cynthia Freeland ( Philosopher Queen ) says :
My neighbor rang my doorbell one night and had in her arms a mama cat and kitten that had been trying to find shelter under her house .
She has two big dogs and knows I 'm a cat person so she brought them over to me .
I gave some food to Mama , who was ravenous , and put them in my laundry room .
Baby Socks , as my neighbor called him , kept screaming the most piercing meows .
It was hard to believe that anything so tiny could emit such loud , piercing , piteous wails !
When I checked on them later I was so happy to find Mama relaxing and feeding little Socks .
The next day plot thickened .
I learned from my friend at the local county animal control of two new kittens in need of bottle feeding .
I thought maybe I could get mama kitty to adopt them , so I drove 40 miles each way to pick them up .
I brought these TINY newborns into the house , and after about 20 seconds of sniffing Mama accepted them and began happily nursing all the babies .
What a lovely lady .
I decided to call her Sylvie because I felt she needed an elegant French name . :-)
I hoped I could find her a good home .
Sylvie , her son Socks , and adopted sons Itsy and Bitsy became a family .
The laundry basket was a good holding pen for the kittens and they seemed to feel comfortable and safe in it .
One morning I found Socks out of the laundry basket , running around , trying to tear up a loose piece of paper towel .
In the next few weeks he turned into quite a comical little adventurer , full of mischief and desperate to play with his little brothers or his mother .
But Sylvie was just annoyed by his jumping on her head and often batted him away , and the little ones were too small and frail to play .
So I tried to divert his attention and keep him entertained .
He cracked me up , running around in uncoordinated bursts of energy and chasing his toys .
One day I found a small basket unused in a closet and had an intuition that Socks might like it .
Boy was that right -- he was one wild and crazy guy playing in ( and out and under ) it !
Itsy and Bitsy started developing into fun little kittens -- boisterous Itsy with his darling round body and head and tummy spots , and Bitsy with his darker , fluffier face and sweet , shy nature .
Socks was constantly trying to get Mama , Itsy , and Bitsy to play with him .
Sometimes Mama played but , being still young herself , she could get a bit rough .
So Socks more often played with little Itsy , repeatedly knocking him down while Itsy batted away at Socks .
It was hilarious to watch .
Itsy was a fighter and Bitsy was a lover .
One day I went to a party at work and one of our graduate students , Wade , told me he was interested in adopting Socks .
He came to visit , met my house guests , and the deal was done .
When it was time for Socks to go , I sent his purple basket along with him to remind him of home .
I was so happy he was going to have his own home where he would be the center of attention and cared for , but I knew I would miss him a lot .
It was rough at first and Socks cried because he missed his mommy , but he adjusted and began enjoying his new surroundings and making new friends .
Wade kept me updated with stories about how Socks settled in , growing into a very outgoing cat who liked to play with visitors .
He continued to love his purple basket and liked tipping it over so he could “ hide ” underneath it and grab things through the holes .
One day I went to visit and was so happy to find that Wade had replaced Socks ’s little basket with an identical but much larger laundry basket .
Socks loves it !
He is so handsome now , all grown up and looking a lot like his mama .
I 'm also very happy to report that Itsy and Bitsy have found a forever home together !
I miss them like crazy .
As for Sylvie , I could n’t give her up .
She is now my beautiful , long - haired , semiferal - but - slowly - learning - not - to - bite black beauty .
I think she ’s very happy .
Every quarter or so , there ’s an old can of worms that we with a foot or two in the open source business world open up and dump on someone ’s head .
Dave Rosenberg appears to be getting out the can opener :
Customers assume that open source is free and that commercial open source is cheaper , but most companies are n’t prepared to deal with the implications of having a lower cost product .
Even when you can clearly demonstrate value , you run into a scale issue sooner or later .
So , the answer appears to be that you have to provide more value for the dollar , but how do you do in a way that makes a highly scalable , highly monetizable business ?
This is the question of how someone gets rich off an open source business .
Typically , the phrasing goes , “ how does a business make money with open source , ” but my rephrasing there gets at the first problem .
First off , let ’s pull the zombified dead - horse out of the ground and examine it :
Paying for “ Free ”
The issue with open source software business models is that your customers can get your software for free , without ever paying you or even ( we hope ) registering with you , giving you lead information to call them up and pester them .
What do you sell them then ?
Support & Services
Support and services is the first rung of “ products ” you can sell without muddling with the definition of open source .
“ Support ” being answering the phone , email , or even being on - site to trouble shoot a customer ’s problem using the software .
Typically , people wrap metallurgical bands around this – Gold , Silver , Platinum ( whither “ Lead ” ? ) – that scale up the response time ( 2 hours to days ) , availability ( business hours , weekends , 24/7 ) , named contact ( “ I talk to Jim about this , not some random call - center head - set ” ) , and other features that do n’t directly connect to the software itself .
RedHat pulled a clever trick many years ago here : instead of selling you the source code , they sold the binaries , the compiled code .
It was certified and approved by them and the first step in getting all those wonderful support options .
“ Services ” are butts - in - seats things like “ make this open source software work with my SAP install . ”
That is , integrating and customizing the software to do whatever business function the customer needs .
You could go and download JBoss App Server and the Spring Framework all day long for free , but you ’ll need to actually code something if you want to start making money with them .
There ’s tons of money in “ services ” like this , but they ’re not typically what open source businesses go after .
Margins tend to be bad ( compare the cost of a living , breathing human to copying software ) , there ’s tough competition , and there ’s an overall distaste among ISVs to actually customizing their software per customer .
Dragons Be Here !
After this , things get a little tricky , and it ’s when you cross The Tarus Line .
Going past The Tarus Line means that Tarus Balog , noted , and more importantly , successful open source business person will start telling you you ’re not doing open source .
Patches & Updates
First , open source vendors can be paid to supply patches and updates to software .
All software is full of bugs , security problems , and other issues that need to be fixed .
Shockingly , even open source applies here .
Less glibly , new features are added to software all the time .
In the closed source world , we ’d call these new versions of the software .
The open source world is a bit different than bundling up mega- released : there tends to be more incremental releases , or updates .
Either way , customers want both bug fixes and new features .
Selling quick , easy , and even early access to those updates is another monetization point for open source businesses .
The philosophic “ issue ” here is that the underlying code for those updates should itself be open source as well , so why ca n’t the customer just get ahold of it , re-compile things , and deploy them ?
Certainly , there is value in paying someone to just do that for you – the vendor – but the value in that should n’t be high enough to get to the “ highly scalable , highly monetizable business ” goal that Dave ’s can - opener is ripping away at .
How much revenue can any given company depend on for simply providing the service of updating open source software ?
Now , if you ’re a clever company you start to wrap things together here : you ’ll only get that support if you use those certified updates .
If you went and re-updated yourself , we – the open source vendor – are going to hassle you with a sort of metaphoric “ warranty void if removed ” argument against helping you .
Again , the issue is not if this is good , bad , open , or closed source .
Rather , the question is how much revenue any given company can get from such a service .
SaaS and Cloud
Another option is to charge for actually running the software for your customers .
You put the software up in the cloud and charge for the service you ’re providing instead of the software .
Google is a sort of square peg in a round hole here – they do n’t open source all of their code – and you ’d think people like Sun would be a natural fit for , say , running identity services based on their open source software in the as a service ( or , yes , “ in the cloud ” ) .
WordPress is , perhaps , a more perfect example .
You can download WordPress for yourself and run it ( as we do at RedMonk ) or you can pay to simply have WordPress.com run it for you .
The interesting part here is that the WordPress instance you get at WordPress.com – that you pay for – has less features than the one you ’d run for yourself .
The hassle of running your own blog ( and elastically scaling up when you get lots of traffic ) is worth not only paying for , but axing features and flexibility .
The problem ( or pointer to what needs to change ? ) with the WordPress example is that it ’s not purely “ enterprise ” or “ business ” software : it ’s consumer as well .
In theory , there ’s good revenue here .
Closed source SaaS ’s like SalesForce are stand - up businesses .
There are n’t a whole lot of open source SaaSes out there .
On a related note , we here at RedMonk have been trying to develop a theory of how you can monetize the community around open source stacks via telemetry and collaborative IT management ( or “ social business software ” to generalize it ) for sometime now .
Ask us for more info ( check me out : monetizing free content ! )
There ’s another trick , of course , as well here : often , to run software at large scale as a SaaS you need some additional code to help out .
Be that code to manage it , balance out databases and web servers , whatever .
The code that Google , for example , would be insane to open source .
When looking at an open source SaaS , you have to make sure to ask them if all of the code is open .
Lump It : Sell Closed Source
Finally , getting to the buried lead , an increasingly popular open source business model is to sell closed source .
This closed source software typically comes in two forms : additional software used to manage the open source software or “ plugins ” and “ extensions . ”
In both cases , typically , the closed software is being sold to someone other than developers .
And this , I believe , is key : developers will not tolerate paying for software ( except Microsoft developers ) , pretty much of any kind .
The people who run the software day - to - day – admins and operations people – will pay for software .
My pet software category , “ The Little 4 ” ( tho , now there ’s just 3 , really ) fit into both of these categories .
Zenoss , Groundwork , and Hyperic are all open source businesses of varying types .
In each case , though , when you pay those vendors money , you get closed source software .
In the case of Zenoss , you get additional functionality in the form of “ ZenPacks ” that allow you to monitor and manage more things in your data center ( like VMWare ) .
In the case of Groundwork , you get the pulling together and polishing of all of the open source project they amalgamate , and also additional functionality .
Hyperic is the same .
Additionally , Hyperic is an interesting example because they ’ll license white - labeled versions of their management software to other open source vendors .
For example , if you “ buy ” Mule from MuleSource , you ’ll also get a version of Hyperic ’s HQ tuned to monitor and manage your Mule install .
Compare this to , for example , what you get from another outfit in the business of IT management , the OpenNMS Group ( home of The Tarus Line ) : all of their software is open source .
All you get from them are services and support .
More People Selling Closed Source
Other examples of selling closed source exist in outside of the IT Management category and I ’m increasingly seeing more of it .
Personally , I see no problem with it .
If customers will pay for closed source software , bully for them and the vendors .
Software is valuable , after all .
Getting email and instant messaging working for your 10,000 employees has value , as does munching over 1,000 ’s of money making transactions an hour .
Far from running around waving a flag of “ open source is dead ! ”
I ’m suggesting that vendors should start feeling ( less bad ) about selling closed source software .
Certainly , there ’s an ethics to trying to hide that fact ( something that The Little 4 people above do not tend to fall into the trap of doing ) and benefit from the marketing glow of being “ open source . ”
No one wants hucksterism here , folks .
But , making a Big Buck off open source is hard .
Closed source tends to be easier .
But what about MySQL ?!
Indeed , Sun bought MySQL for some Big Bucks .
RedHat bought JBoss , and so on .
In general , I do n’t consider “ getting bought by another company ” a business - business model .
It may be an investment and personal wealth building model , but a 20 , 50 , 100 year business model it ai n’t .
Clearly , an open source startup with the goal of cashing out after several years is a viable business model for the people who own a lot of equity in that company .
But that ’s not the kind of business we ’re talking about here .
There is no “ cashing out ” for Sun , IBM , Microsoft , or Oracle : just the quarter - by - quarter game of growing a few ticks or taking a beating from Wall Street ( love those Street guys !
Kisses ! ) .
It should also be noted that the owners of previously independent open source companies tend to use all of the money extraction techniques above , esp. , the grand - daddy example here , IBM .
IBM sells plenty of closed source software , hardware , services , and just about everything but mercenaries .
And yet they do plenty of work with open source as well .
What Should I do ?
As a customer , you should get ready to start paying for more open source software .
As a vendor , you should start thinking about selling closed source software in addition to your open source offerings .
These rules of thumbs do n’t apply to all categories : when you get to more middle - ware , developer - centric software stacks , it ’s an extremely tough sell to get people to pay for software .
Then again , someone managed to invent the bottled water market which looked like insanity – charging for “ free ” water .
Open source will never go away as a method of production or a business model .
In fact , you ’d be insane not to use it as a core part of your software business model now - a - days ; do n’t confuse the above with me saying otherwise .
Indeed , as the OpenNMS Group and other “ small ” outfits have shown , you can build a fine business of “ pure open source . ”
It ’s those “ highly scalable , highly monetizable business ” that are a tougher nut to crack and a little help from closed source can look like a big mallet .
Update : see this addendum on models that involve using , or “ embedding ” open source .
Disclosure : IBM , Hyperic , Groundwork , Zenoss , Microsoft , Sun , and RedHat are clients .
* Photo : Jeff Mermelstein * Guilty .
I feel guilty that I have a blog and have n't contributed to it for seven months .
Guilty that all my pals on Facebook post cool pictures , while the last shots I uploaded were of Fourth of July fireworks — from 2007 .
Guilty that I have n't Dugg anything since , well , ever .
It 's not that I do n't like social networking — I adore it .
I love the way it transforms my ragged circle of contacts and acquaintances into something approaching a community .
Every site becomes a personalized small town where strangers do n't stay that way for long .
I 'm fascinated by the quirks and preferences my " friends " reveal through comments , status reports , and alerts .
That 's where my guilt comes in .
Because of time constraints and just plain reticence , I worry that I 'm snatching morsels from the information food bank without making any donations .
Instead of healthy , reciprocal participation , I 'm flirting with parasitic voyeurism .
So , driven by guilt , I try to pitch in .
I post Facebook status reports , send iPhone snapshots to Flickr , link my Netflix queue with FriendFeed .
But as my participation increases , I invariably suffer another psychic downside of social networking : remorse .
The more I upload the details of my existence , even in the form of random observations and casual location updates , the more I worry about giving away too much .
It 's one thing to share intimacies person - to - person .
But with a community ?
Creepy .
NYU lecturer and Wired correspondent Clay Shirky notes in his 2008 book , Here Comes Everybody , that sharing personal information on social networks is not the same as broadcasting .
It 's more like dishing with close buddies in a mall food court .
The latest source of my dilemma is Twitter , which lets you spit out real - time reports about what you 're thinking and doing .
It 's fun to track the digital ejaculations of selected Twitterati .
But a couple thousand people signed up unsolicited to follow my tweets .
And I feel guilty when not serving this hungry crowd — remorseful when I am .
Since I do n't know many in this mob , I try not to be personally revealing .
Still , no matter how innocuous your individual tweets , the aggregate ends up being the foundation of a scary - deep self - portrait .
It 's like a psychographic version of strip poker — I 'm disrobing , 140 characters at a time .
Every so often , I get a glimpse of the effects of tossing all this personal confetti to the winds .
In November , I attended an industry conference , and so many people congratulated me on the Phillies World Series win that I felt like Chase Utley .
How did they know I 'm a Phillies fan ?
Duh , they read my dispatches from Citizen 's Bank Park during game four .
And if they 're still following , they also know about my son's college plans , my recent travel itinerary , and the fact that I filed this column late .
We hear a lot about privacy violations by Big Brother and Little Brother .
But what if the fault lies not in our siblings but in ourselves ?
For a reality check , I called Marc Rotenberg , head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and an utter hawk when it comes to protecting personal data .
He told me to relax .
" One aspect of privacy is the ability to project yourself as you choose , " he says .
Services like Facebook and Twitter are strictly opt -in , so as long as the information is n't divvied out to marketers , Rotenberg is OK with it : " That is freedom . "
So now I 'm feeling guilty — for being remorseful .
Maybe I should complain about it in my next tweet .

What Facebook and Steroid Use Have in Common
KRAKOW , Poland ( Reuters ) - The United States called on its NATO allies Thursday to provide more forces to provide security for Afghanistan ’s presidential election in August , but had only a limited response .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would not seek a specific number of additional NATO troops from a meeting of NATO defense ministers in the Polish city of Krakow .
But he said Washington would like to see a short - term deployment of troops to Afghanistan from the alliance ’s rapid response force , the NRF , which has never been utilized .
“ The message is that it is a new administration and ( it ) is prepared to make additional commitments to Afghanistan .
But there clearly will be expectations that the allies must do more as well , ” Gates told reporters .
U.S. President Barack Obama authorized 17,000 more U.S. troops for Afghanistan this week , taking the U.S. contingent to around 55,000 , in addition to the 30,000 from 40 other mostly NATO countries already operating in Afghanistan .
Some European allies have announced plans to send more troops , but these numbered in the hundreds , not thousands , and Germany said the NRF should not be used for Afghan duty .
“ The NRF should not be used as a reserve , ” German Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung told reporters in Krakow .
“ The NRF has fundamentally different tasks . ”
U.S. officials have long been frustrated by European reluctance to make new long - term troop commitments to the Afghan mission and Gates said it was unlikely that large increases would be forthcoming anytime soon .
“ WE REALLY NEED ADDITIONAL HELP ”
But Gates said the Obama administration hoped NATO countries where the Afghan mission is politically unpopular could make significant new contributions to civilian development .
“ We really need additional help on the civilian side ... frankly I hope it may be easier for our allies to do that than significant troop increases especially for the longer term . ”
Gates said more help was needed on governance and development , police training and funding of the Afghan army .
Italy said Wednesday it would send 500 more troops by April and Germany publicly announced a pledge of 600 more soldiers it first made earlier in the year .
Britain , which has the second largest force in Afghanistan , said it had made no decision on whether to send more troops , but its Defense Secretary John Hutton said London felt it was up to other NATO countries to step up their commitments first .
Hutton hit out at the failure of allies to commit essential equipment to the Afghan operation .
“ NATO has thousands of helicopters .
We have only managed to put a very few in Afghanistan and that is an appalling indictment of NATO ’s inability to get behind very mission - critical operations , ” he said .
France reiterated it has no plans to send additional forces .
Bob Jackson of London ’s Chatham
House think - tank said that if European allies failed to respond to U.S. calls , Washington would simply go it alone .
“ In the lead - up to the Iraq war , some European leaders said they were not consulted properly .
Do they want to be shut out of the process altogether ?
Europe will have opted out of the most important decision facing NATO since the end of the Cold War . ”
If you feel too busy to exercise and keep your body healthy in the way that you eat , then you will have to think again .
You will need to come up with a new routine for yourself because your body is just too important to let go to waste , no matter how busy you feel throughout the day .
And , the good thing for you to find out , is that there are many ways that you can stay healthy and fit even while you are busy .
This year can be the best one yet if you use some of the tips found below .
Start Timing Your Exercise
Even if you feel that there is no time in the day to get exercise in , you should just start by taking a short walk .
Time it and see how much of a workout you are able to get in .
Maybe go for a jog next time instead .
Figure out a time in the day when you have the most free time and go out then .
It is good to get a half hour of exercise in a day , and if you can do that , then you will start to feel better about your body .
Be Conscience of What You Eat
A simple , yet complicated , at the same time , thing for you to start doing is keeping track of the food you put in your mouth .
You will be healthier just in knowing what you are eating and making a few smart choices throughout the day .
Choose a water instead of a soda here , and a salad instead of a sandwich there .
Stop with the mindless snacking and bring something healthy and filling to munch on , instead .
It is a great thing to be conscience of all of the foods you are eating , so that you can start losing weight and just feeling better in your body .
Shop The Good Parts Of The Store
When you are so busy that every second of the day counts , why not try to trim down some of the time that you spend in the supermarket ?
One great way for you to stop spending so much of your precious time there is to start only shopping in the produce , dairy , and meat departments .
Shop for the foods that are good for you and your body and avoid all of those middle aisles .
Your health will be better because of it , and you will save a lot of time grocery shopping , too .
Stand When You Can And Take The Stairs
There are little things that you can do every day to get a better and healthier body , and one of the things that you can do is to choose to stand instead of sit .
Whenever you have the option , you should stand and stretch your muscles .
You burn more calories when you are standing versus sitting , and you just might find that you feel better when you do this , too .
And another great change for you to make every day is to take the stairs instead of the elevator .
Go up and down the stairs each day , and you will burn a few extra calories .
It does n’t take much time to go up and down them , and you just might save some time versus taking the elevator , too .
Find A Routine That Pleases You
One of the most important things for you to do when you want to become healthier and more fit is to find a routine that works for you .
Figure out a schedule for your day that makes you happy .
Fit in some exercise where you can and make sure that you can stick with it .
Figure out which healthy foods make you feel the best , and which ones are a treat to you , and reward yourself with them .
Know what you need to do to feel good about your health each day , and make it happen .
You will feel great when you start making an effort to care for your health .
You can become fit and healthy in 2017 , even if you are a busy person .
All that you need is some determination , and you will start to feel better about your body and the way that you are treating it .
You will start to gain muscle when you get into exercising every day , no matter how much time you have free to do that , and you will lose a bit of weight by making a few healthy lifestyle choices , as well .
You can start eating healthier and save time while doing that by shopping the right sections of the store , and you can save time by running the stairs instead of taking the elevator every day , too .
Choose to do these things , and you will feel better about how fit and healthy you are .

If you have a great estimate of exactly how many seconds are left until you can leave , it can be really tempting to email all@youroldcompany.com with exactly how liberated you feel .
But if your dream job does n't turn out quite so ethereal , or you ever find yourself needing a tip , lead , reference , or maybe even someone to hire at your new digs , you 'll wish you 'd kept things civil .
To fake it until you make it , crib from eMurse 's sample resignation letters , read from wikiHow 's guide to resigning gracefully , and keep in touch over social networks like Facebook with the co-workers in the same realm you find yourself in .
You never know when one of them might hear about a sudden job opening ; alternately , you can ditch the civility and think about offering cold , hard cash rewards for job leads .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - U.S. auto suppliers submitted a formal request to the U.S. Treasury on Friday for $ 18.5 billion in emergency funding to avoid a wave of bankruptcies and a deeper crisis in the auto industry .
The request , which was submitted by two industry groups , outlined three proposals for financial relief .
The proposals say the government could guarantee supplier receivables from U.S. automakers , accelerate payment terms or guarantee commercial loans to parts companies .
The formal petition was filed by the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and its affiliate , the Original Equipment Suppliers Association ( OESA ) .
The submission includes a request for $ 10.5 billion in guarantees for receivables and accelerated payment terms , as well as $ 8 billion in direct loans , OESA President Neil De Koker said .
“ I have been in the industry since 1962 and I have never seen anything like this , ” De Koker said of the current situation for suppliers .
“ ( What ) we are figuring in the next two weeks to six weeks is where the real peak of the pain will be for the suppliers because of the downturn in volume in December and the virtual shutdown of the industry in January , ” De Koker said .
U.S. auto suppliers , through industry groups , have been in discussions with the U.S. Treasury in recent weeks .
The requests come as General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC race to meet a February 17 deadline to show U.S. officials they can be made viable after receiving $ 17.4 billion in aid .
Bob McKenna , president of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association , which represents some 400 suppliers , warned that without government action , auto suppliers will be forced to shutter facilities or close entire operations in March and April .
“ This would devastate the domestic auto industry and deepen the economic crisis , ” he said in a statement .
The proposal said more than 40 major suppliers filed for Chapter 11 restructuring in 2008 , with industry surveys indicating about one - third of all suppliers are in imminent financial distress .
Auto parts suppliers have come under intense pressure from tight credit conditions and from plant shutdowns by major automakers at the end of last year and the beginning of 2009 .
Projections from parts suppliers show payments to the companies are on track to drop to just $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion in March because of the near total shutdown in auto production at the start of the year , according to MEMA data .
Suppliers had been receiving between $ 8 billion and $ 9 billion per month .
The Pirate Bay trial rolls on into its third day , finally getting into the meatier legal arguments that we have n't seen in the opening statements .
At issue , once all the damage claims and talk of piratical booty is stripped aside , is whether the Bay has anchored its ship in a " safe harbor . "
That is , does it have liability for what its users do ?
And , if so , how does it differ from the other , not - being - prosecuted - by - the - Swedish - government user - generated content sites on the Web ?
Sweden 's
The Local newspaper , which has been covering the case in English , notes that the safe harbor issue was raised today by defense lawyers .
The site " provides a legal function and technology , " he told the court , and any issues related to copyright infringement have to be taken up with the site 's users — the website itself does not host any copyrighted content .
The Pirate Bay is described as little more than Google , a search engine that just happens to return plenty of results for copyrighted content .
But Google , YouTube , and other sites that index the Web or allow user uploads also return such results .
“ I submit that the torrent files one finds on The Pirate Bay can also be found by other search engines , like Google , ” said defense lawyer Jonas Nilsson .
Carl Lundstr�m , an Internet businessman who is not part of the site but is accused of being a part owner , used a similar defense .
According to TorrentFreak , his lawyer said , " EU directive 2000/31 / EG says that he who provides an information service is not responsible for the information that is being transferred .
In order to be responsible , the service provider must initiate the transfer .
But the admins of The Pirate Bay do n't initiate transfers .
It ’s the users that do and they are physically identifiable people .
They call themselves names like King Kong . "
If content owners want to go after infringers , they are free to do so , but that means going after individuals — not a site that provides legal tools .
The content owners pointed out , however , that The Pirate Bay refused to remove files from its tracker even when notified that they linked to infringing material .
In the US , websites are required to take down such content in order to maintain their legal immunity from prosecution ;
The Pirate Bay , however , preferred to post the takedown requests along with taunting messages .
In addition to taking no action on requests from rightsholders , the other issue likely to come up at trial is the sheer volume of infringing material on the service .
While legal content is certainly available , the site 's name is an accurate indicator of most of the content it indexes .
Does a site that takes absolutely no action to curtail illicit file transfers and indexes such material almost exclusively truly qualify for a safe harbor ?
We 'll find out in three more weeks .
Not all the battles are legal
Meanwhile , the " spectrial " continues to play out in the media .
Abba's Bj�rn Ulvaeus lashed out at The Pirate Bay backers yesterday , saying that they fought for " the ' freedom ' to be lazy and stingy . "
" Is it really so damn difficult to pay your way ? " he wondered .
But whatever the merits of the rightsholder position , it 's certainly astonishing to watch the global media industries so artfully beaten in the media by the antics of some twentysomething Swedes .
No , the pirate bus and the megaphones and the flags and the Twittering and all the rest of it might have nothing to do with the legal case , but it 's become quite clear that the issue of copyright has escaped the law 's orbit .
If content owners can't tell a better story to the public , especially to those raised on a diet of Napster and BitTorrent , then the legal maneuvering is likely to fail .
And , in the court of public opinion , it 's The Pirate Bay that comes across looking impish and interesting , while the " creative industries " seem anything but .
The music and movie industries , which do have a story to tell about art , entertainment , and new business models , could really use some better PR — and not necessarily the kind that comes from PR firms .
Otherwise , they risk being further undermined in the public consciousness through a string of clever anecdote bombs such as the one dropped today by defendant Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi .
" We had some pizza after todays episode of # spectrial , " he tweeted today .
" Met the whole opposing side and asked if they could pick up the check .
They refused :( "
And yes , it 's what any of us would have done when in court against our bitterest enemies .
But , when the old and obvious responses have gained little traction , why could n't the content owners show a bit of humanity and pay for some pizza — and then tweet about it themselves ?

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said a police survey in England and Wales will be scrapped to free up time .
The annual survey requires about 50 % of officers to document every 15 minutes of their working day over two weeks .
Ms Smith 's announcement comes as former Police Federation boss Jan Berry is due to publish the interim findings of a review of red tape .
Ms Smith told the BBC she did not feel under pressure - after newspapers speculated she could face the axe .
The Sunday Times suggested there were concerns about her track record and question marks over her chances of keeping her job in any summer reshuffle - last week she also defended her use of " second home " expenses for the house she shares with her husband and children .
Asked if she was concerned people were briefing against her , she told the BBC : " I 'm home secretary .
I quite often feel under pressure but not from things like that - from things like keeping the country safe , making sure the police are back on the streets , protecting this country from terrorism and keeping our borders safe . "
Technology
Two reports will be published later - the interim findings of Ms Berry 's inquiry into police bureaucracy and top civil servant Sir David Normington 's review of data collected by officers .
Ms Smith is expected to announce several measures aimed at reducing police bureaucracy , including a panel of officers to examine the impact of any new policies on staff .
She is also expected to say central government will make fewer information requests to police .
The government says this is the latest in a series of attempts to reduce police bureaucracy , including introducing 10,000 extra hand - held devices for use by officers on the beat to send and receive information .
Ms Smith told the BBC central government could be blamed for some of the bureaucracy .
Asked about the annual survey , she said : " I think that 's wrong .
I do n't think we should expect the police to fill in the sort of timesheets that we have previously .
That 's why one of the things I will be saying today is that we are ending that , as of now . "
Ms Smith said her priority was that police forces reported to " local people rather than up to Whitehall " and drove up confidence locally by " dealing with the issues that actually matter to people " .
' Risk aversion ' Scrapping the timesheet should free up 260,000 hours of police officers ' time every year , the government says .
For the Conservatives , shadow policing minister David Ruffley said : " This review follows five previous Labour red tape reviews , yet it does not give us any clue as to how many more police hours will be spent on the beat .
" On average a police officer spends just one hour in eight on patrol and the Berry proposals do not even estimate how that can be improved .
" Jan Berry is an experienced police officer but she is struggling to grapple with ten years of Labour red tape and risk aversion .
We do not need any more pilots and conferences .
We need competent ministers who will get a grip and take radical steps to cut police red tape . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Tom Brake said : " Actions speak louder than words .
The government talks the talk when it comes to cutting bureaucracy , yet police officers are struggling under a growing mountain of forms .
" We need officers on the street , not at their desks struggling to complete convoluted tick box forms .
" The government must wean itself off its addiction to centralised police targets and its obsession with creating new offences to allow police forces to concentrate on policing . "

Research halted at alleged anthrax mailer 's former lab RAW STORY
Published : Monday February 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Work at the US Army 's top biological weapons defense laboratory has been halted , the Associated Press confirms a story first reported on a science magazine 's blog .
" The lab was the workplace of Bruce Ivins , who killed himself in July after learning he would be charged in the 2001 anthrax mailings that killed five people , " the AP notes .
" A memo obtained by The Associated Press says workers are examining the contents of all refrigerators and freezers at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick . "
The article continues , " Institute commander Col .
John Skvorak wrote that he believes some vials of pathogens and toxins are likely not listed in a laboratory database . "
Science Insider first reported on the memo last Friday , who also noted that the " [ ' anthrax mailer ' ] case never went to trial because of Ivins 's suicide on 29 July 2008 , FBI officials have claimed that the evidence against him is indisputable and that he carried out the mailings using anthrax stolen from a flask at USAMRIID . "
The blog added , " All experiments using select agents will remain suspended until the accounting is finished , which could take several weeks .
Several USAMRIID researchers have been grumbling about the decision , which seems to have caught them by surprise , according to a government official not connected to the lab . "
" I believe that the probability that there are additional vials of BSAT [ biological select agents and toxins ] not captured in our database is high , " Skvorak wrote in the memo .
Jason Sigger and Noah Shachtman , at Wired.com , observe that USAMRIID is " the only place in the American military complex equipped to handle the worst of the worst diseases -- those that have no cure and can are transmissible by air . "
They called the lab 's shutdown " extremely unnerving . "
" This is not a good thing , " Sigger and Schachtman write .
" After all the hullabaloo surrounding the Ivins case , it 's a little surprising to find Army researchers reluctant to toe the line on biosecurity issues . "
The article continues , " It 's not clear right now whether the issue is new regulations that need to be fine - tuned -- or scientists not worried enough about prudent security regulations .
Whatever the case , we ought to expect the Army 's premiere Army biodefense research lab to be leading the private and academic institutions in sound security practices .
Over the past year or so , the Army has been leading the development of regulations to better safeguard its research facilities .
Ironically , now that the regs are completed , it 's USAMRIID itself that still needs work on tightening up its shop . "
“ Last year , ” Leopolis notes , “ if one said that Kazakhstan was the “ Iceland of Central Asia ” it would have been a compliment . ”
Now , not so much .
Earlier this month , Bloomberg reported , Kazakhstan ’s central bank devalued the national currency , the tenge , by 18 % .
Propping up the currency at the old rate proved unsustainable after the country spent $ 1.6 billion , or 6 % of its foreign - currency and gold reserves , in January alone to do so .
Economic growth is down from a healthy 10 % to 1 % .
Profit for Kazakhstan ’s 37 banks plunged 93 % .
The four biggest banks were seized by the government as part of an emergency program costing the equivalent to 20 % of GDP .
( In comparison , the $ 800 billion the US federal government reserved for TARP last year amounted to less than 6 % of America ’s GDP . )
The government is now trying to hawk off the largest bank to the Russian Sberbank .
Experts are expecting future currency devaluations , even if central bank chairman Grigory Marchenko emphatically rejects the prospect .
As one said : “ As long as oil prices remain subdued , there is nothing telling you to buy the tenge and there will be pressure there . ”
The one - sided character of the Kazakh economy makes it very vulnerable , Stratfor noted : the country depends on oil for 70 % of its export revenue and 76 % of all FDI .
With the oil price down and the government spending $ 21 billion – or another 18 % of its GDP – on a stimulus plan this year , the oil - funded National Fund which the country had built as buffer for bad times will all but run out this year .
As Nouriel Roubini commented to Bloomberg :
Kazakhstan looks like a small version of Iceland with its banks borrowing from abroad [..]
A currency crisis becomes a banking crisis , it becomes a housing crisis , a sovereign - debt crisis , it becomes a corporate crisis because each one of these agents in these economies has a large amount of foreign liabilities .
Kazakhstan has one of the highest rates of privately - held foreign debt , Stratfor explains ; one which equaled 100 % of the country ’s GDP in 2007 ( compared to 35 % for Russia ) .
And still , how unique is this ?
The Russian currency is down 35 % and the Ukrainian one down 47 % , Bloomberg notes .
The size of the Kazakh bailout - cum - stimulus seems exceptional , it ’s true , with the sum total equalling 38 % of the country ’s GDP .
In comparison , Russia is spending $ 240 billion , or close to 20 % of its GDP , on bank bailouts and stimulus , while the combined bill for TARP I and the new stimulus bill Congress will vote on now will be about 10 % of America ’s GDP ( though TARP II will come on top of that ) .
Still , at least Kazakhstan is still recording some economic growth , however anemic .
The Czech economy entered in a recession in the last quarter of 2008 and will probably see a 2 % contraction in 2009 , while Hungary , which also entered a recession and is registering the worst data since 1996 , may face a 4 - 5 % drop in GDP this year .
Which pales , in turn , in comparison with the numbers from the Baltic states , where Estonia ’s economy contracted 9 % in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier , and Latvia ’s GDP plummeted 11 % .
Latvia , in particular , is looking economic collapse in the eye as its GDP may shrink by as much as 20 % .
The Baltic states , like Kazakhstan but unlike Hungary , at least enjoyed a number of years of high economic growth until now , with annual growth reaching up into double digits .
That does n’t mean that people have been able to built a protective buffer for the crisis setting on now , though .
The economic growth characteristically benefited the upper middle class , and especially the top layer , disproportionally .
The collapse now , conversely , is likely to hurt the poor and elderly hardest .
So basically , we ’re fucked .
Luckily far - right Russian demagogue and all - round buffoon Vladimir Zhirinovsky , who is also deputy chairman of the Russian parliament , had some advice on surviving the crisis .
“ I have been thrifty , ” he boasted last year : “ I am not having my hair cut .
My hair has already grown longer than ever .
I only shave every other day . [..]
There is no need to buy new clothes .
They can be swapped with others .
I am prepared to give a couple of suits to someone , several pairs of shoes , a wristwatch . ”
Personal hygiene products are just “ all [..] chemical and hazardous ” anyway , so you can leave those as well .
( Though this , admittedly , would n’t present much in the way of savings for the Kazakhs , as anyone who ’s seen Borat will know . )
Finally , when it comes to the holidays , well : “ no need to travel abroad or to go to a restaurant .
Stay [..] at home or invite yourself over to someone else ’s place ” .
So there you are .
When you fall on hard times this year , go to Vlad for clothes .
Just make sure to stock up on vodka and cabbage rather than soap and shampoo in case he shows up in turn for Easter .
He wo n’t mind the smell .
Imagine fans showing up for next month 's annual all - things - Apple shindig in San Francisco , the Macworld Expo , and being handed a programme , out of which flutters a paper insert with the message : " Steve Jobs is indisposed today .
The role of ' Demi - God ' will be played by Philip Schiller . "
Bummer .
Happily , the inserts wo n't be necessary , because the company , which is based in Cupertino , California , was kind of enough to give everyone a little warning .
( Only a little one , mind you . )
There it was , late on Tuesday afternoon , a statement saying just that .
The moment when Jobs is meant to take to the stage , in jeans and black turtleneck shirt , to unveil one more " One More Thing ... " wo n't happen .
And yes , his leading role in the proceedings will be played instead by Schiller , Apple 's top marketing person .
Actually , we need to be very clear here .
The statement from Apple , which sent its shares into an instant swoon on Wall Street , did not mention " indisposed " , but tried to argue that Macworld , an event that is seen as akin to a pilgrimage to Mecca by diehard " Macolytes " ( they really are called that ) , had become superfluous to the company .
Indeed , the statement said that after 2009 , the company would forgo attendance at the event altogether .
The point , apparently , is that Apple has 250 spiffy retail shops these days ( there was a time not so long ago when it had none at all ) and a mighty marketing presence on the internet with its own website .

So who needs trade shows ?
Steve Dowling , a spokesman , underlined the message , lest there be any misunderstanding .
" Phil is giving the keynote because this will be Apple 's last year at the show , " he said .
" It does n't make sense for us to make a major investment in a trade show we will no longer be attending . "
Well , that is a relief , because there was a time earlier this year when all the world was fretting that Jobs , 53 , who is a survivor of pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed in 2003 , might be very unwell again .
People worried especially after his appearance at another Apple event in July when he looked thin to the point of gaunt .
The chatter subsided slightly after another appearance in September saw him looking a little more chipper .
But now we have this .
What are we to make of it exactly ?
Is he , in fact , as gravely ill as we had all feared ?
Normally , a CEO opting to skip just one more product presentation would be no big deal .
( It can even be a blessing ) .
But it 's different with Jobs – who co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak back in the late Seventies , introduced the Macintosh personal computer then left after a boardroom scuffle with then - CEO John Sculley in 1985 and returned to save the company from gathering oblivion in 1995 .
The term " reality distortion field " was coined by colleagues at Apple many years ago to try to describe what happens in a room when Jobs begins his sales patter for the latest wonder from the company 's research laboratories .
First among his many roles at the company is brand - promoter - in - chief , and no one can do it better .
Nor is Macworld just any insignificant trade gathering .
It is true that Apple has had increasingly strained relations with its organisers , the Massachusetts - based publisher IDG , and that it had already pulled out of a similar event that used to take place on the East Coast .
It is also worth acknowledging that there could hardly be a worse time of year – just after Christmas – for any company to be introducing a new product .
But , then again , it was at Macworld two years ago that the company introduced the iPhone and , long before that , its iTunes platform for digitally downloading music .
Apple would have a hard job honestly arguing that Macworld has not been pivotal to the vast improvement in its fortunes of late .
So the notion that the fielding of Schiller instead of Jobs is something boringly bureaucratic is hard to swallow .
Going to Macworld without Jobs will be a bit like paying for tickets to see Houdini escape from a welded trunk with a stand - in called Robert .
" Nooo ... " , was the most common response in comment threads on the numerous Apple - centric internet blog sites yesterday .
" Macworld is like a second Christmas !
Santa Steve , do n't do this to me ! " pleaded someone who goes by the cyber - name of robbydigital .
" It was a huge marketing venue for them , " said Richard Shim , an analyst with the research firm IDC , after hearing the Apple announcement .
" You 've seen those crowds .
It was like the Pope was visiting .
I think the pressure kind of got to them . "
For a hint of the significance of Apple 's announcement , consider what happened to it shares – down nearly 6 per cent in the first hours of trading in New York yesterday – partly as a result of the Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner downgrading the stock in response .
Or look at how this perfectly executed fake press release supposedly from Apple , posted on the net by some smart alec yesterday , reminds us through tongue - in - cheek humour of the near - sanctity of Jobs for some of his disciples .
" December 16 , 2008 – Apple today announced that this is the last year for Christmas .
Philip Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing , spoke at a joint press conference held with Santa Claus at the North Pole .
He announced : ' Apple has been honoured to work with the North Pole the last several years to make Christmas possible , however , we have decided together that this is the last year for Christmas .
Apple is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , Christmas has become a very minor part of how Apple reaches its customers . ' "
For IDG , Macworld 's organisers , the Apple announcement is a body blow .
It is hard not to imagine that without Jobs – without Apple altogether – the expo will not start to wither , even though the company 's general manager , Paul Kent , yesterday insisted otherwise .
" Macworld has thrived for 25 years due to the strong support of tens of thousands of members of the Mac community , " Kent said .
" We are committed to continuing to serve their interests , " he said in a statement .
Plans for 2010 are already in hand .
But the far bigger question , of course , concerns Apple and Jobs .
" The faithful are praying that Tuesday 's announcement is exactly what Apple says it is , " wrote Josh Quittner of Time magazine 's online edition , " and not at all what it looks like . "
What it looks like – to Quittner , for one – is another Jobs health scare .
Or , put even more bluntly and unkindly , that Jobs may be struggling with mortality again .
Some expert watchers of Apple on Wall Street and beyond believe it is possible that the usefulness of Macworld to the company is fading .
It could be that Apple is tiring of the strictures of having to come up with something new every January to satisfy expectations , and that it wants to turn down the glare a little bit because this New Year it simply would n't have had anything very thrilling for Jobs to show off .
John Gruber , who runs a respected Apple blog called Daring Fireball , offered : " I think that the set - in - stone scheduling of Macworld Expo has always been a thorn in Apple 's side .
January looks worse and worse as a month for major announcements . "
Others argue , meanwhile , that there is something unethical about the endless speculation surrounding Jobs 's state of health by members of the media .
He is a human being with children ( who presumably have access to all that is being written ) and is entitled to his privacy .
And it is true that the repeated , " Is - he - dying ?
Is - he - not - dying ? " , headlines are being written on the basis of no concrete evidence whatsoever .
He may be thin , for all we know , because he has discovered the joys of a cottage - cheese diet or because post - cancer he is on a strict dietary regimen imposed on him by his doctors .
Thin is good .
But Jobs is no ordinary citizen .
Nor is he any ordinary CEO .
When he returned to Apple in 1997 , the campus at Cupertino was a place of almost suffocating gloom .
The Apple computing platform commanded roughly 3 per cent of the market , a total washout alongside the hegemony of the PC , developed by Microsoft in Seattle .
The effect of Jobs 's return has been nothing short of miraculous .
Thanks to a combination of aesthetic cleverness – you remember how groovy those iMacs with the sort of blue - translucent back casings were just 10 years ago ?
– and amazing innovations that led to the " i " revolution in Cupertino ( iPod , iTunes and now the iPhone ) , he has led the company to even greater heights .
The effect , however , has been to make Apple without Jobs hard to imagine .
And if Apple , with its 20,000 - strong workforce , is irritated that we should all be obsessing about Jobs and his white - blood - cell count , it has itself to blame in part .
When Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , which is a serious condition however you cut it , in 2003 , it took the company about nine months to alert the public and shareholders to the fact .
The result of that has been to make everyone just a wee bit sceptical about anything it says , or does not say , on the subject now .
Then there is the small matter of the succession after Jobs disappears , whether because of sickness or indeed any other reason .
This is a tricky one , of course , precisely because what will Apple be without Jobs at the helm ?
There are few major companies in the world that are so intimately tied to the boss , both in public perception and in their day - to - day operations .
Others are perhaps the Virgin Group ( Richard Branson ) , or Cuba Inc ( the Castros ) .
( We will not mention Madoff Investment Securities and Bernard Madoff just now . )
Henry Blodget , the former banker and now Silicon Valley analyst , has said that Jobs is " arguably Apple 's single most valuable asset " .
But then Microsoft used to be synonymous with its creator , Bill Gates , and has managed its own transition to existing without his daily presence with a minimum of drama and fuss .
Gates has left the building , in case anyone out there had n't noticed .
We are told that succession plans are being aired inside Apple , and there have been hints of this precisely because of the increased spotlight that has been shone at recent trade shows on other top - level executives at the company , including Schiller and also Timothy Cook , Jobs 's chief operating officer .
( There has even been an effort by some of them to mimic his black - top , jeans - bottom wardrobe when appearing in public . )
But Wall Street clearly thinks it 's high time that the succession debate was taken public .
Confirming that he had downgraded Apple stock from " Outperform " to " Perform " , Reiner of Oppenheimer left no doubt that he is one of those growing worried again about Jobs .
The decision to keep him away from Macworld " has underscored the greatest risk to Apple 's long - term success – its dependence on Jobs ' health and its apparent lack of a succession plan . "
He added that it was " past time " for Apple to give investors some clarity about how it envisages the company post - Jobs .
Gene Munster , an Apple analyst at the Piper Jaffray investment firm , thinks Apple could have avoided this week 's stock grief by letting Jobs speak next month and cautions against those who read into this flap that Jobs is again gravely unwell .
That said , Munster does suggest that , at the very least , we may be starting to see the first phases of whatever succession plans Apple does have being implemented .
" While we do not believe that this change provides any indication regarding Steve Jobs 's health , " he said , " we do believe that it is a sign that we are in the early stages of changing roles in Apple 's management structure . "
In other words , the era of Steve Jobs at Apple may indeed be nearing an end .
A reporter on CNBC yesterday cited sources in Cupertino who insisted that the decision to keep him away from Macworld was " more about politics than his pancreas " .
So , perhaps , if he begins to retreat from his daily duties then it will be because he has other things he wants to do , beyond simply changing the daily lives of so many of us with those clever little iThingamajigs that we are about to buy for Christmas .
Apple 's core : Who will follow Steve Jobs ?
Philip Schiller
Front-runner
Schiller has 17 years of marketing management experience at Apple and is current senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , reporting directly to Steve Jobs .
He is also a member of Apple 's executive team and is credited by the company with " delivering breakthrough products " such as iMac , MacBook , iPod , iPhone and Mac OS X .
While he may not have the technical expertise of other potential candidates , and certainly enjoys a less fearsome reputation than Jobs , Schiller has long been his CEO 's right - hand man at most Apple public events .
Given that a significant part of Apple 's success is built on its presentation and public appeal , perhaps he would add a marketing dimension that other key figures at Apple do n't have access to .
When news broke this week that Jobs would not be the keynote speaker at the Macworld event next January , it was announced that Schiller would deliver the opening address in his place .
Timothy D Cook
Front-runner
Reporting directly to Steve Jobs , Cook is Apple 's chief operating officer .
Having previously worked for Compaq , as vice president of corporate materials , and for IBM as director of North American fulfilment , his rock - solid technology credentials place him firmly in the running for the top job .
At Apple , he is responsible for the company 's sales and operations globally , including managing the company 's supply chain .
Described by ' Fortune ' magazine as being " as steady and low - key as Jobs is temperamental " , 47 - year - old Cook is a fitness fanatic and cycling enthusiast .
Although the question of whether he has the charisma to replace his widely revered boss has been raised , he was given him a nod of approval when , in 2004 , Jobs put Cook in charge of the company while he recovered from surgery for pancreatic cancer .
Ron Johnson
Long shot
With a focus on the public face of the business , Ron Johnson 's profile has rocketed since he joined Apple from the US retail company Target in 2000 .
Although he has on occasion disagreed with the Jobs on retail strategy – the Apple stores ' " Genius Bars " were one such clash – Johnson is widely regarded as one of few candidates to possess the personality and charisma necessary to inherit the top job .
Currently serving as the company 's senior vice president of retail operations , Johnson has presided over a period of record growth for Apple outlets , with annual sales topping $ 1bn .
In a retail environment that is destined to get tougher in the coming years , and with Apple sales having stagnated , dropping 1 per cent last month , now could be the moment for the company to focus more closely on making sure Apple customers keep coming back for more in this difficult period .
Ron Johnson could be the man to tackle the problem head - on .
Jonathan Ive
Front-runner
The 41 - year - old from Chingford , east London , is senior vice president of industrial design at Apple .
Internationally renowned as the principal designer of the iMac , iPod , iPhone and the PowerBook G4 , he was awarded a CBE by the Queen in 2006 .
To many , after Jobs , Ive best embodies the spirit of Apple and is a favourite potential successor – recently 49 per cent of voters in an online poll said they trusted Ive to run Apple .
However , Ive 's pathway to Apple 's throne is n't quite so straightforward : will one of the world 's most influential designers want to give up such a creative role to take on the infinitely divergent tasks of a CEO ?
Further ,
Ive is famously private , and may lack the charisma and presentational skills expected of an Apple CEO .
Rank outsider
Eric Schmidt
Could Apple bring in a relative outsider in an attempt to diffuse any internecine conflicts among the major players in the company 's top echelons ?
Perhaps Eric E Schmidt , current CEO of Google and already a member of the board of directors at Apple , would be an ideal , if surprising choice .
Schmidt led development of Sun Microsystems ' Java technology and ran the software outfit Novell before becoming CEO of Google in 2001 , where he has overseen the introduction of new Google products such as Gmail , Google Talk and the Android phone - operating system .
Schmidt , with an estimated net worth of $ 5.9bn , was recruited by Google as the straight man to rein in the " mad scientist " impulses of the company 's founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
His ability to do so could be useful to Apple to keep Jobs acolytes in check , while the Apple CEO role might entice Schmidt as it could afford him greater creative freedom than being Page and Brin 's third wheel at Google .
With Apple , Google and Microsoft limbering up for a battle over the future of cloud computing , Schmidt 's technical background , coupled with his track record in taking on the latter company in the search - engine market , would be a major boon .
Scott Forstall
Long shot
Forstall cut his teeth at NeXT , the software company Jobs founded following his departure from Apple in 1985 .
The software he worked on there was the precursor to Apple 's OSX , and the buy - out of NeXT by Apple in 1997 saw Forstall join the company , in charge of OSX releases , alongside Jobs , who was then appointed Apple CEO .
This year Forstall was appointed to senior vice president , after having managed the development of software for the iPhone .
His dedication to his previous role bordered on obsessive , as he admitted to ' Time ' in 2007 : " I actually have a photographer 's loupe that I use to make sure every pixel is right , " he told the magazine .
" We will argue over literally a single pixel . "
After his series of impressive performances at recent Apple worldwide developers ' conferences , some observers are tipping Forstall as a worthy successor to Jobs .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NEW ORLEANS - Today the Bureau of Justice Statistics , a branch of the US Department of Justice , released figures showing that , as of December 31 , 2007 , nearly 2.3 million persons were incarcerated in US prisons and jails , giving the United States the largest incarcerated population in the world .
Within the US , Louisiana has the highest rate of incarceration , nearly five times that of the lowest state , Maine .
Louisiana continues to lock - up too many of elderly prisoners and too many people whose biggest problem is addiction .
June , 2008 figures from the Louisiana Department of Corrections show that 13 % of the prison population in Louisiana is over the age of 50 .
More than 30 % of inmates were convicted of drug offenses .
Louisiana also disproportionately incarcerates African - Americans , with more than 60 % of the Louisiana prisoners being African - American .
" We are spending too much money keeping people in jail , " said Marjorie R. Esman , Executive Director of the ACLU of Louisiana .
" Other states have proven that there are more effective ways to treat the problem of crime at lower costs .
These include parole / probation reforms , diversion programs , increasing good - time programs for people behind bars , and sentencing reforms for non-violent offenders ( i.e. drug / mental health courts ) . "
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy remarked , in , 2003 , that " our resources are misspent , our punishments too severe , our sentences too long . "
Since he made those remarks , we have spent more money on incarceration , without achieving the reforms that Justice Kennedy called for five years ago .
Esman continued , " in the current budget crisis , we need to find ways to help those who can be helped , and reduce the costs to all of us associated with overincarceration .
Policymakers need to make corrections reform a top priority because current policies are misguided and costing taxpayers too much money . "

Rebecca Frayn takes her children on picnic to protest at Heathrow expansion guardian.co.uk
It 's always quite interesting , heading to a flash mob like this .
On the train to the specified destination some passengers are just slumped as usual , staring into space , but others are checking everyone out from the corner of their eyes , looking away quickly when anyone glance in their direction .
We all reach Heathrow with no idea what sort of security will be waiting : in the end despite BAA 's hints of machine guns there are just yellow - jacketed police equipped with huge cameras , stationed at intervals along the travelator .
Up , up into the airport , and still nothing shockingly unusual until you reach the departure hall itself .
There , the atmosphere is absolutely electric , prickling with darting eyes and secret acknowledgements .
Edges of costumes and banners protrude from beneath winter coats .
Too many people are carrying musical instrument cases , instead of suitcases .
Everyone is watching everyone else , while the police , lining the long white hall in bristling yellow lines , are trying to watch every single person at the same time .
And then , mysteriously , at 7 pm precisely someone gives a signal .
Like an army going into battle , with a united rustle the coats come off , the blankets are pulled from rucksacks and unfurled on the marble floor .
Out come tupperware , scotch eggs , Carr 's water biscuits , plastic cups and Appletize .
I see a wild - rice salad , a broccoli and brown pasta dish , couscous , cupcakes and beautifully made cucumber sandwiches with the crusts cut off .
The giant picnic is the length of a tennis court : around it the police stand as blank faced as possible .
It is the most British of all possible protest armies .
Heathrow 's Climate Rush has been organised by the Climate Rush , a group of mainly female anti-aviation campaigners who like to organise in memory of the suffragettes ( that 's why the period costume that adds such charm to this whole affair .
You can't have too many men in top hats on a protest ) .
The idea came into being last December , the realisation took just a couple of weeks .
The people here ( I 'd guess , very roughly , about somewhere between 400 - 600 ) come from Sipson village , through Facebook , from the Climate Rush mailing list , from the Youth Climate Coalition .
There are older people ( often with the best picnics ) but there are also a lot of teenagers , a lot of 20 - year - olds , even a handful of children .
Sue Morgan is here because " we 're digging ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole " ; Casper ter Huile is here because " we 're nearly past the tipping point , we need hundreds of thousands of people on the street if we 're going to take action now " ; and Hannah is here because " I really like trains and I think we should be concentrating on that now " .
None of them want to see a third runway .
None of them are optimistic that the government is going to say no .
After a while the weird mysterious picnic calm disintegrates a little into the occasional chant and then some odd attempts at performance art ( women in green catsuits flying mini planes around ?
Tossing blow - up globes in parachute clothes ? ) .
At the last minute it looks as if the protestors are considering a Rush on the police by the departure gates but it turns into a spirited dance - off instead ( only the protestors are dancing obviously .
They win by default ) .
It has been as fluffy as fluffy can be , and by the end even the police are beginning to look a little mellow .
By 9 pm it 's all over ( apart from one doughty group who start defiantly opening up a tent ) .
I overhear one policeman making a crack about ' Sipson refugee camp ' .
It wo n't all be so peaceful , however , if the government makes what these people believes is the wrong decision next week .
As Sue Morgan ( not someone who would usually put me in mind of the Godfather ) puts it : " If the third runway goes ahead there will be a lot of a protest .
And it wo n't all be sitting down like this .
With cups of tea . "
You heard her .
Do n’t be surprised when I laugh in your face .

A couple of my friends on IRC have told me this , and since I 'm using 10.4.11 I could n't verify , but the latest Mac OS X Security Update 2009 - 001 apparently breaks your Perl , if you
are using Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard )
and are using Perl that comes with Mac OS X
and have upgraded several core modules with CPAN in the past
In other words , it does n't break yours if you a ) have n't ever used CPAN with your perl , b ) are on Tiger like me or c ) have built Perl yourself , or are using other Perl like MacPorts one .
In other words , it does n't break yours if you a ) have n't ever used CPAN with your perl , b ) are on Tiger like me or c ) have built Perl yourself , or are using other Perl like MacPorts one .
Once your
Perl gets broken , you 'll see errors like this :
% perl -MIO IO object version 1.22 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.23 at / System / Library / Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/XSLoader.pm line 94 .
Compilation failed in require .
BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted .
This is because the Security Update brings ( old ) IO. bundle with version 1.22 but your IO.pm has been updated to the latest 1.23 on CPAN shell .
( But hey , 1.23 was released in 2006 ...
Why do you bring that ancient version back , Apple ! ? )
The fix is to update IO. pm to 1.23 , but since IO . pm is now broken , you can't even run CPAN shell to do this ( Ugh ! ) .
You need to go to CPAN and grab IO - 1.2301.tar.gz , unpack it and run " perl Makefile .
PL ; make ; sudo make install " to fix this .
You probably need to do the same against Scalar : : Util and Storable .
This is another reason why you should n't use Perl that comes from vendors ( Apple is n't any different from Fedora on this ! ) or use stuff like local : : lib to keep system modules clean .

It 's becoming clear that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is not , as backers have suggested , just a minor tuneup to worldwide intellectual property law , one done for the purpose of cracking down on fake DVD imports or Coach handbag ripoffs .
Such a law — one that amounted essentially to some streamlining and coordination in the fight against actual pirates — might well be hashed out between nations operating in secret .
But a treaty that seeks to apply criminal penalties to peer - to - peer file - sharing ?
Let 's open a window and let the sunlight in .
Rightsholders , especially in the music and movie businesses , have been upfront about what they want , and it's a long and sometimes scary list .
But it has been hard to know if any of these ideas are actually moving forward in the ACTA negotiating sessions , since none of the countries involved have seen fit to release much in the way of useful information on the process —
To the public , anyway .
Based on sources and leaked documents , Knowledge Ecology International now asserts that ACTA drafts are in fact " formally available to cleared corporate lobbyists and informally distributed to corporate lawyers and lobbyists in Europe , Japan , and the US . "
As for what 's in these drafts , which are too secret to be seen by the public paying the negotiators ' salaries , it 's a long and mostly boring list of items intended to stop or slow shipments of counterfeit goods .
But the ACTA proposals currently include language that would make copyright infringement on a " commercial scale , " even when done with " no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain , " into a criminal matter .
ACTA drafts are in fact " formally available to cleared corporate lobbyists and informally distributed to corporate lawyers and lobbyists in Europe , Japan , and the US . "
Both KEI and Canadian law professor Michael Geist , who has been working his own sources , say that the current proposals require all signatories to " establish a laundry list of penalties — including imprisonment — sufficient to deter future acts of infringement . "
Geist believes that P2P use is the obvious target here , though such provisions might well be enacted only against file - sharing hubs rather than end -users .
Camcording in theaters gets its own special section and must also be considered a " criminal act " by countries that adopt ACTA .
Handling fake movie and movie packages would also get the deluxe criminal treatment .
Also interesting , though of less concern to end users , are the proposed " border measures " that would allow customs agents to act against counterfeit goods .
According to Geist :
The proposals call for provisions that would order authorities to suspend the release of infringing goods for at least one year , based only on a prima facie claim by the rights holder .
Customs officers would be able to block shipments on their own initiative , supported by information supplied by rights holders .
Those same officers would have the power to levy penalties if the goods are infringing .
Moreover , the US would apparently like a provision that absolves rights holders of any financial liability for storage or destruction of the infringing goods .
ACTA will also become a sort of institution , with the creation of an ACTA Oversight Council to coordinate enforcement , schedule yearly meetings , etc .
Taking the hint
Some governments appear to be listening to the public criticism of the process .
Michael Geist filed an Access to Information
Act with the Canadian government and dug up a few new interesting documents .
One shows that Canadian negotiators at least read the documents submitted during public consultations ; in it , negotiators noted " that the issue of transparency in the formal negotiation process is important for many of our stakeholders .
Stakeholders have also requested additional information on the scope of the proposed ACTA , as well as further information on why the Agreement is being negotiated in this manner , as opposed to in existing multilateral fora such as WIPO or the WTO . "
Such concerns are apparently being aired to the other ACTA countries , though it 's clear that not everyone involved shares the Canadian public 's interest in transparent process .
The US Trade Representative has held a public consultation and a public meeting in DC to address concerns about ACTA , but little information has been forthcoming .
Just how little ?
Public Knowledge today detailed its struggle to get some ACTA documents using a Freedom of Information Act Request .
The government turned over 159 pages of information , then indicated it had found another 1,390 pages .
But , according to PK attorney Sherwin Siy , " Of these , 1,390 will be withheld under various statutory exemptions to the FOIA .
Yes , thats all of them . "
Things have n't been much better in the EU , where a Dutch group has tried to access documents and gotten nowhere .
When have we ever lied to you ?
So what we have to go on are largely leaked documents and the bland reassurances of governments .
The European Union is a good example of the latter .
" ACTA is about tackling large scale , criminal activity , " we are told .
" It is not about limiting civil liberties or harassing consumers . "
It is not about limiting civil liberties or harassing consumers .
It goes on to say , " ACTA is not designed to negatively affect consumers : the EU legislation ( 2003 Customs Regulation ) has a de minimis clause that exempts travellers from checks if the infringing goods are not part of large scale traffic .
EU customs , frequently confronted with traffics of drugs , weapons or people , do neither have the time nor the legal basis to look for a couple of pirated songs on an i-Pod music player or laptop computer , and there is no intention to change this . "
( i- Pod ? )
And if you think that these negotiations are taking place in smoky backrooms to which only corporate lobbyists have access , you could n't be more wrong .
" It is alleged that the negotiations are undertaken under a veil of secrecy , " says the EU .
" This is not correct .
For reasons of efficiency , it is only natural that intergovernmental negotiations dealing with issues that have an economic impact , do not take place in public and that negotiators are bound by a certain level of discretion . "
Let 's hope it's all true , and that the concerns of civil society groups and citizens really are considered .
Perhaps they are ; perhaps they will be .
But it 's certainly hard to tell at the moment .
The EU and everyone else involved can issue all the say - nothing press releases they like , but those who care about the issue would feel a lot better if they could see the evolving drafts and have some process for providing input on them ; asking people to turn in one document months ago without having seen even a set of proposals hardly qualifies as an " open process . "
Still , when you consider that RIAA - backed measures like ISP filtering do n't appear in the current leaked drafts and MPAA - backed " three strikes " laws also appear to be absent , perhaps the governments truly are attempting to keep ACTA focused on industrial - scale piracy .
It would just be comforting to have something other than their words to go by .
Reporting on a February 9 Business Week article by Pete Engardio on “ State Capitalism , ” the National Center for Policy Analysis summarizes :
Across the United States , state governments are crafting economic strategies that blur the boundaries between the public and private sectors .
They are targeting specific industries and intervening in ways that go far beyond traditional perks like tax breaks and cheap land .
The article gives many examples of government venture funds , R&D consortiums , and other so - called public - private partnerships now operating or about to begin .
States have always engaged in such activities to some extent , although a public revulsion against them curtailed them to some extent in the wake of the debacle of the late 1830s and early 1840s , when some states revised their constitutions to forbid or constrain such undertakings .
Recently , however , the states , like all other levels of government in the United States , have launched into public - private partnerships with unprecedented vigor and funding .
These partnerships , which epitomize economic fascism , promise to waste resources on a wide front .
The idea that politicians and politically appointed “ experts , ” in league with rent - seeking businessmen , can allocate resources more effectively than the private capital markets is a characteristic form of the folly that is leading our generation to march over the same cliff that our forebears marched over in the 1930s .
Each step in this direction moves us farther from economic liberty and closer to the complete politicization of economic life — a trend that recent de facto or de jure government takeovers of large banks and other financial firms are already accelerating .

US President - elect Barack Obama has nominated his former rival , Hillary Clinton , as his secretary of state .
Mr Obama described the former first lady as a woman of " tremendous stature " who had his " complete confidence " .
Mrs Clinton lost out to Mr Obama when they contested a bitterly fought race for the Democratic Party 's nomination .
Mr Obama also announced his nominations for other key national security posts .
He said the current Defence Secretary , Robert Gates , would remain in his job .
Retired General James L Jones was named national security adviser , while former justice department official Eric Holder was nominated for the post of attorney - general , and Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as secretary of homeland security .
Mr Obama 's long - time adviser , Susan Rice , will serve as the US permanent representative to the United Nations in New York .
OBAMA'S SECURITY TEAM Secretary of State : Hillary Clinton Defence Secretary : Robert Gates National Security Adviser : General James Jones Department of Homeland Security : Janet Napolitano Ambassador to the UN : Susan Rice Attorney General : Eric Holder
A balanced foreign team Obama 's team so far World press : Pragmatic choice Send us your comments
His foreign policy team under Hillary Clinton will reassure the more hawkish elements in the US , but might disappoint those who wanted a more radical shift , says BBC News website world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds .
Mr Obama said Mrs Clinton " knows many of the world 's leaders " and " will command respect in every capital " .
He added : " Hillary 's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances . "
Although the two repeatedly clashed during the nomination race , Mrs Clinton went on to campaign for Mr Obama as he took on Republican Senator John McCain in the race for the White House .
Complicated agreement Former President Bill Clinton had cleared the way for his wife 's appointment by reaching a complicated agreement on his financial arrangements , reports said .
The American people have demanded not just a new direction at home , but a new effort to renew America 's standing in the world as a force for positive change
Hillary Clinton Correspondents said there had been fears her nomination could falter over the appearance of conflicts of interest between her husband 's charitable foundation and lucrative speechmaking schedule .
Mr Clinton has agreed to release the list of donors to his foundation by the end of the year , officials overseeing the presidential transition said .
He has also agreed to submit future engagements , speeches and sources of income to the State Department and the White House and to take a more behind - the - scenes role in the daily running of his foundation , sources said .
' Energy and intellect '
Mrs Clinton pledged to give the job " her all " .
" The American people have demanded not just a new direction at home , but a new effort to renew America 's standing in the world as a force for positive change , " she said .
We will also ensure that we have the strategy - and resources - to succeed against al - Qaeda and the Taleban
Barack Obama
The current secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , praised Mrs Clinton as an " inspiration " who would " bring enormous energy and intellect " to the role .
" And most important I know her to be somebody who has what you need most in this job : which is a deep love of the United States of America . "
Announcing his team , Mr Obama said : " The national security challenges we face are just as great and just as urgent as our economic crisis . "
Announcing that Mr Gates would remain in his job , Mr Obama said he would be given " a new mission " to " responsibly " end the war in Iraq .
Mr Gates said he was ' deeply honoured ' to be asked to continue " We will also ensure that we have the strategy - and resources - to succeed against al Qaeda and the Taleban , " he added .
Selecting Mr Gates - who was appointed by President George W Bush two years ago - allows Mr Obama to honour a promise to name at least one Republican cabinet member .
Mr Gates said he was " deeply honoured " to be asked to continue and that he did so with " a profound sense of personal responsibility , to and for our men and women in uniform and their families " .
Gen Jones , the nominee for national security adviser , is a former top commander of Nato and US forces in Europe .
He served in the Bush administration as a Middle East adviser .

“ It ’s disappointing that Congress failed to act tonight , ” Tony Fratto , the deputy press secretary , said .
“ We think the legislation we negotiated provided an opportunity to use funds already appropriated for automakers , and presented the best chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make difficult decisions to become viable .
We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress . ”
Immediately after the vote , the administration was already coming under pressure to act on its own to prop up G.M. and Chrysler , an idea that administration officials have resisted for weeks .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers called on the administration to use the Treasury ’s bigger financial system stabilization fund to but there may not be enough money left to do so .
About $ 15 billion remains of the initial $ 350 billion disbursed by Congress and Treasury officials have said that money is needed as a backstop for existing programs .
Democrats also immediately sought to blame Republicans for the failure to aid Detroit , but
“ Senate Republicans ’ refusal to support the bipartisan legislation passed by the House and negotiated in good faith with the White House , the Senate and the automakers is irresponsible , especially at a time of economic hardship , ” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement .
“ The consequences of the Senate Republican ’ failure to act could be devastating to our economy , detrimental to workers , and destructive to the American automobile industry unless the President immediately directs Secretary Paulson to explore other short - term financial assistance options .
” So far , the Federal Reserve also has shown no willingness to step in to aid the auto industry , but Democrats have argued that it has the authority to do so and some said the central bank may have no choice but to prevent the automakers from bankruptcy proceedings that could have devastating ripple effects .
The rescue plan approved by the House on Wednesday by a vote of 237 to 170 would have extended $ 14 billion in loans to the troubled automakers and required them to submit to broad government oversight directed by a car czar to be named by Mr. Bush .

But even before the House vote , Senate Republicans voiced strong opposition to the plan , which was negotiated by Democrats and the White House .
At a luncheon with White House chief of staff , Joshua B. Bolten , they rebuffed his entreaties for support .
" We understand that there is a social problem ( with divorce ) , but now we 're seeing there is also environmental impact as well on the footprint . "
Senator Fielding , who came from a family of 16 children , has been married for more than 20 years himself .
He quoted from a US report he described as " reputable " .
" Mitigating the impacts of resource - inefficient lifestyles such as divorce helps to achieve global environmental sustainability and saves money for households , " Senator Fielding quoted .
The Federal Government has agreed to investigate Senator Fielding 's concerns .
Ross Carter from the Environment Department told the hearing he had not read the US report , but would take action .
" Certainly now that we 're aware of it we will discuss that with other agencies , " he told the estimates committee hearing .
The government had not measured the impact of divorce on Australia 's greenhouse gas emissions .
Divorce would be a factor in decreasing the efficiency of housing , Mr Carter noted .
" I would imagine that the sort of information that you 're quoting from that study would be another factor that would have increased the usage of housing space and decreased the efficiency of that usage , " Mr Carter said .
Senator Fielding is one of seven balance - of - power senators in the upper house .

Will Ben Bernanke return to the scene of the crime ?
Bernanke
If , as widely expected by financial markets and Fed watchers , the Federal Open Market Committee lowers the target federal funds rate for interbank lending by 0.50 percentage point at the conclusion of its Tuesday - Wednesday meeting , it would leave the funds rate at just 1 % . [… ]
HONG KONG  Panasonic said on Wednesday that it was shedding 15,000 jobs , the second significant layoff in Japan ’s electronics industry in less than a week .
It was the latest example of how Japanese companies , exporters in particular , were scrambling to cut costs as demand evaporates .
Panasonic , along with Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda , also joined the rapidly lengthening list of companies to sharply revise their full - year outlooks Wednesday , with Panasonic now projecting a net loss of 380 billion yen or $ 4.2 billion for the year ending March 31 , rather than the 30 billion yen profit it forecast on Nov. 27 .
Mitsubishi expects a net loss of 60 billion yen and Mazda 13 billion .
The speed of the demand downturn in recent months has taken manufacturers and economists by surprise , and forced many companies to sharply lower profit warnings made only months or even weeks ago .
As concern mounts that no tangible improvement will come until late in 2009 at the earliest , companies have intensified their cost cuts : large - scale layoffs like the ones announced by Panasonic on Wednesday and by the computer maker NEC last Friday are likely to become increasingly common .
NEC is cutting 20,000 jobs .
Hitachi , Toshiba and Sony have all also recently announced thousands of job cuts .
Whatever the truth about The Pirate Bay , its administrators certainly put on a convincing show of not being particularly astute businessmen — the sort of people who do n't read the contracts they sign , do n't proof the speeches they read , and do n't actually care much for the law .
The Pirate Bay trial just wrapped up its fourth day in Sweden , making front - page headlines in local papers ( " Fiasco for prosecution in Pirate Bay case , " said one ) and stirring up comments from Abba members ( " Is it really so damn difficult to pay your way ? " asked Bj?rn Ulvaeus ) .
Music trade group IFPI even had its local Swedish website hacked and defaced by a group called " The new generation . "
But it was the courtroom action today that was most interesting , as two of The Pirate Bay defendants took to the witness stand and answered questions .
Sweden allows a commingling of civil and criminal cases sometimes , leading to the odd spectacle of the defendants being questioned both by state prosecutor Hakan Roswall and industry lawyers from the music and movie industries .
Fredrik Neij was questioned by lawyers who tried to paint him as the point man for The Pirate Bay operations .
Peter Danowsky , who represents the music business , pointed out that Niej owned The Pirate Bay 's domain and then showed him a contract he had signed saying that he would oversee operations for the site .
Neij 's response ?
" But I did n't read it . "
Neij was also asked about a speech he gave back in 2006 ( watch it on YouTube ) in which he said that the site had received many threatening letters over the years from copyright owners .
Lawyers tried to use the speech to show that Pirate Bay admins were aware the site hosted links to copyrighted content .
Neij 's response ?
" I just read the text which someone at the Pirate Bureau had written . ”
( Neij says he 's dyslexic and has difficult writing his own material . )
When asked about his view of the law as it related to copyrights , Neij said that he does n't worry much about the law , does n't care about the ideology behind ( some ) file - swapping , and does what he does because it 's fun to run a large site .
He did indicate that he thought the site was legal .
The datan?rd speaks
Image credit : Gottfrid Svartholm WargImage credit : Wikimedia Commons
Gottfrid Svartholm
Warg is exactly the sort of person who should n't wear a scruffy little beard , but does — one Swedish commentator referred to him today as a prototypical " datan?rd " ( data nerd ) .
He took the stand today and showed the same lack of apparent interest in ownership , contracts , and legal papers as Fredrik Neij .
The prosecutor kept trying to pin him down on who ran the site , how it was organized , and who paid for ( and received the revenue from ) site operations .
Varg kept insisting that the project was n't a " top - down " business , but that interested users volunteered time and effort to make different pieces of it work .
The prosecution appeared not to believe this and continued asking questions to tease out the relationships between everyone involved .
Warg continued to insist it was a " loose project " — even the moderators who took down material that did n't match its stated description were volunteers .
The apparent disconnect between the defendants and a prosecution convinced that The Pirate Bay is an organized criminal enterprise swimming in cash prompted Swedish Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge to reflect on the " generation clash " between the two sides .
But prosecutors and industry lawyers remain convinced that the appearance of disorganization is an illusion .
Many of today 's questions turned on The Pirate Bay 's relationship with an Israeli businessman who served as an ad broker and helped the group with some other business ideas .
Peter Danowsky of IFPI yesterday said in a statement , " This [ case ] is about a purposeful crime on a grand scale with significant income as a result , " noting that the Bay continued to display ads after being raided by Swedish police .
We checked in with the Bay 's Peter Sunde in 2008 after claims emerged that the site was pulling in more than $ 3 million a year .
Without providing any specific numbers , Sunde told
Ars that real numbers were n't that high and that bandwidth , power , and hardware bills meant that the site was either breaking even or operating at a slight loss .

NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 Graphics Card
When NVIDIA launched their GT200 GPU and the first two graphics cards based on it - the GeForce GTX 280 and the GeForce GTX 260 , they thought they had ATI licked for good .
In fact , they originally pegged the GeForce 9800 GTX + as the direct competitor to ATI 's forthcoming ( at that time ) Radeon HD 4870 graphics card .
Unfortunately , NVIDIA grossly underestimated the ATI Radeon HD 4870 , which not only roundly trounced both the GeForce 9800 GTX + and the GeForce GTX 260 , but was also more than a match for the GeForce GTX 280 .
ATI followed that up with a second blow - the dual - GPU Radeon HD 4870 X2 , which effectively made ATI the new leader in the consumer 3D graphics market .
The fall was hard on NVIDIA .
They were dominant for the last 2 - 3 generations of graphics cards and to fall so far so fast was a certainly a big blow .
But NVIDIA is never one to sit down and cry .
They may have stumbled but they now feel they have a card fast enough to regain their dominance in the industry - the new dual - GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 !

LONDON ( Reuters ) - The United States and Israel must change policy toward Hamas and engage the Palestinian militant group if progress is to be made on peace in the Middle East , a group of former peace negotiators said on Thursday .
Writing in Britain ’s Times newspaper , 14 former foreign ministers and peace negotiators said the three - year policy under which Hamas has been ostracized by the international community had backfired and needed to be changed .
“ There can be no meaningful peace process that involves negotiating with the representatives of one part of the Palestinians while simultaneously trying to destroy the other , ” wrote the signatories , who include Britain ’s Paddy Ashdown , a former negotiator in Bosnia , and Michael Ancram , who helped broker peace with the IRA in Northern Ireland .
Hamas , a militant group whose founding charter calls for Israel ’s destruction , won a Palestinian parliamentary election in January 2006 , defeating long - time rival Fatah .
But the group was immediately cut off by Israel , the United States and the European Union , which regard it as a terrorist organization .
Peace negotiations have , however , continued with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who heads Fatah .
The letter ’s signatories said Israel ’s recent war against Hamas in Gaza had “ demonstrated that the policy of isolating Hamas cannot bring about stability . ”
“ Bringing Hamas into the process does not amount to condoning terrorism or attacks on civilians , ” the letter will say , according to excerpts provided in advance .
“ It can strengthen pragmatic elements and their ability to strike the hard compromises needed for peace . ”
The letter is published ahead of a visit to the region by George Mitchell , the newly appointed U.S. envoy to the Middle East , and Javier Solana , the European Union ’s envoy .
On Wednesday , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that talking to Hamas was the “ right thing to do ” but Egypt and other parties were best placed to do so .
Israel has said that it will not deal with Hamas until it ends all violence , abides by already existing peace agreements and recognises Israel ’s right to exist .

So these are the Palm ’s “ new - ness ” that we all have been waiting , are they that really worth waiting for ?
It had been hectic week for me especially over the past few days , with so many workloads to finish , I only had little time for my own addiction of mobile news .
So I came late to inked down my thoughts about Palm Prē™ and the webOS™ , some of you must have read the news and hands - on of them on the net , if you ’re already bored and sick of reading another one , then you better hit the next post because mine here is a long post .
But if you still ca n’t get enough of Palm ’s “ new - ness ” and maybe you ’ve missed few important info , then let ’s dig in for more and find out what have make the buzz all over the net since its announcement at CES 2009 .
I ’ve gathered around some of the news I found most interesting , and which can give us clearer pictures of the Palm Prē™ and webOS ™ .
Allow me to break them down each into the software ( webOS™ ) and the hardware ( Prē™ ) , this way you ’ll be more focus on the details .
Let ’s start , shall we ?
The webOS™ : User Interface ( UI )
Joshua Topolsky from Engadget mention the Palm ’s new OS as “ quite a bit more revolutionary than the iPhone , ” the UI outclasses most of its competitors .
And another cheering remarks when he tried the webOS™ , all of the menus and switching are done with a grace and simplicity that we rarely see on any device , animations are smoothly going in and out .
While Ginny Mies & Melissa J. P. from PC
World believe the new webOS ™ is one of the silkiest and best - designed smart phone platforms they 've seen in a while .
Palm ’s new OS will clearly give iPhone and Google Android some competition when it comes to phone usability and overall appeal .
And Adrian Covert from Gizmodo found a neat feature when he handled Palm Prē ; a black surface under the screen which he calls it as the Gesture Bar , streamlines some of the navigation so you can use the phone with one hand , especially when trying to reach the upper part of the screen .
If you 're working in a specific app , you can drag your finger up from the Gesture Bar to the screen , hold it for a second , and the wave dock will appear , making it easy to quick launch another app .
From some of the quick hands - on reviews I ’ve read on the net , all of them are saying the webOS ™ is splendid in handling finger scroll and swipe , including glide gesture which is very favorable by users after iPhone perfected the feature .
These finger features can be seen as trivial things , but essential for creating a user friendly device with large touch screen like the new Palm Prē™ .
Palm must be planning to make the most of Prē’s™ 3.1 - inch 480x320 display , silently encourage Treo / Centro users , who are accustomed to use their device with one hand , to ditch the need of a stylus to take advantage both of Prē’s™ touch screen and webOS ™ finger - gesture friendly UI .
This is exactly the challenge found in nowadays touch screen based smartphones , including the iPhone and G1 Android .
So for you stylus addicts , you should consider this thought through , because Palm Prē™ is probably the first indication that Palm is leaving behind stylus for the next smartphones to come .
The webOS™ : Multitasking & the deck of cards
One of the most noticeable items , which is basically the first and only item shown at the main UI , is a deck of cards placed at the bottom to keep you inform of what are working on the background and alerts for incoming calls , text messages and emails without interrupting whatever app you ’re currently open .
Apps remains live , even when minimized into the card view , so changes can continue to happen in real - time , even if you 've moved on to another activity ; says PC World .
Joshua from Engadget also noticed that when you 're zoomed out to cards , the data is still active in the previews .
You can view each of your open applications at once , shuffle them any way you choose , and then discard the ones you want to close .
Adrian from Gizmodo says in his quick hands - on review that when user launch an app , user can drag it onto your phone desktop to create a new card , and when finished with a card for a specific app , closing it is as simple as flicking the card upwards .
All of those show how the webOS ™ stylishly handles multitasking , something that Apple is still stubbornly restrict in the iPhone even until today .
The webOS™ : Copy & paste ( ZOMG ! ;- p)
I could just mention this insignificant feature in any above categories , but I simply wish to emphasize the other feature that ’s still dumbfounded - ly restricted in iPhone : copy & paste .
~ LOL ~
Joshua from Engadget says the copy and paste feature is implemented by holding a thumb on the gesture area and grabbing the text you want with your other thumb or a finger -- there 's also a dropdown menu that lets your move through a number of editing options .
The webOS™ : the web browser
I believe it ’s inevitable for any mobile OSes to not include their own built - in web browser , besides avoiding the share of revenue from 3rd party web browser embedded inside the OS , it ’s more stabile and reliable to create your own web browser .
And Palm has done a great job for creating the webOS ’s™ web browser .
Sascha Segan from PC
Mag reports that the browser is based on WebKit , like Apple 's Safari .
It supports streaming video in RTSP , H.263 and H.264 formats , but not Flash .
But knowing how ambitious
Adobe when it tried several times to get Flash into iPhone , we can expect Adobe to bring Flash into webOS ™ web browser .
During the Palm Prē™ introduction at CES 2009 , we were shown how the web browser is able to handle several web pages at once and then show them all as thumbnails like in IE ’s Quick Tabs feature .
PC
World says users can have as many browser windows open as they want ( only limited by the available memory ) and users can still save pages for offline viewing ( for example to view them while in plane ) .
Overall , all of the reviewers say the web browser renders fast and beautifully , no glitches and the browser was extremely responsive during the hands - on with the prototype .
The webOS™ : those neat little features
The new webOS ™ has some features that may look trivial , simple but yet useful and very user - friendly for daily usage .
Here are some of them according from PC World :
The calendar has color coordination and multiple calendar support .
The calendar has color coordination and multiple calendar support .
The Messaging application now combines both SMS and instant messaging into a single umbrella .
The conversations are threaded ( as they are on current Palm OS - based phones ) , and can represent ongoing conversations with one contact , across multiple systems ( ie , you start the conversation via text , and continue via AOL Instant Messenger ) .
Prē’s™ ambient light sensor .
If you 're in a movie theater or dark environment , and you receive a message or call , the display will show up darker than normal .
The Prē™ will receive updates over - the - air in the background ; and all software installation will be done over the air .
Prē™ users will have access to Amazon 's Mobile Music Store , also seen on Google 's Android - based G1 .
The store makes it easy to download DRM - free tracks directly to the phone .
Prē's™ built - in accelerometer seemed quite responsive , but not overly sensitive .
For example , the display does n't flip until the phone is almost completely horizontal .
Engadget reports that if you 're on a web page you can flip the display around and it will automatically reorient , and Gizmodo says it ’s worth noting that the accelerometer works quite well .
The webOS™ : life in the net without walls
Palm CEO
Ed Colligan said this during his session on stage at Palm CES 2009 event , “ Lots of smartphone bring you the Internet -- but Prē™ does this without walls . ”
And so that ’s what the webOS ™ does , it helps liberate us from the walls ( read : restrictions and limitations ) which nowadays average smartphones have put around us .
In today ’s modern life , it ’s unlikely for mobile addicts like you and me not to be connected to the net even for one day , it has become like the air we breathe every day .
Palm understands this , and the new webOS ™ is capable to bring down those walls with nifty little features like these :
Adrian from Gizmodo praises the way webOS pulls data from various web services , and melds it into its own framework is top notch .
Users will be able to text , gChat and send IMs messages all from the same window , without switching between apps for messaging .
He also loves the way users can search for something on the Prē™ , and then shoot that same query up to Google or Wikipedia without having to launch the web browser .
It 's another way the internet has subtly worked its way into the phone without being constricted to a specific app or browser .
According to PC World ; users can subscribe to public and specific calendars , like those on Google and Facebook .
If you use the Pre to add something to your Google calendar , that info will be synced with that on Google 's Calendar Web site .
And the Synergy in webOS ™ email interface makes it easy to check and search through multiple e-mail accounts .
Select a contact , and webOS will autopopulate an e-mail with that contact 's info .
While Joshua from Engadget says when viewing an email you can click on the sender and view their contact card , which is populated with traditional info like phone and email , but also includes statuses for different services like GoogleTalk and Facebook -- another tap and you 're chatting with them .
Still according to PC World ; the webOS ™ Messaging application now combines both SMS and instant messaging into a single umbrella .
The conversations are threaded ( as they are on current Palm OS - based phones ) , and can represent ongoing conversations with one contact , across multiple systems ( ie , you start the conversation via text , and continue via AOL Instant Messenger ) .
Sascha Segan from PC
Mag found out that while the Prē™ wo n't come with desktop software , there will be solutions for people to get their Palm Desktop or Outlook info , and info from earlier Treo and Centro models , into the Prē™ .
And users can drag and drop songs over from PC using USB mass storage to put their music collections into the Prē™ .
But alas , not all webOS™ features are there .
One of the essentially needed in the first place to be there ; video recording is nowhere to be found in webOS™ .
Although we can expect video recording apps to pop out as soon as the phone launched , it ’s still a big question why Palm did n’t embed such feature .
The webOS™ : apps & development
Ever since Apple has introduced App Store , the whole idea of centralized distribution for apps has become widely accepted and a must have gate for users to get the needed ( or hardly useful but fun ) apps .
Having plenty of apps to support the mobile platform can really help to boost the popularity of the phone itself , Palm knows this more than Apple or Google .
With abundant apps available since the first version of Palm OS more than 10 years ago , Palm has been enjoying all the benefits from 3rd party software developers support , so are the Palm users from TX to Treo / Centro generations .
So it is Palm who now follows Apple & Android steps , and named its own app store as : App Catalog .
But unlike Apple who puts iron grips over App Store policy , Palm is taking Android ’s open policy for allowing developers to access most of the phone 's capabilities , including calendaring , contacts , music and video playback .
It would appear that Palm is very open to allowing developers nearly full access to the device 's capabilities ; says Clint Ecker from ArsTechnica .
Sascha Segan from PC
Mag is also reporting the same : Palm will certify all developers and approve all apps , but only to make sure they work properly .
They wo n't kill apps for content - related reasons like Apple does .
Think Android , not iPhone .
Adrian from Gizmodo further more reveals that what Palm is mostly concerned with are the security and stability of the apps .
Making sure there are n't apps that crash or provide holes for their phones to be hacked .
Palm also say they will work close with select partners on app and give them access to deeper areas of the OS that are not available in the SDK , but developers wo n't get access to the Linux core .
Wait , do you hear me say Linux ?
Yessire , webOS ™ is Linux based OS ; though that is invisible for most developers as the tools to write applications are JavaScript , HTML , and CSS says Ina Fried from CNet .
Ina from CNet then later found that Prē™ does have the technical capability to be used as a tethered modem for a laptop ( The original story suggested it could n't based on comments from Sprint that the feature would n't be made available ) .
Back to the Linux topic again , the webOS is indeed based on Linux , and is in some way an extension of what they 've been crafting for a while now , but on top of that Linux core is a display layer that is basically WebKit ( quoted from Engadget ) .
Thus , literally the naming of Palm ’s new webOS ™ can be interpreted as all of the apps will be written for the platform are web - based .
Developers will use Mojo , WebOS ™ application framework , to develop WebOS ™ applications using standard technologies such as HTML5 , CSS , and JavaScript .
And according to Tom Krazit from CNet ’s Wireless blog ; Palm also says there will be a way to migrate older Palm OS applications to WebOS™ , but does n't say how that will work or how it might affect performance .
Ohkay , I ’ve talked a lot about Palm webOS™ , so let ’s take a quick look at Prē™ hardware .
The Palm Prē™ : cute , round and a bit chubby
I do n’t need to say much of Prē’s™ look , because every phone ’s shapes are different from each individual ’s point of view .
Below are the first impressions from each reviewers :
Engadget :
The phone is very light and surprisingly thin , though it does n't feel like a " toy . "
There are buttons and ports around the edges , but everything 's fairly flush with the device ...
The screen is encased in the rounded shell of the device , but comes through incredibly bright and sharp , with zero trouble with viewing angle .
Glare might be an issue outdoors , but it 's not too bad otherwise .
Gizmodo : A good size comparison would be an iPod classic with a big hard drive .
In terms of thickness , it 's definitely not as thin as the iPhone , or even the bold , but it 's an acceptable size considering it 's a slider .
...
While the hardware is definitely high quality , I 'm not entirely blown away by the design .
It looks really nice , and original , but it 's a little too cutesy in shape and kind of reminds me of an oversized pebble .
PC World :
The glossy - black Pre has a unique curved slider body :
When you slide the 3.1 - inch screen up , it curves slightly towards you , a design point intended to resist glare and make the phone feel comfortable in - hand and against face .
And as for me , my first impression from seeing the Prē™ is : me like it !
~LOL ~
It has everything I like from the chubbiness of my Treo , to the modern curvy line that combine into one smartphone which will rest comfortably in my hand .
If a mobile device is designed too thin , then it ’ll easily slips from clumsy hands where it ’ll then plunge down to meet and greet with the hard pavement .
Plus IMHO , with an extra thickness , the Prē™ will feel more sturdy in hand .
The Palm Prē™ : simplified buttons by Palm
Apart from the apparent larger touch screen , Palm has changed its smartphone design to become more sleek and simple with only a rounded center button , that looks and feels like a ball bearing .
It acts as navigation button , replacing the antique D - pad in previous smartphone line - ups .
And for Palm loyal fans and addicts , these are for you guys : the top of the unit retains Palm 's slider switch for turning off the phone 's volume and it has a shortcut to jump to airplane mode ( something travelers will appreciate ) as reported by PC World .
Horraaay !! ;-D
Last but not least , is the volume control button placed like usual on the left of the Prē™ .
The Palm Prē™ : same o’cramped & squishy keyboard
Oh naw , from all of the Palm “ new - ness ” , what I do n’t understand is why Palm still insist on using Centro ’s / Treo Pro ’s keyboard for the new Prē™ ?
It ’s like getting all pumped up from opening a nicely wrapped present , but then a little bit disappointed to find a same o’toy to play with inside .
And it ’s not just me who feel this way :
Engadget :
The keyboard is reminiscent of the Centro or Treo Pro , but closer to the Pro in that the keys are spread out and somewhat larger .
The key presses are about as shallow as the keys on the G1 , but the rubberyness makes that forgivable .
PC World :
We do have some complaints about this early unit .
The keys are slightly recessed , and the bezel lip on the sides and bottom can interfere with typing .
Furthermore , the top row is a few millimeters too close to the top of the slider screen , so we had to angle our fingers in order to press those letters .
Palm says that the form factor may be altered slightly before the release date , so we 'll be curious to see if our design nits might be addressed by then .
It ’s nice to see Palm has used red color lettering to separate the keypad from letters on the keyboard layout , makes you instantly stare at the red dot when the keyboard slides out .
;-
p
And speaking about keyboard , PC World also reports that surprisingly the Palm Prē™ has no touch keyboard , but a third party developer could come out with an app .
Aw , double naw !
The Palm Prē™ : no memory slot no worry ?
This is another big question , and disappointment too for long Palm users all around the world ; there ’s no memory slot in Palm Prē™ which means you ’ll be stuck to the fixed 8 GB of internal memory storage .
But thank goodness , Palm makes it better than iPhone , because you can tether the unit to a PC using a USB cable , and transfer files directly from your PC to the phone ; it will be recognized as a mass storage device .
Still , if you ’re planning to get Palm Prē™ as soon it ’s out in the market tomorrow , you better start reducing those huge music albums and video collections .
With only 8 GB of memory available , it ’ll depleted soon enough before you know it .
The Palm Prē™ : what ’s the processor ?
I ’m sure you ’ve already memorized Prē’s™ specs and can mention them one by one with your eyes closed , so I ’ll skip the specs out to shorten this post .
But like you , I ’m puzzled about Prē’s™ processor .
Palm is still hiding it from the press , and probably only a handful of software developers who have received Mojo ( webOS ™ SDK ) know what is the processor used in Palm Prē™ .
The only comforting assurance for us , is that Prē™ definetely got one badass kickin processor to power up its meany webOS ™ UI and features .
So early adopters can rest assure to dream of owning the latest technology which wo n’t become obsolete in short time span , let ’s pray it wo n’t .
The Palm Prē™ : more Prē™ models to come
Either you ’re not interested with Sprint ’s service or price for the upcoming and unannounced contract for Palm Prē™ , you ’ll be happy to know what Sascha Segan from PC Mag is reporting :
Yes .
There will be different models , in different shapes and sizes .
According to a tipster , the next Pre may be a lower - cost , candybar - style phone without a QWERTY keyboard .
( Hip-hip Hooray ! !! )
Palm is anticipated to announce a GSM / UMTS model for Europe and Asia in mid-February .
Palm expects to address the foreign carriers for Prē™ at a press conference at Mobile World Congress in mid-February .
The Palm Prē™ : pioneering the wireless charge
From all of Palm ’s “ new - ness ” , I ’m very excited to see Palm has finally able to take the initial move that made Palm famous in PDA era back then : a pioneer .
And this time Palm has introduced TouchStone , the wireless charger for Palm Prē™ .
Do n’t be fooled by the first impression on the look of this amazing wireless charger , it may look like a paperweight , or a doorstop , or as even Palm employees are calling it as the “ puck ” .
~ LOL ~ Chris Ziegler from Engadget says that the magnets buried in the Pre certainly seemed to do their job of keeping it glued to the base in portrait and landscape orientations .
Two thumbs up for Palm !
Me like it , and definitely will get one when arrive here . ;-)
The Palm Prē™ : what ’s up with the name ?
I do n’t have a problem with the new webOS ™ name , but it ’s the opposite when I first heard the new name for Palm ’s “ new - ness ” smartphone : Prē™ .
I mean , c’mon .
Palm usually used the combination of “ e ” and “ o ” put in four words altogether like for instance : Trēo™ , Centro™ , or Folēo™ .
But I guess Palm is trying to break the aging pattern , so now it ’s only three words : Prē™ .
It did feel awkward at first , but my tongue finally got used to it .
After that , somehow I ’m getting the vibe from the name ; perhaps Palm wants to give a pre view for the new age of the upcoming 10 years of Palm .
So maybe we ’ll see more than we can ask for ?
Bring it on Palm ! ;-p
Last thoughts
Is Palm on the right track now ?
Will webOS ™ has a long life like Palm OS ?
Will Palm
Prē™ become as good as the first hands - on reviews when it finally out ?
Will you jump in and try the new Prē™ right away ?
These are what I think as a common sense for everyone who is still unsure whether to get the new Prē™ , or the old Palm OS based smartphones like Trēo™ 680 & Centro™ .
Even for long and loyal Palm fans , the long delay of Palm ’s promised “ new - ness ” has left a quite big hole that is now filled with others : iPhone & Android to name the few .
Palm should realize this , and take necessary actions to keep their main bloodline ( and revenue ) alive .
So , my fellow PalmAddicts ; are the new Prē™ and webOS ™ enough to sway you once again into Palm world ?
Pheew , this has been a long post to write for me and to read for you .
Until we meet again on the next episode of the little things that you ( may ) have missed .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
As Wall Street tracks Washington 's moves to help the beleaguered banking sector and push through a massive economic stimulus , nearly 400 of the S&P 's 500 companies have weighed in and reported a collective loss , even excluding the financials .
“ ' This is the worst ; after the sixth quarter of negative growth , it will be the first quarter ever of negative earnings . ' ”
" This is the worst ; after the sixth quarter of negative growth , it will be the first quarter ever of negative earnings , " said Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst , at Standard & Poor's .
A sixth quarter of negative growth ties the prior record set when Harry Truman was president , running from the first quarter of 1951 to the second quarter of 1952 .
" Next quarter , we 're expecting a new record of seven quarters of negative growth , " Silverblatt added .
As of the close of business Thursday , Silverblatt calculates S&P earnings per share , on a reported basis , at a loss of $ 10.44 for the quarter .
If financials were taken out of the equation , that deficit would drop to $ 2.35 a share .
" The majority of it is financials , but the biggest issue to hit as reported -- the worst charge -- was ConocoPhillips COP , - 3.70 % , which accounted for $ 3.66 , " said Silverblatt .
Income from continuing operations at the companies in the S&P 500 that already have reported earnings fell $ 90.8 billion , with financials contributing $ 70.4 billion of the decline .
Conoco accounted for $ 31.9 billion of the shortfall , said Silverblatt .
Financials also led losses in Friday trades , while telecommunication issues fronted the gains .
The major indexes meandered in and out of positive and negative territory before ending near session lows .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % fell 82.35 points , or 1 % , to finish at 7,850.41 , giving the blue - chip gauge a 5.2 % slide from last Friday 's close .
The Dow is now " too heavily weighted in financials to accurately reflect the current business mix of this country , " said Marc Pado , U.S. market strategist , Cantor Fitzgerald .
The S&P 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % declined 8.35 points , or 1 % , to end at 826.84 , translating into a 4.8 % weekly drop , and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , - 0.29 % shed 7.35 points , or 0.5 % , to 1,534.36 .
With 84.8 % of the market value and 390 issues reported , operating earnings , which includes income from products or services and excludes financing and other costs , are down 62 % from the fourth quarter of 2007 , Silverblatt said .
On Capitol Hill , lawmakers prepared for final votes as early as Friday afternoon on the huge economic - stimulus plan backed by the White House .
