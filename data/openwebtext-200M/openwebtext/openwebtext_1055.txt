It matters not what lines , numbers , indices , or gurus you worship , you just ca n’t know for certain where the stock market is going or when it will change direction .
Too much investor time and analytical effort is wasted trying to predict course corrections — even more is squandered comparing portfolio market values with a handful of unrelated indices and averages .
Annually , quarterly , even monthly , investors scrutinize their performance , formulate coulda ’s and shoulda ’s , and determine what new gimmick to try during the next evaluation period .
My short - term performance vision is different .
I see a bunch of Wall Street fat cats , ROTF - LOL , while investors beat themselves senseless over what to change , sell , buy , re-allocate , or adjust to make their portfolios behave better .
Why has performance evaluation become so important short - term ?
What happened to long - term planning toward specific personal goals ?
When did it become vogue to think of investment portfolios as sprinters in a race with a nebulous array of indices and averages ?
Why are the masters of the universe rolling on the floor in laughter ?
— Because an unhappy investor is Wall Street ’s best friend .
By emphasizing short - term results and creating a cutthroat competitive environment , the wizards guarantee that the majority of investors will be unhappy about something , most of the time .
In the process , they create an insatiable demand for an endless array of product panaceas and trendy speculations that regulators fall bubble - years behind in supervising .
Read
— Your portfolio needs to be uniquely your own , and in line with some form of realistic investment plan .
I contend that a portfolio of individual securities rather than a shopping cart full of one - size - fits - all consumer products is much easier to understand and to manage .
You do need to focus on two longer - range objectives , however : growing your productive working capital , and increasing your base income .
Neither number is directly related to any of the market averages , interest rate expectations , or the calendar year .
A focused approach protects investors from their too normal reactions to short - term , anxiety - causing events and trends , while facilitating objective based performance analysis that is less frantic , less competitive , and more constructive than conventional methods .
Unlike most techniques , it recognizes the importance of income generation as a long - term growth enhancer .
The terms “ working capital ” and “ base income ” are tenets of The Working Capital Model ( WCM ) .
The former is simply the total cost basis of the securities and cash in the portfolio , while the latter refers to the total dividend and interest production of the portfolio .
The discussion below is based on the complete WCM methodology .
If we reconcile in our minds that we ca n’t predict the future ( or change the past ) , we can move through the uncertainty more productively .
We can simplify portfolio performance evaluation by using information that we do n’t have to speculate about , and which is related to our own personal investment program .
Let ’s develop an all - you - need - to - know chart that will help you manage your way to investment security ( goal achievement ) in a low failure rate , unemotional , environment .
The chart has five data lines , and your portfolio management objective will be to keep three of them moving upward through time .
Please refer to the chart in Chapter 7 of “ The Brainwashing of the American Investor : The Book that Wall Street does not want YOU to Read ” , or search Working Capital Model .
The Working Capital Line :
The total portfolio working capital should grow at an average annual rate between 5 % and 12 % plus , depending on your asset allocation and current interest rates .
Higher equity allocations should produce greater growth over the course of a complete market cycle .
Note that this major - focus line is absolutely not a measure of market value .
In fact , the market value line is expected always to track south of working capital .
If market value breaks through , it means there are unrealized capital gains in the portfolio— you ’ll want to avoid that scenario .
This line is increased by dividends , interest , deposits , and realized capital gains and decreased by withdrawals and realized capital losses .
The WCM is an investment - grade - only methodology , and it includes techniques that cull downgraded or non-productive securities from portfolios at pre-defined times during the market cycle .
Thus , high cost basis junk does n’t inappropriately impact the long - term slope of the working capital line .
Similarly , the WCM attempts to keep tax code based decisions out of the process .
For example :
Offsetting capital gains with losses on good quality companies becomes suspect because it results in a larger deduction from working capital than the tax payment itself .
Similarly , avoiding securities that pay dividends , and / or paying flat - fee commissions in advance , reduces the income compounding effect that the WCM attempts to nourish .
A declining working capital line can be very informative .
If you are experiencing too many capital losses , it ’s a sure sign that you selection criteria are too speculative ; you are n’t diversifying properly ( or in 2008 and 2009 ) that you were victimized by misguided federal government intervention both before and during the financial crisis .
Excessive withdrawal activity , for whatever reason , reduces more than just working capital .
It also reduces current base income and stunts the future growth rate of both numbers .
Long - term portfolio and income growth demand control of expenses at a level below base income .
Hmmm — I wonder if that would work in Washington ?

Cavemen just did n't have our problems .
And when they did feel stressed , they could just toss a boulder or something .

Last month , researchers found that schizophrenics were more likely to have been subjected to influenza in the womb than healthy individuals .
Other common experiences can also drive away our wits , long after we are out of diapers .
In fact , the typical American lifestyle teems with risk factors for mental illness , says Stephen Ilardi , a psychologist at the University of Kansas and author of " The Depression Cure : The 6 - Step Program to Beat Depression without Drugs " ( DeCapo Press , 2009 ) .
But we can protect ourselves by adopting the habits of our distant ancestors , he said .
" In modern life , our environment is continually activating the brain 's stress response , " Ilardi said , bombarded as we are by email , tragic news and interpersonal demands .
Certain circuits in the brain react to stress as if it is an infection , triggering social withdrawal , inflammation and potentially leading to brain damage in areas such as the hippocampus , the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia , Ilardi said .
In many mental disorders , " inflammation is a big culprit , " Ilardi said .
In short bouts , inflammation is the body 's way of protecting itself .
But if prolonged , it can take a tremendous toll .
Like heart disease and insulin resistance , mental illnesses such as schizophrenia , depression , autism , anxiety and bipolar disorder have all been linked to inflammation .
And the prevalence of many of these illnesses has increased in lockstep with modernization , Ilardi said .
The relative sanity of our distant ancestors should not imply they led stress - free lives .
Hunting dangerous game does not exactly instill Zen - like breaths .
But " our remote ancestors had many factors woven into the fabric of their lives that turned off the brain 's stress response , " — habits that in most developed countries have fallen out of fashion , Ilardi said .
For example , if met with an impediment on a path to some succulent boar , hunter - gatherers may have vented their frustration by , say , heaving a boulder out of the way .
Physical exertion holds up a potent stop sign to the stress - inflammation circuitry , Ilardi said .
But today , an urban dweller stuck in traffic can do little but stew .
Many mental illnesses are recognized as a problem with brain chemistry , and therefore treated chemically with medication .
But behavior also alters brain chemistry .
Several primitive habits , researchers have found , may check the stress response and prevent it from making our brains sick .
A program developed by Ilardi and colleagues — that helps individuals adopt the habits of cool , collected cavemen — is proving more effective in treating mental illnesses than conventional medication .
For primal protection from modern insanity , try to :
Balance your Omegas
The ideal balance between Omega 6 and Omega 3 fats is one - to - one .
In the typical American diet , the ratio is closer to 16 - to - one , largely due to the modern tendency of feeding livestock grains instead of grass .
Compounds derived from Omega 6 fats encourage inflammation , cross the blood - brain barrier and can trigger depressive responses , Ilardi said .
Omega 3 fats , found in salmon , walnuts and flaxseeds , are anti-inflammatory and can help break the stress - inflammation cycle .
Get more Zzzzs
A century ago , Americans were averaging nine hours of sleep every night .
These days , according to the National Sleep Foundation , many people get less than seven , a trend that has been linked to an overall decline in mental health .
Strive to get 8 to10 hours of sleep each night to help your brain and body fully recuperate .
Seek social support
While our distant ancestors likely enjoyed being the best at something , say the best gooseberry spotter among their community of 50 to 100 individuals , in " today 's global village of 6.5 billion people , nobody is the best at anything , " Ilardi said .
Finding a niche in a subset community may dissuade this inevitable ego knocker as well as provide other mental health goodies , such as halting rumination .
Interrupt circle - think
Focusing on a problem or discomfort can be adaptive ; it helps us find solutions .
But when we become fixated , the repetitive stress can erode our ability to rebound .
Rumination , Ilardi says , is particularly common when we 're alone , a state familiar to many inhabitants of developed countries .
In contrast , our ancient ancestors rarely went solo .
Having company or partaking in engaging activities can stop ruminative thoughts in their tracks .
Walk it off
We evolved as recreational athletes .
Our ancestors not only spent much of the day engaged in moderate aerobic activity but also undertook regular weight - bearing chores , such as digging ditches and building huts .
Studies have shown , just 90 minutes of exercise a week can be as effective as psych - medicines such as Zoloft .
Take time to bask
Everyone knows sunlight feels good .
But it may also stave off illness .
Sunlight — in modest quantities — triggers the production of an endogenous form of Vitamin D that , like Omega 3 fats , is anti-inflammatory and can help deter a runaway stress response .
Develop a world view
While research on the relationship between religion and mental health is inconclusive , individuals who have a global framework — a way of understanding the world , whether it be religious , philosophical or scientific — may have an increased ability to withstand blows to their mental health , Ilardi said .
the media takes on scientology , again
The wealthy , secretive UFO cult is back in the news and they 're not taking it well .
Illustration by Amorphia Apparel
When you ’re a wealthy and influential religious cult with lots of celebrities in your midst , a predisposition to all sorts of angry outbursts the moment someone even looks at you the wrong way , and spokespeople who tend to descend into conniptions whenever they defend your interests , you should n’t be surprised that major news organizations make you the focus of their special reports .
I ’m talking about Scientology of course , the group founded around the work of a mediocre sci- fi writer and famous for guarding its image so jealously , many of its publicity efforts backfire , giving critics even more ammo to wield against the organization .
And today , nearly two decades after Time Magazine wrote a scathing expose of the group , it ’s tactics have n’t changed at all .
Yes , I said it .
Hubbard was no Asimov or Heinlein , who were his gifted contemporaries .
Known for his dense , often derivative stories and books , the only organizations which sing praises to his storytelling are small but grandly named groups with strong hints of Scientologist influence at the top .
So instead of putting up with his also - ran status in the literary world , he decided to create a religious mythos in which an evil alien warlord with interstellar spaceships that look like very particular and very Earthly aircraft , wages war on the galaxy .
To make some extra cash off his believers , he invented “ auditing ” which has about as much scientific basis as crystal balls and tarot cards but costs tens of thousands of dollars over intensive treatment courses .
And to protect a lucrative business model , Hubbard decided to create a doctrine which allows Scientologists to go after their critics by any means necessary , including lying , stealing and bodily harm .
It ’s his borderline pathological sensitivity to any sort of criticism that may have inspired some of Scientology ’s best known efforts to silence anyone who took issue with that they did .
From viciously harassing a journalist with the stated intent to either scare her into silence or get her certified as mentally ill , to stealing government documents that could cast Hubbard and his associates in an unfavorable light , and editing Wikipedia to get rid of critical information about the group , there seem to be very few things Scientologists wo n’t do .
But as they try to bully or silence any ridicule , they ’re blissfully unaware that their strong - armed tactics only inspire further criticism and build ill will .
Their unhinged spokespeople do n’t help either because there are few things worse for a public relations campaign than a ranting representative chanting that defectors who berate the group for its actions are all demented psychotics at a soothing 10,000 decibels .
And note the constant accusation of psychosis .
According to Scientologists , the only people who could have a distaste for them are psychopaths which just begs us to ask a question of how one organization could inspire so many mentally unstable people and why its defenders are the ones screaming into the microphone about who ’s sane and who is n’t .
Of course there ’s also the issue that Scientology believes that psychology is just a pseudoscience and all mental health professionals are dangerous quacks .
If they truly agree on this concept , is issuing diagnoses reserved for the evil witchcraft of psychology and psychiatry really a good idea ?
LONDON , July 31 ( UPI ) --
Slightly more than half of the children involved in a flu study suffered side effects from taking the drug Tamiflu , researchers in Britain said .
Fifty - one percent of the 351 children given Tamiflu at three elementary schools in London and one in south west England experienced nausea , nightmares and insomnia , The Guardian reported Friday .
Advertisement
The children were given Tamiflu , an antiviral nasal drug , in April and May after classmates became infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus , Britain 's Health Protection Agency said .
The study found 20 percent of the children also suffered neuropsychiatric side effects , such as poor concentration and confusion , The Telegraph reported Friday .
Only people with suspected or confirmed H1N1 now are being prescribed Tamiflu , British health officials said .
Doctors in Japan also advise not giving Tamiflu to those under age 19 , the Guardian reported .
Nausea is a known side effect of Tamiflu , but neuropsychiatric effects from taking it have yet to be proven , a statement from Tamiflu - maker Roche said .
Mousavi Reportedly Under House Arrest Opposition leader on Facebook : ' All my communication ... has been cut off . '
LONDON , June 27 , 2009  --
The government crackdown in Iran has moved so quickly and brutally the protests have been forced into near silence .
The Web site gooya.com reports that opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi is under house arrest , although that claim could not be verified .
The well - known Iranian filmmaker Moshen Makhmalbaf , who has become an unofficial spokesman for Mousavi outside of Iran , told ABC News that Mousavi is being highly controlled and is limited in whom he can meet with and where he can go .
On his Facebook page Mousavi , who analysts say is under intense pressure , posted a message in Farsi , English and French telling his followers : " All my communication with the people and you has been cut off , and people 's peaceful objections are being crushed . "
He also urged his supporters to protest using only " legal channels " and to remain " faithful to the sacred system of the Islamic Republic . "
He also had a message for those who seek the downfall of Iran 's Islamic regime : " It is up to you , " he wrote , " to distance yourself from them , and do not allow them to misuse the current situation . "
Another graphic undated video shows what appears to be a crowd surging on government Basij militia men .
The video shows one man falling after gunshots ; it appears the man is shot in the head .
The government is now trying to put an end to nightly demonstrations as people shout " God is great " from their rooftops , a tactic that has been used since the 1979 revolution .
Video was posted to YouTube showing a home that was ransacked after its residents claimed that Basij militia roaming the streets at night forced their way in after suspecting that shouts were coming from the roof .
Residents say the militiamen are also destroying satellite dishes in an effort to cut off news from foreign broadcasts .
Despite the harsh crackdown , an opposition that appears to be reeling with its leadership in disarray , long - time Iran watchers say the government may only be making the forces of reform stronger than ever .
Robin Wright , a former Washington Post journalist and now a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center , says , " The opposition may have been forced off the roof tops and out of the streets , but it has not been silenced .
There is still a lot of energy and perhaps more energy today behind the opposition movement because they have been so alienated by the brutal crackdown . "
The challenge for the opposition is how to direct that energy with no clear leader .
Today , Mousavi appeared to cave in to government saying no more protests with official authorization .
Wright , the author of " Sacred Rage : The Wrath of Militant Islam , " says Iran 's government may , in the long term , have the tougher job with so much frustration over the extreme measures exhibited by the government .
Even if completely successful in quelling the opposition , Iran 's religious and political leaders now face the daunting task of restoring order and trust both at home and abroad .
" There has never been a fissure so deep in Iranian society , " said Wright .
" Trying to pull some state of unity back together is going to be nearly impossible . "

If aldermanic candidate Marcus Paca sets foot in New Jersey , he can be jailed for not paying child support .
Paca refused to answer further questions .
“ Are you a voter ?
Do you live in this neighborhood ? ” he asked .
“ If you ’re not a constituent I do n’t need to answer that . ”
“ As a matter of fact , why do n’t you go ahead and tell Eli [ Greer ] to drop this in the entire neighborhood and see what it gets him .
I know that ’s what ’s next , ” Paca said .
Greer , a co-chair of the Ward 24 Democratic Committee , has been an outspoken supporter of McCormack .
“ We ’re going to take care of this immediately , ” he said .
“ It ’s not going to have any effect on the election . ”
Paca said that someone was “ playing dirty . ”
He did n’t specify who .
“ I did n’t receive anything in the mail .
No phone calls that I ’m not making my payments . ”
“ My payments are up to date , ” he said .
“ Obviously they got it late or processed it late . ”
Paca said that he made his last child support payment two weeks ago .
“ I make them every two weeks .
It ’s coming out of my check , ” he said .
“ This is n’t right , ” he said , looking at a copy of the warrant .
( Click here to view it . )
“ I ’ve been making my payments . ”
On Wednesday evening , Paca was sitting in the living room of his Maple Street home with his campaign manager , Cherice Dykes .
He said that he was not aware that there was a warrant for his arrest .
Higgins said that he could not reveal the total amount of money that Paca owes in child support .
If Paca continues to miss payments , the charges will accrue , Higgins said . ” If you do n’t pay , it ’s going to go up . ”
By July 13 , Paca had not sent in a payment and the warrant was issued , according to Higgins .
Higgins said that the warrant is the result of missed child support payments .
At a June 12 hearing , a judge found that Paca had fallen behind and gave him a month to come up with $ 500 .
“ There was a requirement that he make a lump sum payment by a certain date and that payment was not made , ” Higgins explained .
Paca could be in for another arrest if he ’s pulled over in New Jersey .
“ Any encounter with law enforcement ” in New Jersey would mean an arrest for Paca , Higgins said .
If he ’s pulled over for having a tail light out , for example , New Jersey police would scan the records , find his warrant and arrest him , Higgins explained .
Higgins said that there have been two previous warrants issued for Paca for missing child support payments .
The first was on July 15 of last year .
Paca was taken into custody for that warrant when he appeared in a New Jersey courthouse on Aug. 1 for another matter , Higgins said .
Then on Sept. 17 , another warrant was issued for the same reason .
Paca turned himself in on Oct. 27 and paid up at that time .
News of Paca ’s ongoing child support problems initially came out in May , when the Independent reported that the candidate owed $ 20,000 to the mothers of his two children in different states .
He has a 3 - year - old in New Jersey and a 10 - year - old in Virginia .
Paca is the second aldermanic candidate to have had an arrest warrant issued in his name this year .
The first was West Rock ’s Carlton Staggers , who was sought by police earlier this year for an alleged hit - and - run and for driving with a suspended license .
He paid a fine and the charges against him were nolled earlier this month .
Paca is locked in a battle for Ward 24 ’s aldermanic seat in the Edgewood neighborhood , running against 22 - year incumbent Liz McCormack .
They face each other in a Democratic Party primary on Sept. 15 .
Paca insisted in an interview that he did nothing wrong .
He claimed that he has been keeping up with child support payments and that the warrant , which he had n’t known about , is in error .
“ It ’s not a good thing , ” said Vicinage Chief Probation Officer for Somerset County John Higgins , who confirmed that the warrant is active .
Higgins provided a non-actionable copy of the warrant by email .
The July 13 warrant is the third that has been issued for Paca in the last year , Higgins said .
The warrant , issued on July 13 , does not extend outside of New Jersey .
It directs police to arrest Paca ( pictured ) in that state unless he pays the latest $ 500 he owes on outstanding support bills that at last count reached $ 20,000 for two children with two different mothers in two states .

Posted by : working ( too hard ) mom | August 27 , 2009 2:41 PM Mr. Paca -
Please remember you are a Dad.
Perhaps you should consider being more active in your children 's lives instead of devoting all this time and effort into becomming an Alderman .
I would venture to guess that your various children need you more than the good people of Ward 24 .
Also .... from your final comment above , I gather you will only speak to those people that vote ????
Gee , how discriminatory of you .
I thought you would be willing to represent ALL of the people , not just the ones that you can benefit from .

Was she released from jail ?

Marcus , Campaiging for alderman takes at least ten hours a week .
Being a responsive , responsible alderman takes at least fifteen hours a week .
Use the time to get a part - time job and send your kids their child support .
Your choice to run for office rather than pay your child support speaks to a set of values that I simply do not share .
I 'm disappointed but not suprised that the Mayor and his lackeys do n't feel the same way .

I bet Greer is staling your phone calls , too , Mr. Paca .
It 's a conspiracy !
But no , you seem like a quality guy .

Before anyone jumps on this bandwagon , I encourage you to contact Marcus and get his side of the story -- the actual facts and the manner in which he was approached for comment : paca4alderman@gmail.com

What type of message is Mr. Paca sending to his constituents and the young people of our community ?
If elected , will he take care of the people in his ward the same way he handles his child support payments ?
I do n't see how anyone can vote for someone that handles their responsibilites with such poor judgement .

Arrent warrents are public knowledge .
You can find out that type of info using the internet quickly and easily .
Welcome to the electronic age , Mr. Paca .
The warrent was likely available on the internet almost immediately after it was issued .
Posted by : James | August 27 , 2009 3:36 PM
But JZ , Greer is probably stealing his email , too !
Hey , how about , I do n't give a ... if he paid or not .
Multiple kids by multiple mothers in different states to whom he is not married ?
Sounds like a stand - up guy to me .

Marcus -
I think you are thinking too small .
With a past like this you are ready for prime time .
I think you should apply for a for job with the Obama team .

New Jersey is n't particularly exciting anyway and parts of it are downright unattractive .
Newark is the car theft capital of the country , for example .
No sense in risking your freedom and your car .
Most importantly , aldermanic duties do n't cross state lines .
Posted by : cedarhillresident | August 27 , 2009 4:50 PM
And paca do you really think Eli went in your mail .
Come on that is sad .
For $ 4.00 I can go to New Haven PD get your record with that info I can call the Jersey Court and or PD and get the rest ... it is public knowledge .

Marcus is employed and has been for several months .
He makes consistent payements for his children .
Tom ( NHI reporter ) showed up to our home yesterday unexpectedly to " go canvassing with us and have an interview "
He said that he was writing an article for all the candidiates and that he had went canvassing with Liz the day before and did the same .
I told Tom that we did not want to give an interview or have him come canvassing with us .
Only after we declined the interview request , he disclosed a document ( the warrant ) which Marcus had never seen or had any knowledge of .
If we would have recieved this letter issuing a warrant this would have been taken care of immediately .
( Which is why we are concerned about our mail being stolen or mishandled )
We are also having this investigated .
Marcus contacted the person who gave this information ( Higgins ) in the NJ courts today to validate this information recieved from Tom .
Marcus was ordered to pay $ 500 in June , he paid that ( we have the receipts ) .
Apparently the $ 500 Marcus paid was not applied appropriately .
This error has been reconciled today .
Marcus will recieve a letter rescinding the warrant within the next few days .
All those who grace concern should direct questions to Marcus as he is open and willing to speak to this issue .

Why do we need an inefficient bureaucracy to chase after people who owe child support while the children wait and the parents either pay for a lawyer or die a slow death at the Bureau of Support ?
The fact is , anyone dedicated to beating the system can .
We would do better to guarantee parents and children the money they are due and have a smaller bureaucracy dedicated to obtaining reimbursement without penalizing the parents who are raising the kids .
The present system requires numerous frustrating court appearances and many times it is a dead end .
Some people even risk losing their jobs because of the endless court time .
Society is great at celebrating the importance of family and children , but then it leaves a single parent to raise kids without resources in too many cases .
We can change that .
Ask Cedar Hill resident .
The system does n't work !
Change the tax code and make child support tax deductible .
It 's certainly more important than some other deductions allowed .
Incentives work better than punishments .
Posted by : cedarhillresident | August 27 , 2009 7:15 PM truthtopower
I agree 100 % The system does not work .
Case loads are so heavy that paper shuffling happens and no real work gets done .
Most mothers ( and some fathers ) give up because the system is so bad !
That is the case with Paca 's oldest child .
All it takes is a move to another state and you ( the parent raising the child is fu*ked ) .
My case I finally got justice but only after 16 years .
And I did give up ... so worker in VT came across my case and decided I should have my day .
Thank god for good people .
but even in Paca 's case he got behind and then men get scared they will go to jail so they start avoiding it together instead of trying to fix it .
At one time when my ex was still in CT I told the court I would be fine with $ 50 a week as long as I know I would get it .
They refused to lessen it so it remained at 140.00 and I got nothing .
To me something was better than nothing .
I feel for the fathers .
They say they will not have enough to live on .
Well I worked 2 to 3 jobs to put food on the table ... why can't a man work 2 to 3 jobs to pay his support ??
Support is only based on your 40hrs
But with that said Cherice would love it you posted the papers that it was a mistake and that a payment was not just made after the fact .

The real issue is this man has deserted two children .
They will be deprived of love and affection and could end up as drug addicts or criminals .
To me this means he is missing human decency and should not be considered for elected office .
Our Mayor is backing him .
Our city has already fallen in to a moral abyss .
Posted by : James | August 27 , 2009 8:38 PM
Does n't matter , Cherice .
He got kids in two places that he 's not raising .
That does n't scream " responsible leadership material " to me .
Posted by : strangerthanfiction | August 27 , 2009 8:39 PM
Paca always blames everyone but himself for his problems .
And he's not going to waste his con on a reporter or anyone who can't vote for him in this election .
He 's super slick and obviously very focused on saying whatever he needs to say to whomever he needs to say it to get what he wants .
I feel sorry for his kids - they never had a say .
That the Mayor and Voigt continue to give this guy their seal of approval is very disturbing .

Glad that 's worked out for you Marcus .
Now there is nothing that can stop you .
Everything they have thrown at you has been wrong , morally and factually .
Liz , Eli , all her " proxy " supporters and CCNE should be ashamed of themselves .
You 'll show them on Sept 15 !
Posted by : smitty | August 27 , 2009 9:02 PM
Marcus keep your head up and dont forget what I told you at your fundraiser .
I have faithfully paid child support all of which none went to the kids .
I am tired of people talking about fathers and their failure to pay child support .
Most of these mothers when they get the child support dont use one penny of it on the child , which if you are a decent father still end up coming out of your pocket even after paying them the child support .
Marcus politics is ugly , but continue to be a man of integrity , what you do behind close doors , do in front of the world , because you have nothing to hide .
Produce the proof that you paid , then stop giving interviews .
Run a clean race , dont sling mud at no one , because if its GODs will that you be Alderman in that ward you will be .
Stay focus .

Charice and Tom : Paca does n't answer his email .
He sends back a response asking if you live in the district and then saying if you do , he will talk to you face to face .
This is lame .
If he wants to be an alder , whether you are in his district or not , he should speak and be concerned .
At the end of the day , if he wins , he 'll damn sure be taxing us all .
Secondly , Charice - Paca may be making payments through garnishment of his wages but that is not bringing what he owes his children up to date .
He 'll be considered a deadbeat father as long as he's not involved with his kids , and while he 's delinquent .
As for somebody stealing his mail ?
Get off it .
Aside from being a federal crime to do so , it is beyond highly unlikely .
Paca : Man up and take personal responsibility for your sorry behavior .
It 's notbody 's fault but your own .
This latest story reminds me of your race baiting strange announcement when you chose to run .

David nothing was proven yet .
Need to see the papers that he did not just pay it today .
Word and actions are two separate things .
And I totally agree with the above comments that this man is no man ... a man would be there for the children he but on this earth , put the money aside ... he has abandons them !
Sperm donor daddy !

Wait a minute , you mean this guy still has n't paid his child support ? , and he is still running for Alderman with the support of the local party machine ?
Did n't they start to extradite dead beat Dads across state lines a few years back ?
Was n't Blumenthal a big advocate for that ?

It 's good to see such high standards for candidates supported by our mayor --- even if we take him at his word , he is the father of two children from two different women in different states -- one assumes he has little role in raising them .
He has been employed for " several months " and responds to questions with " I 'll speak with you face - to - face if you live in my district - - otherwise forget it " .
This is the best the mayor can come up with -- I 'm embarrassed for our city .

This Higgin 's guy sure gave out alot of information to just be a state employee and then on top of that wrong information .
He should be worried about his job .
I never heard of emailing warrants to the press .
I guess the real question is who / what prompted NHI to pursue Paca 's records from NJ ???
Especially because Paca never recieved this in his mail .
This just seems way to shady to me .
Posted by : Sandra | August 28 , 2009 10:18 AM
Cherice ,
Thanks for providing some clarity to this madness .
It all makes sense now .
I knew Marcus would n't risk anything especially with regard to taking care of his children .
Posted by : Lori | August 28 , 2009 10:32 AM
City Hall Watch - Marcus does reply to his email that is how I am in constant contact with him as well as others in the neighborhood .
( of course if you send him an email he wants to confirm your identity )
He is a face to face type of guy and will literally come by your house or invite you to his to talk .
It is clear that you do not know Marcus nor have you tried to contact him .
People have his cellphone number , he is always visable , and speaks to anyone inside and outside the ward .
Before you bash , if you really want to talk contact him paca4alderman@gmail.com

Again PROOF is needed !!!!!!!!
I can type I am 5 ' 8 ' 120 lb , ass like Jlow , 22 year old .
Does that make it fact or just words type d on a page ???
I want to see he did not just pay it that day because of the story .
He has to prove it is wrong .
Second HE ABANDON TWO KIDS IN TWO DIFFERENT STATES .
That may be fine to those who except this type of behavior as normal ... but most of us see that as a loser !
Posted by : Man do I know ... | August 28 , 2009 10:55 AM
CityHallWatch -
Chances are if his wages are being garnished they tact on the arrears so that he pays for current and bring the owed amount up to date .
When you are uemployed or your wages change they keep adding on to the amount owed .
It takes forever for them to update your records .
2 kids in 2states can be tough ... did you ever think of the affect it has on Paca and the kids .
Things do n't always work out with parents and their is no manual to this stuff .
I try to play devil 's advocate because SOME women can be unreasonable when they do n't want you in the childs life which is a harsh reality that is often overlooked .
Posted by : James | August 28 , 2009 11:03 AM
I knew Marcus would n't risk anything especially with regard to taking care of his children .
You mean except from having more children after fathering and not raising the first , or living a state away from his kids ?
Yeah , they 're clearly his top priority .
Posted by : Darryl Johnson | August 28 , 2009 11:46 AM
Cedarhill ,
You seem to be soo angry and attached to this issue without facts on Marcus ' issue .
You also acuse Marcus of things that YOU DO NOT have proof for yourself .
You have nothing to do but come back to comment over and over on a situation you have NO facts on .
If you want something to do start passing around the hat and start the fund off with a $ 10,000 check , I will follow with $ 1,000 .
It 's worth it given the nonsense that Marcus goes through daily to play an active role in his children 's lives .
Let 's stop assuming and criticizing and HELP .
Anyone know any lawyers to help him fight for his parental rights ??
Posted by : Nakia | August 28 , 2009 2:03 PM
Wow .
It is interesting to see people taking up for a man who may or may not have paid child support but IS running for Alderman .
I do n't know Marcus , do n't live in the ward , but truly wonder what about this situation screams " good Alderman " .
Even if this man did pay his support , is the hint of impropriety something you want in an Alderman ?
And as far as the " nonsense that Marcus goes through daily to play an active role in his children 's lives " , try being a single mother not receiving any financial support .
As for Smitty ... you sound like someone who wants an accounting all the child support money you send - disregarding the fact that someone comes out of pocket for your child long before your money arrives .
For every 1 mother who is " misusing " child support money , I can show you 50 who are still waiting for " reimbursement " for all that they go without for the sake of their child ( ren ) .
Posted by : kyle ward 24 | August 28 , 2009 2:22 PM Paca .... why do n't you get your personal life in order and run another time ...
Susie Voight and the mayor should be ashamed what they are doing to our city ..... let the wards vote for who they want not the strong arm of city hall .... it will be another struggle next year when the co-chairs elections take place ...
Posted by : WARD 24 | August 28 , 2009 2:26 PM
Marcus , know that you still have us behind you .
On Sept. 15 your victory will be testament of your hard work and preserverance !
You 've run the best campaign this city has seen in the history or New Haven .
You are a great role model for your children , this community and this city .
Despite dealing with unemployment , custody battles , constant character attacks , you have overcome .
You have not shown any sweat in it all .
You continued to be strong , lead our community , and be a fighter and advocate for change .
YOU'RE the type of leader we need , hang in there !

Nahh I just keep asking for him to prove things different PROOF not words .
His supporters keep saying that He proved it ... duhh how because he said it ??
No I dont think so Show me that the warrant was a mistake ... not that he payed the $ 500 yesterday because of this story .
He want his kids but he will not pay $ 20,000 in child support ... no judge on this planet would give him the kids because of that .
$ 10.000 No try $ 2000 - 4000
Been there done that .
I am just trying to cut through the BS .
They same he is uniting the community HOW ??
They say he is a good father HOW ?
They say the warrant is a mistake well prove it and prove when the payment was made !
What is so wrong with these simple requests ??
They are not accusations ... saying he is a deadbeat is true he owes 20,000 in child support pretty much above and beyond the def of deadbeat .
The women in VA wants nothing to do with him ... that I will give him he was younger and she went on to a better place .
But the child in NJ how many times has he seen the child this year ???
That would be proof he did not totally abonadon .
I am asking for answers to question that show the charater of this man .
PROVE ME WRONG PROOF NOT WORDS
Why am I working so hard ... because he is going to be a mayor kiss ass
Posted by : lol | August 28 , 2009 3:29 PM
Ihave not commented on this before , but to all those who love Paca so much , what is the story you claim we do not know .
What we do know is he slept with and had children with two different women in two different states .
In at least one state , he is very behind in his support payments .
What else is there to know .
How can he be so involved with his children if his first story was that he did n't know he even had them .
He can not visit them , since he will go to jail if he enters the state .

Paul ,
Thank you for responding .
You can remove the above comment , although I think the " I got Censored " mug is still a good idea .
From memory , here is the part of my comment that was approved , although not initially .
TO City hall Watch : Meeting face to face is lame ?
I think 21st Century democracy is lame .
Posting comments on blogs does not substitute for real political activity .
Maybe you have something to hide since you rebuffed Marcus ' offer to meet face to face instead of e-mailing .
I 'll wager that Marcus has made himself more available than any other candidate during this election .
Here 's a test :
Try to set up a face to face meeting with both candidates in Ward 24 , and see who responds first .
Posted by : strangerthanfiction | August 28 , 2009 9:45 PM
The best thing that can happen for Paca is if he loses this race , and then uses the opportunity to reconnect with the kids he left behind in Virginia and New Jersey .
Despite leaving women with kids in these two states ... he seeks to represent the concerns of an aldermanic ward .
Yet he has no remorse , no self awareness or regrets .
If he gets elected you know this kind of stuff will just keep on coming up because he just does n't get it .

You have consistently either removed important segments of my post or just refuse to post them at all .
Again in response to CEDARHILLRESIDENT question Paca does not have to be qualified to run and what has he done to deserve the seat ?
Nothing .
He has done the exact same thing the guy she supported in the 94th district did .
Nothing .
As to Paca 's personal life I would advise him to focus his time on getting his personal life in order .
The welfare of his children should come first before any political asperations he may have .

I can go on and on but , Until someone can explain to me why I have lived on Winthrop Ave. for 12 years and have not met Mrs. McCormack , I will only vote for the man ( MARCUS PACA ) who has come to my house to discuss community issues several times within the the past months .
Not because he wants my vote , because he cares about this community and will represent ALL people in the ward .
One more thing ...
McCormack has yet to come to by my house or even give a call .
Save the paper it does no good , I 'd like to put a face to your name !

Ya but mine was in the military for some time worked up in Hartford for bill dyson , works at the college and worked with community 's on many African American issues and is NOT A DEADBEAT DAD .
But with that said did anyone hear Blumenthol this morning on the radio about deadbeat dads and what losers they are running state to state to avoid support orders ,
He said people do n't like the word DEADBEAT , but that is what they are DEADBEATS , he wants a national system to protect women and men from having to go through what pacas kids mother and many other parents have gone through .... ANYWHO where are the papers to vindicate paca ... the papers that say he payed the money before the the story came out ... and how he united this community ??? and how he is a good father ???

As an intern , WOW .
As for college and boards he was an administrative asistant and has done no more than anyone else .
His enlistment and the work he performed in the service is a extremely embellished .
He is no more qualified than Paca .
Furthermore Paca is not accountable to you or anyone else .
His accountability is to his children .
The real fact is that neither you or I have a vote in the ward .
The voters in the ward will have the final say .

What happened to the space on Whalley which was proposed as a laundromat .
Greer slammed that with his co-signer Alder McCormack .
DID ANYONE ASK THE PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR IDEAS !
Alder 's are representatives of the PEOPLE not just
What are we left with ... a vacancy !
and where is the contigency plan ?
I know what we can put there Gan School II .
Be sure to build the fences high and paint it mushroom , olive , and burgundy .
http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/02/laundromat_okd.php
O wait what about the trees she has been so influential with planting , that she really has n't done much for ( on the other side of the ward of course )
http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2009/04/500th_tree_plan.php#entry-014747more
Or what about when the lease was up for the Police Substation .
The City of New Haven rents the space on Whalley from Egdewood Corners aka Greer .
McCormack and Greer fought to keep it open only because the rent circulates more $ $$ to the Greers .
I love it !
Posted by : SUNRAZE | September 1 , 2009 4:12 PM some of you sound like scatterbrains .
None of you know what the situation is with his kids and their mothers .
If you were thinking instead of judging you would realize the women have the power to take their children and move to whereever they want to .
Just because the man is not physically with his children everyday , you do not know what his relationship is with his kids or their mothers .
He could have a better relationship with them than some of you who see your children everyday .
Judge the man on his record not on his personal issues , which have nothing to do with his ability to do a good job .

He at least had some political experience where paca has none .
And second Gary has been doing an amazing job for a freshman !!!
He worked in the nuclear sector of the military !
Paca just started a sales rep job with
One communication he is my rep .
But I will say finally some intelligent comments Paradox .
That was what I was looking for .
First the people in the area plant the trees and if the people on the other side want to plant trees I am sure we can hook them up .
They just have to get dirty and come out and do the work .
Like many do in the city .
They will not be planted for them .
It is called community .
As far a s the laundry .. please that was the right move and all were invited but know one ever came .
That is what a management team is ... do you go to them ???
They talked about alternatives and the whole nine yards with that property .
I would of invited crime .
Most area shriek at the thought of laundromats going up because of the lack of regulations they have ... times ect .
the loitering and illicit crime that happen at them ..
I would be thankful for the halt on that .
As far as the sub station I am not up on what happened with that so can not really comment .
But thank you for having facts ect .
that is what debate is all about !
Posted by : Insider2 | September 1 , 2009 5:35 PM
So did I .
I kept inventory while serving my country .
So your point is ?
As for political experience what has he done prior ?
If folks and NHI had put him under the microscope as many are putting Paca you would have been amazed what you would have discovered .
Just ask anyone from his hometown and all you will get is a snicker .
Only in New Haven can one come out of nowhere land a leadership position and no one raises an eyebrow .
So why not Paca .
He cant do any worse than McCormick .
What has she done but take up a seat .
God Bless New Haven Politics .
Yes Paca has some serious personal issues and his time would better spent putting his affairs in order .
However there is no reason he can't do both .
As for your man doing well in his freshman year .
Well I can see it does n't take much to impress you .
Nothing he has done has translated in to any real services for the district .
It is all about him .
Posted by : strangerthanfiction | September 1 , 2009 7:26 PM
Like others , I 'm still waiting for Mr. Paca to come forward with the papers and materials that prove this was a misunderstanding , that he has been making payments on schedule and that these legal matters are behind him .
Anything else is just talk .
I 'd like him to show proof that the NJ courts got it wrong .
Posted by : Paradox | September 2 , 2009 9:40 AM
Cedarhillresident - I went to a few Management team meetings .
I stopped going primarily because Greer ran the show .
It seemed that he influenced all the ideas and everyone fell right in line with the BS .
You seem to be really active , how are the meetings looking lately ?
I will take you up on that tree ... who exactly is responsible for those projects ?
Whats the process if one wants a tree ?
Is their anyway to inform everyone in the ward ?
My concern with the laundramat is , fine we decided it may not be the best business for the place , but WHAT IS ?
Let 's find a solution better than a vacancy which is sure to bring loitering and illicit crime .
I do have to object to some of your statements about Paca .
In my conversations with him ( trust me I gave him the 3rd degree ) , he seems to be a lot more politically savvy then McCormick and majority of our alders for that matter .
Being an alderman does n't require much experience .
However , he has certainly done his homework before jumping into this race .
Just to name a few things , he went to democracy school to learn the interworkings of New Haven politics , attended BOA and finance meetings consistently , worked on numerous campaigns , goes to all management team meetings ( tried to get me to come back ) , PoliSci major in undregrad .
The kid even got his MBA several years ago .
The kid has a quite impressive background .
There is no way he is your sales rep because he has n't worked for One communications in months .
I remeber when he was first got his new gig and told us about it .
Honestly he is too well put together to be Destefano crafted .
So I do not buy the rubberstamp claims .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Mohammad Jawad , one of the youngest detainees to be held at the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , said on Tuesday after his return home to Afghanistan he had been abused and humiliated during six years in custody .
A teenager when he was held , he was accused of war crimes for throwing a grenade that wounded two U.S. soldiers in 2002 , but was ordered freed in July by a U.S. judge who threw out his confession because it had been obtained through abuse .
He was one of the youngest detainees held at the prison .
His lawyers argue that he was about 12 when he was arrested in 2002 but the Pentagon disputes that and has said bone scans indicated he had turned 18 when he was sent to Guantanamo .
Jawad ’s lawyers say he was kept awake , moved constantly from cell to cell and treated harshly .
He arrived back in the Afghan capital , Kabul , on Monday and was reunited with his family .
Jawad was the latest departure from the controversial Guantanamo prison which President Barack Obama has pledged to close by mid-January 2010 .
“ There was a lot of oppression when I was in Guantanamo and these inhumane actions were not for just one day , one week or one month , ” Jawad told Reuters , sitting on cushions in his family home in the south of the capital .
“ I was oppressed the whole time until I was released .
They tortured prisoners very badly and did not allow prisoners to sleep , did not give enough food , ” he said .
Jawad was accused of throwing the grenade into a military jeep in 2002 .
He was arrested and imprisoned at the U.S. detention center at Bagram Air Base , north of Kabul , before being sent to Guantanamo in early 2003 .
“ They knew I was underage but they did not care about my age , ” Jawad said .
“ They insulted our religion and our holy Koran , they insulted us and behaved in an inhumane way , ” he said .
A weary - looking Jawad stood and stretched his hands behind his back to show how he had been bound sometimes by his captors .
He said he and other prisoners were told to eat with their hands bound behind their backs , bending over and putting their mouths into plates of food .
Jawad said he had been freed because none of the charges against him could be proved .
“ I remember the U.S. government lawyer provided evidence against me but could not prove anything and in the end , the judge said : ‘ no charge against Mohammad Jawad can be proved and he is innocent ’ , ” Jawad said .
( Additional reporting by Yousuf Azimy ; Editing by Paul Tait ) ( For more Reuters coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan , see :
here )
I ’m still trying to decide what I think about this question .
But given how much strategic focus we ’re giving to Afghanistan , I ’m confident we have n’t given the question enough collective thought .
Matt Yglesias had a post a couple months ago asking a basic question : how much does it really matter if al Qaida has safe havens in Afghanistan ?
To be clear , no one ’s saying it does n’t matter at all .
But does it matter enough , relative to other threats , to make Afghanistan — and specifically , the escalation of our involvement in Afghanistan — close to the focus of our whole foreign policy ?
Ethnic
Afghans have played little or no role in any of the major terrorist incidents of the last decade .
And most were planned and organized either in Europe , the US or in other Arab or majority Muslim countries .
The training camps we hear a lot about mainly focused on light combat training and maybe car - jackings .
As Matt puts it , the ‘ safe havens ’ in Afghanistan were neither necessary ( the training could be and often was done elsewhere ) nor sufficient ( you still needed cells in the target countries ) conditions for any of the major terrorist attacks .
So why is this such a critical focus of our policy ?
On the other side of the spectrum , I ’d put the following considerations .
If al Qaida types get plugged in in the thriving opium trade in Afghanistan that ’s clearly a source of money .
And one of the best counter - terrorism strategies seems to be just keeping the members of terrorist organizations under pressure and threat everywhere .
So you would n’t want one country where bin Laden and his pals could live more or less unmolested and in the open — though given what happened and how many drones we have on patrol , it ’s not really credible to me that quite that would ever be allowed again .
Then there ’s the question of Pakistan .
On really every front , money , safe havens , weaponry , even nuclear weapons , Pakistan has everything that Afghanistan has , only ten - fold , though there ’s probably a decent argument that the two countries are umbilical when it comes to counter - terrorism policy .
And let me finish on two further points .
Through much of the last decade , I ’ve been in the group of people saying that Iraq was a distraction and that Afghanistan was the place we really needed to be focusing on .
So this is in conflict with much I ’ve said before .
Furthermore , if you look at the history , the role of Afghanistan going back over the last few decades , was n’t so much that it allowed for safe havens but that the guerilla , semi-irregular wars there spun off thousands of violent , highly - trained and religiously intoxicated extremists who later spread out around the world spreading terror right and left .
And that makes intensifying the conflict in Afghanistan to prevent the growth of safe havens a logically questionable proposition .
Like I said up top , I ’m not sure where I come down on this one .
But given how central a role ‘ safe havens ’ play in current policy and how much focus we ’re giving to this policy , it really requires more scrutiny .
Let me know your thoughts .
I ’m curious what others have to say .

Advertisement A car bombing in the Spanish island of Majorca has killed two Civil Guard officers and led to ports and airports being shut for a time .
Thousands of tourists were affected as some flights were turned back or diverted to other Spanish islands .
Spain said the blockade was meant to " prevent the terrorists from fleeing " .
Police said a second unexploded device was found near the explosion site .
The blast comes a day after a similar attack in northern Spain injured 46 .
The government has blamed both on the Basque separatist group Eta.
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero described the killings as " vile " and paid tribute to the Civil Guards .
He said the killers would be caught .
" They will not be able to escape , they will not be able to evade justice , " he said .
Eta has been held responsible for more than 820 deaths during its decades - long campaign for an independent homeland in Spain 's Basque region .
The bombs come ahead of the 50th anniversary of Eta 's founding , on Friday .
Map of where the bomb struck A spokeswoman for the Civil Guards told the AFP news agency that the two officers killed in Thursday 's attack had been inside a patrol car parked outside the El Foc barracks in Palmanova when the bomb exploded , just before 1400 ( 1200 GMT ) .
ANALYSIS Marian Hens
BBC News , Madrid Eta is trying to present this as a sign of the group 's renewed strength .
After repeated arrests of its leadership and the success of the anti-terrorist campaign launched by the Spanish and the French authorities , the armed Basque separatists had been gradually losing ground .
In recent years , the organisation has also seen its political base eroded and support in the Basque county drop to the lowest level in the group 's history .
Read full article Several other people were also said to have been injured by the blast , which happened in a busy area where there is also a post office and health centre .
Police said a second device was found under a civil guard vehicle at another nearby barracks .
Spain 's Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba blamed Eta for the attack .
" We have always known that they are murderers and savages .
Always , " he told TVE Internacional .
" Today , we also know that they are murderers , savages and crazed .
" And this does not make them stronger , but it undoubtedly makes them more dangerous , " he added .

Advertisement High season
In the hours after the blast , police ordered that no planes , ships or pleasure boats leave the island while they hunted for the bombers .
Dozens of outbound flights were affected .
The car bombing in Burgos caused extensive damage but no deaths Incoming flights were diverted .
British tour operator Thomson Holidays was forced to call two flights back to the UK and said two others were being diverted to other Spanish islands .
The move comes at the height of the tourist season .
Majorca depends heavily on tourism .
Its airport in Palma is Spain 's third busiest .
The airport was later reopened .
The European Union 's Commission expressed its " firmest condemnation of the barbaric attack " and said Spaniards had its " complete solidarity ... in the fight against terrorism " .
Dave Wilkinson , who was having lunch at a restaurant in the area at the time of the blast , told the BBC that he had heard a loud explosion and seen a black plume of smoke rising .
" We ran around the corner to see what had happened and saw a car on fire parked on the left - hand side of the road , " he said .
" Across the road , there was a man lying on the floor and another two people with him doing CPR .
" A police car came and officers said to get back as there may be another bomb and that the area was n't safe .
Two or three helicopters were circling over the area , " he added .
No warning Security sources told the Spanish news agency , Efe , that the bomb had probably been planted underneath the patrol car and had been detonated when the officers got into the vehicle or turned on the engine .
A similar method was used in Eta 's last fatal bombing in June , when a senior police officer was killed by a car bomb in the city of Bilbao , in Basque country .
Thursday 's attack was the deadliest since two Spanish undercover policemen were shot during an operation in south - western France in December 2007 .
The powerful car bomb blast which hit a police barracks in Burgos on Wednesday caused extensive damage but only minor injuries .

It 's hard to know where to begin with this , but Creative has confirmed that Zii EGG handheld we saw pass through the FCC a few weeks ago , and proceeded to slap every odd marketing term the company has come up with over the past few years on it .
The Zii EGG runs the new " Plaszma " platform , which has something to do with " StemCell Computing " and allows developers to simultaneously develop for Plaszma and Android .
Since for now the Zii EGG is aimed at developers and OEMs , it runs fairly vanilla Android on top of Creative 's ZMS - 05 chip .
The hardware itself is rather impressive , with front and rear facing cameras , HD playback , 1080 p video output , OpenGL ES support , X - Fi audio processing , 32 GB of built - in memory and a .
Other more " run of the mill " features include WiFi , GPS , Bluetooth 2.1+EDR , and a 3 - axis accelerometer .
The 320 x 480 screen sounds strictly ordinary , but on top is some 10 - point multitouch capacitive input -- Synaptics ' new ClearPad 3000 if we had to guess .
The big drawback here is the lack of cellular data , but hopefully somebody can solve that before long .
The Zii EGG is a developer platform , after all , but Creative says the platform is " market - ready " for picking up by OEMs for production -- hopefully they are n't far removed from shoehorning a 3G chipset in there somewhere as well .
The Zii Plaszma Starter Kit bundled with the Zii EGG can be had for $ 400 .
A video demo is after the break .
[ Via DAP Review
For the second time in a year , Multnomah County 's sheriff is entangled with the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training , the state agency that issues certifications to law enforcement officers .
A year ago , then - Sheriff Bernie Giusto voluntarily relinquished his police certification before vacating the office to Bob Skipper .
With more than two years remaining on Giusto's term in office , Skipper was required to attend the basic police academy because he had n't worked in the industry since he abruptly left office in 1994 following the passage of Measure 8 .
When the agency denied his request for a waiver , Skipper turned to the Legislature for rescue .
The quick passage of Senate Bill 344 , designed solely and exclusively for Skipper , exempted him from the academy , provided that he attend a two - week refresher course and pass an open - book test .
After attending the short course , Skipper failed his test .
Twice .
Skipper is now scheduled to attend a grueling 16 - week academy in October .
But he may not last that long .
Because he failed to obtain his certification within the year required by state law , Skipper may be forced to vacate the office by Nov. 6 .
So Multnomah County voters may get to vote once again for yet another temporary sheriff to finish the end of Giusto 's term -- all due to the issue of police certification .
Lost in this embarrassing spectacle is the fact that while state law currently requires all Oregon sheriffs to be police officers , there is no similar requirement for certification in corrections -- the primary focus of the Multnomah County sheriff for the past 25 years .
The last six Multnomah County sheriffs have had two things in common .
Each was a certified police officer , but none had ever worked a single shift in the county 's jails .
Yet for fiscal year 2009 , 70 percent of the agency 's $ 115 million budget is dedicated to corrections .
Fortunately , county voters may have the opportunity to correct that longstanding deficiency next year .
Beginning in September , a bipartisan committee of 17 county electors will meet to review the county 's home rule charter for potential changes for referral to county voters .
One proposal the charter review committee will consider would require the county 's sheriff to be certified in corrections in addition to any other state requirement .
If that 's approved by voters , Multnomah County will be the first and only county in Oregon to require its sheriff to be certified in that way .
The Oregonian 's editorial board noted the emerging corrections function of the Multnomah County sheriff with this observation : " The sheriff today is more warden than either policeman or politician .
He runs an overcrowded jail - corrections system and diminishing patrol program .
Yet the county 's charter calls only for a policeman 's credentials for the sheriff .
That does n't make sense . "
That editorial was published on May 23 , 1988 .
More than 20 years later , the county 's charter remains unchanged .
Meanwhile the current 70 - year - old sheriff is quickly running out of time to obtain " a policeman 's credential " when what the job actually requires is certification and experience in corrections .
Voters should change the county charter to make sense .
Bruce McCain of Northeast Portland is an attorney and former Multnomah County sheriff 's captain .
I grew up in a heavily Southern Baptist backwater in North Carolina , but I was raised Episcopalian .
The Episcopal Chuch ( a/k / a the Church of England ) is a less filling faith fashioned so that Henry VIII could get a divorce .
I could never quite wrap my lil ' noodle around the concept of heaven ; I could find Antarctica on a map , but heaven was n’t even on maps of the whole solar system .
Religious practice did n’t particularly intrigue me until I thought I could get something out of it here on earth .
When I was , I think , eight , I took swimming lessons at the local rec center .
Our instructor was a sadistic drunk from the high school athletics department who grabbed me by my hair - free armpits and dunked me in the drink , again and again .
I did n’t want to go to swimming lessons , but I had to .
That is , unless it rained .
One depressing afternoon , I stomped around my mom ’s driveway , dreading the rest of the day .
I called out to God .
Specifically , I addressed the ass - kicking God of vengeance from Testament I ( before he had the kid and pussed out ) .
I prayed , begged , bargained and screamed for rain .
And He brought it .
It poured .
Thunder , lightning , everything .
I explained to my mom what had happened , and she decided I did n’t have to go to swimming lessons if I felt that strongly about it .
I continued hitting up God for favors until September of my 7th Grade year , when cheerleaders started coming to school in uniform on game days .
I realized I ’d maxed out whatever God credit I ’d had .
God would n’t sucker one of these sweet gals into blowing me .
He did n’t even want me to masturbate .
Why would n’t he even smite one of my numerous enemies ?
Apparently , he did n’t give a fuck about his boy anymore .
I drifted out of his orbit .
Years later , I became a decent piano player and took a music - writing class in a Methodist church basement .
I was assigned to write vocal melodies for a few Bible verses .
I was so busy flogging the dolphin that I forgot about this assignment until an hour before deadline .
In a panic , I scrawled out notes as quickly as I could .
My teacher dug it so much that she had the church choir sing my it the next Sunday .
As far as I was concerned , it was too little , too late .
Thanks to Jim Goad , a far less cynical Christian , for kickstarting my memory .

The Politics of Pronouns
News coverage of murders unsettling for some in the transgender community
Eric Williams ericwphoto.com
" Another Cross - Dresser Found Dead "
" Murdered Man Dressed as a Woman "
" Cross - Dresser Murdered in Albuquerque "
These headlines do n't sit well with Janice Devereaux , facilitator of Transgender New Mexico .
The first comes from the Albuquerque Journal .
The second , from KOB Eyewitness News 4 's website .
The third , from KRQE News 13 .
Devereaux was on her way to pick up her mom in early July when her cell phone rang .
It was a reporter .
Within a month of each other , two bodies were found in the middle of streets or alleys in the neighborhood east of Presbyterian Hospital .
In 2005 , the first victim was found in the area .
All three were Native American and had been beaten to death , according to police .
Two are believed to have been sex workers .
Devereaux had n't known about the most recent killings until news hounds from the local daily and all of Albuquerque 's news stations began calling .
Her position with the transgender support group made her an impromptu spokesperson .
She went over appropriate terminology with the reporters .
A cross-dresser , she explained , is " typically a heterosexual male who is married , who dresses in female clothing for some type of sexual gratification . "
Transgender , on the other hand , is a way of life .
Teri Benally , the third victim , had lived for years as a woman , Devereaux says .
But the wrong pronoun — he — dominated the coverage of her death .
" They 're not here to tell us how they would like to be referred to , " she says .
" More than likely , they would have liked to have been referred to as female . "
“ Regardless of what these people were doing when they were killed , they still had the right to live . ”
Janice Devereaux of Transgender New Mexico
Devereaux talked with the Alibi about the killings , the coverage and the often ignored transgender community in Albuquerque .
How do you think the headlines should have read ?
They should have said the word " victim " in there somehow , because regardless of what these people were doing when they were killed , they still had the right to live .
And referring to them as victims , I think , would have been more appropriate .
How did you feel about the TV coverage ?
I was not all that thrilled with Channel 13 's story .
It went along the same lines as the Journal .
I was really happy with [ KOAT ] Channel 7's coverage .
Even when I talked to the reporters , they had gone out of their way to find out how these people were to be referred to .
They went out of their way to make sure they got different things right .
There seemed to be more of a human aspect to the story .
Do you think of " cross- dresser " as being a derogatory term ?
There are people who identify as cross-dressers .
The people that do , it 's more a type of sexual paraphilia .
" Transgender " is the umbrella term for everybody else .
There are some people who are offended by it [ cross - dresser ] .
There are other people who say , Yeah , that 's how I get my rocks off .
Aside from the news of the deaths , what do you think the coverage imparted generally about transgender people ?
I think it may have in a lot of ways reaffirmed people 's beliefs who do n't really know anything about us .
It perpetuates this myth that we 're all a bunch of drug addicts and prostitutes , which I 'm not .
A lot of people that I know are not .
That seems to be a popular preconception .
I think these stories try to reaffirm people 's beliefs .
When was the last time a transgender person was in local media — and identified as such — who was n't connected to a crime ?
Not ever that I know of .
I 've lived here 25 years , and I 've never seen anything like that .
Why do you think this story was told this way ?
For the most part , I think a lot of media , they write these stories just to sell papers or get people to look at broadcasts .
It 's like , Oh , here 's another one of those that was doing this , and look what happened .
How can you counteract that ?
Just like with any other stereotype , it 's important for people to know us and for them to know that we 're just like everybody else .
We work and pay our bills and , for the most part , just want to be normal , productive members of society .
Do you think it is a more dangerous world for transgender people ?
I think it 's less dangerous than it was 15 years ago .
There 's still a lot of work to do .
The more people come out , the more visible we are , the less unique or bizarre for people it will be .
Is it strange to find yourself a spokesperson in this situation ?
A little bit .
It 's not something that I had really expected to happen .
But I was never in the closet about myself , anyway .

دیدار سه نفر از مراجع قم از جمله برای بحث درباره ' مسائل سیاسی روز '
توضیح تصویر، این دیدار در اقامتگاه تابستانی آیت الله منتظری انجام شد
به گزارش پایگاه اینترنتی آیت الله حسینعلی منتظری ، او در روزهای اخیر برای بحث درباره " مسائل فقهی و سیاسی روز " با آیت الله موسوی اردبیلی و آیت الله شبیری زنجانی، دیدار کرده است .
جزئیات این دیدار در دهکده خاوه، در اطراف قم که اقامتگاه تابستانی آیت الله منتظری است، فاش نشده است .
چ ند روز پیش حدود هفتاد چهره سیاسی و دانشگاهی از جمله میرحسین موسوی، مهدی کروبی و محمد خاتمی در نامه ای سرگشاده به مراجع تقلید شیعه، از اعمال " شکنجه های مکرر " علیه بازداشت شدگان حوادث اخیر اظهار نگرانی کرده و از آنها کمک خواستند .
آقای موسوی و برخی دیگر از مخالفان از زمان انتخابات جنجالی 22 خرداد که تظاهرات گسترده و سرکوب آن توسط نیروهای امنیتی را به دنبال داشت، در موارد متعدد از علمای مذهبی شیعه خواسته
اند رفتار حکومت را محکوم کنند .
حسن شریعتمداری، پژوهشگر مسائل دینی در آلمان، در گفتگو با بی بی سی فارس ی گفت با توجه به سفر آیت الله موسوی اردبیلی و آیت الله شبیر ی
زنجانی به اقامتگاه تابستان ی آقای منتظری در خار ج
از قم او حدس می زند که موضوع بحث " عاجل " بوده است چرا که چنین سفرهایی معمولا برای مباحث فقهی انجام نمی شود .
او گفت : " این بحث عاجل باید نسبت به فتاو ی ای و استفتاهای ی باشد که آقای منتظری جواب داده و حکومت را جائر دانسته اند .
با توجه به اینکه آقای شبیر ی
زنجانی رفاقت دیرینه ای هم با رهب ر
انقلاب آقای خامنه ای دارد ، شاید پیام هایی هست که چگونه می توان راه حلی برای برون رفت از این بحران پیدا کرد . "
وی البته تاکید که اینها فقط حدسیات است اما افزود " من مطمئن هستم که خرو ج از این بحران با چند رایزنی ساده به هیچ وجه ممکن نیست . "
آیت الله منتظری و آیت الله موسوی اردبیلی قبلا در بیانیه هایی به رفتار حکومت در برخورد با معترضان اعتراض کرده اند .
آیت الله منتظری اخیرا در پاسخ به سوالات محسن کدیور، روحانی مخالف ایرانی، گفته بود که " [ اگر مسئولانی ] به زور یا فریب و تقلب بر آن منصب بمانند مردم باید عدم مشروعیت و مقبولیت آنها را در نزد خود و برکنار ی آنان
از منصب را با رعایت مراتب امر به معروف و
نهی از منکر ... و انتخاب مفیدترین و کم هزینه ترین راه ممکن ابراز داشته و بخواهند " .
به نوشته آقای کدیور، آیت الله منتظری در بخشی از پاسخ هایش، حکومت جمهوری اسلامی ایران را تلویحا متهم کرده است که " بر اسا س چماق و ظلم و تجاوز به حقوق دیگران و تصرف غاصبانه و تغییر در آراء مردم و کشتن و بستن و بازداشت و شکنجه های قرون وسطایی و استالینی و ایجاد خفقان و سانسور روزنامه ها ... و زندانی کردن عقلا و نخبگان جامعه به بهانه های واهی و تحمیل اعترافات به امور خلاف واقع " عمل می کند .
آیت الله منتظری در دوران رهبری آیت الله خمینی قائم مقام رهبر جمهوری اسلامی بود، اما در سال ۱۳۶۸ و در پی اختلافاتی که با آیت الله خمینی پیدا کرد ،
از این مقام عزل شد .
Pat Buchanan :
" I put democracy far down the line .
I think a devoutly Christian , conservative , traditionalist country — even if it ’s a monarchy — is fine with me .
Sen. Jim DeMint :
On what basis does the [ Obama ] Administration demand [ ousted Honduran President ] Zelaya ’s reinstatement ?
His removal from office was no more a coup than was Gerald Ford ’s ascendence to the Oval Office or our newest colleague Al Franken ’s election to the Senate .
Tucker Carlson :
The Barry story is also a tale of codependence between a politician and his supporters .
I love Washington .
My wife and all four of my children were born in Northwest .
I hope I never leave .
But let 's be honest :
The city 's not ready for democracy , much less statehood .
As Adam Serwer says :
This is a pretty weird understanding of how " democracy " works : a given group of people is " ready for democracy " based on subjective partisan judgment of who those people choose to vote for .
But is n't that the whole point of the conservative pathology ?
We 've seen it in action during the teabagger protests , with cries of " disenfranchisement " , building a bizarre fantasy around the theme of " taxation without representation " .
Ultimately , the wingnut appreciation for democracy extends only as far voters ratify their crazy ideology .
Once rejected , they start looking more and more despotic .
i Phone / iPod touch : Yesterday tech site TechCrunch reported that Apple blocked an official Google Voice app from the App Store ; meanwhile , they also kicked unofficial versions ( like previously mentioned GV Mobile ) out the door .
But you can still get GV Mobile for free .

The catch :
You 've got to be willing to jailbreak your iPhone .
Why ?
Because Apple is demonstrating that they 're perfectly happy locking out any application or tool that will improve your iPhone experience in ways that do n't gel with their corporate synergy .
( Yeah , we said corporate synergy — nice work , Apple . )

The developer of the recently kicked - out - of - the - App - Store GV Mobile has decided to go ahead and release GV Mobile for free rather than let his work go to waste ( it should show up in Cydia sometime today or tomorrow ) .
It 's a small consolation that you can now get this unofficial app via Cydia on a jailbroken iPhone — especially since we 'd really kill to see what the official Google Voice app from Apple would have looked like — but it 's better than nothing .
Guess that 's one more reason for us to keep on jailbreaking our iPhones .

Are you looking for a career that enables you to help others , make a real difference , and have a rewarding experience every day on the job ?
If so , then nursing might be the perfect option for you when it comes to what you do for work .
And with an increasing number of online programs now available for those looking to become a nurse , getting qualified has never been easier .
You can study to become a nurse online from the comfort of your own home and at times that suit you best , making it the perfect option whether you are looking for a career change or have family commitments to uphold .
Here are some of the top reasons you should consider studying for your nursing degree online .
Save Money :
Going to college is not cheap , and after graduation , it can often feel like you are drowning in not only student loan debt but other debts that you had to accumulate in order to pay for living costs on - campus , textbooks , other study resources , and more .
While studying to become a nurse online is certainly not free of charge , it can often work out much cheaper compared to studying on - campus .
There ’s ’ no need to worry about the cost of relocating to be closer to or live on the campus while you study , and if you would have commuted to classes , you ’re going to save a whole lot of cash on gas or public transport tickets .
In addition , tuition fees can sometimes be lower simply because online degrees cost the school less , but this is n’t always the case .
Less Stress :
Studying to become a nurse online can often be less stressful for you as a student because you have more control .
There ’s no need to rearrange your week to fit in lectures and seminars at set times because you get to choose when you would like to go through the course materials .
Of course , there are sometimes going to be some set classes that you will need to attend , but for the most part , lectures will be written or recorded , allowing you to pick the most suitable time of day to study compared to having this dictated to you by a class schedule .
If you want to juggle studying to become a nurse with a full - time job , raising a family , or even both , this is definitely the best way to do it with the least amount of stress .
Study at a Great College :
Studying on - campus can often be limiting if you do not have the freedom to up and leave to go and study at the college of your choice .
If you need to stay in your home location due to family or work , for example , you might only have a few options to choose from when it comes to nearby nursing schools that are easy for you to get to .
On the other hand , there are significantly more options available to you when you decide to get your nursing qualification online .
You can find online nursing programs from a wide range of different reputable colleges – many of which might have been impossible for you to get to in person , but the online study gives you the option to get a degree from a better college without setting foot on the campus .
Graduate Faster – or Slower :
Online study is often far more flexible than on - campus study , giving you the option to finish your degree early if you want to put that extra work in , or even take more time and graduate a little later than normal if you are finding it difficult to juggle everything that you have got to do .
You can sign up for an accelerated program that will allow you to graduate a year or so earlier than you would expect to on a standard program , or find a program that allows you a certain number of years to finish in , and take it at your own pace – the choice is yours .
Earn Respect :
Online degree programs used to cause quite a lot of skepticism .
People believed that studying online meant that there was no way you could get the same quality of education compared to studying on campus , and those with online degrees were often seen as taking the easy way out .
But it ’s 2020 , and we now know that that really is n’t the case .
In fact , millions of students around the world are signed up for online courses and employers everywhere are starting to see the benefits .
As a nurse who got her degree online , that alone could earn you extra respect from employers since it proves that you have a great amount of motivation , self - discipline , and determination to get things done , even when you ’re fully responsible for doing it at home .
It can certainly act as a testament to your strong character that will help you go far as a nurse .
The Social Side :
Do n’t think that online learning is all isolation .
In fact , online students are often more social than on - campus students because they have to work harder to meet new people !
When you sign up for an online degree , you ’ll also get access to forums and chat rooms , social media groups , Whatsapp groups , and even local student meet - up groups that you will be able to take advantage of .
If the picture that you conjure up when you think of online learning is sitting at a desk on your own all day , that could n’t be further than the truth – unless , of course , that ’s what you prefer .
There will be ample opportunities for you to socialize and network with some very interesting and influential people .
Improve Soft Skills :
Last but not least , getting your nursing degree online can help you improve a wide variety of soft skills that will positively impact your ability to be a good nurse .
Online study teaches you a lot of things that might not be so predominant on - campus , like motivating yourself , self - discipline , self - study , and research skills .
If you want to become a nurse , studying online has many great benefits .
Getting your nursing degree online puts you in control and opens up a world of opportunities .
In 1969 , an Apollo - crazy high school student wrote one of the most influential computer games of all time .
Lunar Lander games abound on every platform .
Along with Tetris and Pac - Man , the game–in which your mission is to safely maneuver your lunar module onto the moon ’s surface –is one of the most widely cloned computer games of all time .
But did you know that game players began touching down on the moon in Lunar Lander just months after Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did so on July 20th , 1969 ?
Today ’s versions of Lunar Lander are easily taken for granted ; they ’re generally regarded as dinky games you can get for free –
“ Who would pay for that ? ”
But the mother of all realistic space simulations was n’t always perceived that way .
In 1969 , it was , in its own way , a sophisticated , ambitious piece of digital entertainment .
And during the BASIC era of the 1970s and 80s , many programmers cut their teeth by attempting to program their own version of Lunar Lander .
David
Ahl , founder of Creative Computing magazine , called it “ by far and away the single most popular computer game ” in 1978 ( and he was only talking about the text version ! ) .
Indeed , Lunar Lander was one of the early computer games that helped define computer games .
The Eagle Lands
YOU ARE LANDING ON THE MOON AND HAVE TAKEN OVER MANUAL
CONTROL 500 FEET ABOVE A GOOD LANDING SPOT .
YOU HAVE A
DOWNWARD VELOCITY OF 50 FT / SEC .
120 UNITS OF FUEL REMAIN .
Among the millions who watched the Apollo 11 landing was a 17 year old Massachusetts high school student named Jim Storer .
In the fall of 1969 , around the time of the Apollo 12 launch , Storer took his inspiration to class with him .
There , he programmed a simple text - based simulation of humanity ’s greatest technological achievement on his school ’s Digital Equipment Corp. PDP - 8 minicomputer system .
“ Lexington High School had a PDP - 8 , ” Storer recalls .
“ It had 8 Teletypes , a small hard drive , and 12 KB of main memory , where 8KB was used by the system and 4KB time shared by the users . ”
Storer wrote his new program , “ Lunar Landing Game , ” in FOCAL , a programming language for the PDP - 8 that was similar in some ways to BASIC ( both were introductory languages known for their ease of use ) .
His simulation was simple , yet powerful : underneath lay a realistic set of equations Storer believes his father may have taught him .
Lunar Landing
Game ’s gameplay consisted of a turn - based question and answer session , asking the user for the rocket fuel burn rate at each turn , which the user would then enter as a number from 0 to 200 .
The constraints against you were simple :
HERE ARE THE RULES THAT GOVERN YOUR SPACE VEHICLE :
(1) AFTER EACH SECOND , THE HEIGHT , VELOCITY , AND REMAINING FUEL WILL BE REPORTED .
( 2 ) AFTER THE REPORT , A ‘?’
WILL BE TYPED .
ENTER THE
NUMBER OF UNITS OF FUEL YOU WISH TO BURN DURING THE
NEXT SECOND .
EACH UNIT OF FUEL WILL SLOW YOUR DESCENT
BY 1 FT / SEC .
( 3 ) THE MAXIMUM THRUST OF YOUR ENGINE IS 30 FT / SEC / SEC OR
30 UNITS OF FUEL PER SECOND .
( 4 ) WHEN YOU CONTACT THE LUNAR SURFACE , YOUR DESCENT ENGINE
WILL AUTOMATICALLY CUT OFF AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN A
REPORT OF YOUR LANDING SPEED AND REMAINING FUEL .
( 5 ) IF YOU RUN OUT OF FUEL , THE ‘?’
WILL NO LONGER APPEAR ,
BUT YOUR SECOND BY SECOND REPORT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL
YOU CONTACT THE LUNAR SURFACE .
Along the way , Jim Storer created one of the earliest computer games–one of a handful of text - based PDP - 8 games of the 1960s , and one of the first computer simulation games ever .
In less than 50 lines of code , Storer captured the imaginations of an entire generation of programmers with a gripping space drama composed of nothing more than simple text statements .
Storer submitted his game to PDP - 8 maker DEC , which was always looking for innovative and interesting uses of its computers .
The programs were usually distributed for free or used as demonstrations to potential clients , serving as a powerful marketing tool .
At DEC , an employee named David H. Ahl translated Storer ’s Lunar Lander into the BASIC language , which soon overtook FOCAL as the most popular introduction to programming .
From there , both the FOCAL and BASIC versions of Storer ’s simulation spread to other PDP - 8 users through DEC ’s EDU newsletter and through distribution by DEC ’s Education Product Group .
After that , Storer forgot about the game .
Life went on .
He never sold it , and never followed the progress or influence of its imitators as they echoed down through the years .
“ After leaving high school I never thought about the game again , ” says Storer .
“ Until about a couple of months ago when someone e-mailed me about this , I was completely unaware of any Lunar Lander game other than the one I wrote in high school . ”
But Storer ’s computer experiences in high school shaped the rest of his career : “ I became interested in computer science as a result of taking that computer class and doing programming on the PDP - 8 . ”
Storer later studied computer science as an undergraduate at Cornell University and then received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Princeton University .
He is now a professor of computer science at Brandeis University .
In 1973 , DEC published a book edited by Ahl called “ 101 BASIC Computer Games ” that included both Storer ’s version of Lunar Lander and two others that had been inspired by Storer ’s program .
In 1978 , Ahl revamped the book with a focus on home microcomputers that were common at the time , and it sold over a million copies .
Thanks to Ahl ’s book , Lunar Lander ’s status as one of the classics of early computer gaming was assured .
Lunar Lander Gets Graphical
DEC consultant Jack Burness had long been a fan of America ’s race to the moon .
He recalls with great clarity the excitement of the period : “ The space program was an incredibly big project then .
More than a project , it was a national embracing of the future . ”
Inspired by a co-worker who attended the launch of Apollo 16 , Burness pestered his local senator for passes to see the launch of the final Apollo mission , Apollo 17 , in December 1972 .
“ A bunch of my friends went with me to see it , ” recalls Burness .
“ It was the last launch and was at night–an overwhelming powerfully experience . ”
That experience simmered in the back of his mind for the next few months , and it proved influential when DEC needed a software demo for its new GT40 terminal .
The DEC GT40 was a graphical computer terminal–unusual for its time , since it used a vector CRT display .
One electron gun directly drew geometric shapes on the screen , providing a potent way to generate sharp , high - resolution computer graphics with the limited computing power available at the time .
Conventional bitmapped raster displays ( like those on conventional TV video games ) draw the screen progressively from top to bottom , one row at a time , and required vastly more memory to compose a detailed on - screen image .
“ I actually had quit Digital the previous spring and moved to Cambridge to consult for Draper Labs , ” says Burness .
“ For some now long - forgotten reason I was back consulting to DEC that winter . ”
Burness won the contract from DEC and began developing a lunar landing simulation for the terminal in early 1973 .
He programmed the game in PDP - 11 assembly language , as the GT40 contained within it a PDP - 11 CPU , essentially making it a standalone computer system .
“ But the graphics processor had its own instruction set , ” adds Burness , “ and I programmed that in assembly as well . ”
To make a realistic simulation , Burness went straight to MIT , which had co-designed the real NASA lunar module .
“ It only took a few hours of perusing around to dig up enough information ( weight , fuel burn rate , etc. ) to write the program , ” he says .
As for inspiration , Burness does n’t recall seeing Storer ’s exact version of the “ Lunar Landing Game , ” but by 1973 , clones of the Storer ’s text - based simulation were already commonplace .
Still , Burness ’ version had one very important difference from those that had come before it : it had graphics .
His game , which he called “ Moonlander , ” took advantage of the GT40 ’s vector display to draw a moonscape as seen from the side .
Gameplay was simple , but challenging :
The player wielded the GT40 ’s integrated light pen and carefully guided the lunar module ’s descent by touching areas of the screen that controlled thrust .
The player attempted to land via thrusting the lunar module ’s rockets in real time while avoiding too fast an entry , or too steep an angle .
With Burness ’ innovations , the modern action - based Lunar Lander we all know today was born .
“ Start of the project to completion was ten days .
That ’s it , ” says Burness .
“ When you only have a small amount of computer memory , choices become simpler . ”
Moonlander proved an immediate hit with DEC and other users of the GT40 .
From there , it spread wherever GT40s were in use , and influenced a sizable audience as one of the first graphical computer games .
Years later , a co-worker told Burness that the reason he got into programming was because he had played Moonlander as a teenager .
“ I think it ’s kind of neat the way you do something and it can have a rippling effect , ” he says .
Burness never made any money on Moonlander , but his experience with the GT40 solidified his interest in computer graphics .
He spent the next 26 years of his career bouncing between various computer graphics companies , and still consults for technology startups today .
Landing at the Arcade
Before the decade was out , one of Burness ’ biggest fans brought Lunar Lander out of the halls of mainframe academia and into the commercial realm , further widening its audience : Atari .
By 1979 , video game pioneer Atari had been working on bringing vector technology to its arcade games for two years .
They were inspired by Cinematronics ’ 1977 Space Wars arcade game to develop vector hardware of their own .
Rick Moncrief led the project .
“ Before there was a game , we had to make a vector graphic system , ” recalls Howard Delman , an Atari engineer who co-created many Atari arcade games in the 1970s .
“ Rick and I worked on that .
When we were done , we said ‘ What should we do with it ? ’
I said , ‘ How about we make Lunar Lander ? ’
With the help of Rich Moore on software , the two created Atari ’s first commercial arcade game with vector graphics titled , unsurprisingly , “ Lunar Lander . ”
As for Delman ’s inspiration , he says he saw a graphical Lunar Lander game–likely Burness ’ Moonlander–long before development on Lunar Lander began : “ I recall going over to [ NASA ’s ]
Ames research center–some Atari folks and I had a tour there–and they showed us a Lunar Lander game running on some machine . ”
But he does n’t recall the specifics of the occasion .
Atari ’s Lunar Lander was very similar to Burness ’ version , except that players controlled the lander with a thruster lever and two rotate buttons .
Of course , to make a good arcade video game , Delman had to forgo the hardcore simulation aspect of the computer version and make it fun and simple for anyone to walk up and play .
“ Not everyone is trained to land a spacecraft on the moon , ” he says .
The game included four play modes of varying difficulty —
“ One is a realistic mode like a real spaceship , and nobody could land that , ” says Delman , chuckling .
“ But the mode it defaults to is very simple .
There ’s friction on your ship , and the ship only rotates when you touch the controls .
We did all these things to make it easier to play . ”
Then there was a special button that Delman calls the “ save your ass ” button : “ If you ’re out of control , you could hit that and it would straighten out the lander , give you full thrust and try to stop you .
It cost you a lot of fuel , but if all hope was lost , you could hit it . ”
Atari released Lunar Lander in August , 1979 –just after the tenth Anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing .
Strangely , it appears that Atari did n’t capitalize on the anniversary while marketing their new machine .
It ’s forgivable , because Atari ’s attention was quickly diverted when another vector game ’s sales started taking off like a rocket ship .
Atari ’s Asteroids , also released in 1979 , used the same vector hardware as Lunar Lander .
Asteroids became so successful that Atari soon stopped production of Lunar Lander to start building Asteroids machines .
“ The first 300 Asteroids games went out with Lunar Lander artwork on the side , ” recalls Delman .
Still , Atari sold about 4700 Lunar Lander machines , which Delman says was a “ good run ” at the time .
It ’s likely that Atari would have sold more Lunar Lander units if Asteroids had n’t stolen the spotlight .
Overall , it was this version of Lunar Lander by Atari that received the widest audience , and soon hobby programmers of the early software revolution began coding their own versions of the game for home computers of the time : the TRS - 80 , Apple II , Commodore PET , Atari 800 , and other .
The trend continues on nearly every computer platform released .
To this day , neither Storer or Burness have played Atari ’s arcade version of their game , and neither one received any financial compensation from Atari for borrowing their idea .
Burness does n’t seem too upset with the prospect .
He seems satisfied in knowing he got there first : “ A co-worker told me that my Lunar Lander was actually used as an example of prior art to stop Atari from having a patent on an entire class of computer games . ”
After that , Lunar Lander was free to be cloned and re-cloned a million ways , ensuring that its legacy will live on for generations beyond those who created it .
Notable Versions of Lunar Lander Through the Years
The following list is n’t comprehensive–we would be here for weeks if I tried to account forevery version of Lunar Lander ever made .
Instead , we ’ll focus on some notable versions released through the years .
You can even play some of them online .
So Godspeed , virtual astronauts .
May the moon ’s grip be gentle on your ships .

There are all kinds of fees and penalties that you could potentially pay , and it ’s your responsibility to understand and avoid them .
Most fees are avoidable .
Unfortunately , many people allow themselves to be robbed of their hard - earned money .
Most people do n’t realize that fees add up quickly and could cause significant damage to your finances in the long run .
Common fees and how to avoid them
Late fee
This is the most common of all fees .
Most people pay late fees because they either forget or could n’t afford to make the payment .
If you ’re the forgetful type , pay your bills as soon as you get them , or schedule automatic online bill payments .
It ’s also a good idea to write down due dates directly into your organizer or calendar so you ’re constantly reminded .
If you ’re paying late fees because you ca n’t afford to pay on time , you have a more serious issue .
In this case , you need to better understand your finances , which you can do by starting a budget .
Next work on cutting down your expenses and spend less .
Properly done , this will give you the extra cushion you need to pay your bills on time
Overdraft fee
The overdraft fee is more costly than other types of fees because you ’ll end up paying other fees in the process — i.e. , late fee , and finance charges in the case of a late credit card payment ( assuming you usually pay off in full each month ) .
If the root cause is the same as above , you fix it in the same manner
But if you ’re bouncing checks because of poor management ( e.g. , not transferring enough money into your checking account , or not transferring on time ) then there are easy solutions .
You can keep money in a high yield checking account ( to avoid back and forth transfers ) , or enroll in an overdraft protection plan ( usually for a small fee ) .
Finance charge
Last but not least is credit card finance charges .
If you ’re only paying the minimum on a $ 10,000 balance at 20 % interest rate , it will take you more than 9 years and $ 11,680 in interest charge to pay off the original amount borrowed .
Yes , your $ 100 iPod actually costs you $ 216.80 .
The finance charge is easily avoidable if you pay off your credit cards in full each month .
If you ca n’t afford to pay off your credit card bills , do n’t charge it !
Of course , there are plenty of other fees we can talk about .
But you I am sure you got the idea .
Fees are your enemies .
Do what you can to avoid them .
Mr Prusik - Parkin is allegedly shown here ( left ) impersonating his mother
A New York man has been arrested for impersonating his dead mother in order to claim $ 115,000 ( £ 70,500 ) in social security benefits and rent subsidies .
Thomas Prusik - Parkin , 49 , is accused by prosecutors of regularly dressing up in a wig , dress and make - up in order to fool the authorities .
The alleged scam has been going on ever since Mr Prusik - Parkin 's mother , Irene Prusik , died in 2003 at the age of 73 .
He faces charges of theft , forgery and conspiracy .
" I held my mother when she was dying and breathed in her last breath , so I am my mother , " Mr Prusik - Parkin said when he was arrested , according to police .
False information
Using a walking stick , heavy make - up and fake ID , and accompanied by a man posing as Mrs Prusik 's nephew , Mr Prusik - Parkin would , according to prosecutors , collect benefit cheques , visit banks and even appear in court .
When Mrs Prusik died , Mr Prusik - Parkin is accused of giving her funeral director a false social security number and date of birth so that her death would not show up in government records .
He is then alleged to have started claiming $ 700 a month in social security benefits in her name on top of his own disability benefits .
Mr Prusik - Parkin has also been accused of filing for bankruptcy in his mother 's name , and then collecting $ 39,000 in rent subsidies from the city government .
Another man , Mhilton Rimolo , 47 , is accused of pretending to be Mrs Prusik 's nephew , and was accompanying Mr Prusik - Parkin on 29 April when - posing as Mrs Prusik - he renewed a driving licence in her name .
Brooklyn police are reported to have been alerted to the alleged scam by a tip - off .
This delicious cheeseburger originates from Sweden .
It is strange simply because of the pieces used to make the cheeseburger .
I would be worried about the quality of the bread , cheese , and meat after getting this shipped across seas .
For the price of $ 6 you can get a cheeseburger in a can , or you can head over to McDonalds and get 6 of them for the same price .
NOTE : one reader explains " those canned cheesburgers are not from Sweden , but from Switzerland .
They 're made from katadyngroup , a Swiss company . "
Clients of Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( yes , that mouthful is the brokerage 's official name now ) can't say the firm is waffling on its economic outlook .
" The recession is over " Merrill declared in a report Tuesday authored by Michael Hartnett , chief global equity strategist .
The brokerage ’s famed horned mascot is snorting again : " We are bullish on global equities , " Hartnett says in the report .
That might not sound like a surprising call for a major Wall Street player with securities to sell , but Merrill ’s outlook on things in recent years had been extraordinarily dour ( as it turned out , correctly so ) under two of its long - time strategists : Richard Bernstein and David Rosenberg .
Bernstein , who was chief investment strategist , left in April ; Rosenberg , the firm ’s chief North American economist , quit in May .
Hartnett had been Merrill ’s point man on emerging markets before becoming chief global equity strategist this spring .
His report on Tuesday says the economy has begun a " fragile recovery , " but he sees the glass as half - full rather than half - empty : " This means fiscal , monetary and financial policies are likely to remain supportive of asset prices .
For example , we forecast the Fed to keep the target [ short - term ] interest rate close to zero until 2011 . "
Investors sitting with loads of cash on the sidelines should be moving that money into stocks , Hartnett advises .
" An inflection point in the global economy should encourage investors to rebalance their portfolios to reduce cash and to look for opportunities to increase equity exposure while staying with high - quality bonds , " he wrote .
His favorite investment themes include " growth " stocks in emerging markets and " value " stocks in developed markets ; the largest U.S. export - oriented companies ; " high - quality " technology firms ; and investment - grade corporate bonds .

Hillberg Insurgency Weapons
The Winchester Liberator
The Colt Defender
The Winchester Liberator and Colt Defender were two remarkable shotgun designs that sprang from the fertile imagination of gun designer Robert Hillberg .
They were originally conceived as guerrilla and counter - guerrilla weapons for clandestine warfare , and as such , they were shrouded in secrecy .
To appreciate the Hillberg weapons , it is first necessary to consider modern guerrilla warfare .
Almost all guerrilla warfare is fought by indigenous peoples .
Frequently , these people are unfamiliar with modern tactics and are wholly unfamiliar with weapons .
As a result , the ideal guerrilla weapon must be simple and reliable .
More importantly , it must posses a high probability of first round hit and a high probability of a first round kill , even in the hands of a relatively unskilled marksman .
The shotgun answers these requirements perhaps better than any other weapon , and the designs proposed by Hillberg brought the shotgun to a new level of refinement for this niche .
Hillberg 's first gun was designed around several requirements .
Aside from the requirements for hit probability and lethality , it must posses adequate firepower without being too complex .
It should also be light and inexpensive to allow it to be delivered en masse via parachute .
By early 1962 Hillberg had evolved his concept to a first design .
This was a multi- barreled repeating shotgun that was basically an updated pepperbox design .
This design gave the firepower of a semi-automatic without the complexity .
In the initial iteration , Hillberg envisioned a weapon having four barrel in a diamond configuration , constructed from a simple single casting .
His initial design called for an ammunition ' packet ' holding four rounds that would be inserted into the gun as a unit , fired , and then ejected by finger pressure .
Early tests proved the worthiness of the design .
The concept weapon fired 1.5 cm ( 20 ga equivalent ) loads and had 4 16.1 inch barrels .
The entire weapon was only 8 inches tall , which made for a relatively concealable package that was also maneuverable in tight spaces .
It weighed a mere 4 pounds and it's inherent ruggedness made it quite suitable for being air dropped .
When Hillberg had completed his initial design and final drawings , he approached Winchester with the proposal of manufacturing the gun .
Winchester agreed that the weapon had considerable merit but requested time to study the proposal .
After an engineering analysis , Winchester determined that with a few minor modifications , the weapon could be manufactured for about $ 20 using the latest casting techniques .
Armed with it 's own studies , Winchester approached the defense department , and received encouragement fro DARPA , who saw that such a weapon could have vast potential , particularly in Southeast Asia , where the United States was become embroiled .
Based on DARPA 's encouragement , Winchester decided to go forward , with the new gun being developed under the ' Liberator Project ' title , in homage to the gun 's intended role , a role filled during the second world war by the Guide Lamp Division of general motors and their ' Liberator ' pistol .
During development of the first Liberator guns , it was determined that the ammunition packet possessed certain disadvantages , most notably in size and the difficulty of aligning the packet with the bores .
It was also heavy .
The ammunition pack that was a salient feature in the Mark I Liberator , was discarded in the later Mark II version in favor of loading individual rounds into each barrel .
This had the advantage of eliminating the alignment problem and also led to a two piece , hinge open design that was to prove even simpler to manufacture than the original one piece Mark I .
The basic features of the Liberator Mark II were outlines in a patent granted in 1964 ( no. 3,260,009 reproduced here .
The weapon features a pivoting breech secured by a stirrup .
The was a relatively strong locking mechanism that had been used with much success on pistols of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
The barrels were moved from a diamond patter to a square on to facilitate the tipping breech .
The weapon also features a relatively simple hammer and trigger .
The hammer is a simple cylinder with helical cuts and having a fixed striker .
Squeezing the full length trigger lever pulled back the striker and caused it to rotate 45 degrees .
When the striker was fully retracted , the trigger allowed the striker to fall forward , rotating another 45 degrees and firing one barrel .
Pulling the trigger subsequent times rotated the striker 90 degrees and fired the next barrel .
This was an eminently simple and robust design that gave the liberator quite respectable firepower .
In order to maximize range and lethality , the caliber of the weapon was increased to 16 gauge to take advantage of Winchester 's Mark 5 shot collar , which had been developed for the Army 's new buckshot ammunition .
Using standard 16 gauge buckshot ammunition , the liberator could easily make multiple torso hits at 30 yards .
On average , five hits were obtained at that range , and never less than three .
In order to reduce weight , the Liberator Mark II was cast from two pieces of magnesium , with steel reinforcements cast in place .
The whole assembly was coated with an epoxy paint and a removable shoulder stock was provided .
The complete Mark II had four full choke 16 gauge barrels 13.5 inches long .
The weapon measured 18 inches in length and weighed 7.6 pounds with the shoulder stock .
The completed Liberator Mark II was presented to Winchester in the middle of 1963 .
It was demonstrated for various military and police agencies who were impressed with it 's simplicity and firepower .
This was in addition to it 's original mission as a ' guerrilla gun ' .
Both Hillberg and Winchester began to see a wider application for their unique shotgun .
As the role of the Liberator was redefined , one featured proved troublesome .
While the new shoulder stock allowed for a more stable platform , accurate shooting , particularly with slugs , was made difficult due to the long whole - hand trigger bar .
What had been an asset for an insurgency weapon that might be used by someone of poor hand strength precluded the firing of accurate shots .
The gun moved to much .
On an earlier design , Hillberg had used a Smith and Wesson handgun frame as a test fixture .
Recalling the reduced trigger pull , Hillberg returned to that design .
Instead of a heavy revolving striker , the next generation of Liberator , the Mark III , would used a revolver like mechanism with a revolving striker on the hammer which would advance to fire each subsequent barrel .
At the same time , Winchester , now completely in charge of the project , elected to make changes in the barrel cluster .
There was some difficulty in casting the 4 barrel assembly with the inserts properly located .
To simplify manufacture , Winchester instead elected to replace the complicated casting with a simple cluster of four steel barrels held together at the breech .
A simple metal plate was welded to the muzzles to alignment and security , and this plate also formed the front sight of the weapon .
The Liberator Mark III was only 1/2 an inch longer than the Mark II and weighed 7 pounds .
In order to widen the appeal , the Liberator Mark III was changed to fire the standard 12 gauge round .
The revolver - like trigger was robust and reliable .
It could be fired in single action after hand cocking if precise accuracy was required , or it could be fired double action for maximum firepower .
Loaded with standard 00 buckshot loads , the Liberator could deliver thirty - six .33 caliber with lethal velocity out to about 60 meters in a couple of seconds .
This is a greater volume of fire than the typical sub machine gun .
Unfortunately , the military orders that Winchester had hoped for were never forthcoming , and the Liberator failed to catch on with the police market .
The Colt Defender was the logical successor to Hillberg 's earlier Liberator .
With the war in Southeast Asia winding down , Hillberg sought to design a weapon that would have appeal to other purchasers - primarily law enforcement agencies .
Hillberg believed his initial concept was sound , but sought to increase its versatility .
The final design was completed in 1967 .
In designing the new gun , Hillberg reverted to the 20 gauge 3 inch magnum .
He felt that this gave a more compact and easily controlled weapon with nearly identical hit potential and lethality to the 12 gauge .
The new weapon was nothing if not visually impressive .
Eight 12 inch barrels were joined together around a central axis .
The gun possessed the familiar pistol grip revolver action mechanism with a second forward pistol grip for instinctive shooting .
Overall length was 17.75 inches with a weight of 8.6 pounds .
The weapon was composed of an aluminum alloy receiver with steel inserts and was covered in an epoxy paint finish .
The final version of the weapon was available in four configurations :
One version contained a receptacle for a canister of tear gas between the barrels .
Pressing the trigger on the foregrip allowed the shooter to spray the target with teargas , giving him a non-lethal option .
Another version incorporated a barrel selector on the rotating striker on the hammer .
This allowed the shooter to select any one of the eight barrel .
This meant that the weapon could be loaded with a variety of ammunition and the shooter could select which round was most appropriate for the situation in question .
A third variant include both features , and the fourth had neither .
Like the Liberator before it , the Defender possessed semi-automatic like fire without the complexity of the semi-automatic gun .
It was extremely simple to operate and very robust .
Hillberg believe that the double action trigger mechanism was ideal for law enforcement applications , as it minimized familiarity and training requirements ..
Hillberg thoroughly tested the Defender before seeking out a manufacturer .
The design proved to be so correct , that only a couple of minor changes were made for manufacturing .
When Colt Industries was contacted , they showed considerable interest in producing the Defender .
However , before committing to production , they insisted on a market survey to see if there was an adequate market for the gun before committing to full production .
Colt demonstrated the weapon to a number of departments , and all who saw it were impressed with its compactness , volume of fire and reliability .
Additionally , many cited its appearance as having a decidedly deterrent effect .
Unfortunately , the Defender was introduced at a time of national recession .
Police departments found themselves scrambling to maintain what funds they already had .
Despite interest showed in the Defender , Colt determined that there would not be adequate demand for the new weapon to justify full production and the product was shelved .
By 1971 the Defender , like the Liberator before it , was dead .
The Liberator and Defender shotguns designed by Robert Hillberg were perhaps some of the most innovative combat shotguns ever devised .
Their compactness , reliability , firepower and simplicity have yet to be equaled by any other weapon .
They certainly deserved a better fate than they received .

Under the new self - government agreement , Greenland will get half of any proceeds from oil or minerals .
The other half will go to Denmark , to be deducted from the grant of 3.4 billion kroner , or $ 637 million , that it gives Greenland each year .
The hope is that eventually the subsidy can cease altogether and Greenland will be ready for independence .
The prospect of Greenland ’s benefiting from what may be a lucrative oil and mineral business raises an obvious question :
What ’s in it for Denmark ?
“ It ’s not a question about money , ” the Danish prime minister , Lars Lokke Rasmussen , said in an interview here .
“ This is a question of respecting Greenlandic people and giving them the right to decide their own destiny . ”
The right to self - determination , particularly for indigenous people like Greenland ’s Inuit , more commonly known as Eskimos , was a recurring theme this weekend .
Two exotically dressed visitors from Norway ’s Sami Parliament , which represents the country ’s reindeer herders , appeared at a trade exposition here on Saturday , marveling at how far the Greenlanders had come .
“ They ’re many steps farther along than we are , ” said Marianne Balto , Parliament ’s vice president .
“ It gives hope to the Sami people . ”
Iceland ’s president , Olafur Ragnar Grimsson , was there , looking at it from the other side , recalling how his country ended hundreds of years of Danish rule with independence in 1944 .
Bent Liisberg , a lawyer from Norway , which was owned for hundreds of years by Denmark and then by Sweden , had much the same perspective .
On Sunday , he was carrying a backpack from which protruded a little Greenlandic flag , its red-and - white design representing the sea , sky and sun .
“ This is a great day for small nations , ” he said .

Senators John Kerry ( D - MA ) and Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) were on ABC’s This Week today where Kerry unloaded on former vice president Dick Cheney after Cheney blasted the decision to investigate CIA interrogation abuses .
Kerry said , “ Dick Cheney has shown through the years , frankly , a disrespect for the Constitution , for sharing of information with Congress … ”
On Fox News Sunday today , Cheney said , “ I think it ’s a terrible decision .
It ’s clearly a political move .
There ’s no other rationale for why they ’re doing this . ”
He also invoked 9/11 and claimed to be defending the CIA , “ I think it ’s a direct slap at the CIA .
I do n’t think it will work .
I think that if they were faced with the kind of situation we were faced with in the aftermath of 9/11 , suddenly capturing people that may have knowledge about imminent attacks , and they ’re going to have to have meetings and decide who gets to ask what question and who ’s going to Mirandize the witness —
I just — I think it ’s — it ’s silly . ”

Kerry replied , “ Well , Dick Cheney has shown through the years , frankly , a disrespect for the Constitution , for sharing of information with Congress , respect for the law , and I ’m not surprised that he is upset about this . ”
He continued , “ The Obama administration has no intention — I think the president himself has been unbelievably bending in the direction of trying to be careful about what happens to national security , protecting our national security interests , being very sensitive about the CIA ’s prerogatives and needs and so forth . ”
I wish somebody would come out and give the real reason for Dick Cheney ’s vigorous defense of torture .
He is trying to save his own skin .
Cheney ’s explanation sets up the false premise that the CIA was acting alone .
This is not true .
Cheney was running operations from the vice president ’s office .
Cheney constantly used his office to pressure the intelligence community .
If the CIA crossed the line , it was because someone ordered them to , and it is a pretty safe bet that Dick Cheney was involved .
Cheney is n’t trying to keep America safe , defend his legacy , or the CIA .
He is trying to save his own skin .
There is nothing political about wanting to correct some of the most shameful abuses of power in recent American history .
The true shame is that people like Cheney carried out these abuses in the name of the American people .

Tegucigalpa , Honduras -- July 5 , 2009 -- MiMundo.org --
On the day when ousted President Manuel Zelaya was slated to return , thousands of supporters gathered at the Pedagogica University in order to march towards Toncontin Airport .
Meanwhile , at the airport , some gathered early to await Mel ’s arrival despite the suffocating presence of Honduran security forces .
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people marched towards Toncontin Airport to welcome “ Mel ” .
Even though the security forces set up several checkpoints to stop the march , the police and army decided to allow the march ’s arrival to Toncontin .
Until then , both sides had behaved remarkably respectful and peaceful .
The protesters even applauded the police ’s decision to let them through .
Nevertheless , a few minutes later , on the far end of the landing strip , tensions brewed out of control .
When protesters began entering through the barbed - wire fence , the army responded by shooting tear gas and live rounds .
One person was killed on the scene , dozens were injured and overnight , at least three other people died in local hospitals .
“ The armed forces have fired live rounds against unarmed civilians .
For over five hours , the protesters behaved respectfully of the army and police .
There had been no confrontations .
No one had sticks or guns .
The march ’s organisers had even taken stones from a few protesters .
But the army shot as us just like that , in cold blood .
There was no need to shoot !
Yes , some had started to cut and remove the barbed - wire fence [ so as to enter the landing strip ] , this can not be denied .
But it was not necessary to shoot civilians with live rounds .
Once again , so that the people of Honduras will remain united : the blood of a martyr is the seed for many Hondurans who will stand up and remain firm against such de facto government – this government of delinquents .
We are only following Article three of our constitution : ‘ Nobody should obey a Government which has reached power by means of usurpation . ’ ” -- Cesar Omar Silva , television journalist for state - owned Channel 8 .
Manuel Zelaya ’s airplane flew over Toncontin airport a couple of times before aborting its landing attempts and headed for Managua , Nicaragua .
The plane was not given permission to land as military personnel and vehicles blocked the runway .
His plans for a return to Honduras are not yet known at this time .
BBC News has published the best video so far of the Army ’s repression against the protesters .
The army ’s shooting can be clearly seen at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8135453.stm.

External Hemorrhoids
External hemorrhoids form as bulges or bumps around the anus and develop when too much pressure is put on the rectal veins and the tissue around the anus becomes swollen .
Over time , external hemorrhoids can become increasingly irritating , causing frequent itching , swelling and pain .
The good news is that there are plenty of ways to soothe symptoms at home , as well as affordable hemorrhoid treatments , such as the CRH O’Regan System , that can help get rid of external hemorrhoids altogether .
Some of the initial symptoms indicating you may have external hemorrhoids include a nagging , itchy feeling around the anal area , swelling , and pain .
If left untreated , the condition could turn into a thrombosed hemorrhoid , or a large and very painful bulge containing clotted blood .
Many people with external hemorrhoids , also have internal hemorrhoids which can cause bleeding .
This is why it ’s so important to talk to your doctor if you suspect that you have hemorrhoids .
External hemorrhoids rarely pose a serious health threat , but with the proper treatment , you could avoid some very painful flare - ups in the future .
Some of the most common causes of hemorrhoids include pregnancy , constipation , diarrhea or heavy weight lifting .
Unfortunately , once a hemorrhoid has formed , it may not go away on its own .
You can treat hemorrhoid symptoms using over - the - counter topical creams , or natural remedies like witch hazel and apple cider vinegar .
It ’s also possible to decrease your chance of recurring symptoms by eating a healthy , fiber - rich diet and drinking plenty of liquids .
However , while at - home treatments and positive lifestyle changes may reduce hemorrhoid flare - ups , they likely wo n’t fully go away without a professional treatment and the supervision of an experienced gastroenterologist .
For more information about external hemorrhoids and treatment options , talk to your doctor .
Be sure to discuss the CRH O’Regan System – the easiest and most effective solution for removing hemorrhoids .
Researchers have discovered that Cetacea , long thought to be “ the most distinctive and highly specialized orders of mammals ” actually exhibit characteristics of “ personhood . ”
Â
Like chimpanzees , whales and dolphins exhibit “ considerable social complexity and individual distinction . ” Â Scientists believe future research will prove Cetacean personhood will approach that of primates .
Â
Such research gives even more significance to ending international whaling programs .
According to NOAA , there are approximately 78 species of Cetacea , which are all protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act . Â
Findings of Cetacean “ culture and society ” are based upon studies of killer whales , bottlenose dolphins , humpback whales , and sperm whales .
Â
The idea of personhood is based upon the ability to “ possess self - awareness , feelings and high - level cognitive powers ” .
Â
In fact , Cetacan evolution evolved millions of years before primates .
Â Lori Marino , an evolutionary neurobiologist , explains :
If an alien came down anytime prior to about 1.5 million years ago to communicate with the â€˜brainiestâ€™ animals on Earth , they would have tripped over our own ancestors and headed straight for the oceans to converse with the dolphins …
The parts of the brain that are involved with processing emotion and social relationships are enormously complex , and in many cetaceans even more highly elaborated than in the human brain .
If we assume that the limbic system is doing what itâ€™s doing in all mammals , then something very high - level is going on .
The significance of this research may shatter the idea that humans are an “ exclusive species ” .
Â
Wired explains :
As the annual International Whaling Commission meeting stumbles to a close , unable to negotiate a compromise between whaling opponents and people whoâ€™ve killed more than 40,000 whales since 1985 , scientists say these aquatic mammals are more than mere animals .
They might even deserve to be considered people .
Not human people , but as occupying a similar range on the spectrum as the great apes , for whom the idea of personhood has moved from preposterous to possible .
Chimpanzees , gorillas and bonobos possess self - awareness , feelings and high - level cognitive powers .
According to a steadily gathering body of research , so do whales and dolphins .
The evidence of Cetacean “ personhood ” is based upon self - recognition , social behavior , tool use , and communication that may include syntax , dialects , and grammar .
Â
Much of whale research has been limited by “ the underlying desire to relate every â€˜culturalâ€™ characteristic to a functional biological explanation , ” according to Amanda Moore of UC Irvine .
Â
This biological restriction may change as more scientists gather more evidence of whales ’ cognitive abilities .
Â
Whale and dolphin personhood may not be identical to humans , but hopefully the evidence will give new respect and protection for mammals of the sea .
Climate change threatens to snuff out the world 's coral reefs within the next half - century , a group of scientists led by David Attenborough warned on Monday .
Several prominent scientists and marine experts gathered at the Royal Society in London , England , to discuss the future of the world 's coral reefs .
After the meeting , they called on world leaders to make greater cuts in carbon emissions .
" A coral reef is the canary in the cage as far as the oceans are concerned , " said Attenborough , speaking after the meeting .
" They are the places where the damage is most easily and quickly seen .
It is more difficult for us to see what is happening in , for example , the deep ocean or the central expanses of ocean , " the renowned British naturalist and broadcaster said .
The reefs provide important fish habitat and protect coastal areas from flooding .
They support a vast array of marine ecosystems , which humans in turn depend on for sustenance — be it for food or the economic benefits yielded by tourism .
The scientists at the meeting warned that if carbon emissions continue to grow at current rates , levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could reach 450 parts per million by 2050 — up from around 387 ppm today .
Acidity threatens reefs
Oceans absorb around a quarter of the world 's carbon dioxide .
This process creates carbonic acid , and seawater that acidifies creates an inhospitable environment for coral — existing coral can bleach and die , while new coral is unable to grow .
" When we get up to and above 450 ppm , that really means we 're into the realms of catastrophic destruction of coral reefs and we 'll be moving into a planetary - wide global extinction , " said Alex Rogers , one of the scientists in attendance .
He said carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm were necessary to ensure healthy reefs .
" The only way to get to 350 ppm or below is not only to have major cuts in CO2 emissions but also to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere through measures such as geo- engineering , " said Rogers , who is the scientific director of the International Program on the State of the Ocean .
Rogers said the vulnerability of the corals should spur decisive action by world leaders when they meet in Copenhagen at the end of the year to strike a climate pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol .
" Essentially coral reefs are on death row and Copenhagen is one of the last opportunities for a reprieve , " said Rogers .
" Because if we carry on business as usual collapse is inevitable , whereas if we decide to do something about it we can make a difference to the current trajectory . "
Teacher ' pregnant with record - breaking TWELVE babies '
Old record : Nadya Suleman , who gave birth to octuplets , could have her feat demolished by a Tunisian woman
A teacher is pregnant with a record - breaking 12 babies , it has been claimed .
The unnamed Tunisian woman , who is in her 30s , is reportedly expecting six boys and six girls .
She is said to have turned to fertility treatment after suffering two miscarriages in two years .
But British fertility experts said that although it was possible to conceive 12 babies , such a pregnancy was fraught with risk .
There was less than a one in 100 chance of even a single baby surviving , said one .
But the woman claims to be in good health .
‘ All I want to do is be able to hug my babies and show them all my love , ’ she told hospital workers in the town of Gafsa , about 250 miles south of the capital Tunis .
‘ This is an absolute miracle , and we all feel blessed after struggling so hard to have children . ’
Her husband , named only as Marwan , who teaches at the same school in Tunisia , told the Assabah newspaper : ‘ In the beginning , we thought that my wife would give birth to twins , but more foetuses were discovered .
‘ Our joy was increased with the growing number .
The medical team told us that my wife would give birth naturally . ’
But British experts said that a natural birth would be impossible and warned that the strain of carrying 12 babies could lead to labour at 20 weeks – just halfway through pregnancy .
It is unclear what stage the pregnancy is at , but ultrasound scans can work out a baby ’s sex only after about 16 weeks , so it is likely she is already nearing the critical stage .
Peter Bowen - Simpkins , a fellow of Britain ’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said : ‘ It is certainly possible to carry 12 babies but not for long .
‘ The problem is the capacity of the uterus .
‘ This woman is going to be enormous by 20 weeks .
And when the uterus goes into labour there is nothing you can do about it .
' The youngest that babies have survived is at 22 to 23 weeks .
They need very intensive nursing and the majority have permanent neurological damage .
‘ You ’d need a very good intensive paediatric unit to cope with this .
We could n’t do it in this country , we do n’t have a unit with 12 intensive care cots .
‘ I do n’t like to dampen her enthusiasm but the chances are she will deliver at 20 weeks .
' I would n’t even give her a one in 100 chance of even one surviving .
It ’s frightening . ’
In California in January of this year , a single mother of six defied doctors ’ predictions when she gave birth to another eight healthy babies .
The six boys and two girls were born to Nadya Suleman , dubbed Octomom , through IVF treatment .
Others have not been so lucky .
A 23 - year - old Greek Cypriot who became pregnant with a then record 11 babies in 1996 had to abort nine to save the lives of two .
In the same year a British woman , Mandy Allwood , 32 , became pregnant with octuplets after taking fertility drugs .
She ignored medical advice to abort some and lost all after they were born at just 22 weeks .
Fertility doctors say it is unlikely that an IVF doctor would have agreed to implant the Tunisian woman with 12 embryos .
Instead , the bumper pregnancy is likely to be the result of fertility drugs to stimulate the ovaries .

Congress and state legislatures should address the issue by strengthening juvenile justice policies and financing programs that keep youth out of adult jails .

To the Editor :
Judging children as children , not as adults , is a policy that I supported as a New York State judge , and one that I advocate as the executive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City .
Your editorial underscores the problem of charging children under 18 with adult crimes .
Far too many children are being treated in the adult system , which results in unacceptable recidivism and increasingly violent crimes .
As a judge , I channeled as many children as possible out of the system by placing them in community - based programs that provided monitoring , counseling and mentoring .
A mentor has the ability to open the child ’s world to beyond his or her immediate surroundings , making the young person less susceptible to peer pressure , the primary motive for juvenile crime .
It is clearly time for New York State to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18 from the current age of 16 ( and even in some cases 13 or 14 ) .
This way , children under the age of 18 would initially be directed to the family or juvenile court system , where providing social services is the focus .
A youth of a suitable age could be transferred to the adult court only after a due process judicial hearing in which a child is found not to be amenable to the programs or sanctions available in the juvenile court or in circumstances where the public ’s interest would best be served by prosecution in the adult court .
The goal of a thriving , humane society should be to build bridges of opportunities for our children , not to burn them .

The record business is in the doldrums because sales are plummeting .
Digital technology has made music easier to make and copy , with the result that recorded music is about as readily available as water , and not a whole lot more exciting .
This seems like bad news , until you pick up a copy of Time Out .
Then you realise that the live music scene is exploding , for , unable to make a living from records sales , more and more bands are playing live .
That experience ca n’t be put onto a memory card — and people are willing to pay for it , and to pay quite a lot .
Concert attendances are at an all - time high : recordings are increasingly ads for live shows , and live shows have become once again the real thing , the unduplicable .
Similarly , outdoor festivals have mushroomed .
There are more than ever , and they ’ve become temporary communities — somewhere between circuses and communes and summer schools , offering political debate , craft workshops , tai - chi lessons , comedy , visual arts , theatre , bookshops and , most importantly , the chance for people to meet and match and discuss .
The music is almost an excuse for the consolidation of a new society .
That , after all , is the traditional job of pop music , and it ’s good to see it back .
The duplicability of recordings has had another unexpected effect .
The pressure is on to develop content that is n’t easily copyable — so now everything other than the recorded music is becoming the valuable part of what artists sell .
Of course they ’ll still want to sell their music , but now they ’ll embed that relatively valueless product within a matrix of hard - to - copy ( and therefore valuable ) artwork .
People who wo n’t pay £ 15 for a CD will pay £ 150 for the limited edition version with additional artwork , photos , booklet and DVDs .
They often already own the music , downloaded — but now they want the art .
They ’re buying art , and they ’re buying it in a new way .
That suggests to me the possibility of a refreshingly democratic art market : a new way for visual artists , designers , animators and film - makers to make a living .
So , as one business folds , several others open up .

WASHINGTON  The National Security Agency is facing renewed scrutiny over the extent of its domestic surveillance program , with critics in Congress saying its recent intercepts of the private telephone calls and e-mail messages of Americans are broader than previously acknowledged , current and former officials said .
The agency ’s monitoring of domestic e-mail messages , in particular , has posed longstanding legal and logistical difficulties , the officials said .
Since April , when it was disclosed that the intercepts of some private communications of Americans went beyond legal limits in late 2008 and early 2009 , several Congressional committees have been investigating .
Those inquiries have led to concerns in Congress about the agency ’s ability to collect and read domestic e-mail messages of Americans on a widespread basis , officials said .
Supporting that conclusion is the account of a former N.S.A. analyst who , in a series of interviews , described being trained in 2005 for a program in which the agency routinely examined large volumes of Americans ’ e-mail messages without court warrants .
Two intelligence officials confirmed that the program was still in operation .
Both the former analyst ’s account and the rising concern among some members of Congress about the N.S.A. ’s recent operation are raising fresh questions about the spy agency .

Neighbors praise man who allegedly shot carjacker HPD : 74 - year - old man shoots Houston carjacker
Neighbors call him a hero
A southwest Houston man who told police he shot a knife - wielding carjacker Thursday morning is a getting a strong show of support from some of his neighbors .
“ He was protecting us , “ said Jaime Zaldivar , who has lived next door to August Peters , 74 , for several years on Carona near Wilcrest .
Peters pulled in front of the home about 6:30 a.m. when he noticed another car drive past and park along the curb across the street , police said .
Soon after Peters got out of his car , Martin Baltazar , 18 , came up to him and jammed a knife against his throat , Houston police said .
“ He said , ‘ Give me your car or I 'll kill you , ' “ said Victor Senties , an HPD spokesman .
Peters reached into his car for a pistol .
He began firing , with at least one round striking Baltazar in the abdomen , Houston police said .
The wounded Baltazar fled across the street , forcing his way into the home where Luis Ramos lives with his wife and brother .
Baltazar ran through the house — terrifying Ramos ' wife in the bedroom — as he sought to escape .
“ He said , ‘ Do n't touch me .
Do n't touch me .
Move , ' “ Ramos said .
“ I was nervous .
I did n't know what to do in this case . “
Ramos said Baltazar finally found the kitchen but was unable to open the locked back door .
“ He took a big chair and he hit the window , “ Ramos said .
The bleeding Baltazar climbed through the shattered window but apparently had a problem holding up his baggy trousers , Ramos said .
“ He left his pants in the kitchen , “ he said .
Baltazar vaulted the backyard fence but was captured moments later by Houston police a few blocks away from where he was shot .
He was taken to Ben Taub General Hospital where he was in fair condition , officials said later Thursday .
Baltazar has been charged with aggravated robbery with bail set at $ 30,000 .
No other injuries were reported .
August Peters could not be reached for comment later Thursday .
His neighbors described him as a quiet man , friendly person .
“ He 's a good man .
He never looks for problems , “ Zaldivar said .
Residents say they are concerned about crime in their neighborhood .
Zaldivar and Ramos both said their homes have been burglarized .

The last prospect for a bipartisan deal on healthcare reform hangs on closed - door negotiations among six senators , but colleagues on both sides of the aisle are already signaling doubts over whether it can win broad support .
Members of the group have talked about cutting Medicare costs and taxing the highest - end insurance plans – those of more than $ 250,000 , perhaps .
More controversially , the group might also be considering jettisoning a public option – one of President Obama ’s primary wishes – because it is a nonstarter for Republicans , in favor of health insurance cooperatives .
“ We do n’t know what ’s going on in these delicate negotiations , ” says Sen. Richard Durbin ( D ) of Illinois , the majority whip .
“ There ’s high anxiety .
We ca n’t say sight unseen if this will be something Democratic leaders can support . ”
Republicans ready to start over
Republican leaders are already talking in terms of scrapping proposals to date .
“ My guess is that , when it ’s all said and done , we ’ll come back in September and we ’ll say , let ’s start all over again , ” says Sen. Jon Kyl ( R ) of Arizona , the Republican whip .
“ We need to clear the decks here and solve specific problems with specific solutions that do not impose a government takeover and hurt … what most Americans can enjoy today , ” he adds .
Trying to get it done
The team of Sens. Max Baucus ( D ) of Montana and Charles Grassley ( R ) of Iowa – the chairman and senior Republican on the finance panel , respectively – also hatched the compromise that moved the first Bush tax cuts through the Senate in 2001 .
But the overhaul of America ’s healthcare system is a vastly more complex undertaking .
“ This is not one bill .
It ’s many , many , many , many , many bills , ” Senator Baucus told reporters after a Democratic caucus luncheon Tuesday .
Senators involved in the negotiations include Sens. Grassley , Olympia Snowe ( R ) of Maine , Michael Enzi ( R ) of Wyoming , Jeff Bingaman ( D ) of New Mexico , and Kent Conrad ( D ) OF North Dakota .
Responding to reports that the Finance committee may abandon a public option in favor of insurance cooperatives , Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D ) of Ohio said that " there is no real evidence we can put together a cooperative , scale it up , and make it work on a national level . "
" They should keep working on a bipartisan plan but they ought to have a fallback , if they can't get Republicans on , that will command the support of majority of Democrats , " said Sen. Carl Levin ( D ) of Michigan , who favors a public option .
" If you asked me to give you a definition of what cooperatives are , I could n't , " he added .
Last week , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R ) of Utah pulled out of the group .
“ Some of the things they ’re talking about , I just cannot support , ” he said .
Stung by White House charges that they have become the “ party of no , ” Republicans say they are frustrated that GOP alternatives have gotten little traction .
House action stalls as Democrats feud
On the House side , the challenge is to overcome deep rifts in Democratic ranks .
In a bid to rally support within their caucus , House Democratic leaders set up a marathon , five - hour tutorial this week to talk members through details of the vast draft bill .
The House Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Labor Committee have completed work on their bills .
But conservative Democrats in the Energy and Commerce panel want to rein in the cost of the bill .
“ [ The Democratic ] caucus is a diverse caucus .
Sooner or later , the other views needed to be considered , ” says Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( D ) of North Dakota , a member of the conservative Blue Dog caucus .
“ Had more of an effort been made to take these concerns seriously at an earlier point , the bill would be a better product . ”
More colonial subterfuge !
Canada , US , Russia , Norway , Denmark and other imperialist entities are trying to steal the Indigenous area of northern Great Turtle Island .
Climate change is causing the ice to recede .
They all want to cart away our minerals , oil and gas .
Ruskie and US subs have surfaced in the far north .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is standing around the North Pole , waving his arms and screaming , “ I was the first crook here .
So it ’s all mine , mine , mine ! ”
He wants the true inhabitants , the Inuit , to live there year round to assert Indigenous sovereignty .
They can hold back the other foreigners while he and his friends gouge out the riches .
To him Canada is the only imperialist that can rob us as it ’s under the usurpation of the colony of Canada !
Our inherent right to the “ Arctic Region ”
On January 28 , 2006 , the Women Title Holders of the Kanion ’ke : haka issued a public notice of objection to this attempted seizure of our inherent right to the “ Arctic Region ” by these foreign states , corporations , “ outsiders ” and non-Indigenous interests .
The Inuit , our family , are the natural custodians of this area which belongs to our unborn generations .
According to Wampum 44 of the Kaianereh ’ ko : wa , the Ongwehonwe Women Title Holders are the “ progenitors of the soil ” of Great Turtle Island .
We are the Caretakers of the land , water and air .
We told these capitalist blood suckers to stay away , that they have no business here .
Self - determination is a universal human right .
The denial of a nation ’s existence constitutes genocide , according to the many international covenants these states have pledged to uphold .
Modern international law protects small peoples from incursions by aggressive states who use military and economic force to impose their will .
Their turf war over our territory , waters and resources violates our customs , practices , occupation and rights .
We cannot surrender our birthright .
This land is who we are .
The Western Sahara decision provides that a territory cannot be incorporated in another state without the informed consent of the majority of its people .
This was not done because they know that we will never agree to give up our identity .
No one made a treaty of cession with us to enter our Arctic waters and territory .
International , federal , state and provincial entities cannot violate international law and the rule of law by superseding our jurisdiction over territory that we never surrendered .
Colonialism is illegal .
Past agreements and treaties only allowed foreigners to live peacefully on our land .
Any foreigner wishing to enter our territory must deal with us through nation - to - nation protocol .
No foreign entity and their corporate bodies and associated or visitor such as the colony of Canada can invite outsiders onto our territory or sell off our resources .
In Canada we took an action in the Supreme Court of Canada – Kanion ’ke : haka Kaianereh ’ ko : wa Kanon ’ses : neh v. Attorney General of Canada and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario , Court File : 05-CV-030785 .
We brought this constitutional jurisdiction issue before the U.S. Supreme Court .
See No. 05 -165 : 2005 .
In The Supreme Court of the United States In re Kanion ’ke : haka Kaianereh ’ko : wa Kanon’ses: neh , Non-party , Petitioner / Movant / Appellant , The Canadian St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians , Plaintiffs , Respondents , v. The State of New York , Defendants , Respondents .
Petition for Writs of Certiorari and Quo Warranto with Prohibition and Mandamus in Aid to Prevent Genocide .
Rules 17.1 and 20.1 .
There are two camps : our enemy and ourselves .
The increasing dependence of international capitalists on neo-colonial theft makes their existence and future uncertain .
They are facing serious economic and social difficulties making them desperate .
Some of the symptoms are rising prices , balance of payments problems , unemployment and social unrest .
Their use of more violence , armed force and coercion indicates their panic and decline in their power .
The masses are resisting the might is right strategy .
The capitalists are finding themselves in an unhealthy position .
We must keep confronting them with the truth , which they ’re saying is unpeaceful and annoying to them .
The Arctic has become unlivable due to the environmental destruction caused by the imperialists .
The Inuit have the same duties to care for our mother , Great Turtle Island .
We are brothers and sisters .
We follow your issues and feel all the stresses that you are going through .
We hope you wo n’t allow yourselves to be used by any of these foreign invaders .
They are trying to exploit you and nothing good will come of it .

US President Barack Obama has told America 's oldest civil rights organisation that African Americans should take charge of their own lives .
He told the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) there were " no excuses " for minority children not to succeed .
Mr Obama 's comments came in a speech at a dinner marking the 100th anniversary of the NAACP .
It is his first speech focusing on race since he became US president .
The BBC's Jon Donnison in Washington says the tone of the speech was passionate , even preacher - like .
" Make no mistake :
The pain of discrimination is still felt in America , " Mr Obama told the NAACP members gathered for the anniversary dinner in New York .
He said discrimination was still felt by minorities in the US , including African Americans , Latinos , Muslim Americans and gay people .
But he told the NAACP members they had to take responsibility for their lives and their communities .
No one has written your destiny for you - your destiny is in your hands
Barack Obama
" Government programmes alone wo n't get our children to the promised land - we need a new mindset , a new set of attitudes , " he said .
The president said African American communities had " internalised a set of limitations " and " come to expect so little from the world and from ourselves " .
But he said African American children should instead aspire to be scientists , engineers , Supreme Court judges and presidents .
" We have to say to our children : ' Yes , if you 're African - American , the odds of growing up amid crime and gangs are higher .
Yes , if you live in a poor neighbourhood , you will face challenges that someone in a wealthy suburb does not . '
" But that 's not a reason to get bad grades , that 's not a reason to cut class , that 's not a reason to give up on your education and drop out of school , " he said .
" No one has written your destiny for you - your destiny is in your hands .
You cannot forget that , that 's what we have to teach our children . "
Mr Obama also said he wanted to see a return to strong parenting and adults taking responsibility for the discipline of all children in their community .
He drew on his own experiences of growing up with a single mother , praising her for giving him " the chance to make the most of life " .

Editor 's note :
In the days following Bernie Kosar 's application for backruptcy in June , he agreed to an interview with Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald . )
MIAMI --
The IRS and the creditors and an angry ex-wife and an avalanche of attorneys are circling the chaos that used to be Bernie Kosar 's glamorous life , but that 's not the source of his anxiety at the moment .
He is doing a labored lap inside his Weston mansion , the one on the lake near the equestrian playpen for horses , because he wants to be sure there are no teenage boys hiding , attempting to get too close to his three daughters .
He shattered a Kid Rock - autographed guitar the other day while chasing one teenager out of his house because he does n't mind all of the other boys within the area code thinking the Kosar girls have an unhinged Dad .
" There are a million doors in this place , " he says .
" Too many ways to get in . "
So up and down the spiral staircases he goes , a rumpled mess wearing a wrinkled golf shirt , disheveled graying hair , and the scars and weariness from a lifetime 's worth of beatings .
He has no shoes on , just white socks with the NFL logo stitched on because he 's never really been able to let go of who he used to be .
He is coughing up phlegm from a sickness he is certain arrived with all the recent stress of divorce and debt , and now he does n't walk so much as wobble his way into one of the closets upstairs , where he happens upon some painful , wonderful memories he keeps sealed in a plastic cup .
His teeth are in there .
So is the surgical screw that finally broke through the skin in his ankle because of how crooked he walked for years .
He broke that ankle in the first quarter of a game against the Dolphins in 1992 ; he threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter anyway .
Don Shula called him the following day to salute him on being so tough , but Kosar is paying for it with every step he takes today on uneven footing .
The old quarterback shakes the rattling cup , then grins .
There are about as many real teeth in the cup as there are in what remains of his smile .
" I never wore a mouthpiece , " he says .
" I had to live and die with my audibles .
We played on pavement / AstroTurf back then .
Getting hit by Lawrence Taylor was only the beginning of the problem . "
So much pain in his life .
He heads back downstairs gingerly .
" I need hip replacement , " he says .
He pulls his jeans down a bit to reveal the scar from the surgery to repair his broken back .
" Disks fused together , " he says .
Concussions ?
" A lot , " he says .
" I do n't know how many . "
He holds out all 10 gnarled fingers .
" All of these have been broken at least once , " he says .
" Most of them twice . "
Broke both wrists , too .
The game was fast and muscled .
He was neither .
He was always the giraffe trying to survive among lions .
Still is , really .
He has merely traded one cutthroat arena in which people compete for big dollars for another , and today 's is a hell of a lot less fun than the one that made him famous .
More painful , too , oddly enough .
Kosar holds up his left arm and points to the scar on his elbow .
" Have a cadaver 's ligament in there , " he says .
And that 's the good arm .
He bends over and lets both arms hang in front of him .
His throwing arm is as crooked as a boomerang .
" I can't straighten it , " he says .
" I started breaking at 30 years old .
Once you start breaking , you keep breaking . "
The doorbell rings .
It 's his assistant with the papers he needs to autograph .
She puts all the legalese from four folders in front of him on a coffee table that is low to the ground .
A groaning Kosar , 45 , gets down very slowly onto the rug until he is symbolically on his hands and knees at the center of what used to be his glamorous life .
And then he signs the documents that begin the process of filing for bankruptcy .
" Let me tell you something , bro , " he says .
" It was all worth it . "
Seldom nimble , Kosar pulled off a career - long run vs.
Denver :
Until the bitter end
Brett Favre has made a spectacular public mess of his career punctuation because of how very hard it is for even the strongest among us to leave behind the applause for good .
It is difficult for any man to retire when so much of his identity and self - worth and validation is tied up in his job , what he does invariably becoming a lopsided amount of who he is .
But it is especially hard on quarterbacks because of how much of America 's most popular game they literally hold in their hands .
That kind of control -- over other strong men , over huddles , over winning , over entire swaying stadiums and their surrounding cities -- is just about impossible to let go ... as is the attendant attention , ego , importance , popularity , fun and life .
Running backs retire early sometimes because of the beatings , but quarterbacks never do .
Joe Namath finished wearing a Rams helmet , Joe Montana ended with the Chiefs at 38 , and Dan Marino got pushed out after losing , 62 - 7 -- and now Favre wanders the earth so lost and searching that he 's about to put on the uniform of his greatest enemy .
Kings do n't quit kingdoms voluntarily .
But there 's no preparing you for the silence that comes after all you 've heard is cheering .
A quarterback will never feel more alive anywhere than he does at the conquering center of everything in sports .
His is by consensus the most difficult job in athletics , and it requires an obsessive - compulsive attention to detail .
The most diligent and consumed become Peyton Manning and Tom Brady ; the talented and lazy become Ryan Leaf .
Sometimes they sculpt their singular and all - consuming skill to the detriment of the balance needed for the rest of life 's tacklers .
Bills ?
Errands ?
Adulthood ?
Those things get handed off sometimes because , whether it is the offensive line or family and friends huddled around their income source , the quarterback must always be protected or everyone loses .
On and off the field
Kosar was one of the smart ones .
He graduated from the University of Miami in 2 ½ years .
He was smart enough to go a record 308 pass attempts without an interception .
Smart enough to help build several businesses after football , with a 6 percent interest in a customer - service outsourcing company that sold for more than $ 500 million .
Smart enough to have a wing of the business school at the University of Miami named after him .
But now that the maids and wife are gone , you know how he feels walking into a grocery store by himself for the first time ?
" Overwhelmed , " he says .
He is like an embryo in the real world .
The huddle gave him strength and purpose and enough fame and money that he never had to do much of anything for himself .
Never had to grow , really , as anything but a quarterback .
He says his kids ( ages 17 , 16 , 12 and 9 ) grew up in a world where " their idea of work was telling the maid to clean their room . "
And even the live - in maids had assistants .
So now they 're all trying to figure it out together , four kids led by a 45 - year - old one .
Do you know how to wash clothes , Bernie ?
" No , " he says .
Iron a shirt ?
" No , " he says .
Start the dishwasher ?
" No , " he says .
He just learned the other day , after much trying and failing , how to make his own coffee .
This is a man who owned his own jet and helped found companies , plural .
But when his new girlfriend came over recently and found him trying to cook with his daughters , she could n't believe what was on the kitchen island to cut the French bread .
A saw .
" I was 25 and everyone was telling me that I was the smartest ; now I 'm 45 and realize I 'm an idiot , " he says .
" I 'm 45 and immature .
I do n't like being 45 . "
He still finds himself doodling plays on napkins in the kitchen .
Running companies does n't feel as rewarding as working with a high school or college tight end on routes .
The only post - quarterback jobs that have given him any sort of joy are the ones near football : broadcasting Cleveland Browns games ; running a company that created football Web sites and magazines ; buying an Arena Football League team .
But it is n't the same .
Not nearly .
As he tries to reorganize his life in a dark period that leaves his mind racing and sleepless , the people he quotes are n't philosophers and poets .
They are coaches .
Like when he was at the University of Miami , for example .
He was the weakest kid on the team .
He was mortified when his statuesque competition , Vinny Testaverde , walked onto campus and bench - pressed 325 pounds a bunch of times .
Kosar got 185 up just once , with arms shaking .
So he went to coach Howard Schnellenberger and , sweating and trying not to tremble , told him he was going to transfer .
Now he quotes the old pipe - smoking coach and applies those lessons from nearly three decades ago to today : " Son , I 'm not going to lie .
It does n't look good for you .
But wherever you go in life , there 's competition .
The guys who run home to mommy tend to be quitters their whole life . "
Kosar won .
Won huge .
Won the job and the national championship in a flabbergasting upset of Nebraska to begin Miami 's unprecedented football run through the next two decades .
That seems like so long ago .
As creditors close in and his divorce has gotten messy in public , Kosar has had some suicidal thoughts , but he says , " I could n't quit on my kids .
I 'm not a quitter .
I 'm not going to quit on them or me .
I got here with hard work .
I 'll get out of this with hard work .
No wallowing .
No ' woe is me . '
I 'm great at making money .
And , as we 've found out , I 'm great at spending it .
What I 'm not great at is managing it . "
The pangs of loss
It is hard to believe he filed a bankruptcy petition in June , but a bad economy , bad advice , a bad divorce and a bad habit of not being able to say " no " have ravaged him .
He says financial advisers he loved and trusted mismanaged his funds , doing things like losing $ 15 million in one quick burst .
There 's a $ 4.2 million judgment against him from one bank .
A failed real - estate project in Tampa involving multi-family properties .
A steakhouse collapsing with a lawsuit .
Tax trouble .
His finances have never been something he controlled .
He graduated on July 14 , 1985 , was at two - a - day NFL workouts six days later , and immediately got on the learning treadmill at full speed , always feeling like he was catching up because his team was n't very good ; and his receivers were worse than the ones he had at Miami , and everyone on the other side of the ball was very fast , and he was very slow , and the only advantage he would have was being smarter .
Dad would handle the bills ; the son had to handle the Bills .
He was always rewarded for being consumed that way .
That 's how the weakest and least physically gifted guy on the field once threw for 489 yards in an NFL playoff game .
But that huddle eventually breaks , and the men who formed it break , too .
Depression .
Drugs .
Drinking .
Divorce .
You 'll find it all as retired football players cope with the kinds of losses teammates can't help you with -- a loss of identity , self - worth , youth , relevance .
A recent Sports Illustrated article estimated that , within two years of leaving football , an astounding 78 percent of players are either bankrupt or in financial distress over joblessness and divorce .
Through the years , a lot of those old teammates have asked Kosar to borrow $ 100,000 here , $ 150,000 there .
He knew then that he would n't be getting it back .
But , as the quarterback -- always the quarterback -- you help your teammates up .
How much has he lent teammates during the years without being repaid ?
" Eight figures , " he says .
Friends and family ?
" Eight figures , " he says .
Charities , while putting nearly 100 kids through school on scholarships ?
" Well over eight figures . "
When it became public in June that the Panthers hockey team would be sold and that Kosar would be getting a minority - owner percentage of the $ 240 million price , his phone rang all weekend with people asking for help .
Calls after midnight on Friday .
Calls before 7 a.m. on Sunday .
" Everyone with a sob story came flooding back , " he says .
Then there 's the divorce .
It has been a public disaster , with him being accused of several addictions , of erratic behavior and of giving away the couple 's money .
Bernie says he has no interest in fighting with his estranged wife publicly or privately because " I can't live vengefully in front of my kids .
Why subject them to that ?
I do n't want to fight anybody .
I do n't want hate or anger in their life .
I may hurt me , but I would n't hurt anybody else . "
He speaks with a slur and admits there has been drinking and pain medication in his past , but says the only thing he 's addicted to is football .
Drugs ?
Alcohol ?
" Would my kids be living with me if that were really the case ? " he asks .
" If I did 10 percent of things I 'm accused of , I 'd be dead . "
He says the divorce has cost him between $ 4 and $ 5 million already .
" That 's just fees , " he says .
" And they keep coming .
Attorneys charge $ 600 an hour just to screw things up more . "
And here 's the worst part : " I do n't want to get divorced , " he says .
" I 'm Catholic , and I 'm loyal , and I still love her . "
Challenges ahead
He has poured himself into being Dad , but it is n't easy .
Kids listen more from 2 to 10 years old .
But now there are the perpetual parental concerns of cars , driving , drinking , drugs , sex .
" I'm outnumbered now , " he says .
And he has no clue how to help girls become women , although he gets moved to the brink of tears when his girls tell him they appreciate how hard he 's trying .
He wept like a child when his daughter painted him a picture of herself smiling and signed it with love .
He has found therapy in learning how to clean the house with the kids and dealing with life 's smaller headaches .
Just the other day , while in a 10 - hour bankruptcy meeting with 10 attorneys that left him " humbled and in pain and feeling betrayed " as he took a detailed inventory of his life , he excused himself with a smile because one of his daughters -- the oldest of his children lives with him full time , the others part time -- was calling with some sort of popularity crisis .
" The worst feeling in the world is being Dad on Friday night at home at midnight and they have n't gotten home yet , " he says .
His daughter rolled her car the other day , getting ejected as it sank into a lake .
" Memorial Day , I should have been doing the funeral for her , " he says .
" This other chaos is just stuff .
Money .
I 'll make more .
It feels bad .
It sucks the life and energy out of you and is a relentless drain .
But I 'm going to come out of this fine .
I always get up . "
There are photos all over his mansion .
Many of them are not up .
They are on the floor , leaning against the walls .
He 'll learn how to hang them soon enough .
He goes over and grabs the one by the fireplace .
In it , he is in the pocket with the Browns , and everything is collapsing all around him .
You can see Kosar 's offensive linemen either beaten or back - pedaling .
His left tackle is on the ground , staring as his missed assignment blurs toward the quarterback 's blind side .
But the ball is already in the air , frozen in flight , headed perfectly to the only teammate who has a step in a sea of Steelers .
It is a work of art , that photo .
You can see clearly that the play is going to work .
And you can see just as clearly that Kosar is going to get crushed .
Kosar runs his fingers along the frame .
This is what his life once was and what it is now -- a swirl of chaos and pain and danger surrounding a man who has to remain in control for the people around him as everything feels like it is falling apart .
" I just wanted to play football , " the old quarterback says .
A laugh and a pause .
" Actually , I still do . "
Two years ago , the Cleveland Clinic stopped hiring smokers .
It was one part of a “ wellness initiative ” that has won the renowned hospital — which President Obama recently visited — some very nice publicity .
The clinic has a farmers ’ market on its main campus and has offered smoking - cessation classes for the surrounding community .
Refusing to hire smokers may be more hard - nosed than the other parts of the program .
But given the social marginalization of smoking , the policy is hardly shocking .
All in all , the wellness initiative seems to be a feel - good story .
Which is why it is so striking to talk to Delos M. Cosgrove , the heart surgeon who is the clinic ’s chief executive , about the initiative .
Cosgrove says that if it were up to him , if there were n’t legal issues , he would not only stop hiring smokers .
He would also stop hiring obese people .
When he mentioned this to me during a recent phone conversation , I told him that I thought many people might consider it unfair .
He was unapologetic .
“ Why is it unfair ? ” he asked .
“ Has anyone ever shown the law of conservation of matter does n’t apply ? ”
People ’s weight is a reflection of how much they eat and how active they are .
The country has grown fat because it ’s consuming more calories and burning fewer .
Our national weight problem brings huge costs , both medical and economic .
Yet our anti-obesity efforts have none of the urgency of our antismoking efforts .
“ We should declare obesity a disease and say we ’re going to help you get over it , ” Cosgrove said .

You can disagree with the doctor — you can even be offended — and still come to see that there is a larger point behind his tough - love approach .
The debate over health care reform has so far revolved around how insurers , drug companies , doctors , nurses and government technocrats might be persuaded to change their behavior .
And for the sake of the economy and the federal budget , they do need to change their behavior .
But there has been far less discussion about how the rest of us might also change our behavior .
It ’s as if we have little responsibility for our own health .
We instead outsource it to something called the health care system .
Award - winning print design from Cannes Lions 2009

Cheaper Than Paper , Gold
“ Trillion Dollar Posters ” sets a strong message by using money as the medium for a series of posters for The Zimbabwean newspaper by TBWA\HUNT \LASCARIS .
Having been driven into exile and saddled with a massive duty , our client had a limited budget but a need for their message to break through the reams and reams of coverage on Zimbabwe .
One of the most eloquent symbols of Zimbabwe ’s collapse is the Z$ trillion dollar note , a symptom of their world record inflation .
This money cannot buy anything , not a loaf of bread and certainly not any advertising .
But it can become the advertising .
So , we turned the money into its own medium by printing our messages straight onto it .
By sticking notes together we created posters and then we silk - screened our message straight onto the money .
Onion Calendar , Gold
A daily tear - off calendar for Wüsthof knives by Serviceplan in Germany .
We thought about the most common thing which is cut in kitchens all over the world .
The answer was : onions .
After that , the question came : is it possible to cut an onion into 365 slices ?
A little slice for everyday ?
Of course it was .
With sharp - edged knifes from Wüsthof .
So we cut one onion into 365 slices .

Scott Thomas Zielinski , in prison for robbing Nick's Party Shop in Clinton Township in 2007 , is suing the owner and an employee of that store who shot him as he fled .
The Macomb Daily reports that Zielinski is seeking damages in excess of $ 125,000 , contending that employees shot him with a .357 Magnum and beat him while waiting for police to arrive .
Acho told Clinton Township police his mother , nephew and cousin were working when Zielinski entered the store , put a knife to his mother 's throat and stole money and cigarettes .
An attorney for Acho told the Daily that Kallo shot Zielinski after being threatened and after Zielinski told employees he'd come back and shoot them if they lied about not having a safe .
Zlienski took a plea in the robbery case and his charge was dropped from armed to unarmed robbery .
A judge sentenced him to 8 to 22 years in prison .
His lawsuit was assigned to Macomb County Circuit Judge David Viviano .
Obviously unhappy with the lawsuit , Acho said Zielinski's attorney should go to jail " for the accusations he made . "
' It just goes to show you do n't need thousands and thousands of pounds to make a film , ' says Colin director
A film made for £ 45 is to be released in cinemas across the country after finding a distributor .
Colin , a zombie movie made using a camcorder , has been snapped up by Kaleidoscope Entertainment and is due to hit the big screen in time for Halloween .
Shot in Wales and London , the film charts the progress of Colin , a man who is bitten by a zombie , dies and is resurrected as one of the flesh - eating undead .
Viewers gain an insight into his life prior to zombification and witness him munching his way through various victims .
The director , Marc Price , who also wrote and produced the film , said he was amazed it would now be shown across the country .
The 30 - year - old , originally from Swansea and now based in London , edited the film while working for a courier firm , Creative Couriers .
Price said : " The whole thing is just insane , If you 'd told me the film was going to get released in the cinema when we first started on the project I just would n't have believed it .
I really thought it was a joke when I was told .
" I hope this will encourage others to go out with the video cameras and make films .
It just goes to show you do n't need thousands and thousands of pounds to make a film . "
The film , which took 18 months to complete , caused a stir when it was screened at the Cannes film festival this year .
It will be released in London and major cities across the UK .
Film buffs can get a sneak preview at the Frightfest fantasy and horror film festival in London next month .

Can you trust the calorie count of a burger ?
( Image : Dan Saelinger / Image Bank )
STANDING in line at the coffee shop you feel a little peckish .
So what will you choose to keep you going until lunchtime ?
Will it be that scrumptious - looking chocolate brownie or perhaps a small , nut - based muesli bar .
You check the labels : the brownie contains around 250 kilocalories ( kcal ) , while the muesli bar contains more than 300 .
Surprised at the higher calorie count of what looks like the healthy option , you go for the brownie .
This is the kind of decision that people watching their weight – or even just keeping a casual eye on it – make every day .
As long as we keep our calorie intake at around the recommended daily values of 2000 for women and 2500 for men , and get a good mix of nutrients , surely we can eat whatever we like ?
This is broadly true ; after all , maintaining a healthy weight is largely a matter of balancing calories in and calories out .
Yet according to a small band of researchers , using the information on food labels to estimate calorie intake could be a very bad idea .
They argue that calorie estimates on food labels are based on flawed and outdated science , and provide misleading information on how much energy your body will actually get from a food .
Some food labels may over or underestimate this figure by as much as 25 per cent , enough to foil any diet , and over time even lead to obesity .
As the western world ’s waistlines expand at an alarming rate , they argue , it is time consumers were told the true value …
As a reporter for the local newspaper , Louis Beane is shocked when the tiny southern town of Highland Park is selected as the location of the new Hunter College .
Funded by the mysterious New York modern artist Porter Talbot , the school is seen as a cultural blessing for the small community -- until it opens .
The school ’s attempt to bring refinement to this highly - conservative town is a disaster , resulting in a series of scandalous performance art pieces that leave the community enraged .
Suspicious , Louis and his gay neighbors , Nik and Peter , decide to investigate the deceased Mr. Talbot ’s estate and the school ’s ( possibly ) true motivation .
Shockingly , their hilarious attempts at investigation succeed , and reveal an ugly chapter of the community they now call home .
The town ’s church - fueled matriarch , Anna Hoss , eventually decides she ’s had enough of the school ’s antics , and whips her followers into a righteous frenzy .
Faced down by Molotov - cocktail wielding townsfolk , rioting naked students , and an on - the - loose , unrepentant murderer , Louis remains committed to revealing the town ’s sordid past as everyone around him goes

I was reading recently in RESTful Web Services ( Leonard Richardson & Sam Ruby , O’Reilly , 2007 ) about how to implement transactional behavior in a RESTful web service .
Most web services today do this with an overloaded POST operation , but the authors assert that this is n’t necessary .
Their example ( in Chapter Eight ) uses the classic bank account transaction scenario , where a customer wants to transfer 50 dollars from checking to savings .
I ’ll recap here for your benefit .
Both accounts start with 200 dollars .
So after a successful transaction , the checking account should contain 150 dollars and the savings account should contain 250 dollars .
Let ’s consider what happens when two clients operate on the same resources :
Client A ->
Read account : 200 dollars Client A ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 200 - 50 = 150 dollars Client A ->
Write account : 150 dollars Client B ->
Read account : 150 dollars Client B ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 150 - 50 = 100 dollars Client B ->
Write account : 100 dollars
This is all well and good until you consider that the steps in these operations might not be atomic .
Transactions protect against the following situation , wherein the separate steps of these two Clients ’ operations are interleaved :
Client A ->
Read account : 200 dollars Client B ->
Read account : 200 dollars Client A ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 200 - 50 = 150 dollars Client B ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 200 - 50 = 150 dollars Client A ->
Write account : 150 dollars Client B ->
Write account : 150 dollars
After both operations , the account should contain 100 dollars , but because no account locking was in effect during the two updates , the second withdrawal is lost .
Thus 100 dollars was physically removed from the account , but the account balance reflects only a 50 dollar withdrawal .
Transaction semantics would cause the following series of steps to occur :
Client A -> Begin transaction Client A ->
Read account : 200 dollars Client B -> Begin Transaction ( block ) Client A ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 200 - 50 = 150 dollars Client A ->
Write account : 150 dollars Client A -> Commit transaction Client B -> ( unblock ) Read account : 150 dollars Client B ->
Withdraw 50 dollars : 150 - 50 = 100 dollars Client B ->
Write account : 100 dollars Client B ->
Commit transaction
Web Transactions
The authors ’ approach to RESTful web service transactions involves using POST against a “ transaction factory ” URL .
In this case / transactions / account - transfer represents the transaction factory .
The checking account is represented by / accounts / checking / 11 and the savings account by / accounts / savings / 55 .
Now , if you recall from my October 2008 post , PUT or POST : The REST of the Story , POST is designed to be used to create new resources whose URL is not known in advance , whereas PUT is designed to update or create a resource at a specific URL .
Thus , POSTing against a transaction factory should create a new transaction and return its URL in the Location response header .
A user might make the following series of web requests :
GET / transaction / account - transfer/11a5/accounts/checking/11 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 200 Ok balance=200 --- GET / transaction /account- transfer/11a5/accounts/savings/55 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 200 Ok balance=200
The fact that the client reads the account balances before beginning is implied by the text , rather than stated explicitly .
At some later time ( hopefully not much later ) the transaction is started :
POST / transaction / account - transfer HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 201 Created Location : /transaction / account - transfer/11a5 --- PUT / transaction/account-transfer/11a5/accounts/checking/11 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com balance=150 ... 200 Ok --- PUT / transaction/account- transfer/11a5/accounts/savings/55 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com balance=250 ... 200 Ok --- PUT / transaction /account - transfer/11a5 HTTP/1.1
Host : example.com committed=true ... 200 Ok
At first glance , this appears to be a nice design , until you begin to consider the way such a system might be implemented on the back end .
The authors elaborate on one approach .
They state that documents PUT to resources within the transaction might be serialized during building of the transaction .
When the transaction is committed the entire set of serialized operations could then be executed by the server within a server - side database transaction .
The result of committing the transaction is then returned to the client as the result of the client ’s commit on the web transaction .
However , this ca n’t work properly , as the server would have to have the client ’s view of the original account balances in order to ensure that no changes had slipped in after the client had read the accounts , but before the transaction was committed ( or even begun ! ) .
As it stands , changes could be made by a third - party to the accounts before the new balances are written and there ’s no way for the server to ensure that these other modifications are not overwritten by outdated state provided by the transaction log .
It is , after all , the entire purpose of a transaction to protect a database against this very scenario .
Fixing the Problem
One way to make this work is to include account balance read ( GET ) operations within the transaction , like this :
POST / transaction / account - transfer HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 201 Created Location : /transaction / account - transfer/11a5 --- GET / transaction/account- transfer/11a5/accounts/checking/11 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 200 Ok balance=200 --- PUT / transaction/account- transfer/11a5/accounts/checking/11 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com balance=150 ... 200 Ok --- GET / transaction /account- transfer/11a5/accounts/savings/55 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com ... 200 Ok balance=200 --- PUT / transaction/account- transfer/11a5/accounts/savings/55 HTTP/1.1 Host : example.com balance=250 ... 200 Ok --- PUT / transaction /account - transfer/11a5 HTTP/1.1
Host : example.com committed=true ... 200 Ok
The GET operations would , of course , return real data in real time .
But the fact that the accounts were read within the transaction would give the server a reference point for later comparison during the execution of the back - end database transaction .
If the values of either account balance are modified before the back - end transaction is begun , then the server would have to abort the transaction and the client would have to begin a new transaction .
This mechanism is similar in operation to lock - free data structure semantics .
Lock - free data structures are found in low - level systems programming on symmetric multi-processing ( SMP ) hardware .
A lock - free data structure allows multiple threads to make updates without the aid of concurrency locks such as mutexes and spinlocks .
Essentially , the mechanism guarantees that an attempt to read , update and write a data value will either succeed or fail in a transactional manner .
The implementation of such a system usually revolves around the concept of a machine - level test and set operation .
The would - be modifier , reads the data element , updates the read copy , and then performs a conditional write , wherein the condition is that the value is the same as the originally read value .
If the value is different , the operation is aborted and retried .
Even under circumstances of high contention the update will likely eventually occur .
How this system applies to our web service transaction is simple :
If the values of either account are modified outside of the web transaction before the back - end database transaction is begun ( at the time the commit=true document is PUT ) , then the server must abort the transaction ( by returning “ 500 Internal server error ” or something ) .
The client must then retry the entire transaction again .
This pattern must continue until the client is lucky enough to make all of the modifications within the transaction that need to be made before anyone else touches any of the affected resources .
This may sound nasty , but as we ’ll see in a moment , the alternatives have less desirable effects .
Inline Transaction Processing
Another approach is to actually have the server begin a database transaction at the point where the transaction resource is created with the initial POST operation above .
Again , the client must read the resources within the transaction .
Now the server can guarantee atomicity — and data integrity .
As with the previous approach , this approach works whether the database uses global - or resource - level locking .
All web transaction operations happen in real time within a database transaction , so reads return real data and writes happen during the write requests , but of course the writes are n’t visible to other readers until the transaction is committed .
A common problem with this approach is that the database transaction is now exposed as a “ wire request ” , which means that a transaction can be left outstanding by a client that dies in the middle of the operation .
Such transactions have to be aborted when the server notices the client is gone .
Since HTTP is a stateless , connectionless protocol , it ’s difficult for a server to tell when a client has died .
At the very least , database transactions begun by web clients should be timed out .
Unfortunately , while timing out a database transaction , no one else can write to the locked resources , which can be a real problem if the database uses global locking .
Additional writers are blocked until the transaction is either committed or aborted .
Locking a highly contended resource over a series of network requests can significantly impact scalability , as the time frame for a given lock has just gone through the ceiling .
It ’s clear that creating proper RESTful transaction semantics is a tricky problem .
But there also has been a concerted effort to pull a curtain across the food production system .
You see that twice in " Food , Inc . "
Once , when a farmer who raises chickens for Tyson agrees to allow cameras onto his farm , only to have Tyson quickly call and persuade him to rescind his offer .
And again , when Monsanto refuses to comment on , well , anything .
It 's one thing to be kept out of Dick Cheney 's underground lair (s ? ) .
But we 're eating this stuff .
In yesterday 'sEzra Klein , commenting on the recently released film , writes that " something is wrong with our food production system ...
Food , Inc. joinsand dozens of other polemical books and films in the necessary effort to convince us that checking out at the supermarket is , on some level , a political act , with consequences for ourselves , our families and our world .
" I dropped out long ago .
I was lucky that a girlfriend when I was in college was a health - conscious vegetarian and a great cook .
I never made a decision to become a vegetarian ... but it 's been almost 40 years ( not counting , in the old days , here and there , some chicken -- which my doctor says is worse than beef -- and fish ) .
I do remember , much more recently , becoming a raw foodist .
The aforementioned doctor gave me a choice : go raw ( or , really , rawish ) or die from the cancer that had recently been discovered .
I learned -- with little fuss and no hesitation -- toraw food .
When I started , there were no restaurants serving raw cuisine anywhere near my home .
The closest was an hour away .
Learning to prepare my own meals was a joy all over again .
It 's so healthy !
Now there are several in L.A. I could walk to in a pinch .
ActuallyI'm in Bali and there are almost as many restaurants serving raw cuisine here as there are in L.A .
In fact , the house I rented just outside Ubud is a paradise for a raw foodist with a Vitamix , a dehydrator and a wonderful chef who just made me some raw yogurt from coconut milk !
If I go to a " straight " American grocery store , it might be to get toilet paper , a light bulb or a battery .
And that includes Whole Foods , which is maybe 10 - 20 % more health conscious and more organic and less deadly than supermarkets with far less pretension .
Ezra is n't talking about me when he points out that Americans " know rather less about our food than our grandparents did .
In part , that 's because the process of creating food in a lab is less familiar than the process of growing it in a garden .
Food producers might have to print ingredient lists , but no one ever passed a law saying we had to understand them .
( How do you hydrogenate an oil , anyway ? ) " I know I 'm not going to live forever , but my cancer is gone , I lost over 40 backbreaking pounds , I feel better than I can remember in decades , I do n't get sick , I have more energy and my feet never itch .
I do n't eat food created in labs and I feel sorry for folks who eat hydrogenated oils .
Ezra interviews the director ofwho points to the Inside the Beltway power structure : " Industry , committees on the Hill , the USDA , and very little input from us . "
He forgot the FDA .
I 'm sure Ezra will get around to it in his new twice monthly column on the politics of food , but no one mentioned the fount of death - by - eating , Congress ' most corrupt enclave , the Blue Dog - dominated House Agriculture Committee .
Forget the Medical - Industrial Complex and the banksters when it comes to running wild over their slices of our lives .
Compared to AgriBusiness they are each thriving in an oasis of enlightenment , instead of the den of iniquity run by America 's chief poisoner , Collin Peterson .

Eircom Internet services were seriously disrupted again last night due to another suspected cyber attack .
Many of the company 's 500,000 subscribers suffered Internet outages or delays after what the firm says was an " unusual and irregular volume of traffic " .
The situation reoccurred yesterday , but services were restored last night and technical experts are now working to determine the source of the problem .
The outages are likely to have been caused by a deliberate attack on the Eircom network by computer hackers .

Mr. President :
Momentum for universal health care is slowing dramatically on Capitol Hill .
Moderates are worried , Republicans are digging in , and the medical - industrial complex is firing up its lobbying and propaganda machine .
But , as you know , the worst news came days ago when the Congressional Budget Office weighed in with awful projections about how much the leading healthcare plans would cost and how many Americans would still be left out in the cold .
Yet these projections did n’t include the savings that a public option would generate by negotiating lower drug prices , doctor fees , and hospital costs , and forcing private insurers to be more competitive .
Projecting the future costs of universal health care without including the public option is like predicting the number of people who will get sunburns this summer if nobody is allowed to buy sun lotion .
Of course the costs of universal health care will be huge if the most important way of controlling them is left out of the calculation .
If you want to save universal health care , you must do several things , and soon :
1 . Go to the nation .
You must build public support by forcefully making the case for universal health care everywhere around the country .
The latest Wall Street Journal / NBC poll shows that three out of four Americans want universal health care .
But the vast majority do n’t know what ’s happening on the Hill , do n’t know how much money the medical - industrial lobbies are spending to defeat it , and have no idea how much demagoguery they ’re about to be exposed to .
You must tell them .
And do n’t be reluctant to take on those vested interests directly .
Name names .
They ’ve decided to fight you .
You must fight them .
2. Be LBJ .
So far , Lyndon Johnson has been the only president to defeat American Medical Association and the rest of the medical - industrial complex .
He got Medicare and Medicaid enacted despite their cries of “ socialized medicine ” because he knocked heads on the Hill .
He told Congress exactly what he wanted , cajoled and threatened those who resisted , and counted noses every hour until he had the votes he needed .
When you ’re not on the road , you need to be twisting congressional arms and drawing a line in the sand .
Be tough .
3. Forget the Republicans .
Forget bipartisanship .
Universal health care can pass with 51 votes .
You can get 51 votes if you give up on trying to persuade a handful of Republicans to cross over .
George W. Eight year ago George W. Bush passed his huge tax cut , mostly for the wealthy , by wrapping it in an all - or - nothing reconciliation measure and daring Democrats to vote against it .
You should do the same with health care .
4. Insist on a real public option .
It ’s the lynchpin of universal health care .
Do n’t accept Kent Conrad ’s ersatz public option masquerading as a “ healthcare cooperative . ”
Cooperatives wo n’t have the authority , scale , or leverage to negotiate low prices and keep private insurers honest .
5 . Demand that taxes be raised on the wealthy to ensure that all Americans get affordable health care .
At the rate healthcare costs are rising , not even a real public option will hold down costs enough to make health care affordable to most American families in years to come .
So you ’ll need to tax the wealthy .
Do n’t back down on your original proposal to limit their deductions .
And support a cap on how much employee - provided health care can be provided tax free .
( Yes , you opposed this during your campaign .
But you have no choice but to reverse yourself on this . )
These are the only two big pots of money .
6 . Put everything else on hold .
As important as they are , your other agenda items — financial reform , home mortgage mitigation , cap - and - trade legislation — pale in significance relative to universal health care .
By pushing everything at once , you take the public ’s mind off the biggest goal , diffuse your energies , blur your public message , and fuel the demagogues who say you ’re trying to take over the private sector .
You have to win this .

Indeed , until a very recent time , I spent a big period of my life believing I ’m an agnostic .
How do I put this mildly ?
Agnosticism is the safe route , it ’s the one in between the dirty street filled with drug dealers and that very safe boulevard .
It ’s the one you ’d take if your mom told you to take the shortest route home and you decided to be a bit of a rebel .
But just a bit , mind you , not a lot .
Because the basic concept of agnosticism , in relation to God , is that “ we do n’t know ” .
We do n’t know , we ca n’t know , therefore we ca n’t make suppositions based on thin air .
But , what agnosticism offers in return is the acceptance that there is actually something out there , luring in the divine space , waiting for us to recognize it to its true form and power .
Basically , you get the “ safety - belt ” package that allows you to say , if you ever find yourself blamed in front of said divinity , that you could n’t be sure .
Which is , I used to believe , much more acceptable than …
Than atheism , really .
Than flat - out acknowledging and believing and living up to this belief that there is no God .
If death is not final and you find yourself face to face with the supreme Judge … you ’re fucked .
I guess I did n’t want to be a little rebel anymore and blossomed into a full blown hooligan .
I have never in my life been a believer .
Not a single moment have I said : “ I believe in God . ” I have been raised with only one rule as guidance : “ think for yourself ” .
As a kid , my family took me to a vast number of churches , not only of my religion , even if predominantly confined by it ; big churches , small churches , some covered in gold , some built of wood , some carved in rock ; some with a lot of fervent followers , others with just a lonely , old priest watching over the precincts …
I have visited other countries and entered their churches , seen their shrines , watched their processions .
I have had a fair amount of religious visiting done – but never in the name of God .
Not once , in my entire life , have I gone to a church / religious space with the purpose of praying or bowing to the maker .
If there was a reason , I guess it was to witness art , beauty in religious architecture , in believer ’s paintings , in faith based sacred images .
It was to see human - made wonders , ironically .
I have shared meals with priests and slept with nuns in their rooms , in the mountains ; I have experienced the simplicity that religion can instill into the lives of men and women , who devote their entire beings towards a better existence at the end of their current one .
I have also seen the gold - adorned lives some religious people dwell in because of this foolish and completely idiotic belief that a creator would need to be worshipped with precious stones ;
How , did the creator not also create the poor ?..
Or maybe he had an eye for sparkle .
I guess my point is , the concept of God in itself was useless to my formation , to my life .
I have not had any advantage from being baptized into the Orthodox Church , no real need fulfilled by my affiliation to a certain religious cult .
Knowing the Ten Commandments has n’t overthrown my innate sense of right and wrong .
The Genesis has n’t impaired my ability to understand and believe in the Darwinist model .
I have a moral code and fairly tough ethics without having followed God ’s rules a single day .
My life has been much more impacted upon by the fact that I was born into a white , middle - class , fairly well - off European family and that I have been given the proper education during each stage of my life in order to propel me to my current position and allow me to pursue my ( apparently ) fucked - up dreams .
But , at some point in my intellectual journey , I realized I had to know more about religion .
I simply had to .
There was no way around it , I had too many questions that had n’t received answers .
What also prompted me to analyze the matter more profoundly was the attitude of religious people in my vicinity when confronted with a non-believer .
I have had confrontations ( mainly in a scholarly environment , but just as meaningful ones outside of it ) with people who had blamed me for my decisions and professed harsh consequences upon my doings , supported by their faith , when all I had done was ask questions .
I do have opinions , mind you .
I do think religion has become a political / economical tool and that humans have , in their majority , lost the true meaning of it ( which is achieving spirituality ) .
Also , on my bitter road filled with deception in becoming an atheist , I found myself more and more disgusted with religious people and faith preachers and church goers , all because of their sense of superiority over me , their smug characters , thinking they have the divinity watching over their backs , that a divinity cares for them , repudiating reason and thinking and skepticism and empirical evidence to the dungeons of hell and their inhabitants to even worse tortures …
I ’m sure you could say atheists become atheists because of people more than because of God .
I am not one of those who will talk against the concept of God ; however , against the fantasies that the Bible ( or any other scripture ) professes as historically true , I will ; against stupidity and racism and extremist followers and the banishment of science , I will ; against mindless , spineless and remorseless individuals who coerce their children into fear and revulsion , perpetuating this tradition of imbecility over generations , I will .
Against all of that and many more , I will speak up .
After all this ranting , I want you to take this away : I understand the need for religion .
I understand why we turned to it in the first place and why we still cling to it now .
I am not an “ anti- theist ” .
I do not speak against God .
I question him , his existence , his preaching , his absurd needs and his megalomaniac commands .
I judge him , yes , and his followers , as they also judge me in return .
You could call it mutual distrust , really .
But , if it ’s true , if God exists , then I ’m content with my atheist position .
I believe I have the right to burn in Hell , or in all versions of it that exist .
If you are a religious person reading this , please pray to your God that I may suffer .
Please , bring the flames on , an eternity of torture for this pitiful apostate that I am !
I beg of you , prove me wrong .
I ’ll be the happiest for that – indeed , I , in a very sadomasochistic way , look forward to it .
I fully intend to burn in Hell if that is the punishment for critical thinking and freedom of opinion .
Make crackling strips out of my skin !
Scrambled brains out of the contents of my skull !
And never grant me forgiveness for wanting to understand the world by the power of my own mind .
I do n’t need to be excused for my own egocentric nature .
Not by someone who is content in giving up his identity to a whimsical being of a far - away land .
In any case , if death is not final , I ’ll still be going to hell even without being an atheist .
I ’m a sinner by birth , supposedly .
Being an atheist just makes me a conscious one .
DONE !
Now , let ’s move on to an apologetic review that is supposed to be worth reading the whole rant that you just went through …
Oh , well , I doubt it .
What I promise I will not talk about : how awesome Christopher Hitchens is .
What I will talk about : how awesome Christopher Hitchens ’ work is .
“ God is not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything ” is one in a long series of published papers that Hitchens has dawned upon us readers , that concern the matter of a divine being ’s existence .
Now , Hitchens is , as Woody Allen so humorously puts it , “ the loyal opposition ” .
He is an atheist and a very articulate one indeed .
When reading his work , you must be aware of the position he is taking : he is against blind faith and all for finding proof .
As always , as in his speeches and his essays , he does n’t cut off the path to discussion ; rather he wants to open one .
He questions everything , tries to shed light on the scriptures and the relationship between human and divine and all in all succeeds in making a very serious and solid case for his motion .
I have read some commentaries that he just mindlessly gives examples about how different people do different bad things in the name of their religion , and the readers who said that were arguing that these are useless extracts .
I believe not .
Of course he is going to point out what individuals do in the name of religion , that is the exact purpose of it all , how far humans will go and to what extent they will cause suffering and ignite wars and deny the most basic needs to others because of what their God ( read : whimsical being of a far - away land with a very serious ego problem ) has said .
Now , Hitchens does n’t differentiate between Gods .
If one is false , all are .
The God ’s importance does n’t reside in the number of his followers , for this author .
He talks the same about the three big monotheist religions , as well as about the remote cults of distant lands .
The reason why so much of his work is concentrated around the Judaic , Muslim , and Christian preaching is that these three have had a massive effect on our society , as we experience it today .
He speaks against them not with the purpose of defiling the “ fantasy ” itself , but in need to show how ridiculous and irrelevant they are for humanity today .
They were very useful in the dawn of time , when volcanoes erupting at every corner and people found dead in the morning could not receive a proper explanation .
After all , religion is a very early and very primitive attempt at science !
Hitchens does n’t deny that , and never once attacks the spiritual need of humans to unite and find solace – what he offers , instead , is solace through knowledge .
For all it ’s worth it , I need to address the writing .
You can see that this man has loved reading since he was a kid .
You can see he knows literature in a very intimate way ; his choice of words , his rhythm , the subtle irony underlining the entire work , everything points out to a wonderfully complex and cultured mind behind those pages .
And cultured he had to be , given the enormity of the subjects he chose to tackle in his entire career .
This is , in my opinion , a very good piece of non-fiction writing .
It shows through a very thorough research , even if it is centered on finding the right facts to support his claims .
I can throw away my subjective , atheist self , look at this work with my objective , detail - obsessed reader ’s eye and find only minor twerks in this study .
I , for one , love the way Hitchens writes , because I feel he ’s having a conversation with me .
And , in the end , that is every writer ’s dream – the extension of one ’s thoughts into another ’s mind without the two actually being in each other ’s presence .
Atheists … you know you liked it .
Even if it was the sort of : " oh wow he said it much better than I could have " like , you enjoyed it .
Believers … you know you ca n’t deny its truth .
Even if you 're backed up by all your faith , do n't Hitchens ' arguments pick at your reason ?
All the rest … pick a side .
Does Hitchens ask for too much ?
Just pick a damn side .

The White House is always accusing the media of treating health reform like a game .
So .. Step 1 .
The health care system is broken and needs reform .
If you agree with this statement , please go to Step 50 .
If you disagree with this statement , please go to Step 50 .
Step 2 : If you 're afraid that ObamaCare will spell the end of private insurance and be a total disaster , Go to Step 54 .
If you support -- in general -- the consensus insurance reforms in the House and Senate bill , go to Step 3 .
If you support a single payer system and are worried that the White House has conceded way too much , go to step 33 .
Step 3 : If you believe that , even with insurance reforms , health care is n't worth the effort unless it includes a " public option , " go to step 5 .
If you believe that " consumer protections , " combined with some cost - cutting measures , higher taxes on the rich , structural reforms and inducements TBD are good enough , Go to step 4 .
Step 4 : Congratulations .
I 've identified you , at heart , as a health care policy wonk with center - left tendencies .
Or , you work in the White House .
Go to step 6 .
Step 5 : You 're outraged that the White House thinks the public plan is negotiable .
Go to step 6 .
Step 6 : House Democrats say that a conference bill without a public option wo n't pass their chamber .
If you believe their threat , Go to step 8 .
If you think they 're bluffing , go to step 7 .
Step 7 .
All your focus is on getting to 60 votes in the Senate .
If you think Sen .
Ted Kennedy will be able to return to the Senate and cast the 60th vote , go to Step 8 .
If you do n't think Kennedy will return to cast the deciding vote , go to Step 9 .
Step 8 : You 're focusing on a handful of Democrats and a few Republicans .
If you think you should play hardball , go to step 10 .
If you think you should let the finance committee , messy as it is , reach a consensus , go to step 11 .
Step 9 : If you think 61 votes is undoable , you decide to take a gamble on the reconcilliation process .
Go to step 35 .
Else , proceed to step 8 .
Step 10 : The White House fills in the details : reform is a must .
It 's a clarifying issue .
When the American people watch the final , final vote , they 're going to view the pro-reform side as being " right , " and senators need to get on the right side of history .
If you think this is sufficient enough , go to step 14 .
If you think this is an insufficient threat , go to step 13 .
Step 11 : Your base approval rating drops another 10 points .
If you think this is temporary , go to step 12 .
If you 're worried , to back to step 6 .
Step 12 : Wait a while .
Then go to step 16 .
Step 13 : You have your chief of staff threaten to cut the balls off of any Democrat who KOs his president 's signature item .
If you think this will work , go to step 16 .
If not , go to step 15 :
Step 14 : You bargain that the polarization of the health care debate will diminish over time , and that appeals to logic and reason are sufficient , and that things will sort themselves out in the end .
If you 're confident , go step 16 .
If not , go back to step 8 .
Step 15 : You resort to bribery and trickery , are arrested , and thrown into jail .
Game over .
Step 16 : The Senate falls in line , and passes a health care bill that includes a government - funded co-op and no public option .
The House passes a bill with a public option .
A conference begins .
If you think this is plausible , go to step 17 .
If you think the Senate wo n't fall in line and wo n't pass a bill , go to step 20 .
Step 17 .
Stalemate in conference .
If you think the conference bill is reported out WITH a public option , go to step 24 .
If you think the conference bill is reported out without a public option , go to step 25 .
Step 20 : Health care is scrapped for the year .
If you agree with James Carville that the Democrats should punish the Republicans for killing it , go to step 21 .
If you think the Democrats should punish the Democrats for killing it , go to step 22 .
If you think the Democrats ought to remain mute , go to step 22 .
Step 21 : This works .
Go to step 40 .
This does n't work .
Go to step 23 .
Step 22 : In January of 2010 , The Democrats try again .
If it works this time , go to Step 16 .
If it does not , go to step 23
Step 23 : Democrats are wiped out in the election of 2010 , . having no accomplishment to show for it .
If you think this is a likely scenario , go to Charlie Cook 's symposiums .
If you do n't , turn on MSNBC .
Game over .
Go to Step 61 .
Step 24 : The House and Senate pass a bill with a public option .
Obama has won .
Go to Step 61 .
Step 25 : If you think House liberals will cave , having been sufficiently , ah , induced , by the White House , go to step 26 .
If you think they will hold , go to step 27 .
If you think the Senate Democrats wo n't support the conference report with a public option , go to step 27 .
Step 26 .
Go to step 24 .
Step 27 : If you think that a permanent stalemate arises , go to step 20 .
If you think that a third way compromise can be reached , go to step 28 .
Step 28 : A third way compromise is reached .
If you think that the House and Senate manage to pass a bill and that Obama will get credit by the American people and his base for health care reform , go to step 29 .
If you think that Obama 's " win " will be seen as a loss , go to step 30 .
Step 29 : Obama , brimming with confidence , ends the year with high approval ratings again .
Democrats , sensing the popularity of the president and his bill , have something to run on in 2010 .
Go to step 40 .
Step 30 .
You convene a conference to figure out what Obama should do in 2010 in order to cast his first year and a half as a success .
Public opinion gradually softens over time , and Obama 's approval rating creeps up .
If you think it will creep up , go to step 40 .
If not , go to step 32 .
Step 32 : 2010 opens with Republicans and Democrats on an even footing , but President Obama has lost much of his luster , and struggles to regain the magic .
His experiment at political reform -- the Obama project -- has failed .
Obama decides to govern as an unreconstructed liberal .
If you think this is a plausible scenario , e-mail me .
If not , you recruit Joe Lockhart and Joel Johnson to take over the White House .
Go to Step 61 .
Step 33 : If you believe that reform ain't worth the paper it 's printed on unless it changes the health care system to single papyer , go to step 34 .
If you agree that the consumer protections are worth having , even if the rest of the bill totally sucks , go to step 4 .
Step 34 .
The bus to Canada has plenty of open seats .
Game over .
Go to Step 61 .
Step 35 .
If the Senate parliamentarian is skeptical , go to step 8 .
If the Senate parliamentarian lets you wind up with a pretty good bill , many provisions sunset within five years , and you 're consistently fighting an implementation battle with Republicans .
Go to Step 61 .
Step 40 : Democrats lose , at most , a few seats in the House and one or two in the Senate .
It 's possible that they pick up seats in both chambers .
Step 50 : You have private health insurance .
You develop pancreatic cancer .
Your health insurer wo n't pay for experimental treatments .
Go to Step 51 .
You have Medicare .
You develop pancreatic cancer .
Treatment is available , but you wo n't get it for several months .
Go to Step 51 .
Step 51 : You decide that the health care system is broken and needs reform .
Go to step 2 .
Step 54 : You are probably a Republican , or a conservative independent , or a libertarian .
Step 61 : Turns out that the White House underestimated costs .
Congress approves emergency supplemental of $ 500 - billion and raises Debt Ceiling to $ 14.5 - trillion .

OPINION / ANALYSIS
There is no area in which Republicans have further strayed from our traditions than in foreign affairs .
Generations of conservatives followed the great advice of our Founding Fathers and pursued a restrained foreign policy that rebuffed entangling alliances and advised America , in the words of John Quincy Adams , not to “ go abroad looking for dragons to slay . ”
Sen . Robert Taft , the stalwart of the Old Right , urged America to stay out of NATO .
Dwight Eisenhower was elected on a platform promising to get us out of the conflict in Korea .
Richard Nixon promised to end the war in Vietnam .
Republicans were highly critical of Bill Clinton for his adventurism in Somalia and Kosovo .
As recently as 2000 , George W. Bush campaigned on a “ humbler ” foreign policy and decried nation - building .
But our foreign policy today looks starkly different .
Neoconservatives who have come to power in both the Democratic and Republican parties argue that the U.S. must ether confront every evil in every corner of the globe or risk danger at home .
We need to “ fight them over there ” they say , so we do n’t have to “ fight them over here . ”
This argument presents a false choice .
We do not have to pick between interventionism and vulnerability .
The complexity of our world is exactly why the lessons of our past should ring true and demand a return to a traditional , pro-American foreign policy : one of nonintervention .
Moving forward , I suggest that we as Americans adhere to these five principles :
1 . We do not abdicate American sovereignty to global institutions .
The purpose of the United States is to protect the liberty of the American people .
We should never allow the WTO , NAFTA , the U.N. or the Law of the Sea Treaty to transfer power from America to an international body .
2 . We provide a strong national defense , but we do not police the world .
America should be armed with defensive weapons capable of repelling any attack .
We should spend all appropriate money to make sure that no country in world can credibly threaten us .
Unfortunately , our foreign policy is undermining our security .
We have more than 700 military installations in 135 countries around the globe .
We have 50,000 troops in Germany , 30,000 in Japan , and 25,000 in South Korea .
Worse , we have our brave men and women bogged down occupying Iraq and Afghanistan in the midst of ethnic strife and civil war .
We spend more than $ 1 trillion per year on our foreign policy , and our military is stretched thin .
We can no longer afford to be the world ’s policeman .
We must bring our troops home from around the world , cut overseas spending and strengthen our national defense .
3 . We obey the Constitution and follow the rule of law .
The Constitution clearly states that only Congress can declare war .
Congress abandoned that responsibility during the buildup to the Iraq war and must never make that mistake again .
When wars are undeclared , they drag on with no clear plan or exit strategy .
If we must fight , we should do so with overwhelming force , win as quickly as possible and promptly withdraw .
4 . We do not engage in nation - building .
Conservatives know government is a poor tool to solve problems .
It then makes no sense that we would think that our government could build civil societies and solve the tremendously complex problems of a developing country .
Nation - building does not work .
It places a tremendous burden on our military and takes directly from the pockets of the American taxpayer .
The best thing we as Americans can do is offer friendship while setting a good example of what a free and prosperous society looks like .
Ronald Reagan wanted America to be a “ shining city on the hill . ”
We should make that our goal .
5 . We stay out of the internal affairs of other nations .
America should conduct trade , travel and diplomacy with all willing nations .
Intervention , however , always has unintended consequences and almost always gets us in trouble .
For example , in 1953 , our CIA helped overthrow Mohammad Mosaddeq , the democratically elected prime minister of Iran and installed the Shah of Iran , a ruthless dictator .
The blowback from our actions was in large part responsible for the extremist Iranian Revolution of 1979 , the taking of our hostages and the many problems we have had with Iran ever since .
So much of our intervention makes no sense .
We backed Saddam Hussein for much of the 1980s , and then twice went to war against him .
In the 1990s , we bribed North Korea not to pursue atomic weapons with nuclear technology , and Kim Jong - il used that assistance to build several nuclear bombs .
Intervention simply does not serve our long - term interests .
The world is a dangerous place and we should be concerned , but intervention and militarism cannot solve our problems .
The answers to our foreign policy problems lie in defending our soil , scaling back our global military footprint and trading with all willing partners .
We have strayed far from this philosophy , but we can get back on track by looking to our Constitution , our traditions and the example of our Founding Fathers .
Ron Paul , a Pittsburgh - born obstetrician and Republican House member from Texas , campaigned for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination on a limited - government platform .

In many legislatures , including Oklahoma ’s , the concerns of such scientists have made little impression .
Concerns About New Rules
In February , five months after the accident that killed Ms. Doyle , Sue Tibbs was in Tulsa undergoing one of her regular seven - hour chemotherapy treatments for ovarian cancer .
As an Oklahoma state representative , Ms. Tibbs was finishing a bill to require hands - free devices for drivers and to ban texting while driving .
She had developed an interest in the issue last fall , after hearing about a growing number of crashes like the one involving Mr. Hill and Ms. Doyle , and after an Oklahoma state trooper told her he was increasingly concerned about multitasking behind the wheel .
As Ms. Tibbs sat in the cancer center , she overheard a conversation that sealed her resolve .
A woman nearby talked of how her husband often became so engrossed in his cellphone calls he would miss the turn for the road to their home .
The cellphone , Ms. Tibbs decided , is n’t like other distractions .
“ When you ’re eating , you ’re not concentrating like when you ’re on the cellphone , ” she said .
On Feb. 19 , the public safety committee voted 8 to 4 to send Ms. Tibbs ’s bill to the full legislature .
She was thrilled .
But on March 12 , the last day her bill could be considered , the majority floor leader , Mr. Jones , had n’t brought up her bill .
That night , she asked Mr. Jones , a fellow Republican , why .
He explained that there was too much opposition , she said .
Later , Ms. Tibbs said , he added another reason : she was fragile from cancer and he did n’t want her to go through a long - shot battle for the bill .
Mr. Jones , in an interview , said he and his colleagues needed more evidence of the dangers before they considered restricting the freedom to talk while driving .
“ We ’re concerned about going into the cellphone realm at this point , ” he said , adding that he was not lobbied by any companies that make money from the use of devices in cars .
But he said he recognized from using his phone while driving that it could be dangerous , particularly when dialing .
“ There ’s definitely a time when you ’re looking at your cellphone , ” said Mr. Jones , who uses a hands - free device .
“ If you ’re going to do it , you have to be extremely cautious . ”
جمعه، 2 مرداد 1388 / 24 ژوئيه 2009 ، ساعت 3 بعد از ظهر در مسلخ عشق جز نکو را نکشند شهادت محسن روح‌الاميني در « بالاترين » خبري تکان‌دهنده ديدم .
باورم نشد. به پدرش تلفن کردم .
پاسخ نمي‌داد .
به برادر بزرگش، محمد، تلفن کردم .
جواب نمي‌داد .
به عمويش، اسماعيل، تلفن کردم .
بغض‌آلود گفت : خبر صحت دارد .
من
نيز بغض کردم و گريستم .
خبر شهادت محسن روح الاميني در زندان اوين مرا تکان داد .
سخت گريستم .
مي‌دانم که خون محسن از خون ندا آقا سلطان و سهراب اعرابي و مسعود هاشم زاده و کيانو ش آسا و ديگران رنگين‌ت ر نيست؛ ولي چون مي‌شناختمش طبعاً بيش‌تر متأثر شدم .
دکتر روح الاميني، که دکتر داروساز و هم اکنون رئيس انستيتو پاستور است، و همسرش، خانم دکتر زهره حقيقي ،
از مفاخر علمي کشورند .
محمد، برادر محسن که سه چهار سالي از محسن بزرگ‌تر است، سال‌ها مسئول بسيج دانشجويي دانشگاه تهران بود .
نمي‌دانم در اين ساعت چهره هميشه خندان دکتر روح الاميني و محمد روح‌الاميني چگونه است .
فراموش نمي‌کنم آن روز را، در کوران نهمين انتخابات رياست‌جمهوري، که دکتر محسن رضايي، دوست و يار قديمي دکتر روح‌الاميني، از نامزدي رياست‌جمهوري منصرف شد .
دکتر روح‌الاميني در شيراز ميهمان ما بود .
اح مدي‌نژاد به دکتر روح الاميني تلفن کرد و شنيدم که خواهش و تمنا مي‌کرد رضايي اطلاعيه بدهد که به سود احمدي‌نژاد انصراف مي‌دهد .
البته محسن رضايي نپذيرفت .
آن زمان، چه کسي مي‌توانست تصوّر کند روزي را که محسن ، پسر دکتر روح‌الاميني، قرباني صعود شوم احمدي‌نژاد شود .
چه کسي باور مي‌کرد روزي محسن روح‌الاميني را در اوين خواهند کشت؟ چه کسي باور مي‌کند محسن، و ده‌ها مانند محسن ، به اين سادگي قرباني موج جهل و جنوني شوند که گروهي مجهول‌الهويه ايجاد کرده‌اند .
شهادت محسن روح‌الاميني، و همه شهداي راه جنبش نوزايي ايران اسلامي، را به جناب آقاي دکتر عبدالحسين روح‌الاميني، سرکار خانم دکتر زهره حقيقي، مهندس محمد روح‌الاميني و خاندان محترم ايشان تسليت مي‌گويم .
در مسلخ عشق جز نکو را نکشند
روبه صفتان زشت خو را نکشند
گر عاشق صادقي ز مردن نهرا س
مردار شود هر آن که او را نکشند شهيد محسن روح الاميني دکتر عبدالحسين روح الاميني و پدرهمسر ايشان ( عکس از عبدالله شهبازي ) سه‌شنبه 30 تير 1388 / 21 ژوئيه 2009 ، ساعت 10:30 بعد از ظهر « نهان‌پيشه‌گان » : تأسيس انکيزيسيون و فروپاشي مسيحيت در يادداشت پيشين [ 1 ] درباره « نهان‌پيشه‌گان » سخن گفتم و وعده دادم اين بحث را ادامه دهم .
اينک يادداشت دوّم در اين زمينه : منظورم از « نهان‌پيشه‌گان » کساني است که با استتار هوّيت واقعي سياسي خود، و نماياندن خويش به گونه ديگر، به درون سازمان يا حکومت يا فرقه و دين و آئيني « نفوذ » مي‌کنند، به‌ تدريج خود را برمي‌کشند و با تأثير بر آن مجموعه يا آن را به سمت اهداف مطلوب خويش هدايت مي‌کنند يا آن را از درون فرومي‌پاشند .
همان‌گونه که گفتم، اين رويه از ديرباز از سوي برخي يهوديان، که ايشان را « يهوديان مخفي » مي‌خوانند، مرسوم بوده است.
درباره نفوذ « يهوديان مخفي » در مسيحيت و تأثيرات بزرگ آن بر دين فوق پژوهش‌هاي فراوان انجام گرفته. در « زرسالاران » در اين باره به تفصيل سخن گفته‎ ام .
از جمله، نوشتم که بنيانگذاران انکيزيسيون اسپانيا و پرتغال « مسيحي جديد » New Christian بودند يعني يهودياني که خود يا يکي دو نسل پيش به مسيحيت گرويدند با هدف تخريب و فروپاشيدن مسيحيت .
در مقابل اينان، يهودياني را نيز داشتيم که از سر صدق به مسيحيت گرويدند مانند آبنر برغشي .
م نابع يهودي گروه نخست را از زمره « يهوديان مخفي » مي‌خوانند و گروه دوّم را « مرتدين » مي‌نامند .
در « زرسالاران » درباره آبنر و « مرتدين يهودي » چنين نوشتم : در شبه جزيره ايبري، موج " ارتداد " ، يعني گروش واقعي يهوديان به مسيحيت ، از نيمه اول سده چهاردهم ميلادي و با آبنر برغشي ( 1270 - 1340 ) آغاز شد.
آبنر يک طبيب يهودي ساکن شهر مسيحي‌نشين بورگس ( برغش ) ، پايتخت دولت کاستيل، بود .
در سده سيزدهم ميلادي بورگس پرجمعيت‌ترين مرکز يهودي‌نشين کاستيل شمالي به‏شمار مي‌رفت و در آن 120 تا 150 خانوار يهودي مي‌زيستند .
آبنر از جواني به تشکيک در مباني يهوديت پرداخت، به مدت 25 سال با حاخام‌هاي يهودي، که مي‌کوشيدند " ايمان " او را بازگردانند، دست و پنجه نرم کرد تا سرانجام در 50 سالگي رسماً مسيحي شد .
او از آن پس تکاپويي سخت را عليه يهوديت آغاز کرد؛ شاگرداني تربي ت
نمود و رساله‌هاي به زبان عبري نوشت و در ميان يهوديان توزيع نمود .
آبنر را در زمره نخستين " مرتدان يهودي " مي‌شمرند که عقايد جديد و علل " ارتداد " خود را مدون و سامان‌مند کرد و به ديگران ارائه داد .
آبنر نيز، چون عنان بن داوود بنيانگذار فرقه قرائي، با سياست انزواطلبانه اليگارشي يهودي و تبديل جوامع يهودي به جزايري محصور و بسته در درون جوامع ميزبان به شدت مخالف بود .
دائرةالمعارف يهود مي‌نويسد آبنر با شور و حدت خواستار پايان دادن به " خودگراني " يهوديان و انحلال سازمان‌هاي
آنان بود و مي‌گفت تا زماني که يهوديان چنين ساختاري دارند و تابع گروهي‌ از حاخام‌ها و روسا هستند، « موجوداتي پست و خشن که چون شاهان فرمان مي‌رانند » ، مسيح ظهور نخواهد کرد .
چ نان‌که خواهيم ديد، اين اعتراض در سده هفدهم با اسپينوزا سر برکشيد و در سده نوزدهم جنبش هاسکالا [ روشنگري يهودي ] را پديد ساخت .
در « زرسالاران » نقش بزرگ « يهوديان مخفي » را در تأسيس محکمه تفتيش عقايد ( انکيزيسيون ) تبيين نموده‌ام .
اين محکمه بزرگ‌ترين
نقش را در بدنام کردن مسيحيت ايفا نمود و تا به امروز به عنوان بارزترين
نماد ستم کليساي رم در اوج اقتدار آن شناخته مي‌شود .
نوشتم که قربانيان انکيزيسيون در واقع سه گروه بودند : مسلمانان شبه‌ جزيره ايبري ( مورها ) ، مرتدين يهودي، و قرائيون : * تکاپوي قرائيون در شبه جزيره ايبري
از اواخر سده يازدهم ميلادي آغاز شد .
برخي رهبران قرائي، چون ابوالفرج و سعيد بن الطراس، به اين سرزمين رفتند و تبليغ خود را آغاز کردند .
پايگاه آنان در اندلس اسلامي بود ولي پيرواني در کاستيل مسيحي نيز يافتند .
گروش يهوديان فرودست کاستيل به قرائيون چشمگير بود و پديده‌اي جدي و خطرناک تلقي مي‌شد زيرا اليگارشي يهودي کاستيل حکمرانان مسيحي را به سرکوب و اخراج آنان ترغيب کرد . پس از مرگ سعيد بن الطراس، زنش، که به « معلمه » شهرت داشت ، کار او را دنبال نمود .
خطر قرائيون براي اليگارشي زرسالار يهودي چنان بود که يهودا هالوي، متفکر بزرگ يهودي، کتاب « خزري » خود را براي مقابله نظري با آنان تدوين کرد .
ابراهيم بن داوود قرطبه‌اي، متفکر ديگر يهودي، کتاب معروف خود به ‏نام « سِفر قباله » را در دفاع از تاريخ حاخاميم يهودي و عليه قرائيون نوشت .
ابن‌ميمون، بزرگ‌ترين فيلسوف يهودي، نيز در دوران اقامت در مصر مجادله‌هاي سخت با قرائيون داشت .
مقابله با قرائيون تنها به مجادلات نظري محدود نبود .
ما حداقل در دو نمونه مي‌دانيم که يوسف فريزوئل ( نيمه اول سده يازدهم ) و تودروس ابولافي ( نيمه اول سده سيزدهم ) ، رهبران يهودي اسپانيا، برخوردي خشن و سرکوب‌گرانه با قرائيون داشتند .
شدت عمل فريزوئل، وزير مقتدر آلفونسوي ششم، با قرائيون چنان بود که ابراهيم بن داوود، به ‏رغم مخالفتش با قرائيون ،
از سلوک « بي‌رحمانه » و « مقابله ش ديد » فريزوئل با آنان ياد کرده و اشاره نموده است که وي ايشان را از سراسر سرزمين کاستيل اخراج کرد .
ابن‌داوود، فريزوئل را به سبب خشونتش در اين زمينه نکوهش مي‌کند .
تودروس ابولافي نيز « به شدت مخالف قرائيون » بود و با آنان برخوردي خشن و سرکوبگرانه داشت .
تأسيس انکيزيسيون به‏ وسيله « يهوديان نوکيش » و در زمان اقتدار اليگارشي يهودي- مارانو در دربار حکمرانان مسيحي اسپانيا و پرتغال مي‌توانست حربه‌اي مناسب براي سرکوب " مرتدين " يهودي و قرائيون نيز باشد .
تأسيس محکمه تفتيش عقايد زمينه‌چيني‏ ها و تمهيدات مفصلي را در پشت داشت .
از اين ميان به‏ ويژه بايد به کتاب کشيش اسپيناي يهودي‌الاصل اشاره کرد که در سال 1460 ميلادي منتشر شد و در آن « سنگرهاي ايمان » را در معرض تهاجم و فروپاشي معرفي مي‌کرد و توجه پاپ را به اين « خطر » معطوف مي‌داشت .
اين در حالي است که کشيشاني نامدار چون آلفونسو کارتاژنا ( 1384 - 1456 ) در رساله‌هاي خود، چون « دفاع از وحدت مسيحيت » ، مخالفت خويش را با تفتيش عقايد بيان داشتند؛ ولي راه به جايي نبردند .
آلفونسو کارتاژنا فرزند يک يهودي ساکن شهر بورگس است به ‏نام پابلو سانتا ماريا ( 1350 - 1435 ) که در سال 1390 به مسيحيت گرويد .
او در زمره کساني جاي دارد که منابع يهودي از ايشان با عنوان « مرتد » ، apostate نه « مارانو » [ يهو دي مخفي ] ، ياد مي‌کنند .
سانتا ماريا با متون ديني يهودي و مسيحي و اسلامي آشنايي وسيع داشت .
او مورد توجه پاپ بنديکت سيزدهم قرار گرفت، در زمره نزديکان او جاي گرفت و به سرعت در دستگاه کليسا رشد کرد .
از سال 1403 اسقف شهر کارتاژنا و از 1415 تا زمان مرگ اسقف شهر مهم بورگس بود .
پاپ سيکستوس چهارم، کسي که فرمان تأسيس انکيزيسيون را صادر کرد، نيز " ضد يهودي " نبود .
به عکس، به تعبير دائرةالمعارف يهود، او « پاپ عصر رنسانس » بود و بيانگر دوراني که « روح رنسانس در رم پيروز شده بود . » در اين زمان، برخلاف تصور رايج، رابطه پاپ و دستگاه کليسا با يهوديان بسيار دوستانه گزارش شده است؛ تا بدان حد که پاپ « با يهوديان رابطه شخصي ن زديک داشت . » او يهوديان را در کتابخانه واتيکان و
نيز به عنوان پزشک شخصي خويش به کار گرفت و حتي زماني که سخت بيمار شد پزشکان يهودي خون او را عوض کردند .
در نيمه اول سده شانزدهم، رابطه حسنه اليگارشي يهودي با پاپ‌ها اوج گرفت و اين در زماني است که از دوران لئوي دهم ( 1513 - 1521 ) اعضاي خاندان مديچي به مقام پاپي رسيدند .
کلمنت هفتم ( 1523-1534 ) ،
از خاندان مديچي، بيش از اسلاف خود با يهوديان رابطه دوستانه داشت تا بدانجا که به هواداري از يهوديان شهرت يافت .
در زمان او بود که ديويد روبني و سولومون مولخو " ظهور " کردند .
پاپ با آنان رابطه نزديک و دوستانه برقرار نمود .
پاپ جوليوس سوم ( 1550 - 1555 ) ،
از خاندان مديچي، نيز با يهوديان رابطه شخصي دوستانه داشت و پزشک مخصوص او، به ‏نام آماتوس لوسيتانوس، يهودي بود .
از نيمه دوم سده شانزدهم، با صعود خاندان کتخومنس، رابطه پاپ با يهوديان تيره شد .
در سال 1567 پاپ پيوس پنجم ( 1566 - 1572 ) طي فرماني رباخواري را ممنوع اعلام کرد .
از سال 1585 رابطه پاپ‌ها با يهوديان مجدداً حسنه شد و يهوديان ، از جمله يکي از اعضاي خاندان لوپز ، بار ديگر به دستگاه پاپ راه يافتند .
در زمان کلمنت دوازدهم ( 1730 - 1740 ) اين رابطه مجدداً تيره شد و پس از او باز حسنه شد .
از اواخر سده هيجدهم، از زمان پيوس ششم ( 1775 - 1795 ) ، رابطه پاپ با اليگارشي يهودي به تيرگي گراييد .
در اوايل سده نوزدهم، لئو دوازدهم ( 1823 - 1829 ) به مقابله شديد با يهوديان برخاست .
اين وضع تا سال 1846 ادامه داشت .
از آن پس تا اواخر دهه 1870 رابطه حسنه بود .
در اين زمان لئو سيزدهم ( 1878 - 1903 ) به مقابله با يهوديان برخاست و در سال 1892 آنان را به همدستي با فراماسون ها و مشارکت در توطئه‌هاي ايشان متهم کرد .
چ نان‌که مي‌بينيم، رابطه يهوديان و دستگاه پاپ در رم سيري پر فراز و نشيب داشته است.
محکمه تفتيش عقايد در سپتامبر 1480 در شهر اشبيليه ( سويل ) آغاز به کار کرد که يک کانون مهم مسلمان‌نشين به ‏شمار مي‏رفت .
در سال 1486 ، آلفونسو دلا کاوالريا، از خاندان يهودي لاوي و وزير مقتدر فرديناند، محکمه تفتيش عقايد ( انکيزيسيون ) را در بارسلونا بر پا کرد .
دائرةالمعارف يهود پس از ذکر اين مطلب به‌طور مشروح درباره رابطه دوستانه او با يهوديان سخن مي‌گويد .
معني اين شيوه نگارش دقيقاً آن است که خوانندگان يهودي اشتباه نکنند و دريابند که او انکيزيسيون را براي پيگرد مسلمانان و مخالفين اليگارشي يهودي تشکيل داد .
از آن پس، انکيزيسيون يک نهاد رسمي کليسايي تلقي مي‌شد که مشروعيت خود را از پاپ مي‌گرفت و بدنامي آن نيز به‏ نام کليساي رم تمام مي‌شد .
ولي واقعيت اين است که انکيزيسيون تنها يک نهاد سياسي در خدمت اليگارشي غارتگر شبه جزيره ايبري بود و پوشش ديني آن رياکاري‌ بيش نبود .
هدايت دستگاه انکيزيسيون با اعضاي خاندان‌هاي يهودي بود که اينک مسيحيان متعصب مي‌نمودند : توماس تورکوئه‌مدا، دادستان کل انکيزيسيون در سراسر اسپانيا ( 1483 - 1494 ) و ديه‌گو دزا، دادستان بعدي، هر دو يهودي‌الاصل بودند .
در سال 1507 کاردينال فرانسيسکو خيمنس ( 1436 - 1517 ) دادستان کل انکيزيسيون شد و تا زمان مرگ در اين سمت ماند .
او همان اسقف پيشين طليطله است که پس از فتح غرناطه [ گرانادا ] به عنوان حکمران اين شهر منصوب شد و کتابسوزان و کشتار عظيمي به راه انداخت .
تعداد کساني که در دوران رياست او بر انکيزيسيون سوزانيده شدند 2500 نفر گزارش شده است.
دائرةالمعارف يهود
نام او را به عنوان غير يهودي مشخص کرده ولي افزوده است که در سال 1509 به کمک يهوديان براي « توسعه مسيحيت » به شمال آفريقا لشکر کشيد و منطقه اوران را مدتي کوتاه به اشغال درآورد .
اين بيانگر پيوند نزديک کاردينال خيمنس با اليگارشي يهودي است .
نام خاندان خيمنس مکرر در زمره شرکاي اصلي خاندان يهودي- مارانوي مندس به ثبت رسيده است.
در اواخر سده هيجدهم و اوايل سده نوزدهم، خانواده‌اي به‏ نام خيمنس را در انگلستان مي‌يابيم که يهودي‌اند .
سِر موريس خيمنس ( 1763 -1837 ) ، که نام يهودي او موسس ( موسي ) است، از زرسالاران مهم انگليس بود و از سرمايه‌گذاران اصلي در " تجارت " [ برده ] سواحل غرب آفريقا .
او مسيحي شد. برادرش به‏ نام سِر ديويد خيمنس ( 1777 - 1848 ) )
نيز مسيحي شد، به ارتش انگليس پيوست و به درجه ژنرالي رسيد .
قربانيان مارانو - يهودي انکيزيسيون چه تعداد بودند؟ شمار کليه کساني که در محاکم تفتيش عقايد اسپانيا به قتل رسيدند، در بيش‌ترين برآوردها 31912 ن فر ذکر شده است .
برخي محققين اين رقم را گزافه مي‌دانند و تعداد قربانيان را طي سال‏هاي 1480 - 1758 ، يعني در يک دوره طولاني 278 ساله، تنها چهار هزا ر
نفر ذکر مي‌کنند .
دائرةالمعارف يهود، که مقاله‌اي مفصل در 13 صفحه به « انکيزيسيون » اختصاص داده، تعداد کل مقتولين به دست محاکم تفتيش عقايد اسپانيا را، از آغاز تا سال 1808 ، 31912 نفر ( بالاترين رقم ) ذکر کرده است .
شمار مقتولين محاکم پرتغالي
از آغاز تا سده هيجدهم 1175 نفر ذکر شده است .
دائرةالمعارف آمريکانا تعداد کساني را که به فرمان محاکم انکيزيسيون در سال‏هاي تصدي تورکوئه‌مدا به قتل رسيدند دو هزار نفر مي‌داند .
ما نمي‌دانيم از اين قربانيان چه تعداد « مارانو » ( يهودي ) بودند و چه تعداد « مور » ( مسلمان ) .
دائرةالمعارف يهود تنها به قربانيان مسلمان محاکم تفتيش عقايد اشاره‌اي گذرا کرده است بي‌آنکه تلاشي براي تعيين شمار يهوديان به عمل آورد .
اگر شمار قربانيان مسلمان و يهودي را به همان نسبت جمعيت مسلمانان و يهوديان شبه جزيره ايبري بدانيم و جمعيت مسلمانان را کمترين رقم ( سه ميليون ن فر ) و يهوديان را بيشترين رقم ( 330 هزار نفر ) محاسبه کنيم؛ نسبت قربانيان يهودي و مسلمان انکيزيسيون يک به ده است .
اين روش علمي نيست؛ زيرا هم نسبت مسلمانان بسيار بيشتر بود ( براي نمونه، شهر غرناطه در زمان سقوط 500 هزا ر
نفر جمعيت داشت که تنها 20 هزار نفرشان يهودي بودند .
اين انبوه‌ترين يا از انبوه‌ترين جوامع يهودي شبه ج زيره ايبري در آن زمان است . ) و هم، به گمان ما، تنها آن يهودياني مورد پيگرد انکيزيسيون قرار گرفتند که در زمره مخالفين اليگارشي يهودي جاي داشتند .
اينان " مرتدان يهودي " و " قرائيون " يا کساني بودند که به هر دليل طعمه مخالفين قدرتمند خود مي‌شدند و در رقابت‌هاي مالي و سياسي جان مي‌باختند .
بهرروي، باز بي‌هيچ دليل، بالاترين برآوردها از شمار قربانيان محاکم انکيزيسيون را مي‌پذيريم و فرض را بر آن مي‌گذاريم که ادعاي تاريخنگاري يهود صحت دارد و به راستي « مارانوها » آماج پيگرد انکيزيسيون بودند .
در اين‏صورت نيز درمي‌يابيم که شمار مارانو - يهوديان قرباني نمي‌تواند فرات ر از سه چهار هزار تن باشد .
اين به راستي هجو تاريخ است؛ و شايد به همين دليل است که مورخين دانشگاه عبري اورشليم، به‏ رغم نگارش سه صفحه درباره انکيزيسيون و به ‏رغم دقتي که در سراس ر کتاب خود در ذکر ارقام داشته‌اند، درباره شمار کشته‌ شدگان يهودي در محاکم تفتيش عقايد سکوت کرده‌اند .
* قرائيون Karaites شاخه‌اي است از يهوديت که بنيانگذار آن عنان بن داوود بود .
ع نان در حوالي سال‏هاي 135-159 ق./ 754-775 م.، مقارن با خلافت منصور عباسي، مي‌زيست و ساکن بغداد بود .
پيروان او در آغاز به « عنانيه » شهرت داشتند و سپس قرائيون نام گرفتند .
يهوديان به آنان « بني‌ مقرأ » يا « بيله مقرأ » ( طايفه مقرأ ) مي‌گفتند .
« مقرأ » به معني کتاب مقدس است .
علت آن است که ايشان تنها منبع شناخت و سلوک ديني را متون اصيل و اوليه ديني مي‌دانستند و منکر سنن شفاهي بودند که حاخاميم يهودي در سده‌هاي اخير رواج داده بود .
طبق مندرجات منابع قرائي، حاخام‌ها ابتدا کوشيدند تا عنان را با خود همراه کنند ولي موفق نشدند .
سپس، عنان به دستور منصور ( قاعدتاً با دسيسه سران يهودي ) زنداني شد.
ابوحنيفه او را راهنمايي کرد که در برابر خليفه از تشابه عقايد خود با اسلام سخن گويد و بدينسان بخشوده شد.
درواقع، عنان برخي نظريات خود را از اسلام گرفت و ظاهراً از ابوحنيفه متأثر بود .
او به ‏ويژه مخالفتي شديد با نظام بسته اجتماعي يهودي و منع رابطه با غير يهوديان ابراز مي‌داشت .
در نيمه دوم سده نهم ميلادي، مکتب عنان به ‏وسيله بنيامين بن موسي نهاوندي به صورت يک فرقه متنفذ درآمد .
نقش او در اين فرقه تا بدانجاست که در منابع عربي از آن به عنوان « اصحاب عنان و ب نيامين » ياد مي‌شود .
يکي از اقدامات بنيامين نهاوندي پيراستن مفهوم خداوند از موهومات انسانگونه‌پنداري رايج در ميان يهوديان و ارائه يک مفهوم انتزاعي از خ داوند بود.
در سده‌هاي هشتم تا يازدهم ميلادي، کانون تکاپوي قرائيون در شبه جزيره عربستان بود و
از آن پس در ميان يهوديان آسياي صغير نيز گسترش يافت .
قرائيون تا زمان پيدايش جنبش اروپايي هاسکالا در سده نوزدهم ميلادي جدّي‌‌ترين تهديد براي اليگارشي حاخامي در ميان يهوديان به ‏شمار مي‌رفتند .
دائرةالمعارف يهود عمده‌ترين علت پيدايش جنبش قرائيون را « ظهور و گسترش اسلام و تبديل آن به يک دين جهاني و وخامت وضع اجتماعي و اقتصادي طبقات تهيدست يهودي » ذکر کرده است .
For the first time , scientists have managed to grow mature human eggs from immature cells in the lab , a technique that may eventually help save the fertility of female cancer patients who are n't eligible for traditional egg harvest .
Researchers from Northwestern University took immature egg cells , encased in a protective sac called a follicle , from 14 women who wanted to preserve their fertility before undergoing chemotherapy .
By placing the cells in a unique three - dimensional growing environment for 30 days , the scientists coaxed the cells into becoming what appear to be healthy , functional human eggs .
" It is a major first , " said infertility expert Sherman Silber of St. Luke 's Hospital in St. Louis , who was not involved in the research .
" No one has yet tested the eggs by in - vitro fertilization and pregnancy , but they look quite normal and we are all excited about it . "
The traditional way to preserve a female cancer patient 's fertility is to surgically remove fully mature eggs from her ovary , fertilize the eggs immediately in the lab , and freeze the resulting embryos .
But since only one follicle matures each month for ovulation , that method requires two to six weeks of hormone therapy to generate enough mature eggs for harvest .
" The cancer patient usually does not have this much time to waste , " Silber said .
" And to give her any kind of assurance , you would have to put her through three to six or more such cycles to get enough eggs to be comfortable .
With ovary tissue freezing , we will get hundreds of thousands of eggs , and the patient can get a much greater measure of security for her future fertility . "
In addition , giving high doses of hormones is dangerous for patients with certain types of cancer , such as breast or ovarian tumors , and the traditional method wo n't work for girls who have n't gone through puberty .
If physicians could take immature ovarian follicles and grow them into eggs outside the body , they could skip the hormone step altogether .
Until now , however , no one has been able to grow human ovarian follicles in the lab .
Most previous attempts had involved trying to culture the cells in a two - dimensional environment , but it turns out that any kind of pressure on the egg cells inhibits their growth .
" Scientists had been putting them on a flat piece of plastic for years , " said fertility researcher Teresa Woodruff of Northwestern University , a co-author on the paper published Monday in Human Reproduction .
" When you do that , the cells around the egg begin to move away , and the connection between the egg and its supporting cells is lost . "
The supporting cells are critical , Woodruff said , because they provide the hormones and nutrients that the egg needs to grow .
To create the ideal growing environment for a follicle , the researchers collaborated with biomedical engineers who specialize in biomaterials .
" Our breakthrough was to use a hydrogel called alginate , which does n't touch or contact the follicle cells , but just supports them , " Woodruff said .
It turns out that the rigidity of the gel is crucial to follicle function :
If the gel is too stiff , the follicles start looking sick and making the wrong kind of hormones .
" We kind of lucked out in the very beginning in that we used a very soft gel , " she said .
After incubating the follicles for 30 days in the three - dimensional matrix , the researchers discovered that they had grown to the size of mature eggs and were producing all the right hormones , such as estrogen and progesterone , in the right quantities .
The true test of the lab - grown eggs will be to see if they can undergo a final stage of cell division to be ready for fertilization .
" We did it in a mouse and got it all the way to fertilization and live birth , " Woodruff said .
But regulations from the National Institutes of Health wo n't let scientists fertilize human eggs for research — the final step of the process must be done by physicians in an infertility clinic for a patient who 's ready to have a baby .
" The proof would be if they could fertilize the eggs in vitro and get babies out of it , " Silber said .
" But that 's an extra stage , and it 's amazing they 've got this far . "
" Ten years ago it was considered such an impossible task that we did n't think it would happen for another 50 years , " he said .
" The amazing thing is that it turned out to be much simpler than we ever dreamed . "

Obviously a neanderthal corner of my heart worries about some aspects of the coming feminisation .
Will we all become even more namby - pamby , elf - n - safety - conscious , regulation - prone and generally incapable of beating the Australians at anything than we already are ?
Hmm ?
And even if the feminist revolution is good and unstoppable ( and it is both ) , we should perhaps consider some of the downsides — and the most interesting is that greater equality between the sexes is actually leading to greater division between the classes .
Here 's how .
Schools are supposed to be safe havens for students .
But a Congressional report says they are doing a poor job of handling mental illness and other disabilities .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report , Use of restraints on public , private school students , was published May 19 and did n’t get much press .
But it shows that punishing restraints have been used on students by untrained personnel without approval of parents , and often with damaging results .
Investigators found hundreds of cases of abuse over the last decade .
They noted that there are no federal laws focusing specifically on this problem , and state laws vary widely .
“ Although GAO continues to receive new allegations from parents and advocacy groups , GAO could not find a single Web site , federal agency , or other entity that collects information on the use of these methods or the extent of their alleged abuse , ” the report added .
Investigators cited these examples :
– A 14 - year - old boy in a Texas public school , diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder was placed facedown on the floor , with the teacher on top of him , because he did n’t stay seated in class .
The death was ruled a homicide , but the teacher was not indicted .
– A 4 - year - old West Virginia public school girl with autism and cerebral palsy was restrained in a wooden chair with leather straps , described as resembling a miniature electric chair , for being “ uncooperative . ”
Although the school board was found liable for negligent training and supervision , the teachers involved were not .
– A volunteer teacher ’s aide at a Florida school , on probation for burglary and cocaine possession , gagged and duct - taped children for misbehaving .
– In another case : “ A special education teacher at a public school was accused of using bungee cords and duct tape to fasten children as young as 5 years old to chairs designed to support kids with muscular difficulties .
According to parents , their children sustained injuries such as broken arms and bloody noses while in this teacher ’s class .
A teacher ’s aide told investigators that the woman used the restraints on a daily basis to punish the children . ”
The GAO report blamed untrained staff , particularly a lack of training in working with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities .
Several states track the use of seclusion and restraint .
During the 2007 -2008 school year in California , there were 14,300 cases , according to the July 3 issue of Psychiatric News .
In Texas , 4,202 students were restrained 18,741 times during the same school year .
The report was requested by U.S. Rep. George Miller of California .
“ What the GAO found is alarming and eye opening , and it is going to send shockwaves into every corner of this country , and it should , ” said Miller , chair of the House Education and Labor Committee .
Nineteen states have no laws addressing the use of restraints in schools .
Federal action was recommended .
Noah and the Whale were an English alternative / folk group formed in Twickenham , London in 2006 .
Their final line - up consisted of Charlie Fink ( vocals , guitar ) , Tom Hobden ( fiddle , keyboards ) , Matt " Urby Whale " Owens ( bass ) , Fred Abbott ( keyboards , guitar ) and Matthew Petulla ( drums ) .
Former members of the band include Doug Fink ( drums ) , Laura Marling ( vocals , guitar ) and Jack Hamson ( drums ) .
According to Songfacts , the band 's name is a combination of the title of one of their favorite films , The Squid and the Whale and Noah Baumbach , who directed the movie .

Some countries are smarter than others .
You can tell it in a million ways .
By the books people are buying .
By the conversations they 're having in their classrooms .
By the politicians they elect .
By the stories in their media .
By the laws they enact , their rates of crime , and how they treat their prisoners .
Some countries seem capable of creating sensible policy through intellectually honest debate .
Whereas in America and Great Britain , this has n't happened for decades .
Rather , our laws emerge from a haze of ignorance , apathy , and misdirection .
Why ?
It all goes back to Dr. Spock and the industrial revolution .
Let me explain .
In 1946 , Dr. Benjamin Spock wrote a book that would change the course of history .
His book , Baby and Child Care , became internationally famous for promoting the idea that when it comes to raising children , " you know more than you think you do . "
In other words , when it comes to raising your children you should follow your intuition .
This idea proved revolutionary , and remains the dominant advice from pediatricians to this day .
The only problem is that it 's completely wrong .
Think about it .
When deciding how much calcium to give your kids , would you just eyeball the container of Tums and pick an amount that feels right ?
Of course not .
And yet there are many other parenting best - practices that have been determined in exactly this way .
It 's not that parents were n't raising their children this way before .
They were , but since the 40's the wealth of scientific best practices have been largely ignored thanks to Spock 's influence .
Which brings us to the industrial revolution .
As it turns out , a person 's work environment affects much more than just their satisfaction at work .
It alters their intuition and perception , their rhythms and routines .
Parents naturally raise their children according to their intuition , and as farmers left the fields for the factories their intuition about how best to raise their children dramatically changed .
That is , factory workers began to raise their children using methods that echoed the way they were being managed in the workplace .
Sociologists have long suspected that , for example , children of factory workers would be implicitly taught that the best way to succeed was to keep your head down and obey authority .
And while this might in fact make them more likely to succeed in a factory , it would also stifle their chances of upward social mobility .
There is no doubt that the worldview parents impart on their children vastly affects their chances of future success .
But this is where the damage was thought to end .
Experts assumed that because the effect of parenting styles on cognitive , physical , and emotional development is less salient than with the example of calcium above , parenting styles did n't really matter .
It was all just a matter of preference .
And that while the children of factory workers may lack certain advantages , this could be largely ameliorated later given enough school intervention .
But thanks to modern early childhood development research , we now know that the effects of factory - style parenting are much more toxic than previously assumed .
For example , the research of Hart & Risley has shown that over half of the variance in a child ’s vocabulary at age 3 can be attributed to the ways in which a parent talks to their child , and the way parents talk to their children varies dramatically depending on socioeconomic status .
Specifically , they estimate that by age 4 the children of professional parents have been exposed to about 45 million words , whereas the children of welfare parents have been exposed to only about 13 million words .
Because of this by time children are 3 years old , parents in less economically favored circumstances have said fewer different words in their cumulative monthly vocabularies than the children in the most economically advantaged families in the same period of time .
" Even if we have overestimated by half the differences between children in amounts of cumulative experience the gap is so great by age 4 that the best that can be expected from education or intervention is to keep children from falling still farther behind .
For an intervention to keep an average welfare child 's experience equal in amount to that of an average work - class child would require that the chid be in substitute care comparable to the average professional home for 40 hours per week from birth onward . "
That is , already by pre-school the low - SES children are so far behind in language development that it is impossible for them to catch up .
Similarly , Hart & Risley found that the average child in a professional family was accumulating 32 affirmatives and 5 prohibitions per hour , a ratio of 6 encouragements to 1 discouragement .
The average child in a working - class family was accumulating 12 affirmatives and 7 prohibitions per hour , a ratio of 2 encouragement to 1 discouragement .
The average child in in a welfare family , though , was accumulating 5 affirmatives and 11 prohibitions per hour , a ratio of 1 encouragement to 2 discouragements .
( For more on how language exposure and the ratio of encouragements to prohibitions affects childhood outcomes , c.f. Hart & Risley 's excellent book Meaningful Differences in the Everday Experience of Young American Children . )
There 's no especially good reason for low - SES parents to talk less with their children and use more prohibitions .
They 're just following Dr. Spock 's advice and raising their children according to their intuition .
Which , as it happens , is to manage their children the way their employers manage them at work .
Raising children like employees has benefits that are immediate and hugely salient , whereas the harms created are subtle and visible only in aggregate through statistical analysis .
These harms are longitudinal ; even as societies transition toward knowledge work , these flaws in parenting remain and reproduce themselves in future generations .
When figuring out how to raise their children , parents look to the way their parents raised them .
Parenting styles which caught on overnight may take hundreds of years to be displaced , because in each case the benefits are more salient than the drawbacks .
What 's more , as white - collar jobs have replaced factory work an entirely new set of parenting flaws has arisen .
Once again parents are raising their children according to their intuition , intuition which has been shaped and molded by their experience in the workplace .
Success as a white - collar worker largely means developing the skill of being chosen : for the soccer team , for college , for internships , employment , promotions , and so on .
This is the mindset underlying the methodology that high - SES parents adopt when raising their children .
Are these parenting practices good for a high schooler ?
Perhaps .
But when applied to infants they 're empirically damaging .
Many high - SES parents over - schedule and overstimulate their pre-k children in an attempt to impart an early educational advantage .
By depriving their children of time for self - directed play they may be undermining executive function , the best predictor of future success .
source
By forcing their children to read before they 're ready , they may well be robbing their children of intrinsic motivation to read and contributing to future alliteracy .
source
By letting their infants watch baby videos they are at worst contributing to future cognitive and behavioral problems , and at best dramatically decreasing their children 's rate of learning .
source
Again , these parenting practices stem largely from the intuitions parents pick up from their workplaces .
Compared with using intuition to decide how much calcium to give a child , using intuition to make decisions like how much TV to allow an infant to watch is equally absurd and equally damaging , but largely ignored because the intangibility makes these decisions less salient and seemingly less important .
You can't measure bad parenting in parts per million .
But the effects are just as real as lead poising , obesity , or thalidomide .
And as with factory workers , these parenting mistakes will be passed on long after these working environments are gone .
I do n't know why it is that certain countries seem so incapable of setting rational and coherent policy .
I 'm sure there are dozens of reasons .
But I suspect a good percentage of the problem stems from a series of specific parenting flaws largely attributable to parents raising their children with intuition acquired in the workplace .
The reason then that these social problems are most pervasive in countries like America and Great Britain is because these countries were the earliest and most extensively industrialized .
Every time we buy a cell phone , a flat screen TV , or anything produced in a factory , the damages are more than just the environmental contaminants and individual suffering .
Rather , we 're imposing a cultural shadow on ourselves , one which cripples our children and our children 's children .
This is a negative externality of the way we choose to structure society , a form of intellectual pollution far more harmful than anyone could have predicted .
This suggests a market opportunity for teaching parents to separate their parenting styles from the way they spend their day .
But what 's more , it suggests new modes of civic responsibility , and new answers to the age - old question of what it means to be a good person .

Cellphone customers gripe about being nickel - and - dimed to death by their wireless service providers .
But guess what happens when you put all those nickels and dimes together ?
You get a really huge chunk of change .
Since the beginning of the year , the four leading wireless companies -- Verizon , AT&T ; , Sprint Nextel and T - Mobile -- have quietly raised a monthly fee that each charges to recoup some of their business costs .
Taken individually , the fee hikes represent pocket change for most people .
AT&T ;'s fee in California , for example , is up by 40 cents a month ; Sprint ’s is 24 cents higher .
Advertisement
Combined , however , the wireless companies are looking at hundreds of millions of dollars in additional annual revenue .
And that ’s with no significant change in their service to customers .
“ We call these ‘ because they can ’ fees , ” said Michael Shames , executive director of the Utility Consumers ’ Action Network , a San Diego advocacy group .
“ Every household is struggling right now to pay bills , and these companies put the squeeze on because they can . ”
California T- Mobile customers received an insert with their latest bill informing them that the company ’s “ Regulatory Programs Fee ” has risen to $ 1.21 a month from 86 cents .
The company explained that the fee “ is not a tax but a fee we collect and retain to help us recover the costs associated with funding and complying with a variety of government mandates , programs and obligations . ”
Advertisement
In other words , T - Mobile is billing customers for its cost of following the government ’s rules -- rules that were put in place to make the company friendlier to customers .
Nice .
Better still , T - Mobile said that “ these programs and the costs of compliance vary over time , as do the costs that T - Mobile includes . ”
That ’s a nice way of ensuring that customers have no idea what they ’re paying for , or why , in any particular month .
A company spokeswoman declined to provide more detail about the rationale for the fee .

T- Mobile is by no means alone in this practice .
Virtually every wireless company does it .
In May , AT&T ; told cellphone customers that it was nearly doubling its “ Regulatory Cost Recovery Charge ” to 83 cents a month from 43 cents .
A company spokesman told me the increase was based on “ an extremely thorough analysis ” of AT&T ; 's regulatory costs , although he declined to comment on whether those costs had similarly doubled .
A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said she was unaware of any significant increase in the regulatory compliance costs of wireless companies operating in the state .
Even so , Verizon Wireless told California customers earlier this month that it was boosting its monthly “ Administrative Charge ” to 92 cents from 85 cents .
Sprint Nextel raised its own administrative charge in January to 99 cents monthly from 75 cents .
Advertisement
Those amounts sound puny -- which is how the phone companies want you to see them .
Even the most dubious fee appears more palatable when customers view it as just another handful of coins each month .
But look what happens when you do the math .
AT&T ; has about 78 million wireless customers nationwide .
An additional 40 cents per customer translates to $ 31 million a month in extra revenue , or $ 374 million a year .
But it ’s impossible to know exactly how much AT&T ; is pulling down .
Even though the company says all of its wireless customers experienced a fee hike , it says the amount charged varies from state to state .
Advertisement
A company spokesman declined to say how many customers AT&T ; has in each state or to provide a national average for the fee .
“ The total is definitely in the hundreds of millions of dollars , ” said Denise Mann , who oversees telecom matters for the PUC ’s Division of Ratepayer Advocates , the watchdog arm of the state regulatory agency .
“ But nobody knows how much exactly each of the companies makes from the fee , ” she said .
“ They deliberately hide the hard numbers .
All we know is that it ’s a lot of money . ”
Wireless companies are permitted by the Federal Communications Commission to pass along some of their business costs in the form of an additional fee .
The companies typically depict the fee as a normal part of the regulatory process .
Advertisement
“ It ’s not , ” Mann said .
“ It ’s just a fee they add for their routine business costs because they can get away with it .
“ It ’s as if you went to the dry cleaner and they charged you $ 1.50 for a shirt , but then they added another 35 cents for the starch . ”
Verizon Wireless has about 87 million customers nationwide .
Sprint has about 50 million .
T - Mobile about 33 million .
If each of the companies ’ customers experienced the same fee hike that California customers have swallowed -- and why would n’t they , California cellphone users might wonder -- the total amount of additional money raised annually would top $ 725 million .
Advertisement
Again , this is just gravy -- a big pile of money atop the even bigger pile of money raised through monthly service fees and other charges .
Is this legal ?
Apparently so .
Is it an honest way of dealing with customers ?
Hardly .
“ People should write their wireless carriers and ask for a justification of this fee and what the money is used for , ” advised Joel Kelsey , telecom policy analyst for Consumers Union .
Advertisement
Will that work ?
“ It ’s a good first step , ” Kelsey said .
After that , I ’d suggest going a step further .
Contact the FCC and ask why this fee is n’t more transparent , and why it ’s often such a challenge to decipher our cellphone bills .
The agency ’s e-mail address is fccinfo@fcc.gov .

Do you understand all the fees on your phone bill ?
Interviews → Tom Williams Hired by Apple at 14 .
I interviewed him for his full story .
Date : 2009 -07
I was recently in Vancouver Canada for a week , considering moving there , when my friend Ariel Hyatt said , “ You have to meet this amazing guy Tom Williams .
He got hired by Apple when he was only 14 .
I think the company had to , like , legally adopt him to do it .
He ’s a go - getter like you .
Plus his wife , Jessie is an awesome country artist . ”
I met Tom for dinner , loved his story , and wanted to share it with everyone .
Especially in this environment of 10 % - 25 % unemployment , his story and philosophy have some inspiring lessons about how to get a job or make huge deals despite a lack of experience .
So I recorded a phone call and let him tell his tale in his own words :
My mom calls this story my elaborate form of running away from home , except it does n’t have a stick and a kerchief with it .
I grew up in a very normal , middle class family in Victoria .
Very , very happy .
But I was n’t a very good student in school .
In fact I was a very rebellious learner .
I did n’t even take pen and paper to class .
I would interrupt my teachers .
I would question what they were teaching us .
Every parent - teacher interview was focused on having Tom be less disruptive , and a little bit more conformist .
And at the same time , my parents , in the summer break between 6th and 7th grade , announced that they were getting separated .
That really just devastated me .
Even though my parents were dealing with that relatively amicably , I was very distraught and quite upset .
I then realized I was quite powerless , and the solution was to find my own income .
I started out selling chocolate bars and quickly noticed I was the top seller in school .
However , I only got a Nintendo even though I sold about $ 2,000 worth of chocolate - covered almonds .
I realized I was getting kind of gypped , so I negotiated to be the direct retailer of this wholesale chocolate bar operation , basically usurping the school .
I had my dollar of chocolate and they had theirs .
My dad had to vouch that I would n’t just eat the inventory .
That summer I sold several thousand dollars worth of chocolate bars .
This was not some passive kid sitting outside the store , eyes down , hoping somebody would take pity .
I was literally walking backwards , chocolate bar in hand .
As somebody would walk by me , I ’d peddle my very refined spiel about how these chocolate bars were the world ’s best thing .
They were actually called World ’s Best Chocolate , from which I derived my sales pitch .
As a child I was horrible with math , even with the rudimentary .
In fact , I had to go to summer school once .
However , I understood when I was being taken advantage of and when I was in control .
With my first lemonade stand I realized I ’d have to actually spend money on Kool - Aid .
This meant I ’d have to spend the entire day selling at five or ten cents , ( which was the competitive going rate back then ) , or I ’d have to either steal the Kool - Aid pack , or figure out some way around this huge cost liability .
I managed to put up my sign in the local store , without help from my parents .
They were academics and bureaucrats , not in any way entrepreneurial .
For me , this thinking about what was a bad deal or a good deal was instinctive .
I was hard - wired from day one , always trying to make good deals .
I always relied on my own instincts .
I knew that if I wanted to get something done , I had to do it .
Nobody else was going to do it for me .
Nobody else was going to support me .
I did n’t expect to be supported .
I just knew I had to do it if I wanted to do it .
That ’s how I lived every aspect of my life .
Even when I was interested in bird - watching , I had a newsletter and charged a subscription to family and friends .
I was always constantly thinking about how to make money and generate revenue .
Using the proceeds of the chocolate bar sales , I rented an office in the same building as the local sales office for Apple in Victoria .
I would go to my office after school , not really having much to do but trying to build edutainment software on CD - ROM .
I even had an outsourced receptionist service .
This was the stepping stone .
It was clear to me that I wanted to try and short circuit life ’s path .
I did n’t want to stay in school until the 12th grade or at home .
I wanted to live on my own and be free .
I read John Sculley ’s biography , who was Apple ’s CEO at the time , and my hero .
As other kids had sports stars or actors , he was my hero .
I wanted to be him or be like him .
So I started calling Apple in the 7th grade .
Every single morning , at about 8:00 am before I went to school , I would call up the main Apple switchboard number , and ask for John Sculley ’s office , and they would put me to his assistant .
Every single morning I ’d be talking to Jerry , his assistant , and would start for the first few weeks with just my standard pitch .
I was taking the business development angle .
I ’m the CEO of my own company , which was called Desert Island Software , and he ’s the CEO of his company .
Let ’s have two CEOs talk to each other about how we can work together .
For the first few weeks I ’m sure Jerry thought that it was some kind of a prank or weirdo .
Eventually I started to be less reliant on the pitch and say , “ Hi , Jerry , how are you ? ”
This is the gatekeeper to somebody that is receiving a lot of unsolicited phone calls .
I think instinctively I realized that by building a relationship with Jerry , I was building a relationship with the gatekeeper .
If they like you and support you , that ’s really helpful .
Here I was , literally for about a year and a half , calling every single morning .
The relationship obviously evolved to “ Hey Jerry , what ’s going on with you ? ” and “ Oh , you know , school ’s tough this week Tom‚ ” blah blah blah .
In a parallel track , because I had rented this office , I was developing a relationship with the two local sales guys who at this point had taken an interest in me and who I would stop in on every single day .
They wrote e-mails , which somehow came in to Cupertino .
I think it was just a benevolent gesture .
Here was this kind of young , highly enthusiastic , but different than just a Mac fanatic guy that was trying to build a software company .
They were able to get me forwarded all the way up , back into John ’s office , Jerry and some other support staff .
There was now this loop of several people interested in helping me out and seeing my dream .
My dream was to meet John for five minutes , and then I just meet him , and pitch him in person .
I knew that If I was granted five minutes , I was going to be able to extend that into half hour , and that half hour would dictate or drive what would happen next .
Through many , many people ’s generosity at Apple , they had arranged to give me a free pass to the Worldwide Developers Conference , which I think the ticket price was about $ 1,500 for the whole week .
Because of the divorce , my mom and I were quite poor .
We had to actually borrow money from my grandmother , ( it always makes me verklempt to remember her generosity ) , to fly my mom and I down , May 1993 .
In fact the conference registration began on Sunday , which was May 15th .
I remember the date because it was Mother ’s Day , and my mom was thinking we ’d have a nice day to kind of celebrate it .
We went to one of the hotels near the convention center in San Jose , and I scarfed down my breakfast because I wanted to get my registration at Apple done right away .
There I was , registered , and greeted well .
People were like , “ Oh , well , we ’re expecting only one tiny kid from Canada at the conference . ”
They were expecting me , and John ’s PR person said , “ Okay , first thing in the morning , be here 7:30 , bright and early , and before he begins his keynote , you ’ll have your five minutes . ”
For me , this was the night before being able to walk on to the stadium and toss out the first pitch .
It was the pinnacle dream moment .
I could n’t sleep , my mind was racing with how I would spend these first five minutes to make an impression on him .
I knew from his books that he was a concept guy , and loved being able to come up with new ideas on the spot , new ways of positioning things .
I knew the rumors of what technologies were being introduced at the conference and what he was speaking at in the keynote .
I was really studying those technologies to come up with my own spin .
At the time it was actually the Newton that was being announced at the conference .
It commercially failed later , but was successful from an innovation perspective .
I had my own business cards that said , Tom Williams , CEO , Desert Island Software .
I met him and pitched him .
I said , “ Here ’s what I kind of think of the Newton .... ” I barfed out five minutes of stuff that I thought might be impressive to him .
That five minutes extended into a full half hour - up until minutes before he was being pulled away to give the keynote .
At the end we exchanged business cards .
He had two business cards , one that said “ Chief Listener ” and one that said “ CEO ” .
He gave me his CEO card because he was out of the other .
We promised to keep in touch .
At the conference , I was given VIP access .
I sat with all the vice presidents .
I was one of the first guys outside of Apple to actually be able to play with the Newton .
I was anointed as an interesting guy , and I met every vice president at the company that was there that week .
Three months after the conference , John left Apple .
He was booted out in a boardroom coup , and then he went into a company called Spectrum .
He stayed there very shortly .
It was a bit of a bad story .
As a consequence of leaving Apple , John actually had time to call me .
I remember the first phone call .
I ’d left my office , because my cash was running out from my chocolate bar sales .
At this time , I ’d left my office , and had my office in my bedroom in Victoria .
The phone was ringing in the upstairs bedroom .
I was downstairs and could hear it ringing .
I raced up , and it was John on the phone .
Because of networking deep at Worldwide Developers Conference that year , other executives at Apple and the engineering team on the QuickTime products team had organized to get me back to the conference , but this time as a speaker .
I was demonstrating a use of the QuickTime conferencing API that a developer friend of mine and I had mocked up .
In the QuickTime conferencing API you could build any interface on top of the basic function of video conferencing .
We built up this Star Trek - like communications interface .
It was visually appealing , met the geek quotient , and I was there to demo that .
Because of that demo , my brain , and Apple being a corporate culture , which at the time was kind of the dark era of Apple , I was getting hired .
We were just at the end of this first era of human capital and innovation , and so the people that were most respected on the campus were of course the engineers .
The engineers did n’t matter or care what you looked like , or what your educational background was .
You proved your mettle with them simply by virtue of interacting with them on the spot - what your brain was like in those conversations .
Even though I was a marketing guy , it was the engineering team , that on a Wednesday of WWDC , in 1994 , had offered me a job .
They said , “ We want you to come work with us ! ”
At the same time my school year was ending , and John and his wife were doing a CD - ROM multimedia startup of their own in San Francisco , where his son lived .
At this point John had become a regular mentor .
I ’d asked him to join my board of advisors to Desert Island Software , and he agreed .
He even sent me a letter that I had framed , acknowledging his acceptance to the advisory board .
My mom was comfortable with me coming down to live with his son and daughter - in - law for the summer to get some work experience .
At the same time , I was doing work experience , and going down to Cupertino once in a while trying to figure out , over the course of the summer , how I could take this invitation of work with them - become hired by them even though it was infringing upon child labor laws and immigration issues and so on .
What they eventually figured out was that if I was a consultant contracted by Apple through a Canadian company , the Canadian company would be responsible for any issues .
They were able to put the blame or liability elsewhere .
Now the problem was I could n’t even be a director of my own company because I was under 18 .
My mom , was reluctantly , very supportive of me but always worried about the downsides to my stability , childhood , and all the motherly things that one would be concerned about .
I ’d convinced her to at least start the company , that was back in the Desert Island Software days .
We had the company established , and literally a week before I was to go back home and start the 9th grade , the team said , “ Hey , we figured this out .
Want to sign the contract ? ”
I called my mom on a Monday , and said , “ Mom , I ’m starting work with Apple on Thursday , and I ’m not coming home . ”
It was a very hard thing for my mom , you know : the baby son , and California , whatever .
My mom , knowing how stubborn I was , and all these external factors at play , agreed .
She allowed me to do this even though she was very , very concerned that I had negotiated my own contract .
I was later told that she came down and negotiated a different kind of contract , which was to say , “ Hey , you know , guys , you are going to be responsible for my child , not only in terms of his physical welfare , but his spiritual and emotional welfare . ”
I was a cellist at the time and had a bunch of other interests , and she just wanted to make sure that I maintained a childhood and a sense of balance in my life .
It was such an amazing corporate culture at Apple .
There was a lot of people that were looking out for me , and of course , especially given what I was doing there .
There was a lot of opportunity to kind of be a young rebellious teen , and I did some of that , but generally I had a really great group of people around me .
I remember there was a beer bash , when we did a alpha or beta launch of a software product .
There would be a beer bash on campus , and I remember having a beer , and some HR person getting completely freaked out .
There was a bunch of that kind of stuff .
However , I was n’t the youngest .
It was Chris Espinosa , who was actually employee number eight at Apple .
Because I was never an employee , I was a contractor , I ’m the youngest ever contractor I know through Apple .
Chris was youngest ever employee , and actually beat me by I think a year or so .
Chris actually has the title and will always likely carry that title .
I was hired in QuickTime products group , and I was savvy technically .
I was able to comprehend at lower levels the technical concepts , but was a very bad , almost completely dysfunctional , programmer .
The team thought , “ What do we make of this guy ?
What do we do with this guy ? ” I was put into an evangelist role .
It was n’t planned .
They did n’t say , “ Oh , Tom would be great at this . ”
They just thought I would be a great guy to have around .
We kind of had to figure out what my role was .
With QuickTime , we were really trying to build a platform , a media platform , as a consequence of some of the technical portions of later versions of QuickTime .
At the time there was a new standard called CD - plus , and CD - ROM , in the music industry .
CD - plus was a totally different form of manufacturing a CD .
You had a data layer , and you had a audio layer on one CD .
The idea was to use QuickTime to demonstrate how we could create interactive content for artists that would increase engagements around the music on a CD - ROM .
This was 1995 , and the internet was becoming more and more popular .
It was coming out of the academic world and in the fringe technology world .
Not so much in any way the mainstream , but becoming more and more , “ What can we do with this ? , How can we use it ? ” , etc .
Really our vision for how QuickTime and this online music stuff could interact , was that we could have individual files that would contain the music , but also contain very , very simple data structure describing the song .
Being able to use an application which would then be able to look up that data and bring other relevant content in the form of commercial links .
Links out to the web , that would allow for greater music discovery , but also allow for the tracking of how that music is explored , and how that fan engages with that particular track .
What we were tasked with was not only coming up with some prototypes about how that would manifest , and we ’d pitch differently to artists and labels , but ultimately , I was kind of out there evangelizing to the music community .
I remember hanging out with Radiohead backstage at a show they did in San Francisco in 1995 .
Tom was already designing his album covers using Photoshop on a Mac .
We had a tremendous number of artists who were already Mac users .
We were trying to explain , “ Hey , there ’s this new stuff coming ! ”
In New York , we were part of the New York Music Festival , wiring up 13 clubs .
There were 270 bands playing over seven days , and we were live streaming the venues to anybody on the web .
On the crappiest of connections - probably four - frames - per-minute , with the worst 8 kHz mono sound quality .
The way that I approached my work in reaching out to the music business was the same approach that I took with Sculley .
We are all people , regardless of title , whatever .
We were all completely equal and it was all about being likeable and liked .
What was happening before I joined Apple was that there had been several kind of high profile attempts at creating what the press referred to as , “ Sili- wood ” which was Hollywood and Silicon Valley coming together to create these massive studio - produced CD - ROM projects .
The industry observers were saying that the two cultures were clashing .
The Silicon Valley types were saying , “ Well this is how we try to impose their methodologies and their approach to business on Hollywood . ” and vice versa .
Whereas I was just this happy kid that was very excited about the technologies I was working on .
Just being at Apple was my dream job .
That enthusiasm and passion was disarming , and the fact that I was a kid .
Literally every single meeting for the first year , any new meeting , everybody would start looking for the hidden camera .
Looking at each other for either whose kid this was , or who put up this joke .
Then the meeting would start , and again people would still be kind of chuckling .
Then five minutes in , as a consequence of what I was saying , and how I was saying it , they realized that this was this freakish but nevertheless real scenario of this kid being at Apple .
The music industry had the exact same attitude about people .
They did n’t care what package or experience you came in .
If you could play your part , that ’s all that was required for acceptance .
That was the exact same culture that got me in at Apple .
Here I was living in this convergence of those two communities , which really worked for me .
I was doing really high concept stuff .
I had approached Bill Bottrell , a very famous engineer and studio guy , who had also gotten quite critically acclaimed as a producer .
He had produced Sheryl Crow ’s first album , “ Tuesday Night Music Club ” , and that album title was no coincidence .
In her studio in Pasadena , he was organizing a Tuesday night jam session of friends and musicians that he knew .
Our idea was to wire up the studio so that the outside world could see what was going on and allow outsiders to contribute song ideas and lyrics into the studio .
Then if those songs got cut , you would basically , by virtue of membership , be a contributor .
You would sign up to get an audio CD compilation , of all the songs that had gotten cut , but you would get a pre-negotiated small kind of cut from the song that you had gotten cut if you were contacted had come in .
If you fast forwarded to 2009 , and user - generated media contributions , collaboration online , I mean this is 1995 , we just did n’t have the bandwidth to do it .
We did n’t have a user base to do it .
Even though Bill was tremendously excited about it , and so was a pretty high level executive within Apple , the concept worked up several layers above me to our vice president ’s level , what they were looking for was really more .
They looked at our music stuff as more traditionally corporate sponsorship stuff .
So the lens was exposure in the music industry , exposure to consumers , without going into too much of Apple ’s history , you could argue that music was part of the brand DNA of Apple from the very beginning .
Even though Jobs was gone , it was always seen more as , “ Hey , if we can do high visible stuff , get musicians endorsing what we ’re doing . ”
Remember the , “ Think Different ” campaign .
The actual technical business rationale of our unit was that 90 % of the music industry , we had 90 % share of , of computers in studios and musicians from a pure market analysis perspective , the other ten was analog , and those were the guys that were n’t moving .
If we could create high concept stuff , be seen as real supporters of the industry , perhaps we could move the dial , one , two percent , into that other 10 % .
Remember it was Mac platform only that was hosting Pro Tools , Digidesign , and all that stuff .
There was a kind of corporate culture that we were in .
This was illustrative of the disconnect of the time that I was at Apple , which was under our CEO Michael Spindler , at the time .
I left before Gil Amelio came in .
Spindler and Amelio were arguably two of the worst CEOs Apple ever had .
Well , there ’s only been four .
This was an indicator of their “ let ’s sell more boxes ” mentality , so our music stuff was in the rationale of , “ Let ’s sell , let ’s move the dial on those analog guys . ”
The reality of it , is those analog guys were analog for a reason , and they likely would n’t be switching because of our sponsorship of Woodstock 2 .
Nevertheless , that was the mentality .
Whereas internally , as we moved down from the VP into the operating dynamics of our unit , it was just keeping that culture that Apple was famous for .
The culture of early innovation , concept , reaching out to innovators , and empowering them through our ideas .
There was that corporate culture disconnect that was very reflective to the whole company .
With the studio deal , even though there was high levels of support , it came down to negotiating a legal contract .
The legal issues that an entertainment lawyer brought to a contract , and what our Fortune 500 Silicon Valley lawyers brought , were two very , very different contract legalities .
Even though there was cultural similarity , from a legal perspective , they were so different .
It was the legal cultures that were the big issue in allowing us to do deals .
As a result , we did a lot of sponsorship deals .
My business card and the title on my office read , “ Tom Williams , The Kid ” .
That was the brand that was created for me , which I quickly embraced , and owned as my own .
I left Apple as my parents were actually going through the divorce proceedings .
My father did n’t want to pay child support because on paper I was making more money than he was .
I had no concept of money , and was spending more than I was making .
Because of the unique nature of our story , it ran in our local paper and it was syndicated very , very quickly across the country .
The Canadian media got interested in doing a story on me .
CBC National which was the prime - time national news hour in Canada , came calling to me in California to do an interview for a documentary .
I negotiated , and by this time had some ink on me : The Christian Science Monitor , the New York Post , A Current Affair .
I had a bunch of media , and was hanging out with musicians .
I very quickly understood the importance of having control over your own brand .
This was not done with the Apple PR people , but directly between me and the CBC folks .
That documentary created brand awareness for “ The Kid ” in Canada , and as a consequence , I had a number of job offers .
Before the documentary even started , several of our new media guys got themselves hired by Microsoft .
Microsoft has been involved quite heavily in promoting their own music stuff , though Apple was far better at achieving the high profile marketing wins .
Microsoft ’s corporate culture was far different than Apple .
Even though they had way more money to spend , and they got The Rolling Stones‚ “ Start Me Up ” for Windows , they could buy their way only so far .
I ’d done an interview with Microsoft , as several of the guys I knew from Apple were keen on getting me into there .
By this time , the documentary ran and there was a lot of job offers , one of which I ended up taking back in Vancouver .
That was the launch of the brand “ The Kid ” , which became , for better or worse , part of my public persona , quite successfully for the next ten years of my life .
During the ten years , it was the same notion of : build the relationship , success requires a persistent misreading of the odds , have access to anyone that was famous or at a certain level .
The notion that I did n’t or was n’t able to have access to that did n’t exist .
There was no psychological intimidation because I always had that level of confidence , or maybe it was just pure arrogance .
It ’s either a supreme level of confidence or truly seeing everybody , myself included , as just peers of everybody else .
All this title was a function of luck , it did n’t really imply any kind of specialness that I or anybody else did n’t have .
Hold the relationship , be friendly , be likeable , and good things come from that .
I remember working as a technology analyst for this really crappy investment retail brokerage house in Canada .
Not that I ’m insulting the Canadian technology community in the mid-late 90s , but I wanted to go after the same deals that the white investment banks were going after .
There was a company called Invention Machine in Boston that had a bunch of big venture capital money put into it , and were contemplating an IPO .
They needed a few million bucks raised privately before going out IPO , and this was the kind of thing that I did .
I knew that the CEO was a smoker , as we met at a conference in the past where we talked about cigars .
There ’s a comic aspect to this .
An 18 - year - old talking about his love of cigars to a 50 - year - old .
Seems so silly and ludicrous now that I can look back on it .
Nevertheless , I literally bought a box of cigars and sent it to him a week before I was to meet with him .
I wined and dined him .
The night before I was to meet with his board , which included guys from these New York investment banks , and venture capital funds , I convinced him to give me the opportunity to do a private equity round for the company .
We shook hands , but he said it ’s ultimately up to the board .
This very , very powerful board was like , “ This is a joke !
Why should we do it with you ? ” I said “ Well I ’ll get it done in a week . ”
They said , “ Everybody says that and nobody does it . ”
I said , “ So then you got no liability if I ca n’t get it done . ”
He said , “ Well I guess you got me there . ”
This was a Tuesday .
Wednesday I flew to Toronto , met with a mutual fund there .
By Thursday we had a term sheet .
By Friday they got down there , and the deal closed on a following Wednesday .
The commitment was there , pretty much right away .
I gained the respect of that team and board .
My favorite quote is from author and management consultant Tom Peters , “ Success requires a persistent misreading of the odds . ”
That ’s exactly what that was .
I did n’t know that quote when I did it , but it fit very well to describing part of my attitude and approach to this stuff .
It was about relationships , first and foremost .
If people like you , they want you to succeed .
If they want you to , they will help you succeed .
It has to be genuine .
A lot of people approach their relationship - making as mercenary transactions .
As much as you appear very genuine they can see your endgame .
Take the time .
Earlier this week , I was traveling back home with my Mom and we agreed to take a particular ferry home , which would allow me about fifteen minutes of face time with a friend and mentor of mine .
She said : “ Why bother if it ’s just fifteen minutes ? ” I said , “ Well , because it ’s face time , and that fifteen minutes should be spent building and strengthening the relationship . ”
What can you accomplish in fifteen minutes ?
Nothing other than strengthening the relationship .
Recognize that by being useful and good to others , you will eventually build a very strong team of supporters .
They ’ll lift you up to new heights and protect you .
If you falter they will be there to bring you back up and support you .
I think it ’s one of the most overlooked components of business .
Simply , we ’re always able to say that at the end of the day , all you have is your friends .
But , if your friends are your friends , and they happen to be in business , and are helpful to your business , then all that much better , because those people will be there to support you .
Pithy aphorism ?
Probably .
Absolutely true ?
100 % .

The crew is onsight and the gears are falling into place on the new carousel in Pier Park in Panama City Beach .
Workers have been bringing all the parts and peices over all day and the frame is up right now , as of 5:45 pm .
“ We ’ll hang the horses tonight , they have a terrible habit of coming alive and walking off in the middle of the night . ” said the forman of the crew .
“ This is a Herschell Carousel , ” he said , “ this is a ride out of Jersey , from a time when these things were actually rides . ”
He was telling me that the new ones will last 10 years , if they are taken care of , but the old ones like these , they are still in use all across the country .
Apparently this is a great carousel – nice job , Teddy .
Set to open April 1 , the carousel should be completely assembled by tomorrow or Sunday .
Then , all they have to do is clean it up .
If you are on the beach tonight , you should stop by and take a look .
WASHINGTON 
The drug industry has authorized its lobbyists to spend as much as $ 150 million on television commercials supporting President Obama ’s health care overhaul , beginning over the August Congressional recess , people briefed on the plans said Saturday .
The unusually large scale of the industry ’s commitment to the cause helps explain some of a contentious back - and - forth playing out in recent days between the odd - couple allies over a deal that the White House struck with the industry in June to secure its support .
The terms of the deal were not fully disclosed .
Both sides had announced that the drug industry would contribute $ 80 billion over 10 years to the cost of the health care overhaul without spelling out the details .
With House Democrats moving to extract more than that just as the drug makers finalized their advertising plans , the industry lobbyists pressed the Obama administration for public reassurances that it had agreed to cap the industry ’s additional costs at $ 80 billion .
The White House , meanwhile , has struggled to mollify its most pivotal health industry ally without alienating Congressional Democrats who want to demand far more of the drug makers .
White House officials could not immediately be reached for comment .
Many Democratic lawmakers have railed for years against what they consider the industry ’s excessive profits and pointedly insisted in recent days that they do not feel bound by the White House ’s commitments .
Alcohol 's inebriating effects are familiar to everyone .
But the molecular details of alcohol 's impact on brain activity remain a mystery .
A new study by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies brings us closer to understanding how alcohol alters the way brain cells work .
Their findings , published in the current advance online edition of Nature Neuroscience , reveal an alcohol trigger site located physically within an ion channel protein ; their results could lead to the development of novel treatments for alcoholism , drug addiction , and epilepsy .
Ethanol , the alcohol in intoxicating beverages , is known to alter the communication between brain cells .
" There 's been a lot of interest in the field to find out how alcohol acts in the brain , " says Paul A. Slesinger , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the Peptide Biology Laboratory at the Salk Institute , who led the study .
" One of several views held that ethanol works by interacting directly with ion channel proteins , but there were no studies that visualised the site of association . "
Slesinger and his team now show that alcohols directly interact with a specific nook contained within a channel protein .
This ion channel plays a key role in several brain functions associated with drugs of abuse and seizures .
Previous research by Slesinger and his group focused on the neural function of these ion channels , called GIRK channels .
GIRK channels , short for G - protein - activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels , open up during periods of chemical communication between neurons and dampen the signal , creating the equivalent of a short circuit .
" When GIRKs open in response to neurotransmitter activation , potassium ions leak out of the neuron , decreasing neuronal activity , " says UCSD Biology graduate student and first author Prafulla Aryal .
Alcohols had been previously shown to open up GIRK channels but it was not known whether this was a direct effect or whether this was the by - product of other molecular changes in the cell .
Having the location of a physical alcohol - binding site important for GIRK channel activation could point to new strategies for treating related brain diseases .
Using this protein structure , it may be possible to develop a drug that antagonises the actions of alcohol for the treatment of alcohol dependence .
Alternatively , " If we could find a novel drug that fits the alcohol - binding site and then activate GIRK channels , this would dampen overall neuronal excitability in the brain and perhaps provide a new tool for treating epilepsy , " says Slesinger .
Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by episodic , abnormal electrical activity that affects more than 3 million Americans .
Current medications have serious side effects and the search for new , specific mechanisms of treatment is an area of intense research across the globe .
To gain more insight into how alcohols work , Slesinger and Aryal teamed up with Salk colleagues Senyon Choe , Ph.D. , a professor in the Structural Biology Laboratory , and Hay Dvir , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral researcher in Choe 's lab , to determine whether tiny pockets found in a high resolution , three - dimensional structure of a potassium channel were , in fact , the sites of alcohol action in GIRK channels .
The Salk researchers noted the similarity of these candidate alcohol - binding sites with alcohol pockets visualised in two other alcohol - binding proteins : alcohol dehydrogenase , the enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the body , and a fruit fly protein , LUSH , that senses alcohol in the environment .
When Aryal systematically introduced amino acid substitutions that denied alcohol molecules access to the potential alcohol binding site , alcohol could no longer efficiently activate the channel , confirming that they had hit upon an important regulatory site for alcohol .
The team further established that this pocket is a trigger point for channel activation since G protein activation was also altered .
" We believe alcohol hijacks the intrinsic activation mechanism of GIRK channels and stabilises the opening of the channel , " says Aryal .
" Alcohol may accomplish this by lubricating the activation gears of the channel , " adds Slesinger .
i think you would find here http://OnlineDogTraining.enle.info/?00kx an amazing help !
i am currently in the throes of training my new puppy , a german shepherd / alaskan malamute cross who is still just a baby .. but i've grown up with dogs ... had 2 border collies when i was just a kid .. my sister has a toy poodle , my brother has a lab , and my parents have a toy poodle and a yorkshire terrier / pomeranian cross and we lost a lab last august ...
i live with my parents while i'm in school and my mom trained the dogs with Cesar 's techniques .. they really do work !
and that is what i'm training little Justice with ... his techniques i have found more effective than a water spray bottle , rolled up newspaper , yelling or anything else !
my mom trained the lab we lost with the " Lead Training " that a trainer named John Wade taught us .
You put the dog on a leash and put the leash around your ankle ... wherever you goes , the dog goes and eventually , you can take the dog off for longer and longer periods of time ... this works ( as far as i understand ) because in the end , you could be across the room and the dog will still think s/he is attached to you , therefore deterring any errant behaviour ..
if you stick with it , are firm and keep a calm , but assertive , " pack leader " mentality , you will have your little terror :-) trained in no time !
I do n't know where you live but you might find these helpful

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration unveiled new rules on Thursday for searching computers and other electronic devices when people enter the United States , attempting to address concerns about violating privacy and constitutional rights .
At the same time , the Department of Homeland Security defended such searches as necessary to detect information about potential terrorism plots as well as other crimes such as child pornography and copyright infringement .
“ The new directives announced today strike the balance between respecting the civil liberties and privacy of all travelers while ensuring DHS can take the lawful actions necessary to secure our borders , ” DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement .
Between October 1 , 2008 and August 11 , 2009 , 221 million travelers were processed at U.S. borders and about 1,000 searches of laptop computers were conducted , of which 46 were in - depth examinations , the agency said .
Searches often involve asking people to turn on the device to verify it is what it appears to be , the DHS said .
Privacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have pushed Congress to stop border officers from searching laptops , cell phones and other electronic devices without probable cause when people enter or return to the country .
The rules permit searches of such devices without a person ’s consent .
The review is to be done in the presence of the owner , unless there are national security or law enforcement reasons to conduct it elsewhere .
Immigration and customs officers can also hold the devices or the data , which may be copied without the knowledge of the owner for further review , according to the rules .
The new regulations note that border officers should be particularly careful when handling legal or business materials or other sensitive data like medical records or information carried by journalists .

Google today will finally remove the long - standing beta tag from some of its most popular web applications , most notably its wildly popular email application , Gmail .
In addition to the beta-less Gmail , Google Calendar , Docs , and Talk ( i.e. , the rest of the Google Apps suite ) will also shed the beta moniker .
Gmail has notoriously worn the beta badge since its initial invite - only launch back in April of 2004 .
Strangely , as the New York Times points out , Google 's reasoning for keeping Gmail and other apps in beta for so long is n't all that fleshed out :
" Obviously we have n't had a consistent set of policies or definitions around beta , " said Matt Glotzbach , a director of product management at Google .
Mr. Glotzbach said that different teams at Google had different criteria for what beta meant , and that Google felt a need to standardize those .
" It was time to address the issue and bring the products out of beta , " he said .

The Times also points out that " [ p] ractically speaking , the change will mean precious little to Gmail 's millions of users " who 've been happily using Gmail in beta for years .
If our recent poll on whether " beta " bothers you , it seems clear that next to no Lifehacker readers were avoiding Gmail just because of its beta label .
Still , if your workplace was hesitant to adopt Google Apps because of its beta status , this move could make all the difference ( a fact not lost on Google ) .
Does Beta Bother You ?

We 're still seeing the beta label on every Gmail account we 've got as well as our Docs accounts , but Calendar is beta - free .
Google 's rollouts are always just that — rolling — so you can probably still expect to see the rest of those beta tags drop sometime yet today or this week if they have n't already .
The Official Gmail Blog even highlights a new tongue - in - cheek Gmail Labs feature called Back to Beta that , when enabled , " [ s ] oothes the soul by putting the familiar beta sticker back on the Gmail logo . "

Does the beta-less Gmail , Calendar , Docs , or Talk mean anything special to you ?
Will it inspire you to use Google apps more confidently ?

FDP - Politiker : Hartz IV um 30 Prozent kürzen Florian Rötzer
Die FDP macht deutlich , wo sie die versprochenen Steuersenkungen auf der " Ausgabenseite " hereinholen will .
Die FDP drängt die Union dazu , nach den Wahlen die Steuern und Abgaben zu senken .
Das sei , so Westerwelle , der sich schon in der neuen Bundesregierung mit der Union sieht , " Voraussetzung für Wachstum in Deutschland “ .
Die Zauberformel ist , dass selbst bei Schuldenhöchststand , steigenden Kosten für die sozialen Systeme und einbrechenden Steuereinnahmen noch mehr Schulden durch Steuerkürzungen weggezaubert werden , weil dann die Wirtschaft boomt , die Schwarzarbeit " automatisch " zurückgeht und so wieder mehr Geld in die Staatskassen fließt .
Die Idee , auch " Selbstfinanzierungseffekt " genannt , überträfe zwar , noch den Versuch , ein perpetuum mobile zu konstruieren , was man auch bei der FDP weiß .
Gleichwohl hat FDP - Chef Westerwelle den Steuerschwur der " Bild " - Zeitung unterschrieben .
Die Liberalen werden , so Westerwelle , einen Koalitionsvertrag nur dann unterzeichnen , wenn darin ein niedrigeres , einfacheres und gerechteres Steuersystem vereinbart wurde .
" Mit der Abkassiererei der Bürger muss es ein Ende haben " , so Westerwelle .
Die staatlichen Ausgaben müssten gekürzt werden .
Gefordert werden Steuermindereinnahmen von 30 - 40 Milliarden Euro .
Man könne viel auf der Ausgabenseite des Staates finden , was sich kürzen ließe , um den Mittelstand zu fördern .
Jetzt hat zumindest einer der Liberalen , der Berliner FDP - Spitzenkandidat für die Bundestagswahl Martin Lindner , für Aufklärung gesorgt , wie sich Steuerreduzierungen auf der " Ausgabenseite " gegenfinanzieren lassen könnten .
Während andere Parteien von einer Reichensteuer oder der Wiedereinführung der Vermögenssteuer sprechen , meinte Lindner in einem Gespräch mit N24 - Studio - Friedmann , man müsse " natürlich " den Regelsatz von Hartz IV kürzen - und zwar um bis zu 30 Prozent , also von jetzt 359 Euro auf gerade noch 250 Euro .
Gleichzeitig müsse den Menschen aber angeboten , etwas zu tun , auch im kommunalen Bereich .
Martin Lindner im N24 - Studio - Friedmann
Wahltaktisch war das sicher kein kluger Zug des FDP - Politikers , allerdings dürften Hartz - IV - Bezieher auch nicht die Klientel der Liberalen sein , zumal diese von den versprochenen Steuerentlastungen ja auch nichts hätten .
Lindner ließ es aber nicht nur bei der Forderung belassen , sondern setzte noch einen drauf , um Reich gegen Arm , Arbeitnehmer gegen Arbeitslose auszuspielen : " Wir haben gerade hier in Berlin extrem viele Menschen , die sind gesund , die sind arbeitsfähig , und die haben schlichtweg keine Lust , zu arbeiten .
…
Denen kann ich nicht genau so viel überweisen wie einem , der morgens aufsteht und Busfahren geht oder so .
Das ist nicht gerecht . “
Lindner meint denn auch , dass der soziale Frieden gewahrt und ein weiteres Abrutschen in die Zwei- Klassen - Gesellschaft vermieden würde , wenn die Menschen eine Perspektive hätten .
Und die müsse sein : " Leistung lohnt sich wieder in diesem Land . "
FIRST SOLAR , INC . ( NASDAQ : FSLR ) filed Quarterly Report for the period ended 2009 - 07 - 31 .
FIRST SOLAR INC .
manufactures solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor process that significantly lowers solar electricity costs .
By enabling clean renewable electricity at affordable prices First Solar provides an economic alternative to peak conventional electricity and the related fossil fuel dependence greenhouse gas emissions and peak time grid constraints .
FIRST SOLAR , INC .
has a market cap of $ 13.04 billion ; its shares were traded at around $ 154.39 with a P/E ratio of 22.34 and P/S ratio of 10.46 .
Highlight of Business Operations :
We face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as other types of solar modules and photovoltaic systems .
Solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes , including module cost - per - watt and levelized cost of electricity , meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy produced over the system life .
We are one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry , as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from $ 0.98 in the three months ended December 27 , 2008 to $ 0.93 and $ 0.87 in the three months ended March 28 , 2009 and June 27 , 2009 , respectively .
This cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably on the levelized cost of electricity generated by our systems .
Our cost competitiveness is based on our proprietary technology , which provides lower cost from a continuous highly automated industrial manufacturing process , our scale and our operational excellence .
In addition , our modules use approximately 1 % of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules .
The cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules .
The current spot market price of polysilicon of approximately between $ 55 and $ 65 per kilogram ( Kg ) is at a level that enables us to remain one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry .
However , the timing and rate of decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to pricing pressure for solar modules .
Although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer , we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors , that a $ 10 per Kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease , respectively , our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately $ 0.07 to $ 0.08 .
Given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules , there are higher balance - of - system costs associated with systems using our modules .
Thus , to compete effectively on the basis of levelized cost of electricity our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules .
Our cost reduction roadmap anticipates manufacturing cost per watt reductions for our product of 10 % per year .
During the twelve months ended December 27 , 2008 we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 12 % from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 .
In the first six months of 2009 , we further reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 11 % from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 .
Subsequent to June 27 , 2009 , in light of current market conditions , we began to develop plans for a new rebate program intended to address price constraints for customers installing modules in Germany .
As part of this program , we intend to adjust our pricing policies as necessary to drive increased installations by our customers in our core ( free field and commercial rooftop ) markets in Germany .
In structuring the rebate program , we expect to apply a discount to a best in class crystalline module benchmark price calculated by us .
We expect to review the rebate periodically and adjust it upward or downward as appropriate .
The rebate program will specify certain actions required to be taken by customers in order to utilize the rebates .
Given that current market conditions could be temporary , we have limited the scope and duration of the rebate program and could relax or eliminate it if market conditions abate .
Our Long Term Supply Contracts remain in effect and are not otherwise affected .
As a result of this rebate program , we anticipate an impact on net sales for the remainder of fiscal 2009 in the range of approximately $ 40 million to $ 60 million ( €30 million to € 45 million at an assumed exchange rate of $ 1.26 /€1.0 ) .
Such amount may vary depending on the extent to which these rebates are utilized by our customers , the benchmark levels , the exact duration of the program , foreign currency fluctuations and other factors .
If competitive pressures , module oversupply or other market conditions continue , we may elect to enhance or broaden the rebate program further or take other actions that reduce module prices further .
Any such price reductions will be limited to the levels and time periods necessary to achieve our installation objectives .
With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy , LLC on November 30 , 2007 , we began accounting for a portion of our revenues using the percentage - of - completion method of accounting .
Net sales for our solar power systems and project development business for the three and six months ended June 27 , 2009 and June 28 , 2008 were $ 5.4 million and $ 10.6 million , and $ 1.9 million and $ 5.0 million , respectively , and were not material to our consolidated results of operations .
Deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials that we have procured for customer projects .
We recognize these costs as deferred assets until we install the materials .
Deferred project costs at June 27 , 2009 and December 27 , 2008 were $ 1.4 million and $ 0.7 million , respectively .
Production start - up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel - related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production , including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase .
It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program , to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures .
We incurred production start - up expense of $ 32.5 million during the year ended December 27 , 2008 in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center .
Production start - up expense for the six months ended June 27 , 2009 was $ 8.7 million and related to plant four of our Malaysian manufacturing center and our Ohio plant expansion .
In general , we expect production start - up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility , primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility .
Over time , we expect production start - up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale .
The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes , which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center .
This increase in production and sales volume had the following effects : $ 65.0 million increase in direct material expense , $ 8.7 million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the costs of the end of life collection and recycling of our solar modules , $ 4.6 million increase in sales freight and other costs , and $ 27.1 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs .
The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $ 7.3 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses , including a $ 1.4 million increase in share - based compensation expense , due to increased headcount and additional share - based compensation awards , an $ 8.7 million increase in facility and related expenses and an $ 11.1 million increase in depreciation expense ; in each case , primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our Malaysian manufacturing center .
Our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by $ 0.31 per watt , or 26 % , from $ 1.18 in the three months ended June 28 , 2008 to $ 0.87 in the three months ended June 27 , 2009 and included $ 0.01 of non-cash stock based compensation .

Former French President Jaques Chirac says that in 2003 , President Bush asked him to send troops to Iraq to stop Gog and Magog , the " Bible 's satanic agents of the Apocalypse . "
From James A. Haught 's piece in the Council for Secular Humanism :
It 's awkward to say openly , but now - departed President Bush is a religious crackpot , an ex-drunk of small intellect who " got saved . "
He never should have been entrusted with the power to start wars .
For six years , Americans really have n't known why he launched the unnecessary Iraq attack .
Official pretexts turned out to be baseless .
Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction after all , and was n't in league with terrorists , as the White House alleged .
Collapse of his asserted reasons led to speculation about hidden motives :
Was the invasion loosed to gain control of Iraq 's oil–or to protect Israel–or to complete Bush 's father 's vendetta against the late dictator Saddam Hussein ?
Nobody ever found an answer .
Now , added to the other suspicions , comes the goofy possibility that abstruse , supernatural , idiotic , laughable Bible prophecies were a factor .
This casts an ominous pall over the needless war that has killed more than four thousand young Americans and cost U.S. taxpayers perhaps $ 1 trillion .

The crew of the shuttle Endeavour has been welcomed aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The hatches between the craft opened to bring together the largest number of astronauts ever assembled in orbit , 13 .
A few hours later , the ISS had to be moved into a higher orbit , to avoid a possible collision with space debris .
The seven - strong crew who travelled to the station on Endeavour are delivering the final part of a Japanese - built laboratory , spare parts and food .
They joined six astronauts already at the space station , for an 11 - day visit .
Before docking , Endeavour back - flipped so the ISS could photograph it for any sign of damage , after foam peeled off during Wednesday 's much - delayed launch .
Shortly after the Endeavour crew boarded , ground control ordered the ISS team to use the shuttle 's thrusters to move the station about 1.5 km ( 0.93 miles ) higher , to avoid drifting unspecified space junk .
" We 've known about it for several days , it 's not a concern , and we 're doing this only as a precaution , " Nasa said in a post on the micro- blogging site , Twitter .
Debris strike After parking Endeavour on Friday and carrying out safety checks , the shuttle crew floated through the hatches shortly before 1600 EDT ( 2000 GMT ) .
Thirteen is a pretty big number , we are just thrilled to be here
Mark Polansky
Endeavour commander
The orbiter docked at the ISS about two hours earlier , some 220 miles ( 350 km ) above the Gulf of Carpentaria , off the north coast of Australia .
Although the shuttle moved towards the space station at about 3 cm per second during the delicate parking procedure , both spacecraft were travelling at 17,500 mph ( 28,160 km / h ) .
It was the first time representatives from the main station partners - the US , Russia , Europe , Japan and Canada - were brought together in space .
" Welcome , " said the station 's skipper , Russian Gennady Padalka , at the entrance .
Shuttle commander Mark Polansky said : " Thirteen is a pretty big number .
We are just thrilled to be here . "
' Minor dings '
Although 13 people have been in orbit before , they were in different spacecraft .
The previous highest number of astronauts under the same roof in orbit was 10 .
Debris that struck the shuttle during launch is not concerning officials Shortly before berthing , Endeavour performed a nine - minute back - flip , known as a rendezvous pitch manoeuvre , allowing the ISS crew to capture up to 300 photographs of the shuttle 's thermal protection system .
The images were taken after a considerable amount of foam insulation peeled away from the shuttle 's fuel tank and struck it during Wednesday 's launch .
Apart from " a few minor dings " in some thermal protection tiles , Nasa officials have said there does not seem to be any cause for concern .
But the pictures are being examined by engineers back at mission control to ensure there is no damage that could jeopardise the shuttle 's re-entry through the Earth 's atmosphere .
Endeavour and its crew of six Americans and a Canadian launched successfully from Florida 's Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday - after five failed attempts .
Previous efforts to begin the 16 - day mission had been hampered by bad weather and fuel leaks .
During the mission , five spacewalks - each expected to last 6.5 hours - are to be completed .
The first , scheduled for Saturday , will add a platform to the Japanese laboratory complex , Kibo , which can be used for experiments that require materials to be exposed to the harsh environment of space .
In addition , Endeavour delivered a new long - stay US crew member , Tim Kopra , to the ISS and will bring back Japan 's Koichi Wakata , who has lived aboard the platform for more than three months .
The $ 100 bn space station , now about the size of a four - bedroom house , has been under construction for more than a decade .
This is the 127th space shuttle flight , the 29th to the station , the 23rd for Endeavour and the third in 2009 .
Seven further flights to the platform remain planned before the shuttles retire in 2010 .

Remember former CitPat education reporter Chad Livengood ?
You know , the one who was beloved by 5th and 6th grade students all across the state , when a story he wrote inadvertently gave them the opportunity to take the super - fun MEAP test again ?
Well he is at it again , this time at his new job in Missouri , covering state politics .
He has been busy lately breaking a story involving a cover -up in the Nixon administration , and his efforts to uncover the truth have left him branded as a terrorist .
Last month , Chad 's newspaper reported that the state kept secret for four weeks a report showing there were high levels of E. coli in Lake of the Ozarks in the heart of tourist season .
The internal e-mails he obtained show former DNR Deputy Director sought the report on June 3 to take a meeting in the governor 's office the next day .
Gov. Jay Nixon , a Democrat , and his office have denied any such meeting took place , saying the deputy came to talk about other topics .
The DNR quietly released the report to the public on June 26 , and Nixon 's spokesman said the governor did n't learn about the report until seeing news reports about it in mid-July .
So Chad sent a FOIA request to view the footage from the surveillance camera aimed at the door to Nixon 's office .
But the Missouri Capitol Police denied his FOIA request , and cited a post - Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorism exemption in the state 's open records law for doing so .
Chad spoke with a number of state legislators who crafted the law seven years ago and they seemed perplexed the administration is using it to keep him from seeing the tape .
They said the intent of the law was to keep evil - doers from reading through the state 's terrorism response plans at public buildings or a local nuclear power plant .
" They 're calling you a terrorist ? " one state Senator said .
" This is insane . "
And even though Chad is a terrorist , the state attorney general is on his side .
The newspaper has appealed the FOIA denial , but the appeal goes before a member of the governor 's cabinet .
Yeah , we all know how that 's going to turn out .
Transparency and Democracy loses again .
According to a new study , Scotland could shut down all its coal and nuclear power plants in the next 20 years and fulfill all its energy needs using renewable sources .
[ social_buttons ]
The study commissioned by a consortium of environmental groups and conducted by an independent engineering consultant will soon be presented to the Scottish government .
The study hold significant importance as the government has set ambitious goals for cutting carbon emissions and switching to renewable energy sources for power generation .
The research studies and evaluates five different scenarios to predict the energy demand and generation trends over the next 20 years .
In Scenario
One it is assumed that the Scottish government sticks to its already set goals of reducing carbon emissions and increasing percentage of power generated from renewable sources without setting new and bolder goals .
Scotland plans to reduce its carbon emissions by 42 percent and generate 50 percent electricity from renewable sources by 2020 .
In this case , Scotland will not require any new fossil fuel based power plants after 2020 and would be able to generate two - thirds of its total power from renewable sources .
Scenario
Two considers continuous growth in renewable energy infrastructure from 2020 to 2030 with addition of 4.1 GW capacity in ten years from 10.8 GW projected to be achieved in 2020 .
In this case Scotland would get 93 percent of its electric supply from renewable sources .
However , this study notes that achieving this target would require the government to tap renewable sources other than wind and wave .
In order to achieve the 14.9 GW target significant increase in small and micro scale power plants could be required .
Scotland already provides subsidies to home owners and small businesses to install solar and wind energy systems on rooftops .
However , if the government seeks to increase that capacity to partly meet that 14.9 GW target additional financial support would be required which , in turn , would mean possible increase in taxes .
Scenario
Four tries to put forward a simple solution to this problem .
It considers energy efficiency as a major driver in making Scotland free of fossil fuel powered electricity .
It has been projected that the electricity demand would fall by 8 percent by 2020 , the report calls for an ‘ elevated action ’ to further reduce the demand to 20 percent by 2020 and 26 percent by 2030 .
The report then combines Scenario Two and Four to predict that a combination of continued growth of renewable energy generation and energy efficiency would make Scotland an exporter of renewable energy as it would have the capacity to generate 143 percent of its annual electricity demand .
Scenario
Five turns to heating demands and transportation .
The report recommends partial electrification of heat supply and transport .
While proposing modest 10 percent targets for each of them the report claims that electrification would lead to security of supply , increased efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions .
The report is revolutionary as even the worst case scenario ( Scenario One ) would mean a significant supply ( 64 percent ) of electricity coming from renewable sources .
With additional tools of energy efficiency and targeted financial help for small and micro scale energy generation , Scotland would be able to generate a huge power surplus .
At a time when the world leaders are struggling to even promise significant emission cuts , Scottish government ’s continuous efforts to promote renewable energy and cut carbon emissions to meet the highly ambitious goals is commendable .

Drama has struck parts of the BitTorrent community recently as the popular DVD ripper aXXo has n't uploaded any torrents for several weeks .
Recently a rumor surfaced that aXXo went to join a private BitTorrent tracker and continued to share his work there exclusively .
But is this really the case ?
Over the years aXXo has been built up to cult figure status by many BitTorrent users , to a point where the mainstream press and even documentary film makers show an interest .
This March aXXo went silent , but some claim that he is still active on a relatively unknown private tracker named Speed.cd .
A few weeks ago , some blogs and commenters on Mininova picked up on this and reported that aXXo decided to go underground , releasing his torrents only on a few private trackers .
Interestingly , he would also have left Darkside RG which was considered to be his home for years , and where he posted the following message only weeks ago .
“ My home is my beloved Darkside and as i’ve said so many times before on each of my torrents … .
Be aware of bogus sites and lamers , ” aXXo wrote .
So here are some facts .
There is indeed a staff member called aXXo ( with identical capitalization ) on Speed.cd .
He joined the site in January 2008 and has been uploading ( some ) aXXo rips after they appeared on public sites such as Mininova .
After aXXo stopped releasing torrents elsewhere , aXXo on Speed.cd continued to upload movies .
But is this member called aXXo on Speed .cd the real deal ?
No , not even close .
A quick comparison of the codecs used on these “ new ” aXXo releases and an examination of some of the metadata such as the ripping software and specs , clearly shows that it is not the same aXXo his fans know and love .
Also , it is a bit strange that the mystical aXXo only uploaded his releases sporadically onto the Speed.cd tracker before he stopped releasing on public sites three months ago .
To us , these are all clear signs that we ’re dealing with an impostor here .
For years aXXo has been warning followers to “ beware of bogus sites and lamers , ” but apparently that did n’t help much .
Over recent weeks , thousands of people signed up at Speed.cd , and according to a poll on the site , most of them joined because of the ‘ aXXo ’ releases .
aXXo poll on Speed.cd
The aXXo user on the private tracker is clearly enjoying his new status , and has even changed the NFO files bundled with his releases to point to Speed.cd instead of DarksideRG .
In the comments he is chatting with his new found fans and explaining why he decided to leave Mininova and Demonoid .
The site ’s operators on the other hand are welcoming the many donations made by aXXo ’s followers .
“ Since axxo is part of this site I have donated $ 10 , ” one user commented after buying some upload credit and VIP status .
There are even better deals though .
Three months of VIP access is only $ 50 and you ’ll get a star next to your nickname as bonus .
Then again , if thousands of people ca n’t spot the difference between the uploads of aXXo and the fake aXXo , does it really matter ?
We ’re inclined to say no , if it was n’t for the price lists and money begging going on at that site .
Let ’s hope that they do n’t have the MPAA fooled and end up with their servers raided by the authorities .
That would be a shame .
Update : A topic on Speed.cd linking to this article was quickly removed ….
Margaret dear , I need your help sorting all this out .
Rush Limbaugh has a daily audience of 14 million morons - give or take a few rednecks – Howard excluded of course .
So are we to believe that they all want Obama to fail ?
Do I have that right ?
I am a little confused by this recent turn of events because were n’t these the same peckerwoods who got so upset a few years back when a famous country western singer told about 2,000 people at a concert in London that she was ashamed that George Bush was from her home state ?
Actually I believe her exact quote was , “ Just so you know , we ’re on the good side with y’all .
We do not want this war , this violence , and we ’re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas . ”
If I am not mistaken , conservatives everywhere were enraged – albums were burned , death threats ensued .
It was treason .
But Margaret , let ’s consider the following quotes attributed to Rush , another celebrity – albeit a celebrity who really gives renewed meaning to the saying a face made for radio :
“ I mean , let ’s face it , we did n’t have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing .
Quite the opposite : slavery built the South .
I ’m not saying we should bring it back ; I ’m just saying it had its merits .
For one thing , the streets were safer after dark . ”
“ The only way to reduce the number of nuclear weapons is to use them . ”
“ If we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people – I ’m serious , let the unskilled jobs , let the kinds of jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do – let stupid and unskilled Mexicans do that work . ”
“ Bipartisanship only happens after one side has been defeated .
Ask the Japanese after World War II .
Ask the Germans . ”
The same jackass who made those statements also said , “ I want Barack Obama to fail . ”
And more recently he expounded on that statement when he said , “ The dirty little secret is that every Republican in this country wants Obama to fail , but none of them have the guts to say so . ”
For goodness sakes , I am surprised he finds time to be so loquasious between the mouthfuls of donuts .
Personally , I think Rush Limbaugh is a big , fat pig .
I can say that without worry because I am a big , fat bitch .
But what he looks like is really just so much fodder for people like me who do n’t like his politics .
What he says , however … well that is another story .
Hypocrisy .
It ’s a powerful word .
Republicans should look it up sometime .
Barack Obama is a sitting President of a country still at war and on the brink of economic disaster .
And Rush wants failure ?
He is hoping for failure and 14 million listeners who call themselves conservative Americans are okay with that .
But a country singer wishing the President did n’t come from her home state caused moral outrage .
Has anyone gone and looked up that word hypocrisy yet ?
While you ’re at it , look up the word culpable .
Scratch that , just look up the word gluttony .
Of course , Limbaugh can say whatever he wants .
It ’s a free country .
And people can stop buying albums when they do n’t like the singer anymore .
That ’s what “ it ’s a free country ” means .
And I can say that Rush Limbaugh is nothing more than than a fat , greed - filled radio star praying on the insecurities and ignorance of people who graduated high school thinking that they knew everything .
Like I said – it ’s a free country .
You ’re free to love it or even hate it if you want .
All I ask is that you be honest with yourself about which of those two positions you have chosen to subscribe .
Because considering the current state of the world , we will all succeed or fail together – like it or not .
Margaret , I know that Howard listens to Rush .
I hope he does n’t read our little blog .
And know that if only because he loves you , I love him .
I just wish he would check out the local NPR station once in awhile .
I mean it .
Really .
En México , y en el resto del mundo , la prevalencia del autismo es cercana a uno por ciento ; es complejo , porque pertenece a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y se caracteriza por alteraciones en la comunicación desde etapas tempranas , sostuvo la experta Jacqueline Cortés Morelos .
Además , los niños se ven impedidos para establecer un contacto con el exterior , dijo la investigadora con especialidad en Psiquiatría de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México ( UNAM ) , en un comunicado .
NOTICIA : Aprueban ley de protección a autistas
No existe un factor que lo precipite , es multifactorial y tiene un alto índice de heredabilidad ; todos los trastornos del espectro autista tienen esta condición muy alta , casi de 100 % , comentó en ocasión del Día Mundial de Concienciación sobre el Autismo , que se conmemora este 2 de abril .
Viven en su propio mundo , entonces , al crecer adquieren pocas herramientas de neurodesarrollo , que son habituales para los demás infantes .
Pueden llegar a carecer de comunicación verbal , y no verbal ; no ofrecen respuestas a señales ; tienen movimientos repetitivos ( manerismos ) : se mecen , aletean o acarician su cabello , indicó la académica .
También se les dificulta expresar sus emociones , ser empáticos , receptivos o tener conductas enfocadas a la supervivencia .
Por ejemplo , golpean la mesa , el plato , el garrafón de agua para solicitar alimento o saciar su sed .
Si tienen cambios en su ambiente , tienden a agitarse porque todo se les hace extraño ; en consecuencia , tienen conductas desadaptativas que expresan con llanto , gritos o agresiones .
NOTICIA : Abby apoyará a niños con autismo
Aunque el autismo puro es un trastorno que no se cura , existen métodos de adaptación y aminoramiento , como psicoterapias y medicamentos que pueden lograr mejor calidad de vida , sobre todo en lo social y en lo afectivo , indicó Cortés Morelos .
Se puede detectar a partir de la etapa de lactante , cuando el niño ya tiene ciertas conductas sociales , como la denominada  sonrisa social , o cuando el bebé ríe con otras personas o juega .
Incluso alrededor de los ocho meses tienen algo que nosotros conocemos como jerga y hablan sin decir palabras ; todavía no pueden frasear , pero balbucean ( agu - agu - agu ) constantemente .
Los autistas no lo hacen , no entablan una interacción , apuntó .
Las alteraciones en la comunicación son las principales características de quienes padecen ese trastorno .
Los padres o la figura de apego lo identificarán de inmediato como algo anormal .
Lo ideal entonces es que se acuda con un especialista en psiquiatría infantil ( paidopsiquiatra ) , que se responsabilice del diagnóstico y el tratamiento , destacó .

Disgraced :
The soldiers have brought shame on the Lancaster Regiment
An investigation has been launched after a 15 - year - old girl was smuggled on to an Army base and filmed having " roasting " sex session with up to 17 drunken soldiers .
Police are working with military authorities after speaking to the schoolgirl , it was confirmed .
The sex session was filmed at the Bourlon Barracks at the Catterick Garrison in North Yorkishire last week .
It is believed the youngster had been drinking before the incident , which involved soldiers from the 2nd Battalion , Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment .
They had pushed campbeds together so that some of them could have sex with the girl while others watched .
Because of her age , the soldiers could be charged with having unlawful sexual intercourse .
Footage of the incident was passed to the Ministry of Defence by The People newspaper .
One soldier said : " They pushed two campbeds together to have sex with her and then gathered around .
Scroll down for more ...
More than 7500 soldiers are stationed at Catterick Garrison in the North - East of England
" Many of them were filming it and were pumped up on booze .
It was appalling .
" They have dishonoured the Army and brought shame on their regiment .
Their behaviour makes me sick . "
A North Yorkshire police spokeswoman confirmed officers have seen the footage and had traced and interviewed the girl involved .
" With support of the Royal Military Police 's Special Investigations Branch , efforts are still ongoing to identify everybody connected to the footage , " she said .
The spokeswoman added that no arrests had been made and inquiries were continuing .

As Ontarians flock to the Great Lakes for a little summer fishing , a new report is warning some categories of fish are unfit for consumption due to high levels of toxic chemicals found in their tissue .
" Fish are still great for our diets , but you need to watch what you eat , " said Mike Layton of Environmental Defence , an author of the report .
" For the most part , eating a few small fish every month is n't a big deal but you should be cautious with larger fish that have had more time to accumulate higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals . "
The report , entitled " Up to the Gills : 2009 Update on Pollution in Great Lakes Fish , " brings together data from fish advisories published by the Ontario environment ministry between 2005 and 2009 .
In many Great Lakes areas , high levels of mercury , PCBs , pesticides , dioxins and furanes were found in medium - sized and large fish ( 55 to 75 centimetres long ) such as salmon , trout and carp .
Lake Huron catches showed some improvement but even there , cautions remained for larger fish .
Lake Ontario was less lucky , with 40 per cent of advisories saying eating certain fish in any quantity is unsafe .
Many cautions targeted small and medium - sized fish , considered a disturbing trend .
" In the last two years , however , advisories for smaller fish in Lake Ontario levelled off , " he said .
The " Up to the Gills " report can be seen at Environmental Defence 's website .
I steal things .
It ’s what I do .
I ’m a rogue .
Sometimes the people I take things from are alive when I take them , sometimes they are n’t .
I do n’t need a job .
I do n’t want a profession .
I decided when I created Elsinne that the only profession she would need is first aid , and that was for survivability purposes .
Can you imagine a rogue sitting in a shop making sewing boots or jackets for people ?
I shudder at the thought .
What if I need a jacket for myself ?
Then I ’ll take it from somebody else .
Elsinne hit level 18 last night and I have been having great success at the auction house thus far just selling things I ’ve stumbled across in my travels .
I ’m above skinning dead animals .
I refuse to pick flowers .
And I ’ll die before you catch me digging up rocks for money .
I ’m just selling cloth , glasses of ice cold milk , or uncommon weaponry I find on people .
And it ’s been working out .
I ’ve got about 35 gold right now , which is pretty impressive since I have n’t been farming drops or anything .
So far pickpocketing has n’t gotten me much more than health potions , but it ’s fun to take a troll ’s thirteen copper , the only money they have in the world , and then shank them afterwards .
Many online have been working very hard to bring news of Iran and the events after the election , and one of those methods is to upload and spread news of videos of the protests and other related events .
One nearly effortless way to promote a video is to give it a high rating which may result in it making this list for example .
At first glance , the ratings system seems pretty straightforward : videos go from awesome to pretty cool , to worth watching , then nothing special , and finally poor .
There 's a problem with this though - take a video like this one .
It 's a somewhat grainy video called Basij Militia driving truck through the Iranian protesters " .
It 's definitely a video that the world needs to see , but it just does n't feel right to give the video an Awesome !
rating .
There 's nothing awesome about a truck being driven into protesters , and the image quality is not awesome ; nevertheless , it 's a video that needs to be promoted .
When you think about it , giving a video five stars simply means " more people should see this video " and one star means " I would n't recommend this to anyone " .
At the moment there 's a bit of confusion when you see a video of something you do n't like but think should be seen by others -- as another example , let 's say you 're a supporter of a political candidate and you see his opponent saying something dumb - do you give it five stars because others should see it or do you give it one star because you do n't like the person ?
Therefore the ratings should probably be replaced with something like the following :
*****
Must see video
**** Recommended
*** Worth watching ( this one can stay the same )
** Not recommended
* Stay away
Now the ratings system is clear - you 're either telling others to watch the video or not .
As for where to suggest this - perhaps here ?
Let me know if there 's a better place to make the suggestion .
“ Lawmakers , read the bills before you vote , ” by Jeff Jacoby ( Boston Globe )
This “ Read the Bills ” movement has finally cut through political pretensions to reveal that there is no “ deliberative democracy ” in the USA .
Apparently , members of Congress are simply asked to “ react ” or express “ feelings ” or channel interest - group concerns about broad notions like global warming , the economy , energy , and so on .
Not that democracy is an unalloyed good , but words ought to mean what they say .
Otherwise , William Graham Sumner was right about “ public servants ” throwing the Constitution overboard :
If you take away the Constitution , what is American liberty and all the rest ?
Nothing but a lot of phrases .
. . .
Any member of Congress who refuses , then “ guffaws , ” at the notion of “ reading bills ” is a candidate for expulsion from Congress .
“ Aye , there ’s the rub ” : who will read the bill of particulars against the scoundrel who presumes to speak in the name of “ the people ? ”
Who but his fellow scoundrels , who have continually mocked thoughtful , active , ongoing deliberation ?
The Waxman - Markey bill ( mentioned in above article ) is a perfect example of the oligarchy in D.C. : fancy preambles with flights of prose followed by blank pages to be filled in later by a few “ leaders ” of Congress .
My worst students cannot read , write , or put together an extended argument for a position .
In place of reason or analysis , they offer “ feeling ” or what they are told third - hand .
To wit :
They are perfect future congressmen ( women ) of America .
The best history students grapple with the primary stuff of history , its original intent , changing meaning , and significance .
In the future , what can they “ read ” in between the pages of congressional acts ?
They cannot assume anything when few people had anything to do with the bill , and obscure bureaucrats file enabling regulations that carry enormous significance for future generations , all hidden from public view .
I ’m sure we will be told that “ Read the Bill ” is not “ on the up - and - up . ” Right wingers must be behind it because they want to slow down the work of Congress .
Leave aside the bare fact that Congress is not working and we still have ample exhibits of “ right - wing ” laws ( e.g. , USA PATRIOT Act ) that sprang surprises on the Left because “ we do n’t read those things . ”
I have researched the papers of men and women in nine presidential libraries , along with the records of many congressional committees .
What impresses me is how little the White House and Congress know about the functioning of government .
Some say that government has become too big to be safe ( the Left ) or efficient ( the Right ) .
I say government has become too big for democracy .
If that is true , why bother voting ?
Heresy , but there is an argument for “ those who refuse to vote . ”
( See Carl Watner and Wendy McElroy ’s The Dissenting Electorate ) .
In short , our long march into oligarchy reminds me of the Old Whig slogan ( I am working from memory ) :
“ Man is free on election day , and everywhere in chains between elections . ”

The End of Liberalism : The Second Republic of the United States ( 1969 ) , by Theodore J.

In a high - profile policy address before the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the US would n’t not hesitate to use its military to “ defend our friends , our interests , and above all , our people ” during the segment discussing Iran .
She elaborated on the declaration with “ this is not an option we seek nor is it a threat ; it is a promise . ”
Clinton also warned Iran that the US offer to hold talks , which she had previously said she did n’t expect to work to begin with , would not be open - ended and that “ our willingness to talk is not a sign of weakness . ”
Today ’s comments are the latest in a long line of bellicose rhetoric coming from the Secretary of State .
Last month during a television interview she said that Iran was risking the possibility of a US invasion , citing the disastrous 2003 invasion of Iraq as a model .
The US has been demanding that the Iranian government abandon its civilian nuclear energy generation program , and several officials have claimed , despite a stark lack of evidence , that Iran is working on nuclear weapons .
The IAEA has pointed out no evidence for the accusation exists , and America ’s own National Intelligence Estimate says they do n’t believe Iran has an active weapons program either .
Der Innenausschuss des Bundestags hat mit den Stimmen der großen Koalition den Weg frei gemacht für eine zusammengestrichene Variante der geplanten Novellierung des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes .
Der jetzt beschlossene Gesetzesentwurf enthält umfangreiche Änderungen gegenüber der ursprünglichen Fassung , mit der die Bundesregierung auf die jüngsten Datenschutzskandale reagieren und vor allem die Einflussmöglichkeiten der Bürger auf die Verwendung ihrer personenbezogenen Daten stärken wollte .
Die Fraktionen von Linken und Grünen votierten gegen das lange umkämpfte Vorhaben .
Die FDP - Fraktion enthielt sich .
Vom ursprünglich vorgesehenen Opt - in - Prinzip zur Weitergabe persönlicher Daten für Werbung , Markt - und Meinungsforschung sind nur Reste übrig geblieben .
Das Kabinett hatte das sogenannte " Listenprivileg " als überholt angesehen , das die Verwendung personenbezogener Daten zu Zwecken der Werbung , Markt - und Meinungsforschung in gewissem Umfang ohne Einwilligung der Betroffenen erlaubt .
Laut dem Beschluss des Innenausschusses dürfen listenmäßig erfasste Daten wie etwa Name , Beruf , Adresse , Geburtsjahr oder Titel aber weiterhin auch ohne Zustimmung weitergegeben werden .
Die Weitergabe müsse künftig aber grundsätzlich zwei Jahre dokumentiert werden .
Betroffene müssen über gespeicherte Daten und deren Herkunft informiert werden .
Damit soll es ihnen leichter gemacht werden , der Weitergabe und der Nutzung ihrer Daten wirksam zu widersprechen .
Weite Ausnahmen zur Datenerhebung und - speicherung gibt es für Zwecke der Markt - oder Meinungsforschung .
Deutlich konkretisiert und präzisiert wird die Dokumentations - und Überwachungspflicht des Auftraggebers bei der Datenverarbeitung durch Drittfirmen oder Detekteien , wie sie etwa die Deutsche Bahn durchführen ließ und damit in die Bredouille geriet .
Für Verstöße werden in diesem Fall sowie bei nicht erfolgten Dokumentationen neue Bußgeldtatbestände geschaffen .
Ohne Einschränkung gestattet wird die Eigenwerbung mit eigenen Kundendaten , die im Rahmen einer Vertragsbeziehung erhoben wurden .
Die Sicherheit von Daten soll durch Vorschriften zur Verschlüsselung verbessert werden .
Hervorgehoben wird zudem die Pflicht gemäß dem Prinzip der Datensparsamkeit , personenbezogene Informationen möglichst zu anonymisieren oder Pseudonyme zu verwenden .
Wird unrechtmäßig Kenntnis von sensiblen Daten erlangt und besteht ein erhebliches Missbrauchsrisiko , so sind die Betroffenen und die Aufsichtsbehörde zu informieren .
Dies hat etwa bei Kreditkartendaten öffentlich zu geschehen .
Gestärkt werden soll zudem die Stellung der betrieblichen Datenschutzbeauftragten , für die weit reichende Kündigungsschutzvorschriften vorgesehen sind .
Daneben werden die Aufsichtsbehörden künftig bei Verstößen gegen Datenschutzregelungen nicht mehr nur Bußgeldverfahren mit nun höheren Bußgeldern einleiten können .
Vielmehr dürfen sie auch anordnen , dass der entsprechende Verstoß eingestellt wird .
Dabei ist für solche Fälle die Möglichkeit der Gewinnabschöpfung vorgesehen .
Die zunächst geplanten , von Datenschützern und vom Bundesrat scharf kritisierten Regelungen zur Einführung eines bundesweiten Datenschutzaudits hat Schwarz - Rot komplett gestrichen .
Hier soll nach dem Willen der Koalition zunächst ein dreijähriges Pilotprojekt durchgeführt wertden .
Inkrafttreten sollen die komplexen Regeln Anfang September .
Ausnahmen gelten für das neue Auskunftsrecht der Betroffenen und die ergänzten Bußgeldbewehrungen , die vom 1 .
April 2010 an gelten sollen .
Übergangsregelungen teils bis 2012 sind zudem für die Neufassung des Listenprinzips enthalten .
Die Auswirkungen der Änderungen soll die Bundesregierung zeitnah evaluieren .
Die doch noch erzielte Einigung bezeichnete ein Sprecher der CDU / CSU - Fraktion als " Prototyp eines Kompromisses " .
Nach Meinung der SPD - Fraktion kommt es durch das Gesetz zu " keinen Nachteilen , aber vielen Fortschritten " .
Mit dem " schwierigen Werk " habe die Koalition eine " Öffnung für Datenschutzrechte " erreicht .
Als " Schritt in die richtige Richtung " schätzte die FDP - Fraktion den geänderten Entwurf ein .
Es wären aber weitere Schritte sinnvoll gewesen .
Die Linksfraktion kann " keine substanziellen Verbesserungen " erkennen .
Auch aus Sicht der Grünen hat die Koalition den " ambitionierten " Vorstoß der Regierung derart " verwässert " , dass der Datenschutz darin nur noch in " homöopathischer Dosierung " erkennbar sei .

The challenge of telling one 's Christian family that one is an atheist for the first time is not something anyone should take lightly .
This is an anxiety - provoking subject for many good reasons , and while many people report that it went better than they anticipated , there is some real risk involved .
The outcome is not always positive , and particularly for teenagers still living at home , the consequences can be devastating .
What I 've tried to do in this post is offer some tips on how to prepare for the process .
And yes , I think this is best approached deliberately as a process rather than as something someone blurts out in a moment of frustration .
Initial Considerations
For big and scary decisions like this , it is often helpful to consider the pros and cons of making such a disclosure .
The idea is that if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks , one feels more confident in moving forward .
Unfortunately , this is a situation where it is not always easy to assess the risks accurately .
If you are trying to decide if and how best to disclose your atheism to your family , I recommend that you start by asking yourself the following questions and considering what your answers suggest :
How old are you , and if you are living in your parents ' home , how many more years do you expect to live there ?
If you imagine your family 's Christian beliefs ranging on a continuum from progressive to extremist , where would you place them ?
If you imagine yourself remaining silent and not disclosing your atheism for another year , how tolerable vs. intolerable does doing so seem ?
That is , how critical is it that you make the disclosure now as opposed to a year from now ?
What is your motive for disclosing your atheism ?
As we look through these and examine your answers , the picture may become a bit clearer .
For those under the age of 18 , I am generally comfortable with saying that the younger you are the more likely I would be to advise you to postpone your disclosure .
For those over 18 , the situation changes dramatically ( see For the Adult Atheist below ) .
In addition to considering these questions one - by - one , think about their interaction .
For example , if you are 14 and expect to be in your parents ' home for at least another 4 years , you may want to give yourself a couple more years before disclosing your atheism if you rated your family in the fundamentalist to extremist range of the belief continuum , especially if you also perceive your current situation as fairly tolerable .
On the other hand , a 14 year - old in a fairly progressive family who cannot imagine remaining silent any longer may decide to speak out sooner .
For the Adult Atheist
If you are over 18 and not residing with your parents or planning to move out soon , your situation becomes much simpler because your level of risk tends to be considerably lower .
Consideration # 1 and # 3 become irrelevant , leaving you to focus on # 2 and # 4 .
Even then , # 2 is relevant only with regard to how you might make your disclosure .
Since there has been a tremendous amount written about coming out by LGBT authors , this is a great place to start .
For the adult atheist , the power dynamics are vastly different , the risk is lower , and one has far more control over how to navigate the aftermath .
Regardless of your age , disclosing one 's atheism to one 's family is often one of the most dreaded experiences many atheists will face .
While it is certainly safer to wait until one is an adult and no longer living in one 's parents ' home before choosing to reveal one 's atheism , age does not always make the experience of doing so any easier .
It is quite normal to be fearful of making such a disclosure even as a young adult who is no longer living in the family home .
Our anxiety tends to focus on the manner in which disclosing atheism may affect how we are perceived and treated by our family .
It is important to recognize that the impact of such a disclosure may be much broader than this .
The way in which many faith communities shield members from outsiders in order to prevent exposure to contrary ideas often means that someone disclosing atheism risks more than the disapproval of the immediate family .
The disclosure of atheism to one 's family may entail losing access to one 's entire support network .
As Richard Collins wrote at End Hereditary Religion ( update : link no longer active ) ,
Depending upon how insular their faith community was , leaving can be a wrenching , depressing experience that they face alone .
The church and the people they have known all their lives are often the newly converted apostate ’s only friends .
Since leaving is seen as disloyal and a betrayal , their friends often abandon them .
Millions of people leave a faith community every year and the pain they suffer is one of the dark shameful secrets that goes unrevealed in the major media and that is systematically covered up by the churches .
For more on this important subject , see :
This was originally two separate posts both written in 2009 that were combined into this post in 2020 .
Six months into Barack Obama ’s presidency , the U.S. public ’s display of antiwar sentiment has faded to barely a whisper .
Despite Obama ’s vow to withdraw all combat forces from Iraq before September 2011 , he plans to leave up to 50,000 troops in " training and advisory " roles .
Meanwhile , nearly 130,000 troops remain in that country and more than 50,000 U.S. soldiers occupy Afghanistan , with up to an additional 18,000 approved for deployment this year .
So where is the resistance ?
In independent journalist Dahr Jamail ’s The Will to Resist : Soldiers Who Refuse to Fight in Iraq and Afghanistan ( Haymarket Books ) , Jamail profiles what may ultimately prove to be the United States ’ most effective antiwar movement : the soldiers themselves .
During the early years of the Iraq war , Jamail traveled to Iraq alone and reported as an unembedded freelance journalist .
Over four visits , Jamail documented the war ’s effects on Iraqi civilians in Beyond the Green Zone ( 2007 ) .
Although he is a fierce critic of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. mainstream media , which he says served as a " cheerleader " for war , Jamail admits he was raised to admire the military .
However , after covering the war from Iraq between 2003 and 2005 , Jamail was enraged by what he calls " the heedless and deliberate devastation [ he ] saw [ the U.S. military ] wreak upon the people of Iraq . "
Back in the U.S. , traveling the country speaking out against the war , Jamail met scores of soldiers who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and found that he shared with them a " familiar anguish " which drove him to further explore their motivations as soldiers .
In doing so , he opens the door to a growing subculture of internal dissent that is increasingly bubbling up and spilling over the edge of an otherwise ultra- disciplined , highly controlled military society .
" The soldiers I spoke with while working on this book are some of the most ardent antiwar activists I have ever met , " Jamail told IPS .
" Having experienced the war firsthand , this should not come as a surprise . "
In The Will to Resist , Jamail profiles individual acts of resistance that he envisions as the possible seeds of a broader antiwar movement .
The book is filled with stories of soldiers who refuse missions deemed " suicidal , " go AWOL , flee abroad , refuse to carry a loaded weapon , even arrange to be shot in the leg  and those who in a final act of desperation commit suicide .
Soldiers who refuse to deploy or follow orders risk court - martial , prison time , dishonorable discharge , and loss of veteran ’s medical benefits , yet an increasing number of active - duty soldiers and veterans are willing to do so .
Rather than accept a mission almost certain to bring death , some troops simply refuse to follow orders .
Jamail describes soldiers in Iraq on " search and avoid " missions who grew adept at giving the appearance of going out on patrol when , in fact , they were lying low , catching up on sleep , and trying to avoid being killed .
Jamail quotes one Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as saying , " Dissent starts as simple as saying , ‘ This is bullshit .
Why am I risking my life ? ’ "
Soldiers tell Jamail that incidents of refusing orders are unremarkable and " pretty widespread , " to which he responds , " It is also understandable why the military does not want more soldiers or the public to know about them . "
" Army Specialist Victor Agosto , who served a year in Iraq , has recently publicly refused orders to deploy to Afghanistan , " Jamail told IPS , " and the Army , due to the threat of more soldiers and the broader public learning of this , backed away from giving Agosto the harshest court - martial possible , to one of the lightest . "
Jamail also dedicates two chapters to soldiers who stand up to systemic misogyny and homophobia in the military .
Extensive interviews with female soldiers detail a pervasive culture of institutionalized " command rape , " harassment , abuse , and assault , which , in a number of high - profile cases ( and many more unknown ) end in ostracism , coercion , demotion , suicide , and murder .
Citing studies from professional medical journals that offer a grim assessment of sexual intimidation and abuse within the U.S. military , Jamail writes , " According to the group Rape , Abuse , and Incest National Network , one in six women in the United States will be a victim of sexual assault in her lifetime .
In the military , at least two in five will .
In either case , at least 60 percent of the cases go unreported . "
As Jamail recounts horrific cases of violence toward women in the military , he notes the irony of frequent claims that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are " liberating " women of those Muslim countries .
Like female soldiers , gay and lesbian service men and women are targeted for harassment and abuse .
Jamail meets soldiers who , under the " Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell " policy , must conceal their true identity , falsely posing as straight while battling internal conflicts about their own roles in the military .
In the blunt language of the soldiers , Jamail describes the military experience as a process of dehumanization .
" The primary objective appeared to be to mistreat and dehumanize your guys [ fellow soldiers ] , " one Marine says .
" I could not do it , not to my men and not to those people .
I like the Iraqis , I like the Afghanis .
Why were we treating them like sh*t ?
That is when I really started questioning what the hell was going on . "
For many soldiers , however , the pain of war is simply too much to bear and so they choose their own final discharge : suicide .
In an emotionally exhausting chapter , Jamail cites statistics from the Army Suicide Event Report , which states that active - duty military suicides have risen to their highest rates since the Army started tracking self - inflicted deaths in 1980 , and the numbers are growing .
Documenting the phenomenon of " suicide by cop , " Jamail quotes from a Post Traumatic Distress Syndrome ( PTSD ) - wracked veteran ’s pre-" suicide "
Internet article in which he wrote , " We come home from war trying to put our lives back together but some cannot stand the memories and decide that death is better .
We kill ourselves because we are so haunted by seeing children killed and whole families wiped out . "
Contemplating the long - term implications of the more than 1.8 million military personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan , Jamail points out that the United States , for many years to come , will be faced with caring for tens of thousands of veterans whose lives are permanently marred by grave physical and traumatic brain injuries , psychological scars , PTSD , and a host of associated problems ranging from divorce and substance abuse to domestic violence , homelessness , and run-ins with the law .
Other soldiers manage to cope somehow and , perhaps in a sense , recover .
Following their discharge , some veterans profiled by Jamail seek to make peace with themselves by educating others about the realities they experienced in war .
The most successful and constructive of military efforts to resist war are made by those who turn their experiences into teaching tools and therapeutic exercises like music , video , theater , painting , books , blogs , photographic and art exhibitions , performance art , and even making paper out of old military uniforms .
In a chapter titled " Cyber Resistance , " Jamail contends the Internet " is probably the first time that we have available to us an inexpensive and extremely inclusive means to communicate and thereby advocate sustained resistance to unjust military action , at an international scale without losing any gestation time . "
Web sites like YouTube , Facebook , Flickr , Twitter , Blogspot , and countless alternative news sources have given soldiers and veterans both a voice and the means to connect with those Jamail calls " fence - sitters , members of the silent majority and well - intentioned but resource - less individuals to participate in the promise of a historical transformation . "
" While we do n’t have an organized GI resistance movement today that is anywhere close to that which helped end the Vietnam War , " Jamail said , " the seeds for one are there , and they are continuing to sprout amidst a soil that is becoming all the more fertile by the escalation of troops in Afghanistan , the lack of withdrawal in Iraq , and an increasingly over - stretched military . "
( Inter Press Service )
It 's no longer uncommon for an individual to have multiple cameras , and to use those cameras with a computer .
People often have a point - and - shoot , a cell phone with camera functionality , and maybe even a DSLR for different picture - taking scenarios .
Chances are , however , that people do n't do the same thing with pictures from each camera .
While iPhoto may cut it for a point - and - shoot , you may need Aperture or Lightroom to deal with the .raw images from a DSLR .
Mac OS
X lets you decide which application you want to open when a image device is connected , but it does n't let you chose what happens on a per-camera basis .
It sure would be nice if you could assign an application to each individual camera , would n't it ?
Enter Cameras , a freeware solution for OS X that allows you to do just that .
Cameras is a preference pane that allows users to assign specific applications to open when a camera , iPhone , or card reader is connected .
This might not be for you if you just launch iPhoto whenever you connect your camera , but if you have a point - and - shoot for family outings and a DSLR for professional work , the preference pane can save you some time and headaches .
Watch out if you rely on a card reader , though : when I connected my 8 - in - 1 USB card reader , I was n't able to change which software came up .
Instead , I was asked what I wanted to do every time it 's plugged in .
In its current state , there will be people who are thrilled with the enhancement that comes from Cameras , but there are still a few features left to be desired .
For example , I 'm willing to bet that Cameras is n't compatible with the Eye - Fi .
Also , the pane is n't compatible with the Flip Ultra , ( I understand the Flip does n't take still photos , but it would still be a nice feature ) .
This makes me wonder if it works with similar devices that do take still images , like the Kodak Zi6 .
I would also like to see the preference pane treat image readers as cameras based on the metadata on the media inserted .
It is n't perfect , but Cameras is a great solution for many pro and casual photographers .
And it is free — a hard price to match for software that many would be willing to pay for .

This monograph was produced under the auspices of CIA 's Center for the Study of Intelligence and the Harvard University program for Studies of Intelligence and Policy .
The idea was to examine the role of signals intelligence * in US military planning during the final stages of the war with Japan in 1945 -- particularly its contribution to planning for an Allied invasion of the Japanese homeland .
This study was not intended as an argument for or against the use of the atomic bomb against Japan .
Obviously , the importance of the bomb in concluding the war was of such magnitude that it is not plausible to examine intelligence related to invasion planning without addressing the question of whether and to what extent that same intelligence might have influenced the decision to drop the bomb .
It also is not plausible to argue that the military calculus concerning an invasion of Japan does not bear directly on evaluations of the bomb decision .
Nonetheless , the debates and historical studies supporting or condemning the use of the bomb involve factors that go well beyond the scope of this monograph .
The study 's basic objective is not to pass judgment on the decisions that were made , but rather to examine the intelligence that was available at the time and to weigh the role this intelligence played or might have played in the deliberations on an invasion .
The author wishes to express his appreciation to those who reviewed drafts of this study and provided constructive comments -- particularly military historian Edward Drea .
* In modern intelligence parlance , the term signals intelligence , or SIGINT , is often used to refer to a broad range of intercepted communications .

Japan 1945
As World War II progressed in the Pacific , the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) confronted the prospect that getting an unconditional surrender from Japan might require invading the Japanese homeland .
A number of key Navy and Army Air Force officers led by Fleet Admiral Ernest King , Chief of Naval Operations , and General H. H. " Hap " Arnold , Chief of the Army Air Force , argued that a combination of sea blockade and aerial bombardment could produce a Japanese surrender without the need for a ground invasion .
Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall and his Army planners , however , believed that Japan 's surrender on the terms being demanded by the Allies could be assured only by invasion of its home territory .
Both sides made legitimate arguments , but the debate also appears to have reflected organizational competition .
Examining the Options
By mid-1944 a consensus had begun to develop on the need at least to plan and prepare for an invasion , even though some officials evidently continued to believe there was a good chance it would not have to be carried out .
In early July the JCS approved a report by its Joint Planning Staff ( JPS ) that said unconditional surrender was to be achieved by undermining Japan 's ability and will to resist through sea and air blockades , intensive air bombardments , and destruction of Japanese air and naval strength -- and ultimately by invading and seizing objectives in the Japanese industrial heartland .
The report called for invasion of the Ryukyu island of Okinawa and the " home " island of Kyushu in order to establish bases for a decisive ground invasion of the Tokyo Plain , the region around the Japanese capital on the central island of Honshu .
This report became the basis for an agreed statement at the Roosevelt - Churchill meetings in Quebec during September 1944 .
That pronouncement defined Allied military objectives in the Pacific as " invading and seizing objectives in the heart of Japan , " after " establishing [ a ] sea and air blockade , conducting intensive air bombardment , and destroying Japanese air and naval strength . "
The US military leadership did not treat the situation as an " either - or " choice of invasion versus blockade and bombardment , but rather as a melding of the two strategic concepts .
For General Marshall and those on the planning staffs who agreed with his view , the JCS / JPS report and the Quebec statement amounted to a commitment to plan , prepare , and ultimately carry out the actions they believed would be necessary to gain Japan 's surrender on the " unconditional " terms demanded by the Allies .
For Admiral King and General Arnold , the Roosevelt - Churchill declaration was a commitment to continue and even intensify their campaign of aerial destruction and naval strangulation .
They saw an invasion of Kyushu -- if it should prove necessary -- as a means of gaining bases from which to launch an even more devastating air and sea campaign and thereby produce a surrender without having to mount a ground invasion of the Tokyo Plain .
The debate nonetheless continued through the rest of 1944 and the first few months of 1945 .
Admiral King , while nominally sticking to the position that the end - game would be an invasion of the Japanese homeland , advocated various operations to be undertaken between the seizure of Okinawa and the invasion of Kyushu - - for example , attacks on small islands and coastal areas of Japanese - occupied China between Formosa ( Taiwan ) and Japan .
Some analysts have postulated -- plausibly -- that these operations were seen by their advocates as a way of creating more time for the bomb - and - blockade campaign to produce the surrender they believed could be obtained without an invasion of the homeland .
Considerable debate also took place on the question of an amphibious assault on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido .
The strategic outline accepted by the Joint Chiefs in July 1944 had specifically named Kyushu as the site for the initial invasion .
But some planners -- with support from General Arnold -- argued for attacking Hokkaido first .
Although these discussions initially focused on Hokkaido as an interim step between Okinawa and Kyushu , the debate evolved into an examination of Hokkaido as an alternative to Kyushu .
Nearly all members of the Joint War Plans Committee ( see footnote 2 ) , however , strongly supported targeting Kyushu rather than Hokkaido .
They also objected strenuously to any diversion of resources toward an interim operation .
Invasion Preparations Begin
On 3 April 1945 the Joint Chiefs formally directed Gen. Douglas MacArthur , then Commander in Chief of US Army Forces in the Pacific ( CINCPAC ) , and Adm.
Chester Nimitz , Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet and the Pacific Ocean Area ( CINCPOA ) , to develop plans and begin preparations for an invasion of Kyushu .
This was strictly a planning directive , not an order for implementation .
Even at this stage , Admiral King and Adm.
William Leahy ( who was Chief of Staff for the President and who functioned as ex officio chairman of the JCS ) remained reluctant to treat the invasion decision as a fait accompli .
While not directly opposing an invasion , they continued to advocate intermediate objectives along the China coast .
But with the invasion of Okinawa in early April 1945 , US military and civilian leaders clearly felt growing pressure to nail down the next step in the Pacific strategy .
By the end of April , agreement was reached that instructions would be formulated for Pacific commanders to proceed with an invasion of Kyushu .
Invasion Date Set , Commander Named
Still to be resolved was the naming of an overall commander for the invasion .
The choice was between the Army 's General MacArthur and the Navy 's Admiral Nimitz .
While this was being worked out , MacArthur and Nimitz issued a joint recommendation on one point on which they did agree -- that the target date for invading Kyushu should be 1 November 1945 .
The planning directive of 3 April had given 1 December as the invasion date for Kyushu and 1 March 1946 for Honshu .
Both MacArthur and Nimitz argued that scheduling the invasion of Kyushu as late as 1 December would subject the operation to weather uncertainties that could cause it to be set back to the spring of 1946 , creating a significant delay in ending the war .
On 25 May 1945 the JCS finally sent a directive assigning MacArthur " primary responsibility for the conduct of Operation OLYMPIC " ( the codename for the Kyushu invasion ) and setting the date as 1 November .
The invasion of Honshu ( codenamed CORONET ) remained slated for 1 March 1946 .
[ Top of page ]
In mid-1944 , as the planning process was picking up momentum , the Japanese Army forces that US intelligence had identified on Kyushu consisted of only one combat division and two depot divisions .
( A combat division was the principal mixed - weapon ground combat unit of the Japanese Army , with a troop complement of 16,000 .
Depot divisions essentially were pre-positioned stocks of equipment and weapons , garrisoned by manpower pools and training staffs ; their roles included marshalling replacement forces and creating new combat divisions . )
The US War Department 's Military Intelligence Service ( MIS ) believed that more than half of the Japanese military personnel then on Kyushu were Navy ground troops and ground support personnel of the Army and Navy air forces .
Japan 's 16th Area Army Headquarters , located in northwestern Kyushu , exercised overall command on the island .
As part of the planning process in mid-1944 , the Joint Intelligence Committee ( see footnote 2 ) projected that by the time of the contemplated invasion in autumn 1945 , the Japanese would have augmented their Army ground forces on Kyushu to six combat divisions while also maintaining the two depot divisions .
The Committee estimated that once the invasion began , the Japanese might be able to reinforce the six combat divisions with up to four more , but that ten was about the maximum they could sustain because of geography and supply constraints .
This projection would remain the agreed forecast until mid-1945 .
SIGINT Provides the Window
Knowledge of the strength and disposition of Japanese defenses that would be encountered in an invasion was heavily dependent on intercepted communications .
Allied intelligence services had no effective agents or spy networks in the homeland , nor were there Western sympathizers with access to this kind of information in any detail .
Aerial reconnaissance played an important role in detecting force movements and identifying physically definable targets such as aircraft , airbases , and concentrations of weapons and vehicles .
Its overall utility , however , was constrained by weather , darkness , and technology .
Prisoner - of - war interrogations had been a source of intelligence for Allied forces throughout the Pacific campaign , but prisoners available as of the spring of 1945 had little if any knowledge about measures being undertaken for the defense of the main islands .
US intelligence units had been intercepting and decrypting Japanese diplomatic communications since well before the outbreak of World War II .
Intelligence of this kind was obtained on a regular basis ( with short interruptions as the Japanese changed their encryption systems ) from 1935 to the end of the war .
Japanese naval communications had been deciphered from the beginning of the war in the Pacific .
But it was not until April 1943 that a major break was achieved in deciphering Japanese Army ground communications , and significant quantities of this high - grade cipher message traffic did not begin to be available to US intelligence staffs until the end of that year .
Evidence of Japanese Preparations
In the weeks following the dispatch of the planning directive to MacArthur and Nimitz on 3 April 1945 , intercepted communications already were showing that the Japanese were expecting attempts to invade their homeland .
A message sent by the German naval attaché in Japan , for example , described a report by the Japanese concerning their preparations for Allied landings in the homeland .
The report said they expected an assault on Okinawa " shortly " and anticipated that the Allies ultimately would mount an attack on the Tokyo Plain .
It quickly became clear that the Japanese had identified Kyushu as a likely invasion site .
Messages in early April 1945 dealt with Japanese mining of harbors and coastal areas of Kyushu and the evacuation of civilians from Kyushu's " areas of coastal defense . "
Other communications dealt with the assignment of suicide aircraft to Kyushu .
Other intercepted messages at that time provided evidence of large - scale Japanese troop movements from the Asian mainland to the Japanese islands .
Based on the listing of vessels involved , intelligence analysts calculated that 30,000 to 60,000 troops were being moved .
By mid-April , intercepts confirmed that one of the units being shifted was a combat division previously identified in Manchuria , and that components of it were already arriving on Kyushu .
At about the same time , other messages noted that units were moving from the Kurils to the main islands , although their specific destinations could not be determined at that point .
An assessment by MacArthur 's intelligence staff near the end of April concluded : " It is apparent [ that the Japanese ] now consider invasion certain if not imminent , " and that their troop movements and unit dispositions reflected preparations for an all - out defense of their homeland .
The report said new combat formations were being created on the main islands , the flow of reinforcements to outlying areas had ceased , " troops guarding the close approaches to Japan [ such as Okinawa ] were dying in place in desperate delaying actions , " and Japanese forces were being sent from Manchuria to Japan " to provide strength for a final defense of the Empire . "
In early - to - mid - May , with the completion of the movement of the combat division from Manchuria to Kyushu , the US Military Intelligence Service estimated the number of Japanese troops on the island to be 246,000 , including 128,000 in Army ground force units .
The Intelligence Service estimated that the four additional divisions expected by 1 November , along with a requisite increase in support units , would add roughly 100,000 more Army ground troops .

On the 12 May figures , see SRH 195 , Bulletin Nos. 62 and 66 .
b MacArthur 's staff gave its own estimate of current ( including the 57th Division ) and future troop strengths .
Its overall current total was slightly less than the MIS figures -- 228,000 rather than 246,000 .
This reflected a lower number of troops ascribed to base and service support functions .
The staff 's projections of Army and Navy ground troops -- 225,000 and 25,000 respectively -- were almost identical to the War Department MIS figures .
MacArthur 's staff thought Japanese Air Force ground support personnel would be cut by as much as 50,000 as air units were removed to locations on other islands from which they could still provide air support with less risk from the invading force .
This difference did not materially affect the ground combat potential in the force projections of the two intelligence services .
This table is Unclassified .
During May and the first half of June , intercepted communications disclosed the movement of two more divisions to Kyushu - - one from Hokkaido and the other from the Korean Peninsula .
Messages also showed that an Army - level headquarters had been established in southern Kyushu and that another was situated in the northern part of the island .
Because normal Japanese organizational practice was to subordinate three combat divisions under an Army headquarters ( roughly comparable to a US Corps ) , US intelligence analysts viewed the discovery of these two headquarters as tending to confirm their long - held projections of six divisions evenly divided between northern and southern Kyushu .
Intercepted communications also continued to reflect preparations for extensive use of suicide tactics .
One series of messages indicated that up to 2,000 obsolete planes and trainers were being assigned to equip and train units for kamikazi missions .
Instructions were issued to outfit biplanes and other older model aircraft with night operations equipment .
Other intercepted transmissions contained information on the construction of underground hangars and new , concealed dispersal airfields on Kyushu -- which the analysts presumed would be used by suicide aircraft .
A message in mid-June contained a Japanese naval base commander 's description of progress being made on construction of suicide boats , and others dealt with measures to disperse and conceal unmanned " boat bombs . "
One intercepted order revealed the presence of a base for piloted suicide torpedoes ( kaiten ) on the southeastern tip of Kyushu .
Also during this period , intercepted messages began revealing the assignment of naval ground support personnel to missions normally performed by Army troops .
These missions included operation of antiaircraft sites around key points such as bridges and roads , and static defense of bases and depots .
A series of transmissions also indicated that one of the units being pulled from the Kuril Islands -- a force below division size that was specially tailored for combatting amphibious assaults -- was headed for southern Kyushu .
As a result of these developments , the US War Department 's Military Intelligence Service in mid-June increased its estimate of Japanese military manpower on Kyushu to 300,000 .
This estimate was disseminated just two days before President Truman was to meet with his senior military advisers to discuss planning for an invasion of Japan .
The force developments it described were still consistent with the projections made a year earlier regarding Japanese forces likely to be defending Kyushu by the time of the planned invasion on 1 November 1945 .

After the German surrender on 8 May 1945 , arrangements were made for Truman , Churchill , and Stalin to meet in Potsdam , on the outskirts of Berlin , to try to settle the postwar arrangements for Europe and to reach agreement on coordinated Allied military operations against Japan .
This Tripartite Conference was scheduled to open on 15 July -- just three months after President Truman had taken office .
A month before the conference , Truman met with his senior advisers to go over plans for ending the war with Japan and to prepare himself for Potsdam .
In a 14 June memorandum to the service chiefs setting up this meeting , his Chief of Staff , Admiral Leahy , said the President wanted to :
. . . discuss details of our campaign against Japan .
He expects at this meeting to be thoroughly informed of our intentions and prospects in preparation for his discussions with Churchill and Stalin .
He wants an estimate of the time required and an estimate of the losses in killed and wounded that will result from an invasion of Japan proper .
He wants an estimate of the time and the losses that will result from an effort to defeat Japan by isolation , blockade , and bombardment by sea and air forces .
It is his intention to make his decision on the campaign with the purpose of economizing to the maximum extent possible in the loss of American lives .
Economy in the use of time and money cost is comparatively unimportant .
I suggest that a memorandum discussion of the above noted points be prepared in advance for delivery to the President at the time of the meeting .
. . .
Leahy 's memorandum was forwarded immediately to the Joint Planning Staff and the Joint War Plans Committee .
The latter body had the task of preparing the initial draft of the paper Leahy had requested for the President .
Centrality of the Casualty Issue
Leahy 's description of Truman 's intent to make his decision on the basis of casualty calculations apparently caught some senior planners offguard .
The archival files of papers for this meeting include a memorandum of a telephone conversation on 14 June between the senior Navy representative on the Joint Planning Staff , Adm .
Donald Duncan , and his Army counterpart , Gen. George A. Lincoln .
Focusing specifically on the " decision " sentence in the Leahy memorandum , Duncan said he found it " a little disturbing . . . it is late in the day to be making decisions . . . when there is a firm directive to do certain things . "
( He was evidently referring to the 25 May directive . )
After Lincoln affirmed that he considered the commitment to the Kyushu operation to be " a matter of fact , " Duncan pointed out that while this commitment may have been made without having been reviewed and cleared by the President , " the Heads of State did approve the overall objective which this directive supports . "
( He was almost certainly referring to the Roosevelt - Churchill meeting in Quebec . )
Discussions among various planners over the next few days focused not only on what the proper casualty estimate would be , but also on whether an estimate should even be offered .
On 15 June 1945 , the Joint War Plans Committee submitted its draft of the requested paper to the Joint Planning Staff .
The paper presented essentially the same case for an invasion of Kyushu that had been made in the earlier debates preceding the operational directive of 25 May .
It also incorporated the same forecast of Japanese forces ( six combat divisions , two depot divisions , 350,000 men ) that had been presented in intelligence estimates going back to mid-1944 .
In response to the presidential request for casualty estimates , the Joint War Plans Committee report laid down strong caveats on uncertainty and emphasized that the level of opposition and the time required to complete the operation could result in major variations .
The report then offered the following figures as an " educated guess " :
Invasion Scenarios Killed Wounded Missing Total Southern Kyushu , followed by Tokyo Plain 40,000 150,000 3,500 193,500 Southern Kyushu - Northwestern Kyushu ( Japan sur-renders ) 25,000 105,000 2,500 132,500 Southern Kyushu - Northwestern Kyushu - Tokyo Plain 46,000 170,000 4,000 220,000
Note :
The JWPC assessment did not give a specific breakdown for each area individually , but a nominal breakdown can be derived by comparing the component figures given for each scenario .
For example , the differences between the second and third scenarios for total casualties and numbers killed are 87,500 and 21,000 , respectively .
The operational difference between these two scenarios is the inclusion or absence of an attack on the Tokyo Plain .
Thus , an interpretation could be made that the estimated casualty total for the attack on the Tokyo Plain was 87,500 , including 21,000 killed .
Subtracting these figures from the first scenario would yield figures for southern Kyushu of 106,000 total casualties and 19,000 killed , and a similar calculation shows 26,500 total casualties and 6,000 killed for northwestern Kyushu .
These breakdowns have been used by some scholars for analysis of the JWPC estimates .
Such calculations , however , need to be read with the caveat that the JWPC figures were scenario - driven .
For example , an estimate for an attack directly on northwestern Kyushu not preceded by an attack on southern Kyushu would probably result in figures that were different from those obtained through this derivative process .
A revised version of the 15 June report was circulated the following day to the Joint Chiefs through the Joint Planning Staff , which had made a few changes to the language .
Although most of these were little more than minor modifications to the wording , there were two important exceptions : the Joint Planning Staff version deleted both the entire casualty estimate table and the figure that showed total US personnel ( 766,700 ) who would be involved in the Kyushu operation .
The JCS draft offered no descriptive language or numbers to replace these deletions .
In an apparent effort to close or narrow the gap between presenting no casualty figures at all and presenting numbers that the Joint Planning Staff was unwilling to use with the President , the Army 's Director of Operations , Maj. Gen. J. E. Hull , asked his staff for casualty figures for operations on Okinawa , Iwo Jima , Leyte and Luzon ( both in the Philippines ) , and " overall figures on MacArthur 's operations to date . "
He said these could be used as background at the upcoming meeting with the President , whom Hull described as " very much disturbed over losses on Okinawa . "
Hull then incorporated the following casualty figures into a summary of the longer report that had been prepared for the President 's meeting .
Islands Invaded Earlier US Killed , Wounded , and MIA Japanese Killed , Prisoners ( Not including wounded ) Ratio ( US to Japanese ) Leyte 17,000 78,000 1:4.6 Luzon 31,000 156,000 1:5 Iwo Jima 20,000 25,000 1:1.25 Okinawa 34,000 ( ground )
7,700 ( Navy ) 81,000
( Not a final count ) *
1:2
* Note :
The struggle on Okinawa was ongoing , and ground force casualties there continued to mount .
The figures were updated in an 11 July report that was made part of the package of background papers for use at the Potsdam Conference , which took place over the latter half of July .
By 11 July , according to the report , the numbers for US casualties on Okinawa since it was invaded in early April had risen to " 39,000 ground , 7,700 Navy " versus a " Japanese total of 119,000 . "
At the same time that General Hull was pulling these figures together , Marshall cabled MacArthur asking for the " estimate you are using for planning purposes on battle casualties in OLYMPIC up to D plus 90 . "
The response from MacArthur 's staff ( received in Washington on 17 June ) projected battle casualties of 50,800 for the first 30 days of the invasion and a total of 105,050 for the first 90 days .
It also anticipated 12,600 nonbattle casualties over the same 90 - day span .
These numbers applied only to operations to seize the southern part of Kyushu .
Marshall then cabled MacArthur again , asking if the figures provided by the latter 's staff were intended purely for planning medical requirements or were actual estimates of battle results .
Marshall prefaced his question by emphasizing Truman 's concern about casualties .
Many readers of the original text of this cable have interpreted it as intending to convey the message that the figures provided by MacArthur 's staff might be viewed as unacceptably high .
The CINCPAC 's answer was delivered to Marshall in time for him to quote from it during the meeting with the President on 18 June .
In this message , MacArthur downplayed the figures his staff had sent earlier , describing them as simply cautious logistic planning estimates and maintaining that actual battle losses were likely to be far less .
He did not , however , include an explicit figure for what he thought the casualty total would be .
MacArthur 's disclaimer notwithstanding , the numbers offered by his staff were very close to the figure for southern Kyushu derived from the estimates contained in the Joint War Plans Committee paper of 15 June .
( See the Note , earlier in this section , accompanying the Joint War Plans Committee 's casualty estimates . )
They were also consistent with a 30 - day casualty estimate prepared by Admiral Nimitz 's staff :
First 30 Days Total MacArthur's Staff 50,800 105,050 Joint War Plans Committee 106,000 Nimitz 's Staff 49,000

Operations , " RG 165 , ABC 384 Japan ( 3 May 1944 )

Presenting the Case
The 18 June meeting with the President was attended by General Marshall , Admiral Leahy , Secretary of War Stimson , Secretary of the Navy Forrestal , Assistant Secretary of War McCloy , Admiral King , Lieutenant General Eaker representing General Arnold , and the recorder , Brigadier General McFarland .
Marshall presented the summary report that General Hull had prepared , including the casualty figures from various operations in the Pacific .
The report also included the judgment that " There is reason to believe that the first 30 days in Kyushu should not exceed the price we have paid for Luzon . "
Admiral Leahy challenged the Luzon comparison ; he contended that the casualty rate from an invasion of Kyushu would be more likely to resemble the experience on Okinawa .
Noting that the rate on Okinawa had been 35 percent , Leahy suggested that applying that percentage to the number of US personnel to be committed to the Kyushu operation would produce a more realistic casualty estimate .
He asked Marshall what the resulting number would be .
Marshall did not respond directly ; he merely stated that the total number of US personnel committed to the Kyushu operation would be 766,700 -- the same number that the Joint Planning Staff had deleted from the Joint War Plans Committee 's draft of 15 June .
The minutes do not show Marshall or any of the other participants taking the logical next step -- calculating what a 35 - percent share of this total would be .
The minutes of the meeting also reflect little discussion of the size of the Japanese forces expected to be encountered in an invasion of Kyushu .
The only reference is a one - sentence statement by Marshall , and even that was made in answer to a question from the President .
Marshall cited the longstanding estimate that by November the Japanese would have eight divisions ( referring to six combat and two depot divisions ) and a total of 350,000 military personnel on Kyushu .
Most of the discussion about Japanese forces focused on prospects for US air and naval forces to succeed in constraining Japanese reinforcement of the island .
Marshall repeatedly emphasized the assessment of the Joint Planners that air and naval power had already reduced movement of Japanese shipping south of Korea and should in the ensuing few months " cut it to a trickle if not choke it off entirely . "
According to Marshall , these judgments were shared by MacArthur and Nimitz .
Later , still reading from the Hull memo , Marshall said that by 1 November " our sea action and air power will have cut Japanese reinforcement capabilities from the mainland to negligible proportions . "
He made the same point when responding to Leahy 's criticism of using Luzon as a model for casualty predictions , stressing that although Japanese reinforcement from other areas was still possible , it was becoming " increasingly difficult and painful . "
President Gives the Okay
Truman 's questions and comments during this exchange reflected his own continuing unease over the level of US casualties .
He asked about the possibility that reinforcements would be sent to Kyushu from other Japanese islands , rather than from the mainland .
Marshall assured him that all avenues for such movement were being cut .
The President also expressed concern that an invasion of the homeland by Americans could carry a racial connotation in the minds of the Japanese that would unite them for a fight to the finish .
Stimson said there was every indication that this would be the case .
At the meeting 's end , Truman said he agreed that the plan presented by the Chiefs was the best choice under the circumstances , but he added that he " had hoped there was a possibility of preventing an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other . "
Truman gave the go - ahead to continue preparations for the Kyushu operation ; he said the decision on a follow - on invasion of Honshu could be made later .
That had been the stance proposed in the paper prepared in advance of the meeting .
The minutes of the meeting indicate that an explicit rationale for this postponement was to enable the President and his advisers to take into account the impact of the Kyushu campaign and the anticipated Soviet entry into the war .
The upcoming test of the atomic bomb may have been an unspoken factor in the Honshu postponement .
Figure 2
Estimated Japanese Dispositions on Kyushu , 9 July 1945
[ Top of page ]
On 7 July , Truman boarded a ship bound for Potsdam , arriving there on the 15th .
Up to the time of his departure for the conference , intelligence had shown the buildup of Japanese forces on Kyushu to be generally consistent with the earlier projections .
As of 18 June -- the day he met with his military chiefs to discuss plans for invading Japan - - only three combat divisions had been fully confirmed on Kyushu , with a fourth believed to be on the way .
By the time Truman reached Potsdam , the presence of the fourth division on Kyushu had been confirmed and two newly created divisions had been discovered , bringing the number of confirmed divisions there to six .
Intercepted communications in this time period continued to show Japanese preparations for extensive use of suicide weapons and tactics .
Messages in late June described additional bases for piloted suicide torpedoes ( kaiten ) and preparations for using oil and gasoline incendiary devices .
Intercepted transmissions in July dealt with the deployment of a flotilla of 940 suicide aircraft to 18 concealed bases on Kyushu , as well as extensive efforts to reconfigure floatplanes for suicide missions .
The same communications also showed training for night suicide attacks .
It was becoming increasingly clear that Japanese naval air elements had been completely turned over to the suicide mission .
All of the Japanese force buildup and other defensive preparations that had been identified on Kyushu up to the start of the Potsdam conference in mid-July fell within the original projections .
But they had been achieved much sooner than expected .
In fact , the estimated manpower level for this force was 375,000 - - 25,000 higher than the forecast provided by Marshall for 1 November .
US Military Intelligence Service analysts , moreover , would subsequently learn that the fifth and sixth Japanese divisions discovered on Kyushu had actually been there as far back as the first week in May .
This meant that at the time of the President 's meeting on 18 June with his senior military advisers , the number of divisions on Kyushu had already reached the level that Marshall gave as the forecast for the situation on an invasion date still more than four months down the road .
One can only speculate as to how much of an impact this information might have had on the discussions at the 18 June meeting had it been known at the time and conveyed to the President .
In any event , the long - held projections would be completely shattered by the end of the first week of the Potsdam Conference .
A Burst of Discoveries
On 21 July the Military Intelligence Service 's daily summary on Japanese forces reported that three entirely new divisions had suddenly been discovered on Kyushu .
Another was discovered within the next few days , bringing the confirmed total to ten combat divisions and two depot divisions .
Intercepted communications provided tenuous evidence that an eleventh combat division was being moved there from Honshu .
Figure 3
Estimated Japanese Dispositions on Kyushu , 2 August 1945
At about this same time , analysis of a series of messages and their addressees disclosed that an Army headquarters , which had formerly controlled Japanese forces on southwestern Formosa , had recently been moved to southern Kyushu .
After this was confirmed , a further review of the messages indicated that this army headquarters ( the 40th ) probably had been on Kyushu since June .
Analysts had been looking for evidence of an additional army - level headquarters because of the number of combat divisions that were showing up in southern Kyushu .
By 2 August , as Truman was beginning his voyage back to the US from Potsdam , the Military Intelligence Service had confirmed the arrival of the eleventh combat division on Kyushu ; it also reported evidence that two more were present or en route .
The intelligence data on the continuing Japanese buildup on the island also included a significant number of specialized combat units below division size -- such as mixed brigades , tank regiments , and artillery brigades -- and a substantial increase in the strength of naval ground troops assigned to defense of bases and support facilities .
The MIS report of 2 August showed that estimated military manpower on Kyushu had reached 534,000 .
As substantial as this increase was , it still did not include the full personnel of the recently confirmed eleventh combat division because analysts believed this division was not yet fully deployed .
Nor did the new estimate include any manpower for the two suspected but yet - to - be - confirmed divisions .
These forces together represented the potential for another 40,000 troops .
SIGINT Picture Raises Concerns for Invasion Plans
These numbers clearly demonstrated that the previously predicted cutoff of Japanese reinforcements -- confidently anticipated by Marshall and others in the 18 June briefing of the President -- had not happened .
A palpable sense of alarm over the implications of this intelligence was exhibited in a paper circulated by the chief of MacArthur 's intelligence staff , Maj. Gen. Charles A. Willoughby , on 29 July :
The rate and probable continuity of Japanese reinforcements into the Kyushu area are changing that tactical and strategic situation sharply .

that one , the 206th , had redeployed south .
The same day , a new division ,
the 351st , was discovered in the north , bringing the total to 12 --
four in the north and eight in the south .

divisions on the island was confirmed after the war .
MacArthur's

a The figures listed in disseminated official estimates for 2 August ( see figure 3 ) included 9,000 additional personnel in Army ground units and 2,000 more in air - ground components .
These forces , however , were not actually on Kyushu ; they were stationed on the outer Ryukyus but had been resubordinated to the 16th Area Army headquarters on Kyushu .
For purposes of consistency over time , such troops from the outer Ryukyus have been excluded from this study 's comparisons of forces on Kyushu at different points in time .
This table is Unclassified .
At least six ( 6 ) additional major units have been picked up in June / July ; it is obvious that they are coming in from adjacent areas over lines of communication that have apparently not been seriously affected by air strikes .
There is a strong likelihood that additional major units will enter the area before target date ; we are engaged in a race against time by which the ratio of attack effort vis -a - vis defense capacity is perilously balanced .
Unless the use of these [ Japanese land and sea ] routes [ to Kyushu ] is restricted by air and / or naval action ... enemy forces in southern Kyushu may be still further augmented until our planned local superiority is overcome , and the Japanese will enjoy complete freedom of action in organizing the area and in completing their preparations for defense .
Referring to the fact that the original estimates had said the projected force of six combat divisions might be reinforced with three or four more " after the operation begins , " the Willoughby report said " these divisions have since made their appearance and the end is not in sight . "
The report acknowledged that some of the new units on Kyushu were at that time not yet fully manned or equipped , but it nonetheless went on to state that " this threatening development , if not checked , may grow to a point where we attack on a ratio of one to one , which is not the recipe for victory . "
This report , moreover , was disseminated before MacArthur 's intelligence staff knew of the tenth and eleventh divisions on Kyushu or of the evidence that at least two more were there or en route .
The intercepted communications also made clear that this buildup had taken place primarily in southern Kyushu , where the US was planning to conduct its landings .
Seven of the eleven identified Japanese divisions and most of the independent brigades and regiments were deployed there .
This meant that the number of Japanese combat divisions and equivalent forces in southern Kyushu was already more than double the number originally forecast for that part of the island ; in fact , it exceeded what had been forecast for all of Kyushu by the invasion date .
US intelligence analysts believed that some 320,000 troops -- about 60 percent of the total estimated to be on the island -- were deployed in the south .
This aspect of the buildup was the focus of an assessment by the intelligence staff of the Sixth Army , which had primary responsibility for ground combat operations in the OLYMPIC operation .
The assessment concluded that the invasion of Okinawa in April had " convinced the Japanese that an assault on southern Kyushu would in all likelihood follow soon afterwards , " and that they consequently had " spared no effort to build up the mobile combat potential in Southern Kyushu . "
The report went on to emphasize that " as many combat divisions . . . have been disposed in Southern Kyushu alone as earlier estimates had computed would be allotted to the whole of Kyushu by [ the ] target date . "
Focusing on the contrast between the level of reinforcement already accomplished and the earlier optimism regarding the ability to cut off any significant movements between the islands , the US Sixth Army 's G - 2 concluded : " [ The ] ever increasing aerial offensive can be expected to hamper the execution of the enemy 's movements and redispositions , [ but ] it cannot . . . prevent such movements from being taken prior to [ invasion ] day . . . . " ( Emphasis added . )
The judgments offered in this report are all the more noteworthy in view of the fact that -- although it was disseminated on 1 August -- the authors were working with data that were more than a week old , and they were unaware of the full extent of the buildup that would be confirmed by the time their report was issued .
Apparently the stark messages being circulated by the various US intelligence staffs received immediate attention , with the implications flagged in memos circulated at senior military planning levels .
Records show , for example , that a summary of the Willoughby report landed on the desk of General Lincoln , who in addition to being the Army 's senior representative on the Joint Planning Staff was Chief of the Strategy and Policy Group of the War Department Operations Division .
The sharply increased numbers presented in the 2 August Military Intelligence Service report were incorporated two days later in a Joint War Plans Committee memorandum to the Joint Planning Staff , recommending that : " The possible effects on OLYMPIC operations of this buildup and concentration " of Japanese forces should prompt US field commanders " to review their estimates of the situation ... and prepare plans for operations against ... alternate objectives . "
Although this memo was cautiously worded , its message was clear : the dimensions of the opposing forces and defensive preparations on Kyushu mandated a fundamental re-examination of US invasion plans .
Even as this memorandum was being disseminated , intercepted messages confirmed another new division and provided further evidence on the two that had been suspected to be moving to Kyushu .
Confirmation of all the communications evidence would bring the total number of divisions on Kyushu up to 14 , more than twice the original estimate .
Nine of these were in or being deployed to the south -- three times the number of divisions that US analysts had initially projected for that part of the island , where the US landings were to take place .
Allowing for partial deployment of these divisions prompted another hike in the Kyushu manpower estimate , this time to 549,000 .
Soon the figure was upped again to 600,000 .
[ Top of page ]
This alarming intelligence picture did not really begin to come together until about the time the Potsdam Conference was getting underway .
The record on how much of it reached the senior US officials there is fragmentary .
It seems likely that at least the basic information on the overall dimensions of the buildup reached the key military advisers and perhaps the President , but even this is an inferential judgment .
What Did They Know and When Did They Know It ?
The buildup of Japanese forces on Kyushu , including the appearance of new combat units , was reported in signals intelligence summaries addressed to senior US policy - makers .
Special channels were set up to handle such material addressed to Potsdam , and a scaled - down map room , modeled on the setup at the White House in Washington for charting such information , was established .
Both Truman and Stimson confirmed in later years that they had received reports in Potsdam on intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications .
In a brief given to the " Tripartite " military chiefs on 24 July , Marshall said troop strength on Kyushu and on the outlying Ryukyu Islands other than Okinawa totaled some 500,000 .
As noted in the footnote with Table 6 , the US Military Intelligence Service was including some forces that were located in the outer Ryukyus in its total of troops " subordinate " to the command on Kyushu .
The total cited by Marshall - - 500,000 - - would have been a rounded version of the fast - rising US estimate of Japanese troops under this command at that time .
Nonetheless , official records of discussions between the President and his key advisers while at Potsdam make no reference to information on the sharply increasing Japanese forces on Kyushu .
Nor do the memoirs and diaries produced by so many of the participants in those discussions .
Admiral Leahy said in his memoirs that " military matters occupied a relatively minor role " in the discussions at Potsdam . "
Some academic specialists have suggested or implied that the absence of references to the intelligence stems from the secrecy imposed on the signals intelligence source material codenamed " ULTRA " -- secrecy that endured well after the war ended :
US military historian Edward Drea , who is generally acknowledged as having carried out perhaps the most extensive research into the use of ULTRA for intelligence on Japanese Army deployments , has pointed out that the sensitive nature of intelligence derived from deciphered Japanese radio messages precluded extensive or explicit note - taking or recorded minutes during planning and decisionmaking sessions .
British scholar Christopher Andrew , who has written extensively on intelligence practices , has said that ULTRA remained so highly classified until nearly 20 years after the end of the war ( " compartmentalized , " in the intelligence lexicon ) that Truman and most of his advisers were not able to cite references to it in their published memoirs .
Their sensitivity to the secrecy of signals intelligence , however , did not constrain Secretaries Stimson and Forrestal from recording in their diaries the fact that they were receiving intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications .
These diary entries are dated at the time they received the information .
Forrestal 's diary material was published openly in 1951 .
Stimson 's was made publicly available shortly thereafter , and excerpts were incorporated into the 1960 unclassified State Department History of Foreign Relations publication on the Potsdam meetings .
In January 1956 , President Truman stated at an open conference that he had known of Japan 's efforts to enlist Soviet help in brokering conditions for ending the war in the Pacific , and that he had been aware of this before Stalin informed him .
Did the SIGINT Picture Affect the Discussions at Potsdam ?
Some scholars also have suggested that knowledge of the level of Japanese reinforcement efforts was reflected in a statement Truman described some years later as having been made by Marshall at Potsdam .
In a 12 January 1953 letter responding to a query from an Air Force historian , the President noted that , after he had learned of the successful nuclear weapon test , he asked Marshall about casualties that would be incurred in carrying the planned invasions through to the Tokyo Plain .
The published version of Truman 's letter states that Marshall told him it would cost " at a minimum one quarter of a million casualties and might cost as much as a million . "
A plausible inference some observers have made is that the fact that these numbers were dramatically higher than those which Marshall had presented at the 18 June meeting with the President was probably the result of knowledge that the Japanese were positioning a much larger defense than had been forecast .
This notion carries a further implication that Marshall 's statement was influential in the decision to use the atomic weapon .
If true , this would establish a link between the intelligence reporting and the decision to drop the bomb .
The origins and validity of the statement attributed to Marshall , however , have been a matter of considerable debate .
The " million " end of the range , in particular , has been widely challenged as being without basis and as a product of an ex post facto campaign to put forth a rationale for having used the atomic bomb .
A review of documents from the Truman Library shows that Truman 's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying " one quarter of a million would be the minimum . "
The " as much as a million " phrase was added to the final draft by Truman 's staff , so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson ( which has been widely challenged ) .
A quarter of a million is roughly the level - - 220,000 - - that the Joint War Plans Committee , in its paper prepared for Truman 's 18 June meeting , had estimated would result if Japan 's surrender required seizing all of Kyushu plus the Tokyo Plain .
As was noted earlier in this study , those figures , taking into account various scenarios and the duration of the operation for which the casualties were estimated , were consistent with estimates made at the same time by the staffs of MacArthur and Nimitz .
To many observers at the time , the quarter - million figure put forward in June by the Joint War Plans Committee could well have seemed intimidating .
By comparison , the combined casualty figure for MacArthur 's campaign through the Philippines , Okinawa , and Iwo Jima was 133,000 .
For Normandy , from D - Day through 48 days of conflict , losses were 63,360 .
For the Battle of the Bulge they were 59,000 .
The casualty estimates for the invasion of Japan had been constructed before the receipt of evidence that defensive forces on Kyushu would be much higher than initially expected .
Even so , they were excluded from the presentation to Truman on 18 June , apparently because of concern over how the President might react .
If , as the evidence seems to show , Marshall was indeed in possession of the latest Kyushu estimates at the time the detailed report of the Alamogordo test was being read in Potsdam ( 21 July ) , he would have known even then ( a ) that the overall number of Japanese combat divisions on Kyushu already exceeded what had been expected by the invasion date still three months away , and ( b ) that the number for the south -- where the landings were to take place -- was at least double what had been forecast .
Under those conditions , it is not unreasonable , as has been argued , to postulate that Marshall could have -- without stretching -- responded to a question on expected casualties by citing estimates that he had known about earlier but had considered higher than he wanted to accept , or higher than he thought the President could accept .
Such an interpretation , while not unreasonable , is nonetheless conjecture .
Whether in fact Marshall actually made such a statement remains a matter of some ambiguity .
And even if one concludes that the intelligence on the Japanese force buildup was fully digested by the US officials in Potsdam , there remains the question of whether and in what way it affected the actions taken there .

On the evening of 16 July -- Truman 's second day at Potsdam - - he received a cryptic notification that the atomic bomb had been successfully tested early that morning at Alamogordo , New Mexico .
On 21 July he received via special courier a detailed report on the test results from Gen. Leslie Groves .
( This was the same day the Military Intelligence Service reported that the number of identified combat divisions on Kyushu had jumped to nine . )
Three days later Gen. Carl Spaatz headed to Guam as the new head of Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific , carrying written instructions for his new command to deliver the first " special bomb " as soon after 3 August as weather permitted .
The document said the instructions were issued " by direction and with the approval of " Stimson and Marshall .
According to General Arnold , the dispatch that initiated the drafting of these instructions was sent to Washington from Potsdam via courier as early as 22 July .
On the morning of the 31st , President Truman was given a cable from Stimson requesting approval of a draft public statement planned for release immediately after the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Japan .
Stimson 's message included an apology for his " haste , " but it added that " the time schedule on General Groves ' project is progressing so rapidly that it is now essential that [ a ] statement for release by you be available not later than Wednesday , 1 August . "
Truman penciled his response on the back of the Stimson cable , and it was sent immediately to Washington .
It said : " Suggestion approved .
Release when ready but not sooner than August 2 " ( i.e. , after Truman 's departure from Potsdam ) .
The President gave this go - ahead two days before the Military Intelligence Service issued its report on " eleven divisions " that was cited in the Joint War Plans Committee 's recommendation for studying " Alternates to OLYMPIC . "
This sequence of events is consistent with the weight of evidence from archival documents and from statements and memoirs of the participants in the Potsdam discussions indicating that for all practical purposes the decision on whether to use the nuclear weapon against Japan had already been reached by the time the President arrived in Potsdam .
On this point virtually all scholars who have studied the issue seem to concur , however much they may disagree on the motives for its use and whether its use was justified .
On 1 June the " Interim Committee " - - a group established by Truman and chaired by Stimson that included political advisers in and out of the government , scientists , and industrialists , with Marshall and Groves also involved -- had recommended to the President that the bomb be used as soon as possible , against a military - industrial target in Japan , and without prior warning .
This was the governing concept during all of the Committee meetings over the next five weeks .
The meetings also featured discussions of drafts and re-drafts of Presidential public statements to be made when the bomb was used .
Debate continued over whether to provide a warning and perhaps a demonstration of the weapon 's devastating power .
Some scientists outside the Interim Committee dissented altogether from the idea of using the new weapon .
But the record shows that Truman agreed with the course of action recommended by the Committee and had every intention of implementing it .
The record of documents and memoirs also shows that , from the time that word of the successful test arrived in Potsdam , the internal discussions there focused on ( 1 ) how soon it would be possible to use the weapon -- including whether it might be ready before the USSR formally entered the war against Japan ; ( 2 ) what would be the first target or targets ( from a short list that had been already drawn up ) ; ( 3 ) the wording of what would become known as the " Potsdam Declaration " , which warned the Japanese of the consequences of not surrendering " unconditionally " and outlined in general terms what that meant ( but did not warn specifically about the atomic bomb ) ; and ( 4 ) the public statement the President should release immediately after the bomb was dropped .
The news of the test also sparked further discussion on whether the USSR 's commitment to the war was still needed and whether and how to inform Stalin of the bomb .
There are , however , no explicit references to the Japanese defensive buildup as a factor in any of these discussions , and no indications that it affected any of the actions taken .
Whether any formal decisionmaking meeting took place among the key Potsdam participants on the subject of using the bomb is itself a question for which the evidence is at best tenuous and conflicting .
A Truman biographer has pointed to 24 July , when Truman and Churchill met jointly with their military chiefs , as the day of the " critical moment . "
But there is no evidence that this subject came up at that meeting .
Some sources have suggested that a key meeting took place on 22 July , the day after Truman received the Groves report on the test results , and that this meeting may have been the occasion when the President asked the question of Marshall that resulted in the " quarter of a million " statement .
All references to this meeting appear to be based on Truman 's statement in his January 1953 letter to the Air Force historian -- and also in his memoirs -- that after receiving the " report " ( presumably a reference to the Groves document ) , he called together all his advisers .
The records and memoirs clearly establish that Truman did have a private meeting with Churchill that day , with Marshall and Leahy in attendance , to discuss use of the bomb .
A detailed review of the Potsdam records , however -- along with accounts of the activities that day of the officials Truman claimed were present at a larger and more formal meeting -- suggest that while the President may have engaged in separate consultations with individual advisers at different times , there was no gathering of the whole group as has been sometimes claimed .
Based on the record , it seems more accurate to describe the events in Potsdam regarding the atomic bomb as a series of ad hoc " consultations , " probably stretching over a few days following the President 's receipt of news of the successful test .
A conclusion that no such formal gathering took place is not an argument that concern over the casualty cost of an invasion of the Japanese homeland was not a central consideration in the decisions regarding the use of the bomb .
The concern over casualties is clearly reflected , for example , in the discussions between the President and his advisers on 18 June , including Admiral Leahy 's questioning of the merits of paying such a price for unconditional surrender .
A further example is Secretary Stimson 's memorandum to the President on 2 July , which ultimately evolved into the Potsdam Declaration .
As initially drafted by Stimson , this memo was much more explicit than the version adopted at Potsdam on conceding to the Japanese the right to maintain the institution of the emperor .
Stimson described his intentions as seeking Japan 's surrender without incurring the high casualties he feared would result from an invasion .
Nor should the evidence be construed as indicating that concern over casualties was the only factor exerting critical force on the A - bomb decision .
What the evidence does indicate is that the view of the bomb as a potential way to end the war quickly -- in the hope of ( 1 ) avoiding the need for an invasion with resulting casualties that by any standard would be of intimidating proportions , ( 2 ) minimizing the USSR 's postwar leverage , and ( 3 ) not having to confront debate over concessions on the terms of unconditional surrender -- was the driving force in the minds of the US leadership team before Potsdam , and before the acquisition of intelligence showing much - larger - than - expected Japanese forces on Kyushu .
Nonetheless , it is certainly plausible that the buildup disclosed by early August reinforced the belief that the decision to use the bomb was the path of least resistance .
[ Top of page ]
The impact of signals intelligence on the decisions at the end of the war thus falls into the " what if " category .
There are of course libraries of " what if " analysis on the dropping of the atomic bomb .
In this case , however , the " if " question can be narrowed to the specific issue of the impact of signals intelligence , and for that there is an empirical base .
The recommendation to examine alternative invasion sites , outlined in the 4 August memorandum by the Joint War Plans Committee , was explicitly tied to the intelligence derived through intercepted communications .
Enclosed with this memorandum was a draft cable that the committee recommended be sent to MacArthur and Nimitz .
The cable referred to highly classified reporting that
Indicated a strengthening of Japanese forces and measures in southern Japan [ Kyushu ] to an extent considerably in excess of that previously estimated as Japanese capability by OLYMPIC target date .
While these measures ... are not yet considered to require change to your current directive it is desired that you ... make alternative plans and submit timely recommendations .
Operations against extreme northern Honshu , against the Sendai area [ in northeastern Honshu ] and directly against the Tokyo Plain are under intensive study here .
( Emphasis added . )
Although this cable , adhering to bureaucratic rules , would have told the Pacific commanders that it was not yet necessary to change their current operational plans , it also said clearly that they should begin preparing for such a turn of events .
The question of making such a change was about to come before the Joint Chiefs .
On 6 August -- the morning after the A - bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima , and while the results were still being evaluated -- Marshall was notified that , as a consequence of the concerns expressed by the Joint Planning Staff , the next meeting of the Joint Chiefs probably would address the issue of the Japanese buildup on Kyushu and examine alternatives to the planned invasion .
There is every reason to believe that , if the atomic bomb had not been ready and used when it was , this JCS meeting would have been held .
Had the meeting taken place , the earlier arguments for avoiding an invasion altogether , relying instead on sea and air strangulation and destruction , almost certainly would have been revived .
Such arguments by Admiral King and General Arnold had never really been overridden ; advocates of this position had simply been placated .
If the bomb had not been available , King 's and Arnold 's views would have been buttressed by the SIGINT evidence indicating a potential escalation of the estimated costs of an invasion .
Re-Evaluation of the Casualty Estimates ?
There is no record that any revised casualty estimates were actually produced as a result of the dramatically changed SIGINT picture of the opposing forces that an invasion would have encountered .
But a meeting held specifically in response to intelligence showing a much - larger - than - expected buildup of opposition forces would not have been able to duck the casualty implications of that information .
The original estimates by the Joint War Plans Committee and by MacArthur 's staff had been produced when both groups were forecasting opposing forces only half the size that now awaited them .
And even those casualty estimates had been purposely excluded from the briefing of a President who had said he planned to " make his decision ... with the purpose of economizing to the maximum extent possible in the loss of American lives . "
The most recent US experience bearing on the casualty question in the Pacific war was Okinawa .
Japanese regular
Army troops and naval ground - based defense forces on that island when it was invaded by US forces in April 1945 totaled some 75,000 .
Also on hand were about 25,000 civilian - paramilitary defenders and an unknown number of additional civilian volunteers .
By the beginning of August the US casualties in the ongoing struggle on Okinawa had reached 49,000 .
Attacking Kyushu would have meant invading an island many times larger than Okinawa ; southern Kyushu alone is well over twice Okinawa 's size in square miles .
Kyushu was initially expected to be garrisoned by Japanese ground combat forces roughly three - and - one - half times the size of the forces on Okinawa .
Kyushu also had a civilian augmentation potential many times greater than Okinawa's .
The initial estimates by the Joint War Plans Committee and MacArthur 's staff of casualties that would be incurred in capturing southern Kyushu ( 105,000 - 106,000 ) were a little more than twice the Okinawa total .
By the first week in August , the estimated total of Japanese Army and naval ground combat troops on Kyushu was more than six times what it had been on Okinawa .
Intercepted communications had been showing Japanese preparations to employ the same kinds of suicide attacks and other unconventional tactics and devices that had caused so many casualties in the Okinawa operation .
The number of US Army and Marine troops to be committed in the landing was about three times the force that had been launched against Okinawa .
These figures would have given some senior officials -- including Admiral Leahy , who had already challenged the earlier presentation - - a powerful case that a plausible casualty estimate had to be significantly more than double the Okinawa level .
Leahy had supported the blockade - and - bomb strategy in earlier debates , and he was the only participant in the 18 June White House meeting recorded in the minutes as saying that he did not think unconditional surrender was worth a high cost in American casualties .
It is not clear at what stage Secretary of War Stimson might have been drawn into the debate .
His concerns about casualties , however , had also been clearly reflected in the 18 June meeting and in his efforts on the Potsdam Declaration .
The Argument for Staying the Course
The opposite pole of the debate would doubtless have been the position supported by MacArthur .
He favored going ahead with the Kyushu invasion as planned .
When told that alternatives to Kyushu would be the main issue at a coming JCS meeting , Marshall sent a personal cable to MacArthur soliciting his views .
Marshall emphasized the large Japanese land and air buildup on Kyushu that had been reported in intelligence , noting that , if the Japanese were in fact deployed in such numbers there , US landing forces risked heavy losses in their amphibious attacks .
Pointing out that the buildup on Kyushu had been carried out at the expense of reductions in other locations , Marshall queried MacArthur about " possible alternative objectives " at less defended sites , pointing to the three that the Joint War Plans Committee 's 4 August memo had characterized as " under intensive study here . "
MacArthur 's response was dismissive of the reported buildup :
He said he did " not , repeat not , credit the heavy strengths reported to you in southern Kyushu . "
He reiterated that airstrikes would cut off Japanese reinforcement , despite reports from his own intelligence staff -- and from the Joint Intelligence Committee in Washington -- that so far this had demonstrably not occurred .
He rejected the alternatives suggested by Marshall as either not feasible without air bases closer to the homeland ( in the case of the Tokyo Plain ) or requiring substantial delay for preparations ( in the Northern Honshu case ) .
MacArthur argued that " there should not , repeat not , be the slightest thought of changing the OLYMPIC operation .
Its fundamental purpose is to obtain air bases under cover of which we can deploy forces to the northward into the industrial heart of Japan .
The plan is sound and will succeed . "
He concluded : " Throughout the Southwest Pacific Area campaigns , as we have neared an operation , intelligence has invariably pointed to greatly increased enemy forces .
Without exception , this buildup has been found to be erroneous . "
It is worth noting that MacArthur did not argue that the buildup -- if true -- should not be viewed as threatening the success of OLYMPIC .
Instead he tried to impeach the accuracy of the reporting .
This tactic could be interpreted as an indication that he recognized that if SIGINT reflecting the buildup was accurate -- or if it was accepted as accurate by Washington -- it would indeed have significant implications for the invasion plan .
MacArthur 's practice was to not allow intelligence to interfere with his aims , and his history of complaints about Willoughby 's reports resulted mainly from their contradiction of his own estimates and preferred courses of action .
His denigration of the reported buildup on Kyushu directly contradicted the performance record of his G - 2 under Willoughby .
In those instances during MacArthur 's Pacific campaign when the ULTRA - derived assessments were not entirely accurate , the errors tended to be on the low side .
In this instance , postwar information would show that there had in fact been 14 Japanese combat divisions on Kyushu -- and that intercepted communications had identified all of them .
The exact locations of a few of the newest arrivals had not been determined at the time of the war 's end , but it is quite likely that , once their existence on Kyushu had been confirmed , finding their locations would have been accomplished within a few weeks at most .
Japanese documents obtained after the war showed that at the time the US Military Intelligence Service was estimating 600,000 troops on Kyushu , there were 900,000 soldiers assigned to its defense .
Looking for a Middle - Ground Strategy
A middle ground between an invasion of Kyushu and a blockade - and - bomb strategy would have been the approach proposed by the War Plans Committee , apparently with some support from Marshall .
The Committee continued to insist on an invasion of the Japanese homeland but sought a target less well defended than Kyushu .
The views of General Marshall and most of the Joint War Plans Committee on the obstacles to achieving unconditional surrender would have made it difficult for them to abandon their advocacy of an invasion of the Japanese homeland .
The unconditional surrender objective was about much more than the status of the Emperor .
Indeed , the latter issue was the easiest to resolve .
While some Allied governments , especially the Australians and Chinese , remained opposed to retention of the Emperor , many key UK and US officials -- including some members of the JCS - - were not only willing to allow the Emperor to remain , but actually favored doing so in the belief that this would facilitate the administration of Japan by a postwar occupation force .
The more important Allied objectives of unconditional surrender were the unrestricted occupation of Japanese territory , total authority in the governing of Japan , dismantlement of Japan 's military and military - industrial complex ( " demobilization " ) , a restructuring of Japanese society ( " demilitarization " ) , and Allied - run war crimes trials -- in effect doing to Japan what was being done to Germany .
Abandoning these goals would mean Japan would not suffer the same consequences as Germany .
Truman 's consciousness of the political side to this issue was indicated in his meeting with his military advisers on 18 June , in which he said that he was deliberately leaving the door open to a modification of the surrender terms but that the initiative would have to come from Congress .
Achieving the surrender and unrestricted occupation of the entire national territory of an opponent steeped in a warrior tradition and a history as a great power , without having captured any portion of that territory , posed an extraordinary challenge .
It had not been achieved in Germany without invasion :
The historical record shows that after the bomb was dropped , the Japanese civilian leadership was willing to settle for only one concession by Japan 's conquerors -- the Emperor 's continuity .
The Japanese military , however , held out on the very issues that defined the Allies ' unconditional position , insisting that there be no security occupation of Japan ; that disarmament and demobilization be left in Japanese hands ; and that war criminals be tried by Japanese tribunals .
Inasmuch as none of these concessions had been granted to Germany , Allied leaders doubtless would have had great difficulty in gaining political support at home for granting any of them to Japan .
Whether the Allies ' demands could be achieved without capturing any part of the Japanese homeland was really what the debate between invasion and bomb - and - blockade was all about .
By early August the casualty costs of an invasion would have added credibility to the case for bomb - and - blockade .
That strategy 's downside was time : how much destruction had to be imposed , and for how long , and how many more thousands of Japanese had to be killed by bombing or starvation to achieve unconditional surrender ?
Implications of Soviet Entry Into the Pacific War
By this time ( early August ) , the prospect of Soviet entry into the war against Japan would have provided arguments to both sides .
For those favoring a bomb - and - blockade approach or even just a postponement of any invasion , Soviet entry could have been cited as an additional reason why surrender could be obtained without invading the main Japanese islands .
On the other hand , if Japan 's surrender did not take place until after the Soviets had been in the Pacific war for some length of time , and if there were no US forces on Japanese territory ( because no US invasion had occurred ) , how could the United States and its Allies acquire the control over occupation that they were seeking ?
Unless the mere entry by the USSR somehow caused an immediate surrender on the unconditional terms being demanded by Washington , the Potsdam experience was likely to reinforce the tendency among at least some US officials to see any gain resulting from Soviet entry as also carrying a serious potential cost -- the possible emergence of a Far Eastern version of the Soviet hegemony that was beginning to be imposed on Eastern Europe .
Weighing Alternatives
These considerations supported the idea of searching for an alternative that still involved capturing some Japanese homeland territory .
The appreciation that Marshall and many members of the Joint War Plans Committee would have had for the casualty implications of the Japanese buildup probably would have led them -- MacArthur 's views notwithstanding -- to look for alternative invasion sites .
In addition to the choices suggested in Marshall 's cable to MacArthur and in the Joint War Plans Committee paper of 4 August , there was the option of keeping Kyushu as the target but postponing the ground invasion so as to allow the increased air power from bases being set up on Okinawa to administer an extended pounding .
Such an intensified air bombardment campaign had been slated to begin in mid-September ; the Army Air Forces at MacArthur 's request had already accelerated this timetable by 30 days because of Willoughby 's recommendation based on the buildup that had been observed .
Timing and weather posed potential problems for the option of choosing an alternative invasion site .
Such a major change in plans at this time presumably would have forced a delay in launching the invasion .
As noted earlier , the date for invading Kyushu had already been moved up from 1 December to 1 November in response to concerns expressed by MacArthur and Nimitz , among others , over the greater chance of adverse weather during an invasion that did not begin until December and the possibility that such conditions could set the invasion back to spring 1946 .
From this perspective , there was little difference between seeking new invasion alternatives and opting for a bomb - and - blockade strategy .
Each involved putting the invasion on hold and engaging in an intensified air and sea attack ; if that did not produce a surrender within the next six months , the invasion issue might or might not be back on the planning board .
The military alternative to this course of action was to go ahead with the invasion and risk the high casualties .
The political alternative was to relax the terms for surrender .
Japanese Perspectives
This was exactly the dilemma that Japanese military leaders had sought to force the United States and its Allies to face .
They wanted to buy time in the hope that war - weariness in the Allied countries , in combination with concerns about high casualties , would produce a softening of the unconditional surrender demands .
Even for the Japanese , the issue was not whether they would be forced to surrender , but rather on what terms .
The best leverage for Japan 's leadership was to raise the cost perceptions -- both military and political -- for Allied decisionmakers .
The downside for the Japanese from Allied decisions dragging out the war would not only have been the devastation and loss of life that would have resulted from bombing and sea strangulation .
The longer the war lasted , the longer and deeper Soviet participation would become .
And attaining a satisfactory postwar settlement once the inevitable surrender did take place would probably have been more problematic .
Any attempt to conclude how the debate among US leaders over invading Japan would have come out if the atomic bomb had not been available to end the Pacific war abruptly would be a matter of guesses and probably preferences .
The planned JCS meeting that was to examine alternatives to an invasion of Kyushu did not take place because the atomic bomb was dropped at the very time the meeting was being scheduled .
This potentially historic meeting had been proposed in direct response to the picture of an accelerating Japanese buildup portrayed by signals intelligence .
Had the bomb not been ready when it was , and had the meeting gone ahead , history may well have judged this critical re-examination of strategic choices as one of the most pivotal contributions of SIGINT to the outcome of the Pacific war .

This appendix describes the chronology of the signals intelligence discovery path for the Japanese force buildup on the island of Kyushu from mid-April through early August 1945 .
The detailed source references for the increments to the military estimates are shown in the chronology table that follows the narrative .
Intercepted messages confirmed on 18 April 1945 that the 57th Division , previously identified in Manchuria , was part of a large movement of Japanese forces being shifted from the Asian mainland and that components of this division were already arriving on Kyushu .
At about the same time , US military intelligence learned that the 3rd Amphibious Brigade , a unit designed for countering amphibious invasions , was moving from the Kurils to somewhere in Japan 's main islands .
Analysts began to pick up evidence that this brigade was headed for Kyushu , but its actual presence there would not be confirmed until mid-May .
The movement of the 25th Division from the Korean Peninsula during the latter part of May was disclosed in a series of messages between a Japanese headquarters in Korea and a new communications entity in southern Kyushu .
Completion of the move was confirmed in early June .
In mid-June the transfer to Kyushu of the 77th Division was disclosed in messages to a unit on Kyushu employing what was known to be that division 's communications codename .
This division had been previously identified at a location on the northern island of Hokkaido .
Its movement would be completed by the end of the month .
Signals analysis disclosed the presence of a Japanese headquarters on Kyushu in mid-May ; its identity as 57th Army headquarters was confirmed around the end of the month .
This discovery stemmed from several weeks of intercepting and tracking message traffic sent by an unknown entity in southern Kyushu that was using an identification code indicative of Army - level headquarters and interacting with addressees at the echelon of Army headquarters or above .
By the end of the first week in June , intercepted message traffic had exposed the presence of a second new Army - level headquarters -- this one in northern Kyushu .
The US War Department 's Military Intelligence Service suspected that this was the 56th Army headquarters , inasmuch as the Service had recently identified newly created Japanese armies numbered 55th , 57th , and 58th .
It would be some time before this suspicion would be confirmed .
The analysts also had presumed that their projected deployments of three Japanese divisions in northern Kyushu and three in the south would create a requirement for an Army headquarters in each area .
They therefore viewed the discovery of these two headquarters as tending to confirm their long - held estimates .
A fifth division on Kyushu was confirmed in communications a few days after President Truman 's meeting with his advisers on 18 June .
Its specific identity was not determined for another two weeks , when a message disclosed its designator as the 206th Division .
This was a newly created division .
It also was one of the first identified as carrying a numerical designator in the " 200 " series , indicative of the " levy " on existing military units that the Japanese were undertaking for the creation of new divisions .
Until then , the divisions discovered on Kyushu had been existing ones that had been transferred intact from previously known locations .
On 13 July , shortly after the identity of the 206th was confirmed , the presence of the 212th Division on Kyushu was disclosed .
The addition of these two divisions and completion of the 77th Division 's move from Hokkaido prompted the Military Intelligence Service to raise its manpower estimate for Kyushu to 375,000 .
On 21 July the Military Intelligence Service 's daily summary on Japanese military forces reported that three more divisions had suddenly been discovered on Kyushu .
Within the next few days these were identified as the 146th , 154th , and 156th Divisions , and the presence of another new division , the 145th , was disclosed .
This brought the total on Kyushu to ten combat divisions and two depot divisions .
In addition , intercepted communications provided tenuous evidence that an eleventh combat division was being moved to Kyushu from Honshu .
According to the data compiled by the Military Intelligence Service , two of the identified Japanese combat divisions ( the 57th and 145th ) were based well to the north .
One ( the 206th ) was carried at that time in north - central Kyushu , positioned for reinforcement of critical areas in the south .
The other seven identified divisions and most of the independent brigades were in southern Kyushu .
This meant that the number of combat divisions and equivalent forces in southern Kyushu was already more than double the number originally forecast for that part of the island , and in fact exceeded what had been forecast for all of Kyushu by 1 November 1945 , the planned invasion date .
By the end of July intercepted communications had apparently indicated the presence of two more divisions , designated the 216th and 303rd .
Analysts were uncertain as to whether this information might have reflected some misinterpretation of signals from divisions already detected , so they did not immediately add them to their estimate .
On 1 August intercepted messages unambiguously disclosed that the 312th Division was in the process of moving to a site in northwestern Kyushu .
The identification of divisions in a " 300 " series also represented another layer of the Japanese " levy , " and was seen by the analysts as yet another indication of more to come .
By this time communications had also identified the 4th , 5th , and 6th Tank Brigades on Kyushu .
On 4 August , the same day that the Joint War Plans Committee circulated a memorandum citing the much - larger - than - expected buildup on Kyushu and recommending examination of alternative invasion sites , intercepted messages confirmed that another new division was moving onto Kyushu -- the 351st .
The intercepts also revealed that the 206th Division was moving from its position in the central area to the southern part of the island .
During the next few days the analysts would confirm that the 216th and 303rd divisions were at least in the process of deployment on Kyushu .
The 303rd appeared headed for southern Kyushu .
This would bring the number of divisions there to nine --- three times what had been forecast for that area by invasion day .
These deployments resulted in a hike of the Kyushu manpower estimate to 549,000 .
A short time later , when the full manpower of the 351st , 303rd , and 216th divisions was believed to be in place , the estimate would be raised to nearly 600,000 .
The following chronology is constructed mainly from Military Intelligence Service reports on Japanese fo
Many of you already have heard the news : Maemo Harmattan will base its application framework in Qt while keeping most of the Fremantle middleware based on GNOME technologies .
The goal is to offer an open , efficient and compelling Linux mobile stack with a cross- platform Qt API used also by Symbian and available in other mobile and traditional operating systems .
Hopefully a successful step helping free software projects collaborating with each other and also helping free software developers reaching millions of potential users .
At a personal level it was a pleasure and a honor to explain these news to the GNOME and KDE communities in the same place and at the same time in the first day of the first joint Desktop Summit ever !
Hopefully the work Nokia is putting in Harmattan will benefit KDE , GNOME and specially freedesktop.org , that common meeting point in need of so much love .

After three months of unofficial campaigning against Arlen Specter , U.S. Rep .
Joe Sestak will make a major campaign announcement Tuesday .
It is expected that Sestak will make official his bid to upset Specter in a 2010 Democratic primary for U.S. Senate .
Sestak will make his announcement at 8:30 a.m. at the Herbert W. Best VFW Post in Folsom , Pa .
The event will be streamed online at www.joesestak.com and followed by press conferences in Pittsburgh and Johnstown .
On Wednesday , Sestak will be in Harrisburg and Scranton , before finishing as a guest on ' The Colbert Report . '
Sestak , 57 , is a former U.S. Navy admiral in his second term in Congress .
Sestak opposes Democratic Party officials who ' anointed '
Specter for re-election and has made a case for expanding the choice for Democrats in the 2010 primary .
Sestak 's unofficial candidacy has apparently had an impact on Specter , the 79 - year - old former Republican .
Since switching parties on April 28 and facing the potential showdown against Sestak , Specter has voted almost entirely along Democratic Party lines .

From TheNewspaper.com :
A group campaigning to eliminate photo enforcement in Arizona has forced Paradise Valley to admit that it has been shortchanging drivers .
A volunteer with the group Camerafraud.com discovered the city used illegally short yellows at the intersection of Tatum Boulevard and McDonald Drive .
The motorist was mailed a red light camera ticket for allegedly entering the intersection just 0.2 seconds after the light had turned red .
“ I was nailed with a ticket at an intersection that left me very perplexed because I did n’t think I was going to get a ticket , ” David K. wrote on June 16 .
“ I thought I was close enough to the intersection to pass the limit line before the light turned red .
Well , I thought wrong because the duration for the yellow light on a 40 MPH speed limit road was only three seconds … ”
… Altogether , 1063 motorists issued red light camera tickets between May 6 and June 16 will receive refunds if paid or have their citations canceled .
Most have not paid .
This represents a loss of $ 193,466 in potential revenue to the city .
It ’s important to note that less than a day after the whistleblower posted his video online and contacted the city , Paradise Valley quietly corrected the yellow light timing to the proper threshold .
A video made by the driver before - and - after was the only proof of the misdeed , so you can be assured that without it the issue would have been quietly swept under the rug .

Where perpetrating fraud is always about the money .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The Venice film festival has capitalism in its sights this year , with premieres of Michael Moore ’s documentary on the U.S. economic meltdown and a drama starring Matt Damon as a corrupt corporate whistleblower .
U.S. director Michael Moore arrives at the world premiere screening of " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull " by U.S. director Steven Spielberg at the 61st Cannes Film Festival May 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jean - Paul Pelissier
“ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” in competition at the annual cinema showcase , sees Moore take on the corporate bosses with his trademark combative style , bringing the hot topic of recession to the picturesque Lido waterfront .
And “ The Informant ! , ” directed by Steven Soderbergh and featuring Damon as a real - life crooked executive who exposed his company ’s price - fixing tactics , will be screened out of competition .
The festival runs from September 2 - 12 .
Damon is one of several Hollywood A - listers due to grace the red carpet in 2009 , as studios appear prepared to foot the substantial bill and come to Venice in order to generate buzz for their pictures as the awards season kicks off .
Hundreds of fans waiting outside the main cinema where gala premieres are held each day will be hoping to catch a glimpse of Nicolas Cage , George Clooney , Oliver Stone , Charlize Theron , Eva Mendes , Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone among others .
The 2009 edition of the world ’s oldest film festival looks set to eclipse 2008 , which , despite awarding Mickey Rourke ’s acclaimed comeback “ The Wrestler ” with the Golden Lion for best film , was seen as lackluster and lacking star power .
“ On paper it looks good , and these people will be doing the red carpet giving the festival the glamour I think it needs , ” said Lee Marshall , film critic for Screen International and a Venice regular .
“ That was lacking last year , considered by many to be a limp festival from that point of view .
Many media representatives canceled pretty much after the program was announced . ”
LOCAL FAVORITE CLOONEY
Clooney , who has a home in Italy and is a local favorite , appears in “ The Men Who Stare at Goats , ” about a reporter who stumbles across a U.S. military unit in Iraq which employs paranormal powers on its missions .
Author Cormac McCarthy ’s post - apocalyptic vision of the world in “ The Road ” makes it to the big screen , with Viggo Mortensen starring with Theron .
Cage appears in Werner Herzog ’s “ Bad Lieutenant : Port of Call New Orleans , ” a remake of the 1992 movie directed by Abel Ferrara , who has publicly criticized the new version .
U.S. director Todd Solondz is in competition with “ Life During Wartime , ” while horror master George Romero presents “ Survival of the Dead , ” one of several horror movies at the festival this year .
Films touching on the 1982 war in Lebanon , the Tamil Tiger rebellion in Sri Lanka , recent Iranian protests and China ’s violent past promise to make the headlines , as does Oliver Stone ’s documentary “ South of the Border ” about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
Two very different cinema heavyweights will be honored , with animation king John Lasseter receiving a lifetime achievement award and “ Rambo ” and “ Rocky ” star Stallone receiving an award outside the main festival .
As usual Venice promises a global line - up , with Egypt ’s “ The Traveler , ” featuring Omar Sharif , in competition alongside pictures from China , Austria , Israel , Japan , France , Hong Kong , Germany and Italy .
Not for the first time fashion is in focus , with designer Tom Ford bringing his directorial debut “ A Single Man ” starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore .

Es geht mit den üblichen Lügen los , dass das Internet ein rechtsfreier Raum sei , dass es dieses Gesetzes bedürfe , um das Verbot von Kinderpornographie im Internet durchzusetzen , dass die Verfügbarkeit von Kinderpornos ein Anreiz für weitere Missbrauchsfälle sei .
Haben wir alles schon zigmal widerlegt , spare ich mir hier .
Franziska hält dagegen , vergreift sich aber bei der Wortwahl " ineffizient " .
Das ist kein Zeichen von Ineffizienz .
Ineffizienz ist , wenn man zu wenig blockt .
Wenn man zuviel blockt , ist das Missbrauch der Zensurinfrastruktur .
Daher warnen wir ja auch vor Missbrauch .
Das ist keine theoretische Erwägung , sondern das kann man bei allen " Vorbildern " für unsere Zensurinfrastruktur so live und in Farbe beobachten .
Und da kommen wir zum ersten Schenkelklopfer von Zensursula :
Die genaue Recherche zeigt , dass diese Listen oft schon alt waren und völlig überholt .
Das ist kein wirkliches Argument .
Als nächstes kommt ihr Vergleich mit einem Bildband in der Buchhandlung , und Zensursulas Argumentation fußt am Ende auf der Behauptung , die Sperren in den anderen Ländern würden täglich zehntausende von Leuten vom Kinderpornoklicken abhalten .
Hier hätte man einhaken müssen , woher Sie denn weiß , dass die Leute nach Kinderpornos gesucht haben ?
Das könnte ja auch ein Cron Job sein , der alle Domains durchgeht , um zu gucken , welche zensiert werden .
Oder ein Netzaktivist , der alle Einträge der Sperrliste in einem Iframe verlinkt , um zu zeigen , wie sinnlos diese Sperren sind .
Oder oder oder .
Oder vielleicht klickt da auch gar keiner drauf und das ist nur eine Schutzbehauptung der Behörden , um ihr Gesicht zu wahren angesichts der offensichtlichen Nichtwirksamkeit der Sperren .
Damit kommen wir zum nächsten Schenkelklopfer :
Wer die Stoppseite zu umgehen versucht , macht sich bewusst strafbar , weil er dann aktiv nach Kinderpornografie sucht .
Mein persönlicher Höhepunkt ist aber der folgende Satz , bei dem ich wahrscheinlich ausfallend geworden wäre :
Aber es ist interessant , dass
Sie jetzt leugnen , dass es einen Massenmarkt von Kinderpornografie im Internet gibt .
Als nächstes lügt Ursula lächelnd der Kamera folgendes ins Gesicht :
Gleichzeitig sehen wir deutlich mehr Fälle bei der Verbreitung kinderpornografischer Schriften .
Dazu müssen wir von einer hohen Dunkelziffer ausgehen .
Der nächste Absatz muss insgesamt zitiert werden , um seine Absurdität voll zur Geltung zu bringen :
Der Kampf um Meinungsfreiheit war immer berechtigt .
Aber diejenigen , die in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten oder Jahrhunderten um die Freiheit von Zensur gekämpft haben , taten das , weil sie anders als die Obrigkeit dachten oder ihre Religion ausüben wollten .
Aber niemals , damit Bilder von Gewalt oder Kinderpornografie verbreitet werden können .
Freiheit kann nie bedingungslos sein .
Ihre Grenze ist da erreicht , wo sie die Freiheit oder die Würde des Mitmenschen infrage stellt .
Zensur in Deutschland wäre , wenn zum Beispiel das Wort " Zensursula " verboten würde .
Aber dass Bilder von vergewaltigten Kindern nicht frei zugänglich sind , das ist keine Zensur .
Auf den Vorwurf , wir würden gerade Zensurregimes im Iran und in China durch unsere Zensur legitimieren , kommt dann folgender Hammer :
Exakt die Gegenpositionen nehmen namhafte Rechtswissenschaftler ein , die sagen : Die verfassungsrechtlich geschützte Informationsfreiheit deckt nicht , dass strafrechtlich relevante Inhalte zur Verfügung gestellt werden .
Wir leben in einem Rechtsstaat .
Die Diskussion um die aktuelle Zugangserschwerung zeigt , wie aufmerksam dieser Staat damit umgeht .
Or , as Petersmann memorably suggests , constitutionalism 's foundational insight is that the central political question is not who shall govern , but rather ' how must laws and political institutions be designed … so that even incompetent rulers and politicians cannot cause too much harm ' ( Petersmann 1997 )
Den nächsten kapitalen 12 - Ender , den sie schießt , muss man auch großflächig zitieren :
Es stimmt nicht , dass jeder kriminalisiert wird , der zufällig auf eine gesperrte Seite gerät .
Das war mir wichtig , denn viele Nutzer kommen ungewollt auf diese Seiten .
Ich habe deshalb gegen die Vorstellung der SPD gefochten , dass automatisch die Daten aller Nutzer gespeichert werden .
Diese Daten werden jetzt sofort gelöscht .
Und auch die Darstellung , dass man ja den Betreibern nicht Bescheid sagen müsse , wenn man sie sperrt , weil es ja im Internet " 40 Millionen Kontrolleure " gäbe , ist an Dreistigkeit kaum zu überbieten .
Hier hat Franziska sehr schön schlagkräftig reagiert :
Heine : Wollen Sie die Bürger aufrufen , sich pädophilen Inhalten aussetzen zu müssen , um die Kontrolle demokratischer Rechte wahrzunehmen ?
Sie haben doch oft genug öffentlich gesagt , dass derjenige , der so etwas sieht , süchtig danach werden kann .
Die geheimen Filterlisten verteidigt Zensursula mit der Lüge , dass man ja ansonsten die Ermittlungen öffentlich machen würde , und sie dann zum Erliegen kämen .
Das ist natürlich , wie auch Franziska einwirft , eine groteske Falschdarstellung , weil die Webseite ja merkt , wenn ihre Kundschaft von einem Stoppschild aufgehalten wird .
Die Ermittlung ist also bereits veröffentlicht zu dem Zeitpunkt .
Als Sahnehäubchen marginalisiert Zensursula dann noch die Petition mit den Worten
Ich meine : 134.000 Zeichner , das ist schon etwas .
Aber es gibt 40 Millionen Internetnutzer .
von der Leyen : Ich kann das Gefühl schon nachvollziehen , aber eine Onlinepetition ist mit einem Klick unterschrieben … Heine : … das stimmt nicht !
von der Leyen : Okay , vielleicht braucht es zwei , drei Minuten .
Update : ist euch aufgefallen , dass sie sagt , " der Kampf um Meinungsfreiheit war immer berechtigt " ?
Ein Schelm , wer dabei böses denkt .
Danke an Cryx für diesen Hinweis .
THE fate of Paul Henderson 's wounded ALP Government appears signed and sealed .
Alison Anderson , the mercurial Loritja woman and member for MacDonnell , this week promised Opposition Leader Terry Mills that she would vote for a no-confidence motion brought against the Northern Territory Government .
And Mr Mills is believed to have provided Ms Anderson with an assurance that if the Country Liberals ( CL ) assume power as a result , she will be offered a place in his ministerial line - up .
With the other remaining independent Gerry Wood willing to support a non-confidence vote , Mr Henderson seems to be , as Ms Anderson herself put it , " a dead man walking ' ' .
This week Ms Anderson , a former indigenous affairs minister , predicted that Tuesday 's parliamentary session would be the " greatest day " in Northern Territory politics , her inflated exuberance no doubt a reflection of the secret understanding struck with Mr Mills midweek .
Yesterday Mr Mills issued a letter calling on the speaker of the Legislative Assembly to approve the early recall of the NT Parliament so that his no-confidence motion could be voted on , saying he had the support of Ms Anderson and Mr Wood .

And bigger one by and y753421 ( with two very minor edits by uriel ) :
South Carolina governor Mark Sanford can't stop confessing .
In a teary interview with the AP , he admitted more secret rendezvous with his " soul - mate " ( Argentinian mistress Maria Belen Chapur ) and flings with other women over the years ( but not sex ! ) .
He also insulted his wife Jenny again by saying he was " trying " to fall back in love with her .
All we can say is this is one bizarre PR strategy .
Sanford has already cried for the cameras once , and his wife 's refusal to stand by his side at that obligatory ritual won a big round of applause .
So how will Sanford 's constituents react to his latest revelations and spin on his fling ?
Namely :
He met his mistress at a dance club .
It is n't a sex story - - it 's a " love story . "
He will die knowing he met his soul mate .
He can't get her out of his head .
Is the " family values " thing just not bringing home the votes anymore ?
: COLUMBIA , S.C. *– South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , already struggling to salvage his family and his political career after admission of a scandalous affair , added explosive details Tuesday , including more visits with the mistress he calls his " soul mate " and additional women in his past .
The once - promising presidential prospect said he is committed to reconciling with his wife , but professed to The Associated Press his continued love for the Argentine woman at the center of the firestorm that gutted his political future .
In emotional interviews with the AP over two days , he said he would die " knowing that I had met my soul mate . "
Sanford also said that he " crossed the lines " with a handful of other women during 20 years of marriage , but not as far as he did with his mistress .
" There were a handful of instances wherein I crossed the lines I should n't have crossed as a married man , but never crossed the ultimate line , " he said .
Sanford insisted his relationship with Maria Belen Chapur , whom he met at an open air dance spot in Uruguay eight years ago , was more than just sex .
" This was a whole lot more than a simple affair , this was a love story , " Sanford said .
" A forbidden one , a tragic one , but a love story at the end of the day . "
Even with the latest revelations , Sanford maintains he is fit to govern and has no plans to resign .
" I 've been able to do my job and in fact excel at it , " Sanford said , while acknowledging he is a spectator at his " own political funeral . "
During more than three hours of interviews over two days at his Statehouse office , Sanford said he is trying to fall back in love with his wife , Jenny , even as he grapples with his deep feelings for Chapur .
" I owe it too much to my boys and to the last 20 years with Jenny to not try this larger walk of faith , " he said .
Sanford detailed more encounters with his mistress than he had disclosed during a rambling , emotional press conference last week .
The new revelations Tuesday led the state attorney general to launch an investigation of Sanford 's travels , and some legislators to repeat calls for him to step down .
He delivered a personal check late Tuesday for nearly $ 3,000 to reimburse the state for a 2008 state - funded trip to Argentina where he visited Chapur , and he insists no public money was used for any other meetings with her .
House Speaker Bobby Harrell , who would chair any forced ouster of the governor by the Republican - controlled Legislature , said it 's premature to heed calls from those in his own party to remove Sanford .
" I want to see what the investigation finds before I 'm willing to discuss that topic , " said Harrell , a Charleston Republican .
Sanford , at times crying and unabashedly emotional , acknowledged in the AP interview that he had casual encounters with other women while he was married but before he met Chapur .
They took place during trips outside the country to " blow off steam " with male friends .
" What I would say is that I 've never had sex with another woman .
Have I done stupid ?
I have .
You know you meet someone .
You dance with them .
You go to a place where you probably should n't have gone , " Sanford said , declining to discuss details .
But he said those encounters were nothing like his relationship with Chapur .
" If you 're a married guy at the end of the day you should n't be dancing with somebody else .
So anyway , without wandering into that field we 'll just say that I let my guard down in all senses of the word without ever crossing the line that I crossed with this situation . "
Sanford also detailed more visits with Chapur , including an encounter that he described as a failed attempt at a farewell meeting in New York this past winter , chaperoned by a spiritual adviser and sanctioned by his wife soon after she found out about the affair .
But he saw Chapur again , this time over Father 's Day weekend and after his wife expressly told him not to , leaving the country without telling his staff and instead leading them to believe he was hiking the Appalachian Trail .
By the time he returned to a puzzled public , staff and family , his public image and emotional state had unraveled .
He admitted the affair at a news conference televised nationally , but at the time said there were only four meetings with his mistress .
Sanford told the AP he saw Chapur five times over the past year , including two romantic , multi - night stays with her in New York — one in Manhattan , one in the Hamptons , both paid for in cash so no one would know — before they met in the city again with the intention of breaking up .
He said he saw her two other times before that , including their first meeting .
" There was some kind of connection from the very beginning , " he said , though neither that first encounter nor a 2004 coffee date in New York during the Republican National Convention were romantic .
Their relationship turned physical , he said , during a government trip to Brazil and Argentina in June 2008 , and when he returned , the e-mails that had started years earlier began to reflect anguish over what they had done .
" Now I am frightened , " he told the AP , describing his state of mind at the time .
" It was before safe .
But now it 's not safe .
We gotta put the genie back in the bottle . "
Critics have charged that Sanford should resign or be impeached because he was unreachable during the latest Argentina trip and that no one was in charge of state government during his secret absence .
In the interview , he said he first became aware that officials were looking for him Monday evening , June 22 — four days after his departure for Argentina — when he checked his cell phone voice mail .
" I was reached ultimately on Monday evening , " he said .
" I was contacted and called ( chief of staff ) Scott ( English ) back that Tuesday morning . "
Sanford said he then changed his flight to return to South Carolina that evening .
He and Jenny , parents of four sons , say they are trying to reconcile their marriage but have not been sharing the same house for several weeks .
Jenny Sanford found out about the relationship in January when she discovered a letter the governor had written to his mistress .
She did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday and was not at their coastal home on Sullivans Island .

California Wildfires : Here is a Gallery of Photos .
In the Ohio Valley , we ’ve had a pretty cool summer .
July had zero days of 90 degree temperatures for the first time in recorded history .
For the next few days , we ’ll have highs in just the low to mid 70’s .
Its because there has been a general trofiness in the long wave pattern .
This pattern has contributed to such things as Hurricane Bill and Tropical Storm Danny going off the east coast toward Canada when that sort of thing is more common in October .
The other thing is that while there has been a general trof in the east , there has been a general ridge in the west , which means the other half of the country has been hotter than average and in several areas , drier than normal .
There is a big drought in Central Texas and it is quite dry in California , which is a recipe for wildfires in an area that is typically pretty dry all by itself .
So , fires are raging near Los Angeles near my boyhood home in La Canada .
Here is an interactive map with links for fire information .
When I was a kid , La Canada was all by itself but now it more commonly called La Canada - La Crescenta - Flintridge because all of those communities have kinda run into each other .
Anyway , our old neighbors have evacuated and the area is under seige as our house backed up to the Angeles National Forest where it appears that this fire originated .
To give you an idea of how dry it is …at 8 PM EDT a nearby reporting station had 9 % humidity .
It is called the Station Fire .
There are many other fires though and here is a link to wildfire incidents in California .
Governer Schwarzenegger has toured the area and issued decrees of warning .
It would be a good idea to heed calls to evacuate .
Meanwhile , Baja California is bracing for a hit from a major hurricane .
Hurricane Jimena .
It ’s not totally uncommon for a storm to move due north in the Pacific but its not a typical track .
Once it veers off to the west , it will encounter some pretty cold water from the California Stream that originates in Alaska … that is why surfers often wear wetsuits on the west coast .
The water is some 20 degrees colder than say , the Gulf of Mexico this time of year .
Anyway , what will be interesting to see if some of the moisture from the hurricane will make its way far enough into California to aid in the fire fighting efforts .
Probably not a whole lot of help but even a little will be of use .
HURRICANE JIMENA DISCUSSION
NUMBER 9
NWS TPC / NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL EP132009
200 PM PDT SUN AUG 30 2009
JIMENA CONTINUES TO HAVE A SMALL EYE EMBEDDED WITHIN A QUITE
SYMMETRIC CENTRAL DENSE OVERCAST .
ON INFRARED IMAGES …THE EYE
TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED SOMEWHAT …SUGGESTIVE
OF ADDITIONAL
STRENGTHENING .
SUBJECTIVE DVORAK T-NUMBERS REMAIN AT T 6.0 FROM
BOTH AGENCIES BUT OBJECTIVE T-NUMBERS SUPPORT A STRONGER HURRICANE
… PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE WARMER EYE .
THEREFORE THE NHC INTENSITY
ESTIMATE IS BOOSTED TO 120 KT .
ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING IS
CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY GIVEN THE WARM WATERS …LIGHT SHEAR …AND
MOIST TROPOSPHERE .
HOWEVER …THE INTENSIFICATION
PROCESS COULD ALSO
BE HALTED AT ANY TIME BY AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLE .
THE OFFICIAL
WIND SPEED FORECAST SHOWS ONLY A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN
STRENGTH .
BEGINNING AROUND 48 HOURS …THE GLOBAL MODELS SHOW
INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY
UPPER -LEVEL FLOW NEAR JIMENA .
THE
RESULTING INCREASE IN SHEAR WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO A WEAKENING
TREND…AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE OFFICIAL FORECAST .
ALSO BEYOND
48 HOURS…THE INTENSITY OF THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WILL BE DEPENDENT
ON HOW MUCH IT INTERACTS WITH LAND .
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TROCHOIDAL WOBBLES… TYPICAL OF THE MOVEMENT OF
INTENSE HURRICANES…BUT
THE SMOOTHED INITIAL MOTION ESTIMATE IS
ABOUT 295/07 .
THE FUTURE TRACK OF JIMENA SEEMS TO DEPEND LARGELY
UPON THE EVOLUTION OF TWO MAIN FACTORS…A MID - TO UPPER - LEVEL LOW
LOCATED NEAR THE SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA AND A MID -LEVEL
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. AND NORTHWESTERN MEXICO .
IF THE
LOW SHIFTS WESTWARD AND WEAKENS…IT WOULD ALLOW THE RIDGE TO BUILD
WESTWARD AND COULD CAUSE THE TRACK TO VEER WESTWARD AWAY FROM BAJA .
THAT APPEARS TO BE THE SCENARIO DEPICTED BY THE U.K. MET .
OFFICE
AND ECMWF GLOBAL MODELS .
HOWEVER …THOSE MODELS ARE THE WESTERN
OUTLIERS OF THE DYNAMICAL TRACK GUIDANCE .
OTHER GUIDANCE SUCH AS
THE GFS…THE HWRF …AND THE GFDL INDICATE THAT THE MID - TO
UPPER -LEVEL LOW WILL CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE THE MOVEMENT OF THE
HURRICANE…SO THAT JIMENA WILL CONTINUE TO TURN TOWARD THE
RIGHT…AND MOVE NEAR OR OVER BAJA .
THE OFFICIAL FORECAST IS
SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AND IS CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MODEL
TRACKS .
INTERESTS IN WESTERN MAINLAND MEXICO AND THE SOUTHERN BAJA
CALIFORNIA SHOULD MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF JIMENA .
A HURRICANE WATCH
MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA
PENINSULA LATER TODAY OR TONIGHT .

FORECASTER PASCH
John Carmack has talked at length about what he expects from the next generation of consoles , planning to create brand new tech that allows his company to create cross-generational games that span Xbox 360 / PS3 along with whatever their successors may be .
The id software technical director also believes that console - makers are in danger of slamming into a power wall that may be impossible to engineer around , with the platform holders perhaps looking to cloud computing to continue the console arms race .
Carmack 's comments are found within a collection of three videos posted a week ago by Polish site CD - Action , in which the idTech mastermind talks without respite about the engine behind new game Rage along with other hardcore topics , armed only with a comedically branded soft drink .
Watch him go : it 's absolutely remarkable .
According to CD - Action , the interview was recorded around a month ago .
" I have a good sense of where technology is going but larger things about what businesses choose to do and big businesses like Microsoft and Sony ... those are decisions above my pay grade and not really in my line of business , or what I think about a lot , " Carmack says .
" I think that Xbox Live ... the advent of that and the App Store with the iPhone are wonderful signs of the future of digital distribution .
I think there 's a decent chance that one of the next gen consoles will be without optical media ... the uptake rates of people who have broadband connects surprised everyone this generation .
It 's higher than what the core publishers and even the first party people expected . "
Carmack goes on to talk about how he believes that one or the other of the major HD console - makers will jump the gun with the leap to the next generation ( hinting that it will be Sony ) , but in common with many other developers believes that their best interests are served by prolonging the lifespan of the current consoles .
" The whole jockeying for who 's going to release the first next gen console is very interesting and pretty divorced from the technical side of things , " he says .
" Whether Sony wants to jump the gun to prevent the same sort of 360 lag from happening to them again seems likely .
As developers , we would really like to see this generation stretch as long as possible .
We 'd like to see it be quite a few more years before the next gen console comes out , but I suspect one will end up shipping something earlier rather than later . "
The general roadmap for the next gen architectures has already been laid down though , and the future appears to be all about variations of Intel 's Larrabee proposition , where many tiny , fully programmable cores combine to form one powerful chip that may well work as both CPU and GPU .
" We do have a very good sense of where the technology is going because we talk to NVIDIA , we talk to Intel , we talk to ATI / AMD and they 're all pursuing variations on massive multi-core processor integration , " Carmack says , " There 's lots of interesting things about that , about how we need to think about things on the game development side to take advantage of that . "
Real - time ray - tracing has often been seen as the holy grail of graphics rendering and simply unobtainable with the levels of technology we have available , but it may well find a place within the next gen consoles .
" The big question is , are we going to be able to do a ray - casting primitive for a lot of things ? " he ponders .
" Certainly we 'll still be doing a lot of conventional stuff like animated characters and things like that very likely will be drawn not incredibly differently from how they 're drawn now .
Hopefully we 'll be able to use some form of sparse voxel octree representation cast stuff for some of the things in the world that are gonna be rigid - bodied ... maybe we 'll have deformations on things like that .
But that 's a research project I 'm excited to get back to in the relatively near future .
We can prototype that stuff now on current hardware and if we 're thinking that ... this type of thing will be ten times faster on the hardware that ends up shipping , we 'll be able to learn a lot from that . "
However , while he predicts that the leaps in cutting edge console technology are set to continue ( certainly there is no hint from him that Microsoft or Sony will follow a Wii- style strategy of simply adding minor or incremental upgrades to their existing hardware ) , we are swiftly reaching the point where platform holders will be unable to win their battles against the laws of physics .
" We talk about these absurd things like how many teraflops of processing and memory that are going into our game machines , " Carmack says , speculating off - hand that the next gen consoles will have at least 2GB of internal RAM .
" It 's great and there 's going to be at least another generation like that , although interestingly we are coasting towards some fundamental physical limits on things .
We 've already hit the megahertz wall and eventually there 's going to be a power density wall from which you wo n't get more processing out there ... "
That being the case , he speculates that the game - makers could move into different directions to provide new game experiences and at that point , the almost mythical cloud computing concept could make an impact .
" There 'll be questions of whether we shift to a cloud computing infrastructure ... lots of interesting questions about whether you have the computing power in your living room versus somewhere else , " he says , noting that while latency is a fundamental issue , the sheer scope of storage available online opens up intriguing possibilities .
" Certainly the easier aspect of that is ' net as storage ' where it's all digital distribution and you could wind up doing an idTech 5 - like thing ... and blow it up to World of Warcraft size so you need a hundred petabytes of storage in your central game system .
We can do that now !
It 's not an absurd thing to talk about .
Games are already in the tens of millions of dollars in terms of budget size and that 's probably going to continue to climb there .
The idea of putting millions of dollars into higher - sized storage ... it 's not unreasonable to at least consider . "
Returning to the concept of the next generation console , John Carmack is already planning to take advantage of the new hardware and is planning to have systems in place to ensure that a sneaky pre-emptive launch from one of the platform holders wo n't catch id software by surprise .
" What I 'm planning to do is set up a new rendering engine that co-exists with the current one ... and I intend to develop it like that , so you have an idTech 5 version and then have everything working the same [ with ] an alternate data set that you can render with a different version , " he revealed .
" So the hope would be that if we do get some flashy new graphics hardware on there that we would possibly have the option of releasing a game cross-generational like that .
Same game , same design across everything but different media set , different rendering engine ...
That also allows me to work on something without having to involve the entire team .
That 's something where we can take a couple of people , go out , work on prototyping proof of concepts while the rest of the company is building the production titles . "

• Extremists want to stoke race tensions , officer warns • Counter - terrorism unit diverting resources to threat •
No specific intelligence of planned strike , sources say
Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism command fears that right - wing extremists will stage a deadly terrorist attack in Britain to try to stoke racial tensions , the Guardian has learned .
Senior officers say it will be a " spectacular " that is designed to kill .
The counter - terrorism unit has redeployed officers to increase its monitoring of the extreme right 's potential to stage attacks .
Commander Shaun Sawyer told a meeting of British Muslims concerned about the danger to their communities that police were responding to the growing threat .
Sawyer said of the far right : " I fear that they will have a spectacular ... they will carry out an attack that will lead to a loss of life or injury to a community somewhere .
They 're not choosy about which community . "
He said the aim would be to cause a " breakdown in community cohesion " .
Sawyer revealed that the Met commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , had asked the counter - terrorism command , SO15 , to examine what the economic downturn would mean for far - right violence .
The assessment concluded that the recession would increase the possibility of it .
Sawyer told the meeting last Wednesday that more of his officers needed to be deployed to try to thwart neo -Nazi - inspired violence .
He said the terrorist threat posed by al - Qaida remained the unit 's priority , but said of its far - right section : " It is a small desk ... we need to grow that unit . "
Sources have told the Guardian that while they believe the neo - Nazi terrorist threat has grown , they have no specific intelligence of an attack .
" There is an increased possibility of violence from the far right .
There is a trend , " said one senior source , adding that the ideology of the violent right was driven by " people who do n't like immigration , people who do n't like Islam .
We 're seeing a resurgence of anti-semitism as well . "
The meeting at which Sawyer spoke was staged by the Muslim Safety Forum , whose chair , Abdurahman Jafar , said : " Muslims are the first line of victims in the extreme right 's campaign of hate and division and they make no secret about that .
Statistics show a strong correlation between the rise of racist and Islamophobic hate crime and the ascendancy of the BNP . "
It is a decade since an extreme rightwing terrorist has used bombs to claim lives in Britain .
In 1999 , David Copeland struck three targets in London .
His attack on a gay pub in Soho , London , killed three people and left scores injured .
It followed attacks against the Muslim community in Brick Lane , east London , and the bombing of a market in Brixton , south London .
The senior source said : " When Copeland attacked we did not have the religious tensions with the Muslim community .
What kind of schism would a Copeland - type event cause now ? "
The far - right threat to Britain 's Jewish communities is monitored by the Community Security Trust , which says attempted terrorist violence by neo -Nazis has increased in the past few years .
It says nine white men have been " convicted of offences involving explosives , terrorist plots , violent campaigns or threats to carry them out " .
David Rich , of the CST , said : " There 's no one directing people , it 's a mindset " – a reference to the easy availability of extremist right - wing material and information about making bombs .
What a State to be in ...
on the institutional question
Saverio Craparo
A little history never hurt anyone !
The beast that is the modern State was born over two centuries ago and was closely connected with the emergence of the bourgeoisie as the new dominant class .
It is not by chance that a large part of the typical functions of the modern State owe their origins to revolutionary France in 1789 .
It is a good idea to examine the reasons behind this profound transformation of the power structures in society , which social relationships ceased to exist in order to make way for others , what effects all this had on class relations and , above all , how the domination of the emerging bourgeoisie came about .

And one by one , and two by two , They have sailed from the wharf since then ; I have said good - bye to the last I knew , The last of the careless men .
And I can’t but think that the times we hadWere the best times after all , As I turn aside with a lonely glassAnd drink to the bar - room wall .-- Henry Lawson
My understanding of history , economics , and the laws of causation , have long led me to expect the present collapse of Western Civilization .
I did not , however , anticipate the culture experiencing a free - fall into an awaiting black - hole .
Like T.S. Eliot , I suspected Western society would end " not with a bang but a whimper . "
I envisioned a more gradual decline , one to which individuals could make the necessary adjustments in their lives that would lessen the impact and help to restore societal order .
The symptoms of our decline - and - fall are becoming increasingly evident even to those who , not so many years ago , regarded the outcome of an American Idol contest as the most pressing concern .
A public - opinion - poll mentality substitutes for thinking in our modern world , creating a collective mindset that insists upon instantaneous answers to questions that few people are capable of asking .
As the processes of causation play out the inexorable consequences of premises grounded in utter stupidity , a holiday for the expression of socio- economic fantasies has beset us .
Hardly a week goes by without some twit — whether in or out of office — upping the ante in a bull market for runaway imbecility .
Such efforts continue to produce an upswing in GDP ( " Grotesquely Delusional Programs " ) , with politicians , academicians , and media hacks jostling one another — like San Francisco cable - car passengers — to be first aboard .
Murray Rothbard said , more than once , that there was nothing wrong about a person not fully understanding economics ; but that those ignorant of economic principles ought not to be proposing governmental policies to govern economic activity .
I have a hard time imagining Murray remaining calm as multitudes of men and women — with nary an understanding of economics — consult their Ouija boards for additional " solutions " to the calculated chaos generated by earlier practitioners of political mysticism .

Unable to engage in the economic analysis that would both explain and provide a basis for resolving current crises — an approach that would call into question the entire logic of statism — the established order has been forced to seek other rationales for its authority .
The New Deal gave us a proliferation of alphabetized federal agencies to do what Plato envisioned could be done , namely to plan for and direct the course of economic systems .
But the study of chaos and complexity — along with the failed histories of state planning — have shown the fallacy of such thinking .
As but one glaring example , ordinary people are discovering what Ron Paul and others have long observed : the vaunted , " independent " Federal Reserve system is not only incapable of regularizing the marketplace , but has been a principal agency for sowing confusion into our economic life .
The Platonic image of " philosopher kings " sitting atop pyramids of power and directing the lives of hundreds of millions of people to ill - defined ends , is increasingly questioned by those who produce the genuine order in society .
Contrary to the basic tenets of all forms of statism , it is the spontaneous order generated by the individual pursuit of self - interests in a marketplace that accounts for both our liberty and material well - being .
But in the marbled halls of state , as well as the sycophantic media and academic institutions that are well - paid to propagate a continuing faith in the cult of centralized power , the mantra is still heard , with only the content of the litanies modified to fit new situations .
" Save the planet " now substitutes for " save democracy , " but the premise of state power structures remains intact .
For a culture fast descending into history ’s memory hole , and with the illusion of central planning no longer enjoying the intellectual support it once did , the established order has turned to the most desperate of measures : magical thinking enforced by undiluted , unprincipled coercion .
No longer does the pretense of a scientific , rational basis for state planning prevail .
Instead , resort is had to a kind of political sorcery — wrapped in the behavior - modification terminology of " stimulus . "
Trillions of dollars are given away to the corporate friends of those in power , and the system waits to see what happens .
In what even the vice - president has termed a form of " guesswork , " the state has revealed its underlying sophistry .

In a society as thoroughly politicized as ours , the booboisie will always react with demands for the state to " do something , " a mindset that gives the statists a continuing incentive to identify — or concoct , if necessary — fears that can be used to increase state power .
When the civilization , itself , is in collapse , Boobus will insist that something — anything — be done , if for no other reason than to keep alive the illusion that the state is still in charge of events in the world , and can act to bring about desired results .
An awareness that there is nothing the state can do to reverse the fate it has unleashed is as unavailable to most people as would be a physician ’s assurances , to family members , that Uncle Willie ’s terminal condition cannot be overcome with Dr. Quack ’s Cancer Salve !
What else could be expected from political systems , whose only distinguishing characteristic is an enjoyment of a monopoly on the use of violence ?
" Reason " in the mouths of government officials , always reduces to no more than rationalizations to justify whatever it is the statists want to do .
When the promised results of economic planning are not forthcoming , the troops — with their tanks , armored personnel carriers , attack helicopters , and machine guns — will be sent in to enforce the state ’s will .
At that point , Boobus may begin to learn what the German and Russian people learned , namely , that the alleged distinction between " law enforcement " and " national defense " has been but another deception employed to protect the establishment from its own people .
And so , we seem to have reached that stage where state violence has become its own raison d’tre .
Social and economic problems are no longer considered within the sphere of authority of legislative bodies ; congress is too slow to act when " we need action , now ! , " and so the president or governor takes over and appoints — without anyone else ’s approval — " czars " to rule over various realms of human activity .
My thesaurus advises me that synonyms for " czar " include " despot , " " tyrant , " " dictator , " " slave driver , " " duce , " " oppressor , " and " Fhrer . "
One news report informs us that some thirty - two " czars " have been appointed in a number of states .
This is what we have become , a consequence that should reveal to all that scribbling words on parchment and calling them a " constitution " is ineffective to prevent any significant number of people from doing whatever they want to do .
The response of some mainstream media ’s " talking heads " to America ’s embrace of " czars " has been not to question the statist power implications , but only to suggest calling such officials by a different name !
As has become the norm in our world , if we use an alternative word to describe something ( e.g. , " waterboarding " instead of " torture " ) it becomes a different act .
With Boobus having learned his catechisms about health - care costs , and the terrible - of - terribles attending " climate change , " might we expect some of these " czars " to get together and plan a solution to both ?
Perhaps we shall soon be informed that each person produces approximately 2.3 pounds of carbon dioxide per day , an amount that translates into 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year for all six billion humans .
Perhaps people could be euthanized at age 65 — when most have become economically nonproductive , and increasingly costly drains upon Social Security and the health - care system — a result that would greatly reduce their production of carbon dioxide .
While such a program would exempt the philosopher - kings from its operation , the next generation of Boobus — unfamiliar with both the philosophically - principled and spiritual nature of what it means to be human — could probably be counted upon to embrace it .
After all , what denizen of our brave , new dehumanized world could resist a series of television commercials showing a polar bear on its small patch of ice ?

Video : Cleveland Indians ' Victor Martinez traded to Boston
An emotional Victor Martinez said goodbye to the only organization he has ever played for shortly after learning he had been traded to the Boston Red Sox .
" It 's tough because I 'm leaving my house , " he said , his voice cracking .
" This was my house .
It 's really tough . "
Surrounded by reporters in front of a locker with his familiar No. 41 hanging in the background , Martinez choked up when asked for his reaction to the deal .
" From the bottom of my heart , I really thank this organization and the fans in Cleveland .
They 're one of the greatest fans .
Thanks for everything . "
Still , Martinez is looking forward to playing for a contender .
" I play to win .
I want a World Series ring . "
When asked if he would ever return to play for the Indians again , Martinez said , " I do n't know .
We 'll see what happens . "
The British alternative rock band Elbow finally finds itself " mercifully free of the pressures " of anonymity .
All it took was three brilliant records , followed by an overdue commercial breakthrough .
" The Seldom Seen Kid " ( Geffen ) , the latest album from the rock quintet ( singer - guitarist Guy Garvey , bassist Pete Turner , drummer Richard Jupp , guitarist Mark Potter and keyboardist Craig Potter ) , has reaped well - deserved praise from numerous music quarters , and scored the prestigious Mercury Prize in 2008 and the Best British Group award for the band at this year 's Brit Awards .
Yet , as any long - time Elbow fan will tell you , " The Seldom Seen Kid " merely represents the latest installment a well - established creative continuum .
Recently , frontman Garvey discussed Elbow 's success and artistic process , as the group from Manchester wrapped up its latest North American tour .
The Mercury Prize represents a significant high point in Elbow 's career .
But it did n't come easy .
The band , which has played together for 18 years , released its debut , " Asleep in the Back , " in 2001 .
The album exhibited a ranging musical dexterity that echoed early Radiohead and the progressive vibe of rock legends like Genesis and Pink Floyd .
The record also earned the ensemble its first Mercury Prize nomination .
Elbow 's follow - ups , " Cast of Thousands " in 2004 and " Leaders of the Free World " in 2005 , further underscored the group 's talent for moving , potent numbers .
The band faced a significant problem with its label , V2 , however , during the release of " Leaders of the Free World . "
" By the time V2 released that record , they were collapsing , " recalled Garvey .
" The fact that they were collapsing meant that we 'd did n't get the record service the way we wanted ...
We 're very proud of that record , and still are .
But there were Elbow fans in the world that did n't know it was out .
It was a huge disappointment .
But the first thing we always do when faced with a disappointment or a setback , which has been going on for a long time , is get in the studio and start writing . "
Any concern the band felt over V2's demise gave way quickly to focus in the studio , and in early 2008 , " The Seldom Seen Kid " arrived .
" Mark said a long time ago that you do n't need record labels to make records , " said Garvey .
" And , he 's absolutely right .
We made 偲he Seldom Seen Kid ' without a record label , just the five of us , with Craig doing the producing this time .
So for this one to be the one that 's got the commercial success , the first one we 've done completely on our own , in our own studio , makes us even prouder . "
Elbow 's sound seethes and swells as much as it blazes over sundry scales .
The band 's graceful harmonies and melodic textures result from an extensive sonic trial and error process .
" We do an awful lot of experimenting , " said Garvey .
" For every song that makes a record , there are 12 that do n't .
And they become nothing most of the time or we grab odds and ends of them and use them in different song .
We 've got this terrific synthesizer fanfare thing that I wrote about three or four years ago , maybe more than that .
When we finally get it on a tune , it 's going to put whatever song we put it on over the edge . "
Field recordings and expanded instrumentation are among Elbow 's most effective music tools .
The barking dog that intros " Fugitive Motel " on " Cast of Thousands , " for instance , sets up the song 's longing air beautifully , while the bit of George Gershwin 's " Summertime " that plays out " The Bones of You " on " The Seldom Seen Kid " grounds the number in a sense of daily life .
" It 's always been whatever the album needs , and on a smaller scale , whatever the song needs , " explained Garvey .
" If it needs a trumpet refinement or if it needs a bicycle wheel , we 'll use a bicycle wheel ...
They can work as a mood changer or an answer . "
One or more stirring ballads typically anchor an Elbow album .
The emotive atmosphere in these songs , such as the yearning and aching isolation conveyed in " The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver " on " The Seldom Seen Kid , " owe their expressive force in no small measure to Garvey 's exceptional , vivid lyrics .
" I live in a confined place really , " noted the 35 - year - old singer - songwriter .
" I only write about things that I 've experienced , because that 's the only thing I feel any authority on . "
Poignant ballads aside , Elbow also likes to have fun musically .
One recent ditty , " The Fix , " offers a good - natured take on a racetrack scam , performed as a duet with guest artist Richard Hawley .
" If you try to do anything heartfelt as a duet , it 's immediately cheesy , with very few noble exceptions , " said Garvey .
" We decided that the best duets were comedy ones .
So we came up with the idea of two guys that fix a horse race and how they 'll spend the cash . "
Each Elbow album furnishes a decided start - to - finish listening experience .
Yet the group 's records may not reach listeners in their entirety these days due to music downloads .
While downloads provide income for recording artists , Garvey has mixed feelings about the distribution method .
" I 'd be lying if I said we did n't consider commerciality when choosing singles .
But , I would love to be able to bundle an album .
...
In download culture , where music is concerned , obviously it 's troubling that people are stealing music .
At the same time , I 've only got a problem with that if you can afford music .
If you can afford music and you steal it , then there 's a special place in hell reserved for you .
" Yeah , but I wish you could only download albums ( in their totality ) . "
In the meantime , Elbow has its attention on a more immediate matter - a fifth record planned for sometime in 2010 .
Like many sports that originated in Europe , cycling is not very popular with Americans .
The activity , like soccer and cricket , are seen as easier and less masculine sports than activities like baseball and football .
But anyone who ’s seen the Tour de France for themselves know this is far from the fact .
The truth is that professional cycling is one of the hardest endurance sports and requires a certain individual to reach the competitive level .
However , the reality that most pro cyclists shave their legs and arms does n’t lend any credence to the debate .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Personal details and photographs of the incoming head of Britain 's international spy agency have been posted on Facebook , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband acknowledged Sunday .
The UK's Foreiogn Office says foreign service staff should exercise caution on social - networking Web sites .
But he insisted that no compromising information had been revealed .
" You know he wears Speedo , swim , swimming , swimsuit ...
I mean what is that ?
I mean , that 's not a state secret , " Miliband said on a BBC Sunday morning talk show .
The man in question , John Sawers , is currently the British ambassador to the United Nations .
His wife posted details about their family , vacations and residence on the social - networking site , British media reported Sunday .
Her Web site has since been taken down , reports said .
Have you ever posted something you later regretted on a social - networking Web site ?
Sawers " was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6 , " said Miliband , using the common term for the Secret Intelligence Service .
" He is an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organization that does a huge amount for this country , " Miliband added .
" The fact that there is a picture , the head of MI6 goes swimming .
I mean , wow !
That really is exciting .
It is not a state secret . "
But intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear - Harvey said the leak was at least an embarrassment and possibly much worse .
" Have you ever seen the foreign secretary more embarrassed ? " he asked rhetorically .
" The Foreign Office should have made the announcement that no personal details should have been left on any computer or directory , " Trenear - Harvey told CNN .
The leak compromises Sawers ' personal security , said Trenear - Harvey , the editor - in - chief of " The World Intelligence Review . "
" You could have someone come online and insinuate themselves with Lady Sawers ' daughter , " who reportedly appeared on the Facebook Web site .
If she shares a computer with her father at home , " the house could pick up a virus , and once that happens we have access to the next chief of the Secret Intelligence Service , " the analyst said .
An additional reason for red faces is that Sawers will be in charge of a new British cybersecurity organization when he becomes head of MI6 , Trenear - Harvey pointed out .
The new organization , based at GCHQ , another British intelligence agency , will be " charged with making sure that all the intelligence services are not vulnerable to hacking , identity theft , or phishing , " Trenear - Harvey said .
This is not the first time a top British intelligence official 's personal details have been leaked .
When Richard Dearlove became the head of MI6 in 1999 , " his address in Putney was announced , " forcing the government to put Special Branch police officers there to protect him , Trenear - Harvey said .
And when Stella Rimington became the first publicly named head of MI5 , the domestic security agency , in 1991 , her north London address was revealed .
" She and her daughter fled the house and were put into an MI5 safe house , " Trenear - Harvey said .
Foreign service officers " are advised to exercise caution " on social - networking Web sites , a Foreign Office representative said , declining to be named , in line with government policy .
Sawers , 53 , is a career foreign policy expert .
He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair when Blair was prime minister , then became ambassador to Egypt and briefly represented Britain in Iraq .
He was political director at the Foreign Office for four years before going to the United Nations in 2007 , according to his biography on the Web site of the British mission to the U.N .
He is slated to replace John Scarlett in November as head of MI6 .
As chief of SIS , he reports to the foreign secretary , according to the SIS Web site .
" Known as the Chief of SIS or ' C ' ( after the first Chief , Mansfield Smith Cumming , who signed himself ' C ' ) , the Chief is the only serving member of the Service who is officially named in public , " according to the agency .
Facebook claims to have " over 200 million active users . "

So did Joe Biden just pull another " Biden " with his line this morning about " misreading " how bad the economy was ?
Some folks in the White House may chalk it up to " Joe being Joe , " but make no mistake , the administration is laying the groundwork for the second stimulus .
We predicted on Thursday , after the weak jobs report , that the second stimulus was no definitely on its way .
The very next day , Paul Krugman , a reliable thermometer for establishment thinking , chimed in and said we must do a second , bigger stimulus .
So when you have Joe Biden saying " we misread how bad the economy was " -- despite the fact that we stave off an outright collapse -- what else could he possibly be talking , other than : ' it 's time to do a second stimulus ' ?
So how will this be sold politically ?
Here 's a guess .
The administration and Congress will argue ( correctly ) that the first stimulus was n't actually a stimulus , but was mainly an expansion of various benefits and transfer payments .
Stuff like that .
This time , they 'll say , those gargantuan stimulus projects will be the priority , and they 'll say that the original stimulus demonstrated an enormous demand for cash to fund infrastructure projects , all around the country .
The question then , is timing .
Our guess is October .

Obamacare Is at War With Itself Over Future Costs
Right now , Obamacare is at war with itself .
Political efforts to buy off Big Pharma , private insurers , and the AMA are all pushing up long - term costs -- one reason why Douglas Elmendorf , head of the Congressional Budget Office , told Congress late last week that " the cost curve is being raised . "
But this is setting off alarms among Blue Dog Democrats worried about future deficits -- and their votes are critical .
Big Pharma , for example , is in line to get just what it wants .
The Senate health panel ’s bill protects biotech companies from generic competition for 12 years after their drugs go to market , which is guaranteed to keep prices sky high .
Meanwhile , legislation expected from the Senate Finance committee wo n't allow cheaper drugs to be imported from Canada and wo n't give the federal government the right to negotiate Medicare drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies .
Last month Big Pharma agreed to what the White House touted as $ 80 billion in givebacks to help pay for expanded health insurance , but so far there 's been no mechanism to force the industry to keep its promise .
No wonder Big Pharma is now running " Harry and Louise " ads -- the same couple who fifteen years ago scared Americans into thinking the Clinton plan would take away their choice of doctor -- now supportive of Obamacare .
Private insurers , for their part , have become convinced they 'll make more money with a universal mandate accompanied by generous subsidies for families with earnings up to 400 percent of poverty ( in excess of $ 80,000 of income ) than they might stand to lose .
Although still strongly opposed to a public option , the insurance industry is lining up behind much of the legislation .
The biggest surprise is the AMA , which has also now come out in favor -- but only after being assurred that Medicare reimbursements wo n't be cut nearly as much as doctors first feared .
But all these industry giveaways are obviously causing the healthcare tab to grow .
And as these long - term costs rise , the locus of opposition to universal health care is shifting away from industry and toward Blue Dog and moderate Democrats who are increasingly worried about future deficits .
My sources on the Hill tell me there are n't enough votes in the House to get either major bill through , even with a provision that would pay for it with a surcharge on the richest 1 percent of taxpayers .
House members do n't want to vote for a tax increase before their Senate counterparts commit to one .
Yet the Senate continues to be in suspended animation because Max Baucus and his Senate Finance Committee still have n't come up with a credible way of paying for health care .
In his testimony last week , Elmendorf favored limiting tax - free employer - provided health benefits , but organized labor remains strongly opposed .
Obama has less than three weeks before August recess .
Chances are dimming that he can get some form of universal health care passed in both Houses before the clock runs out .
The Democratic National Committee is running ads favoring passage in Blue Dog states and districts , but that wo n't be enough .
Now is the time for the President to begin twisting arms and knocking heads .
To control long - term costs , he 'll also have to take away some of the goodies that have been promised to the health - industrial complex , and maybe even cross Big Labor .
He also needs to come out clearly and forcefully in favor of a way to pay for the whole thing -- ideally , in my view , a surtax on the top .
#
I imagine many of you are still digesting Noah 's jeremiad yesterday on the mess over health care reform now unfolding in Congress -- and I want to encourage everyone to make it through -- and so I 'm going to keep what I have to say brief .
I was nervous about getting involved in the debate on health care reform debate because this seems to me above all a matter of infinite and infinitesimal details , and I have no confidence in my ability to process the minutiae even of what needs to be done by way of reform , let alone what the bills that take shape actually mandate .
My feeling is that very little of what 's being screeched about now is going to tell us much about what if anything makes it through Congress and onto the president 's desk .
Sure , the famous public option is important .
But I still think in the end what 's really going to matter is all that accumulation of detail , the stuff that hardly anybody knows about and even fewer people understand .
In a subject this complex , with ( count 'em ) congressional committees at working on bills , not to mention the conference committees that will eventually have to reconcile House and Senate versions , my prediction is that the only people who will really know what 's in there are the wonkiest of health care policy wonks .
And , of course , the lobbyists who have attached themselves to all those dozens and dozens of committee members fighting for the interests of their employers .
More and more it seems to me that if we get anything , it 's almost certainly going to be health care , not reform , with the revisions determined by which special interests have the most clout and the the deepest and shrewdest access to the lawmakers who can advance their agendas .
My existing gloom was only deepened by this Sunday blogpost from former Labor Secretary .
I had no idea that major concessions of this kind had already been made , at least within the respective committees .
I mean , if the drug companies already have it in the bag that they wo n't face any price competition , not only are we not going to have any " reform " of the American prescription - drug distribution system , not only is there no hope of getting control of obscenely skyrocketing drug prices , but with all those drug - company subsidies built into the package , we 're going to have one whopping chunk of cash added onto the total tab , just to pay off the drug companies .
( I 've highlighted just a couple of chunks of the text below , to signal the kind of information that deepens my gloom . )

MIT just updated its seminal 2003 study on the role nuclear power could play in America 's energy mix .
The upshot : Nuclear power 's appeal may have grown due to concern over greenhouse - gas emissions , but that has n't translated into any real progress in the U.S .
Same as it ever was ( AP ) " The sober warning is that if more is not done , nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation , " the study concludes .

The family of a terrified Chinese factory worker who jumped to his death after being interrogated over a missing iPhone prototype has been paid US $ 44,000 ( NZ $ 67,000 ) , while the factory in which he worked continues to smear his reputation .
Sun Danyong , 25 , committed suicide this month after one of the 16 prototype iPhones he ordered from the Foxconn factory assembly line went missing .
Family and friends say Sun told them he was beaten and humiliated by his superiors while being interrogated over the missing phone , claims that Foxconn has denied .
The incident has whipped up controversy in China and abroad and has helped shine a light on questionable working conditions in Chinese factories .
It has also highlighted the pressure Apple puts on staff and supply chain workers to keep its upcoming products secret .
In an interview with The New York Times , Sun 's brother , Sun Danxiong , 28 , said Foxconn paid his family US $ 44,000 compensation and gave Sun 's girlfriend a free Apple laptop computer .
The paper also spoke to Foxconn 's general manager of China operations , James Lee , who defended the company 's working conditions and continued to attack Sun 's credibility .
'' Several times he had some products missing , then he got them back .
We do n't know who took the product , but it was at his stop , '' Lee said .
Foxconn has suspended one of its security staff members over the incident pending a police investigation .
The man , Gu Qinming , told Chinese media last week that he did not beat Sun and only grabbed his right shoulder after becoming ' ' a little angry ' ' .
Gu's personal details were published on the internet by angry Chinese citizens , and he now claims he is unable to return to his home .
It has also been revealed that , just after being interrogated , Sun , a shy graduate who had finished university only a year earlier , sent a distressed SMS to his girlfriend , who later published the message online .
The message read : '' Dear , I 'm sorry .
Go back home tomorrow .
I ran into some problems .
Do n't tell my family .
Do n't contact me .
I 'm begging you for the first time .
Please do it !
I 'm sorry . ''
Sun jumped to his death from the 12th floor of an apartment building hours later .
Foxconn and Apple have both expressed their sadness at Sun 's death , but neither has released any further details about the investigation into it .
Local police have so far refused to comment .
In a press release issued after Sun 's death , China Labor Watch lambasted Foxconn 's '' inhumane and militant management system , which lacks fundamental respect for workers ' rights '' .
CLW published a detailed investigation into working conditions at Foxconn last year but claims the company failed to address the issues it raised .
They include '' serious labour violations including excessive working hours , unpaid wages for up to 30 minutes of work each day , compulsory overtime and extremely poor dormitory conditions ' ' .
The organisation alleges Sun 's death was not the first suicide at a Foxconn factory and that other workers have reported being beaten with ' ' iron bars and whips ' ' .
It also claims that only workers producing Apple products are given stools , and the rest must stand .
CLW said workers were housed in '' converted workshops with hundreds of workers per room ' ' , which is similar to conditions that Britain 's Daily Mail found when it published photographs and details of the harsh working conditions at Foxconn 's iPod factories in 2006 .
Foxconn has still not recovered the missing iPhone , but Sun 's brother is confident Sun had nothing to do with it .
Biographies of Sun published in Chinese media have said he grew up in an isolated mountain village in the south - western province of Yunnan and his family was so poor that he would erase the old pencil notes from his school books and reuse them .
He had only just graduated with a business degree from one of China 's best schools , the Harbin Institute of Technology .
When he started work at Foxconn he told his parents '' from now on you do n't have to work so hard , you should enjoy a little ' ' , China 's Southern Metropolis Daily reported .
'' He was honest and modest .
He would never steal anything , '' Sun 's brother told The New York Times .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The story of Sen. John Ensign 's affair with a former staffer took a new twist Thursday with the revelation by Ensign that his parents gave the woman 's family $ 96,000 as a gift .
Sen. John Ensign of Nevada admitted in June to an extra-marital affair .
A statement released on Ensign 's behalf by his lawyer , Paul Coggins , said a check totaling $ 96,000 from both of Ensign 's parents was given to Cindy Hampton , her husband , Doug , and two of their children in April 2008 .
It described the money as two separate gifts to each family member .
" Each gift was limited to $ 12,000 , " the statement said .
" The payments were made as gifts , accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts . "
Under U.S. tax laws , gifts of up to $ 12,000 are tax - exempt .
According to the statement , Ensign 's parents learned of the affair from their son and decided to make the gifts " out of concern for the well - being of long - time family friends during a difficult time . "
Doug Hampton was Ensign 's administrative assistant and Cindy Hampton worked on his election campaign when the affair occurred .
Ensign and his family were longtime friends with the Hamptons .
Ensign , a Republican from Nevada , announced the affair in June , more than a year after the check was given .
Prior to the announcement , he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012 , and it is unclear if the affair has derailed his chances .
The revelation raised questions about whether Ensign violated campaign finance reporting laws .
On Wednesday , Doug Hampton told the Las Vegas Sun political television program " Face to Face with Jon Ralston " that his wife received more than $ 25,000 in severance pay , which would trigger campaign finance reporting stipulations .
Do n't Miss Senator quits leadership post after admitting affair
In response , the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a non-profit that focuses on government wrongdoing , called Thursday for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the case .
Melanie Sloan , executive director of the liberal - leaning group , told CNN that if Ensign paid Cindy Hampton more than the $ 25,000 threshold as severance , he would have to report it as an in - kind campaign contribution .
She said no such report has been filed .
Sloan conceded that gift payments to Cindy Hampton and her family would not trigger the campaign finance reporting requirement .
Also Thursday , the Las Vegas Sun published on its Web site what it said was a letter from Ensign to Cindy Hampton that ended their affair .
The one - page hand - written letter published by the newspaper was dated February 2008 and began " Dear Cindy . "
" What I did with you was wrong , " it said .
" I was completely self - centered and only thinking of myself . "
The letter laments the harm caused to her family , naming " Doug " and three children .
" I betrayed everything I believe in .
I lied to myself over and over , " it said .
" I take 100 percent responsibility for my actions .
It was wrong ; it was sin .
God never intended for us to do this . "
Ensign 's office refused to comment on the letter .
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Shirley Zilberstein contributed to this report .

**EDITED UPDATE : AT&T is planning on requiring data ( +30 $ on your bill ) on smart phones by Sept 6th , 2009 it seems .
Reporters are saying that this will greatly reduce smart phone sales , and stifle innovations in digital wireless phone use as people would choose a cheaper standard phone that burns minutes .
AT&T is most likely doing this as customers are realizing they are essentially paying 3 x for data ( texts , voice minutes , data ) and are trying to make it ’s new customers look at minutes and not megabytes .
An iPhone or smart phone has the abillity to make many phone calls , texts over a data - only plan for minimal charges .
AT&T appears once again to be slowing innovation , etc like it ’s famous for .
There would be no surprise if many lawsuits or FCC hearings take place yet again .
This great idea that wireless customers can do everything they need over a simple data - only plan is not known by the general public , and is huge .
AT&T is spearheading that lack of public knowledge and will be charging sourly for it .
For instance , a person could jailbreak legally , get a data - only plan through T - mobile , install Skype on their iPhone , install TextPlus and generally be set .
( safari is already installed for browsing the web )
Chapter 1 : http://iphonenodata.com/
Chapter 2 : Using this site , you can use your jail broken or non-jailbroken phone to simply disable EDGE or 3G use for those customers who do n’t want to pay 30 bucks / month for data services that AT&T offers in your area .
( If you signed an iPhone 2 - year contract , however your stuck with it unless you cancel your contract for 175 $ early termination– and believe me : canceling right away if your not planning on using AT&T ’s data will save you 545.00 $ over the 2 - year contract .
That ’s 30 / month/2years-175$=545 $ )
Use wifi instead .
Chapter 3 : If you want to go further and use your iPhone on another network , you ’ll want to Jailbreak your iPhone .
This requires a little more computer soul .
This term Jailbreaking only means to release your phone from the steel clutches of AT&T’s .
Nothing more .
This is also perfectly legal as your only changing something that ’s yours .
There are no U.S. laws that prohibit this .
There has been a lot of mass chit - chat about this being illegal , and in no way can be true as it is something tangible that you own .
The device is yours !
USE it how you see fit .
If you do n’t like AT&T , cancel your contract ( the 175 $ early termination fee ) and switch to T - Mobile , they are glad to help you out after you Jailbreak your iPhone , which allows it to be used on a lot of foreign networks as well !
Chapter 4 : A good site to help you do this can be found here .
Get a friend with more experience to help you .
An iPhone free from the monopoly that it ’s currently tied to is definitely cheaper , and you can truly then enjoy whatever network you see fit and build it the options you want .
For instance , customer # 001 might want wireless data only , as they ’ll be using textplus app with minimal skype voip .

As Delhi prepares for the Commonwealth Games in 2010 , former BBC South Asia correspondent Sam Miller finds how the ancient city is changing at breathtaking speed .
Delhi has a population of more than 15 million
The inhabitants of India 's other great cities , Mumbai ( Bombay ) and Calcutta , used to sneer at Delhi with its much smaller population , and its supposed lack of sophistication .
" It 's a collection of villages , " they would say .
" A fossil , a reminder of past empires .
Not a real city . "
They would joke : " Delhi has got no culture just agriculture . "
They would say it was boring and sleepy .
But Delhi has begun to emerge from the shadow of Mumbai and Calcutta , and even provokes a certain amount of jealousy .
It is now - depending on how you calculate such things - one of the five most populous cities in the world , with a cultural life that equals or surpasses that of its Indian rivals .
Delhi attracts migrants from all over India ( as well as some like me , from the rest of world ) and is now the most cosmopolitan and fastest - growing of India 's large cities .
It has one of the world 's best metro railway systems , with more than 50 stations being added to the network over the next 15 months .
It is also visibly preparing for its next moment of anxiously anticipated glory , the Commonwealth Games of 2010 .
Unsurprisingly , then , there are construction sites all over the city .
But despite this extraordinary speed of development , Delhi remains both the leafiest and most archaeologically impressive of the world 's megacities .
Magnificent ruins
Most evenings , just before sunset , I walk or run in a huge secret park in the heart of modern Delhi .
A ruin which is part of the Siri Fort .

It is really a jungle with footpaths , known only to those who live close by .
And peeking out of the jungle are the ruins of one of Delhi 's earlier incarnations , known as Siri Fort , the capital of the Khilji dynasty built in the early 14th Century .
These ruins include one magnificent cathedral - like building - three stories high - that always seems destined to topple over in the next storm .
It is popular with peacocks , but I have never seen another human there .
Delhi is littered with such ancient ruins , so many indeed that the ones in my park are not even included by the Archaeological Survey of India in a list of more than 1,000 heritage buildings in the city .
Anywhere else in the world these ruins would be a major tourist attraction .
Parts of the walls of Siri were recently excavated and restored and the workmen told me why they were doing it .
" It 's for the Commonwealth Games , " they said .
Except of course it is not .
These ancient walls have absolutely nothing to do with the Games , which have become kind of Delhi shorthand for any piece of urban development that the authorities want to be completed by 2010 .
Hidden heritage
Two summers ago , back in my local jungle park , I found another ruin , in an area of wilderness so thick with undergrowth that I had to beat my way through it with a stick .
Despite its age the mosque failed to capture public interest
There , long - forgotten , was half a mosque , a tree growing out of one of its walls , but the perfect rosettes and squinches created by artisans 700 years ago still intact .
I tried to interest my friends and fellow journalists in my discovery of an unlisted ancient mosque in the heart of modern Delhi .
I told people about it at Delhi parties and they yawned .
I telephoned a leading historian of the medieval Sultanate period , who promised he would get back to me .
A guide book writer did come to see and she told me it will be mentioned in the next edition .
But I failed to get anyone else half as excited as me .
' Treasure hunt ' I tried the internet , joining a " treasure hunt " website called geocaching .com
I hid my treasure - a few coloured paper clips in a plastic jar - inside the mosque , and posted the map co-ordinates on the website .
I waited for eager treasure hunters to track down the mosque .
I went away on holiday and an irate American traveller posted a note on the website to say the co-ordinates were wrong and that he had been chased away by an angry pig .
In a city boasting such archaeological riches , smaller ruins may go unnoticed
On my return I went back to the mosque and discovered that my co-ordinates were correct .
The American had not gone to the wrong place .
The mosque had gone .
It had been bulldozed and there was no sign it had ever existed .
The wilderness had become a building site and squash and badminton courts were being built for - yes - the Commonwealth Games .
No -one made a fuss and I have found it hard to make the case that this archaeologically super - rich city is much poorer without one old tumbledown mosque .
And though I have been able to immortalise it in photos and text in a book I wrote about my adoptive city , I am also aware that it is just one of dozens of minor ruins that have disappeared in recent years .
And more will almost certainly go as the pace of development continues to accelerate .
Delhi is a city that is more proud of its future than its past .

The soundtrack to our lives contains certain noises which exist primarily to reassure the more vulnerable citizens of middle Britain that old values and traditions live on .
The shipping forecast , eager middle - class voices singing " Jerusalem " on the Last Night of the Proms , the Queen 's Speech : the content of all these things is unimportant beside the fact that they still exist .
They are little comfort blankets of sound .
It is time to admit that one of these aural symbols of national continuity has well and truly outlived its usefulness .
Radio 4's Thought For The Day has got to go .
There was a time when the calming tones of a vicar , Sikh or rabbi , saying nothing in particular but in a soothing , pastoral tone of voice , provided a welcome contrast to the bustle and aggression of the Today programme .
Now it seems unbearably patronising , a throwback to the bad old days when tweedy Establishment types took it upon themselves to tell the nation what to think and believe .
Everything is wrong with Thought For The Day .
It interrupts a programme of issues , news and discussion at precisely the moment when it is hitting its stride , thereby annoying ( and probably losing ) many listeners .
On Today , views are challenged , often ferociously , by its presenters , yet for those three minutes , some vaguely religious opinion – often rather mediocre and vapid – is given the floor , unchallenged .
The general standard of argument is so low that the slot often seems like a sort of celebration of non-thinking .
It comes as a shock when a big hitter , like the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rabbi Jonathan Sacks or Clifford Longley , makes a worthwhile point .
It is , of course , quite absurd that only those who happen to be marketing a religious faith should be allowed as contributors .
The BBC should be reminded that there is such a thing as a thinking non-believer , that an agnostic or an atheist is every bit as qualified to speak of moral and ethical matters as anyone else .
The argument that religious views are not represented elsewhere on the Today programme is patently unsustainable .

Yet , oddly , the problem is not that this pause for thought is too long but that it is not nearly long enough .
Three minutes of lightweight , uncontroversial waffle in a golden age of controversy is simply irritating .
Never in our history has there been such a general clamour of opinion all around us , in the press , online and in public debates .
Everyone now has a point of view and is eager to express it .
Yet , extraordinarily , the BBC responds by persisting with a feeble , virtuous sound - bite of sincere nothingness at a time of peak - hour radio .
We need more and better thoughts for the day on Radio 4 , away from the ghetto of news and interviews , released from the straitjacket of a three - minute broadcasting slot .
There is surely space in the schedules for a programme in which new , interesting and sometimes outspoken new voices debate the big issues behind contemporary events – a more inclusive , more daring Moral Maze .
There is a wild and savage jungle of opinion and thought growing rampantly in our early 21st - century culture .
In response , each morning at the same time , Radio 4 offers a very small , neat , carefully tended suburban garden .
It is not enough .
Strewth , meet a Pom who does n't even whinge
The Australian press has welcomed a double miracle .
Firstly , a 19 - year - old English student has managed to survive by eating grubs and mosquitoes after getting lost for 12 days in the remote Blue Mountains of New South Wales .
Then , the boy 's father turned out to be that rarest of things , a Pom who does not whinge .
As it turns out , the whingeing may soon be coming from Australians , and with some justification .
Hardly had Jamie Neale and his father Richard Cass been reunited before both of them signed up with a local agent for celebrities , Sean Anderson .
Jamie has a good survival story to tell , says Anderson , who anticipates bids from newspapers for his new client 's story .
School visits could be organised in which survival skills could be taught .
There might even be a diet book .
The search for the wandering student is said to have cost the Australian taxpayer about $ 100,000 .
Mr Neale and his father have offered their very sincere gratitude .
A sinister tale of political over - correctness
There is something very peculiar about a society which rewards those who write stories to entertain and educate the nation 's children by requiring them to buy a certificate confirming they are not paedophiles .
It is hardly surprising that normally relaxed and modest writers for children , among them Philip Pullman and Michael Morpurgo , are refusing to visit schools under these humiliating and insulting circumstances .
When authors are obliged by the Government to buy licences of acceptability before they are allowed to talk to their readers , something distinctly sinister is going on .
* That very contemporary phenomenon , the celebrity divorce , is posing all sorts of legal problems .
Adjudicating over the divorce proceedings of the Earl and Countess of Spencer , a judge has decreed that the new spirit of openness in family courts should cover public figures as well as " those who live their lives in tranquillity and anonymity . "
Then there is the burning question of " brand divergence " .
Because , like everything else in the world of the famous , a celebrity marriage is a marketable product , and the question of who wins custody of the brand image can be as sharply contested as issues concerning children or even property .
Such things matter , as Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills could testify .
Sir Paul , well and expensively advised on the public relations side , remains a cuddly national favourite .
Mills , however , who fired her publicity team , has been cast into the outer darkness .
Minutes after wiggling my feet into these five - toed monstrosities I was creeping across a coworker 's desk like Spider -man .
Sadly , Vibram FiveFingers do n't actually let you stick to walls and ceilings , but they are wickedly fun to wear .
Vibram FiveFingers are little more than flexible plastic soles with just enough cloth to hold them snugly on your feet .
They have little individual pockets for each toe , making the FiveFingers into a sort of foot glove .
The resulting footwear feel less like shoes and more like tougher , more invulnerable versions of your feet .
Traction is incredibly good , due to the grippy material , the separation of the toes , and the addition of siping , or tiny zigzag cuts etched into the soles that expand into little treads as the sole flexes .
The VFFs are also surprisingly comfortable .
Each toe is snuggled inside its own little pocket , which is not only cozy , it also gives your feet a surprising amount of feedback about the ground you 're standing on .
Your toes , freed from their typical leather prisons , act like a tiny topography sensor array .
Running in FiveFingers is much like running barefoot , except without the mincing " Ow - ow - ow ! " moments as you hit a patch of gravel or sun-baked asphalt .
You have to use the same stride ( and the same , probably atrophied , calf and arch muscles ) as you do when running with naked feet .
The end result is good :
By forcing me into a more efficient stride , the VFFs helped subtract nearly a minute from my admittedly slow per-mile pace .
Also , a growing body of research suggests that minimal or no footwear will result in fewer running injuries .
But it takes some getting used to if you 've never run barefoot before .
Start with very short runs , and work up gradually .
Vibram offers four different models of its FiveFingers line ; I tested two .
The Classic offers as clean a line as you 're going to get from such freaky footwear , but the KSO ( short for " Keep Stuff Out " ) is more practical for running , with webbing on the top to keep debris from sneaking in and a single strap for snugging the shoes more firmly onto your feet .
Vibram FiveFingers will make you look like you have plastic gorilla feet .
They 'll draw curious , often appalled stares from strangers and mockery from your family .
But by making you run as if barefoot , Vibram FiveFingers might just make you a stronger , faster and less - injured runner .
They are not moving out , merely strolling to their new home on Penguin Island , at San Francisco zoo , during the annual March of the Penguins in 2007 .
Housing a colony of Magellanic penguins since 1984 , the zoo was also home to a gay penguin couple , Harry and Pepper , who recently broke up after living together for six years .
( George Nikitin / San Francisco Zoo / Associated Press )
A pair of male penguins who have nested together for six years apparently broke up when a female penguin became available , say caretakers at the San Francisco Zoo .
Harry and Pepper , a pair of Magellanic penguins , started nesting together in 2003 and incubated an egg last year .
However , zoo keepers confirmed in early July that Harry has been nesting with a female penguin , Linda , for several months , said a report in the San Francisco Examiner .
Linda and Harry became friendly shortly after her long - term partner , Fig , passed away in the winter .
Within a week of Fig 's passing , Harry was spotted in Linda 's burrow .
Harry and Pepper had a violent confrontation and zookeepers removed Pepper from the penguin colony .
He has since been reinstated , but zookeepers say they 're concerned the upcoming penguin moulting season in late July could cause upheaval among penguin couples .
Zookeepers say it's not the first time Linda has been involved in such a triangle .
Several years ago , she left her longtime partner and moved in with Fig shortly after his partner passed away .
Earlier this year , zookeepers at Germany 's Bremerhaven zoo gave a same - sex pair of Humboldt penguins an egg to incubate .
The egg hatched in early June and the penguins , named Z and Vielpunkt , are raising the chick .
The pair is one of three same - sex pairs of Humboldt penguins at the zoo .
That means almost one - third of the zoo's 20 penguins who have attempted to mate exhibit homosexual behaviour .
Same - sex penguin pairs have also been observed at zoos in Japan , Scotland and New York .
More and more of Iran 's pro-government websites are under assault , as opposition forces launch web attacks on the Tehran regime 's online propaganda arms .
What started out as an attempt to overload a small set of official sites has now expanded , network security consultant Dancho Danchev notes .
News outlets like Raja News are being attacked , too .
The semi-official Fars News site is currently unavailable .
" We turned our collective power and outrage into a serious weapon that we could use at our will , without ever having to feel the consequences .
We practiced distributed , citizen - based warfare , " writes Matthew Burton , a former U.S. intelligence analyst who joined in the online assaults , thanks to a " push - button tool that would , upon your click , immediately start bombarding 10 Web sites with requests . "
But the tactic of launching these distributed denial of service , or DDOS , attacks remains hugely controversial .
The author of one - web based tool , " Page Rebooter , " used by opposition supporters to send massive amounts of traffic to Iranian government sites , temporarily shut the service down , citing his discomfort with using the tool " to attack other websites . "
Then , a few hours later , he turned on the service again , after his employers agreed to cover the costs of the additional traffic .
WhereIsMyVote.info is opening up 16 Page Reboot windows simultaneously , to flood an array of government pages at once .
Other online supporters of the so - called " Green Revolution " worry about the ethics of a democracy - promotion movement inhibitting their foes ' free speech .
A third group is concerned that the DDOS strikes could eat up the limited amount of bandwidth available inside Iran – bandwidth being used by the opposition to spread its message by Twitter , Facebook , and YouTube .
" Quit with the DDOS attacks – they 're just slowing down Iranian traffic and making it more difficult for the protesters to Tweet , " says one online activist .
But Burton – who helped bring Web 2.0 tools to the American spy community – is n't so sure .
" Giving a citizenry the ability to turn the tables on its own government is , I think , what governance is all about .
The public 's ability to strike back is something that every government should be reminded of from time to time . "
Yet he admits to feeling " conflicted . " about participating in the strikes , he suddenly stopped .
" I do n't know why , but it just felt ... creepy .
I was frightened by how easy it was to sow chaos from afar , safe and sound in my apartment , where I would never have to experience–or even know –the results of my actions . "
Meanwhile , San Francisco technologist Austin Heap has put together a set of instructions on how to set up " proxies " – intermediary internet protocol ( IP ) address – that allow activists to get through the government firewall .
And the Networked Culture blog has assembled for pro-democracy sympathizers a " cyberwar guide for beginners . "
Stop publicizing these proxies over Twitter , the site recommends .
Instead , send direct messages to " @stopAhmadi or @iran09 and they will distributed them discretely [ sic ] to bloggers in Iran . "
Other advice :
Keep you bull $ hit filter up !
Security forces are now setting up twitter accounts to spread disinformation by posing as Iranian protesters .
Please do n’t retweet impetuosly , try to confirm information with reliable sources before retweeting .
The legitimate sources are not hard to find and follow .
Help cover the bloggers : change your twitter settings so that your location is TEHRAN and your time zone is GMT +3.30 .
Security forces are hunting for bloggers using location and timezone searches .
If we all become ‘ Iranians ’ it becomes much harder to find them .
* Do n’t blow their cover !
If you discover a genuine source , please do n’t publicise their name or location on a website .
These bloggers are in REAL danger .
Spread the word discretely * [ sic ] through your own networks but do n’t signpost them to the security forces .
People are dying there , for real , please keep that in mind .
Denial of Service attacks .
If you do n’t know what you are doing , stay out of this game .
Only target those sites the legitimate Iranian bloggers are designating .
Be aware that these attacks can have detrimental effects to the network the protesters are relying on .
Keep monitoring their traffic to note when you should turn the taps on or off .
UPDATE : Here 's the latest wrinkle in the online conflict , according the activists '
Twitter streams .
The government is filtering text - message traffic , and Secure Socket Layer - protected web sites .
That 's making it much harder for pro-democracy types to communicate with each other – and with the outside world .
In response , the activists are calling for renewed assaults on government web pages .
" Iranian gvmt is blocking out all INTERNET / SMS / PHONE - as long as they do this , we cut down THEIR sites , " one Tweets .
UPDATE 2 : As of 12:30 pm eastern time on the 17th , PageReboot.com and WhereIsMyVote .info are both offline .

ALSO :
I really hope no one is shocked , because the disruptions at these town hall meetings are from operatives from the GOP and lobbyists representing the health care industries and insurance companies .

If you remember a certain story from way back when , Activision claimed that they owned the publishing rights to Brutal Legend , and because of this felt justified in suing the developer , Double Fine .
Now , Double Fine and the gang have striked back , countersuing the video game giant .
Activision ’s main purpose in suing Double Fine was to “ stop the release ” of Brutal Legend this October .
Double
Fine does not obviously want this hard work to go to waste , and thus have countersued , claiming Activision ’s lawsuit is out of pure malice and intended to hurt Brutal Legend and Double Fine .
The developer ’s own Caroline Esmurdoc said this in a statement this afternoon :
“ Double Fine ’s countersuit is a demonstration of our intention to fight for this game – Activision will not kill Brütal Legend . ”
Double Fine is also looking for an official judge ’s ruling that the developer was free from its contract with Activision , and was therefore allowed to sell the rights to current publisher Electronic Arts ( EA ) .
A slightly surprising tidbit that was shared was that Brutal Legend was dropped during the Vivendi / Activision merger after “ an effort to convert the game into a Guitar Hero sequel failed . ”
Who do you want to see come out on top ?
Activision , or Double Fine ?
Post your thoughts below !

Unlike Chris Grayling , the putative Conservative home secretary who invoked a subtle television series to score a clunking political point only then to be exposed as not having watched much of it , I have seen every episode of all five seasons of The Wire , the compelling HBO series about drugs , gangs and politics in Baltimore .
To him and all his colleagues in the shadow cabinet , I particularly recommend the final two seasons as a taster of the horrors that await them should they find themselves in office .
Mayor Tommy Carcetti is elected on a central pledge to crack down on crime .
He moves into City Hall only to discover that his predecessor has bequeathed him a hidden , massive hole in the schools budget .
To deal with this crisis , Mayor Carcetti is forced to betray his promises on law and order with the inevitable consequences for his credibility , the crime rate and police morale .
In an attempt to divert resources back to their department , well - intentioned but desperate detectives resort to mutilating dead bodies to create a panic that a serial killer is murdering homeless men .
We will see if a Conservative government comes to such a macabre end .
What we already know is that an enormous budgetary challenge will face David Cameron .
Except it will be worse .
The Conservatives will not even have the excuse that the hole in the finances was concealed by their predecessors , because everyone knows that the government is running a prodigious deficit which will have to be brought down whoever wins power .
The tax and spending – or , rather , tax and cuts – question will be central to the election campaign which will unofficially begin as politicians return from the sun loungers .
Before the August break , the Tories got the better of this battle .
They succeeded in making the dividing line one between their purported candour about the national finances and Gordon Brown 's stubborn refusal to acknowledge that cuts are coming .
This caused despair not just to Alistair Darling , but to several senior members of the cabinet .
One cabinet minister , who is already giving a haircut to parts of his budget , observed to me the other day : " I 'm not going to lie about it . "
He would be instantly found out .
The prime minister 's colleagues believe they have now persuaded him to move to a more defensible position .
Labour will acknowledge there will be cuts to turn the argument with the Tories into a debate about how , where and when those cuts should fall .
So long as Gordon Brown persisted with his transparently untruthful claim , there was less attention paid to the essential dishonesty of the Tory position .
At the moment , David Cameron and his team speak with two tongues .
One
Tory tongue declares that they will make deep cuts and asks us to salute the bravery of the Conservative leadership for saying so .
" The public finances are awash with red ink , " he cries .
" George Osborne and I have been straight about the need to sort out the public finances ... spending plans need to be reduced . "
Yet his prospective ministers are simultaneously talking from a contradictory script .
The other Tory tongue sprays us with implied promises that there will be more money for services under a Conservative government .
From law and order to schools and hospitals , from defence to transport , Tory spokesmen and women routinely suggest that life will be radically improved once they are the owners of ministerial limousines .
Mr Grayling introduced The Wire into our debate to promote the Tory trope of " Broken Britain " .
He was factually wrong to suggest that " many parts " of British cities resemble the murderous streets of Baltimore .
A second error , I think , is tonal .
Tories misread the voters when they describe Britain in such dystopian terms .
There is a lot wrong with the country and people know it ; their government has disappointed them in various ways and people are duly disillusioned .
Labour 's abysmal ratings in the opinion polls tell us that .
My sense , though , is that most people do not believe that they are living in a broken country .
Whenever the Conservatives seek to exploit anxiety about crime and disorder , they suggest that they will be spending a lot more money on the police and prisons .
Mr Grayling did not explicitly promise us that there will be x thousand more police officers and y thousand extra prison places when he is home secretary .
Like all members of the Conservative frontbench , he has been forced to take the vow of omerta when it comes to numbers .
He is not allowed to say directly that he will spend more , but he certainly implies it when he claims that Britain is broken and the Tories will fix it .
Many Conservatives have been playing this game over the summer .
David Willetts , who speaks for his party on higher education , is one of the most thoughtful members of their team and not as natural an attack dog as the shadow home secretary .
But the cerebral Mr Willetts has been snapping around the government 's ankles for failing to provide enough university places to satisfy demand .
He 's not wrong ; it is a crushing disappointment to many young people who have worked hard to secure excellent A - levels – even straight As – and yet can't find a place at university .
Mr Willlets seeks to position himself as their champion and every time he does so he implies that a Conservative government will provide the places which Labour has not .
Whenever anything goes wrong in Afghanistan , we can be sure to find Liam Fox parachuting in front of a camera .
The shadow defence secretary machine - guns his scorn for a government that has compromised the mission in Afghanistan .
" We are short of infantry and special forces , " barks the quick Fox .
Those troops we have " struggle with inadequate numbers of helicopters and armoured vehicles " .
I do n't argue .
New Labour has too often wanted to send men and women to fight wars without providing adequate resources for the job .
" Neither Blair nor Brown had the courage to take the tough decisions to match our resources to our commitments , " says Mr Fox and invites us to believe that he would not be such a coward .
So what would he do ?
Pull out of Afghanistan ?
He says not .
Find money for more helicopters , armoured vehicles and troops from elsewhere in the defence budget by scrapping Trident ?
That would be " madness " he says .
When the prospective Conservative defence secretary is asked to explain what he would do and where he would find the money , he mentions a strategic defence review – a foxhole for Mr Fox .
Michael Gove and Andrew Lansley want us to believe that the nation 's schools and hospitals will be transformed for the better in their custody .
The latest press release from Theresa Villiers , the Tory voice on transport , suggests that a Conservative government will finance high - speed rail lines to the north that Labour wo n't pay for .
Good news for those , like me , who are enthusiasts for high - speed rail .
But where 's the money , honey ?
In speech after speech , David Cameron says the axe is sharpened .
In speech after speech , George Osborne practises his swing .
The Tory leadership does not argue with the figure of a 10 % reduction in real terms , which would be a spending squeeze without precedent in postwar history .
Have they told Chris Grayling , David Willetts , Liam Fox , Andrew Lansley , Michael Gove , Theresa Villiers and every other Tory frontbencher who can't open his or her mouth without implying a spending increase ?
Messrs Cameron and Osborne are clearly conscious of this contradiction because in their most recent speeches they 've been trying to square it away .
The Tory leader talks about a " new approach to public spending " which will " get more for less " .
How this trick works is known only to members of the Magic Circle .
The shadow chancellor , in a cheeky contribution during August , went so far as to claim that " progressive reform with the Conservatives " would produce a big reduction in spending while " cuts on the frontline can be avoided " .
All gain and no pain !
The axe that never hurts !
That earns an A for audacity , but gets an F for credibility .
I grant them that money is n't everything when it comes to performance .
It can be possible to improve standards without additional resources .
There is nearly always waste to be identified and methods of deploying existing money more productively .
It is even sometimes possible , when reform is terrifically smart , to squeeze more from less .
Yet significant reform often also involves extra cost , at least initially .
Michael Gove 's ambition is to create many more academy - style schools , which are more expensive than average schools .
Reductions to the civil service sound painless for everyone else , but they will not be cost - free ; there will be a big redundancy bill to pay .
No British government of any complexion has ever managed to make a real term cut to public spending of 10 % and at the same time miraculously generated more police officers , extra high - speed rail links , a larger and better equipped army , improved healthcare and better schools .
The Tories are either conning themselves or they are trying to dupe the voters – it is probably a blend of both – when they suggest that you can have both deep cuts and better public services .
As they say in The Wire : " A lie ai n't a side of a story .
It 's just a lie . "
Previously , we took you through all five beta versions , now we 'll take you through the final GM ( gold master ) seed .
( And when it goes live on iTunes for one and all , we 'll update any changes we find as well , so consider this your one - stop - shop for everything iPhone 3.0 ) .
Waiting to download iPhone 3.0 ?
Trying to figure out exactly what 's included in the new OS ?
Wondering what 's changed since iPhone 2.2.1 ?
Need a handy link to send your friends who may have questions ?
TiPb 's got your back with our complete iPhone 3.0 Software Walkthrough .
i Phone 3.0 software offers a host of new features ( 100 according to Apple ) .
However , not all of these are available on every hardware generation .
Here 's a list of the differences , and we 'll mention them again , as appropriate , below .
2009 iPhone 3GS : All features
2008 iPhone 3G : no video camera , voice control , compass , or related features .
2007 iPhone 2G : no video camera , voice control , compass , stereo Bluetooth , MMS , or related features .
Also note : iPhone 3.0 launches 2 days before iPhone 3GS , so until we can get our hands on the new hardware and take proper screenshots , we 've included captures from Apple 's video .
We apologize for the lower quality and will swap them out as soon as we can .
What Has n't Changed
As has become our custom , we 'll start off by listing what has n't changed in iPhone 3.0 .
It 's amazingly short this time :
Weather : Still unchanged from iPhone 1.0 .
Still no HTC TouchFlo 3D - style animations , and no landscape mode with more / different information .
Nada .

Previously upgraded for iPhone 2.0 with landscape - activated scientific mode , calculator does n't sport any additions this time around .
That 's it !
Home Screen
At first glance the SpringBoard app behind the iPhone 3.0 Home Screen seems identical to earlier versions .
Sure , SMS is now labeled Messages , the Stocks icon has had a make - over , there 's a new Voice Memos icon and app and -- exclusively for iPhone 3GS owners -- a new Compass icon and app .
With iPhone 2.x , Apple introduced 9 Home Screen pages , allowing 148 apps total .
i Phone 3.0 expands that to 11 pages , allowing 180 apps total ( 11 built in , leaving 159 for 3rd party apps and WebClip Safari bookmark shortcuts -- rumor has it you can load more , but their icons wo n't be visible ) .
Not much else looks different .
There are still tiny dots above the dock that signify your additional app screen .
However , there 's now an equally tiny magnifying glass icon to the left of them ...
Spotlight
On the Mac , Spotlight is the system - wide indexing and search feature that allows you to find files by scouring through metadata and text strings .
Apple re-purposes the name and icon here for a new , system - wide iPhone search feature that serves up Contact names , App names , iPod media file names , Email headers ( from , to , and subject ) , and Calendar event names .
You can access Spotlight from the main / primary Home Screen by swiping from left to right , or by clicking the Home Button .
When on the Spotlight Screen , you can return the main / primary Home Screen by swiping back from right to left , or clicking the Home Button again .
( Yes , clicking Home will toggle you back and forth between those two screens ) .
Spotlight starts with a blacked - out screen with a search box on top and the portrait keyboard on the bottom ( no landscape mode for Spotlight thus far ) .
As you type , results begin to populate the screen , narrowing as you refine your search term .
At any point , you can tap on a Spotlight search result to launch the app and / or take you to the resulting content within an app .
Hitting the blue Search button at the bottom right will slide the virtual keyboard away and give you full screen results .
Or almost full screen .
Since Spotlight is integrated into the Home Screen , the Dock is revealed along with the results so you can quickly launch any of your four docked apps ( Phone , Mail , Safari , and iPod if you 've kept the defaults ) .
Voice Control
With iPhone 3.0 when used in conjunction with iPhone 3GS , holding down the Home button ( or the center button on earphones ) sounds a tone and launches Voice Control , which takes the VoiceOver feature introduced in the iPod shuffle to the next level by allowing you to talk to the iPhone .
Voice Control 's interface is simply a wave form with the various commands floating by , and a cancel button .
Currently , supported commands include : call / dial [ contact name ] , call [ contact telephone number ] , play [ playlist name , album name , artist name , song name ] , what [ song , group ] is this , play more songs like this ( creates Genius playlist ) , shuffle .
A second tone is followed by VoiceOver ( which is computer generated ) repeating back your command and then your corresponding call or music starts .
( It 's not hard to see this eventually expanded to include things like : email Bob at work , launch app Peggle , take voice memo , etc. now is it ? )
One of the most impressive aspects is how many languages will be supported by Voice Control at launch :
Chinese ( Mainland ) , Chinese ( Taiwan ) , Czech , Danish , Dutch ( Belgian ) , Dutch ( Netherlands ) , English ( Australian ) , English ( UK ) , English ( U.S. ) , Finnish , French ( Canada ) , French ( France ) , German , Greek , Hungarian , Indonesian , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Norwegian , Polish , Portuguese ( Brazil ) , Portuguese ( Portugal ) , Romanian , Russian , Slovak , Spanish ( Mexico ) , Spanish ( Spain ) , Swedish , Thai , Turkish
Force Quit
Under iPhone OS 1.x and 2.x , holding the Home button down allowed you to force a frozen application to quit , clear the RAM , and return to the Home Screen .
Since , as mentioned above , holding down the Home button now launches Voice Control on the iPhone 3GS -- and does nothing on the iPhone 2G or iPhone 3G , Force Quit has be reassigned .
Now , to Force Quit an app you hold down the sleep button until the the red " slide to power off " control appears .
Then hold the Home button down ( it can take a while so keep holding ! ) and -- presto! -- the current process will be terminated , memory cleared , and you 'll be taken back to the Home Screen .
Messages
Messages is the new SMS , and is renamed to signify the addition of MMS ( multi- media messaging service ) .
It allows , in the case of the new iPhone OS 3.0 software , for you to receive , vCards ( contacts ) , audio , location , and -- for iPhone 3GS only -- video to be sent using the Messages interface to any other smartphone or feature - phone that supports MMS and those file types .
Once you receive an MMS , you can tap the icon in the message bubble to get a better look at it .
In the case of a contact , you 'll see a page similar to what you get when you call up a contact in Phone , except at the very bottom you 'll have extra , saving and sharing related options that we 'll cover later in the Phone app section .
Location opens in Google Maps as you 'd expect , audio and video in iPod , and images pop up full screen where you can tap the share icon to Save Image -- but strangely not re-share it ...
Note :
The details of MMS vary carrier to carrier .
While many international carriers do have MMS enabled with the iPhone 3.0 launch , AT&T is the largest and most notable exception .
When it comes to sending MMS , only picture sending can be initiated from within the Messages app itself .
Everything else starts a " share " function from another app ( i.e. Share Contact is in Contacts , Share Location is in Google Maps , Share Audio is in Voice Recorder , etc . )
There are two ways to insert a picture into MMS .
The first is to tap the camera icon , bottom right .
A requester will ask if you want to Take Photo or Choose Existing .
Take Photo will call up an embedded version of the Camera app .
Frame your picture , tap the camera icon , look at the preview and either hit Retake to try again or Use to insert the picture into your MMS window .
( If you want to erase it later , just backspace over it like you would a text character you want to delete )
Choose Existing will call up an image picker ( like the Photo App ) .
Pick an Album , pick a picture , and tap Choose to confirm .
The second way to insert a picture into MMS is to paste it ...
The new , system - wide Cut , Copy , and Paste service has also been introduced into Messages .
It works in a similar way to the implementation in the Notes app , and we 'll cover it more fully there .
One difference is that double tapping a previous SMS will give you the Copy popup allowing you to duplicate the entire contents of the SMS to the clipboard .
Tapping on an empty entry box will launch the Paste popup , so you can stick the contents back down in an message of your own .
If the entry box already contains text , double tapping will select the closest word , and double tapping an holding will select the closet word and popup the loupe .
Again , we 'll cover this more fully in the section for the Notes app .
Messages also now includes line - item deletion and forwarding .
Tap the Edit button at the top right , select the messages you want -- as many of them as you want -- and then hit the red Delete button at the bottom , or the blue Forward button beside it .
Edit still is n't the most elegant name for the combination of deletion and forwarding , mind you , but the functionality is consistent with the Mass Edit feature introduced for Mail in iPhone 2.0 .
Lastly , Apple has also answered the call for pervasive landscape - style keyboards , and Messages is one of the text - entry apps that received it .
For those who want a Cadillac - wide typing experience , enjoy !
( Note to Apple : a way to " lock " the iPhone in portrait or landscape mode would be appreciated , especially when typing while reclining and every little angle change sends the UI spinning . )
Calendar
Calendar appears largely unchanged from the perspective of the app itself .
No landscape rotation for week view -- still no week view of any kind .
There are , however , two very welcome new features for Exchange users .
You can now add Invitees and set Availability when adding a new event .
Tap Invitees to open the Add Invitees pane , then start typing to search for contacts or hit the blue + icon to pull up the embedded Contacts picker .
You can add more than one invitee .
Tap Availability to choose between Busy , Free , Tentative , and Out of office .
The other changes occur in the plumbing and are -- somewhat counter - intuitively for us at least -- hidden almost entirely away inside the Preferences app ( see that section for more details ) .
That 's a shame because they 're rather significant : support for CalDAV and Subscribed Calendars ( i.e. holidays , sports schedules , etc. ) .
Once added via Preferences , however , here 's an example of how Subscribed Calendars look :
Photos
The Photo app receives an update in the form of integration into the Copy ( no Cut or Paste here ! ) , MMS , and -- for the iPhone 3GS -- video camera systems .
For iPhone 3GS users , the Camera Roll now also includes any videos you 've shot with the device .
Similar to how iPhoto on the Mac handles video thumbnails , they 're shown intermingled with still pictures , a transparent black bar along the bottom showing the video icon and the run time of the video .
Tabs along the top let you switch from the All view to Photos only or Videos only as well .
When in the Gallery view mode ( where pictures are tiled in four columns of thumbnails ) , tapping on the Action button at the bottom left corner will no longer slide up a menu , but will place two or three buttons along the bottom .
For Camera Roll , these are Share , Copy , and Delete .
For any other galleries , you 'll still get Copy and Share , but not Delete ( yes , you still can't delete synced photos , only ones you 've taken with the camera itself ) .
Tapping on a thumbnail will select it ( or de-select it if it has already been selected ) .
Selected photos are labeled with a red check mark icon in the lower right corner , and number of photos selected is reported in parenthesis and continuously updated beside each of the buttons .
However , if you select more than 5 images , Share will no longer be enabled ( you can still copy them and paste them into Mail , however . )
Tapping on Share button will let you send the photos via Email or MMS , Copy will place them on the clipboard , and Delete ( Camera Roll only ) will trash them .
In single photo viewing mode , you can Copy an image to the clipboard by touching and holding .
A Copy button will pop up just above you finger .
Tap it and the image is copied .
Also in single photo viewing mode , the Action button now brings up a longer list of options : Email Photo , MMS , Send to MobileMe , Assign to Contact , Use as Wallpaper .
i Phone 3.0 also now presents the Action button in Landscape mode , though the list view is n't as attractive for some reason .
When in Landscape mode , f you choose to share via Email or MMS , for example , the Email or Messages app pops up in Landscape mode as well .
Expected , but we do n't always get what we expect so it 's still nice to see .
Sharing to MobileMe now does double duty , publishing photos and video alike .
For photos , you can choose any existing MobileMe gallery , but can't create a new one .
Video is similar , though adds YouTube to the list of supported targets .
We 'll cover that at the end of this section .
For iPhone 3GS users , you can view and share videos in much the same way as photos .
Tapping on a video in the gallery bring it up full screen , portrait or landscape , along with a big Play button in the center .
Hitting the play button , of course , plays the video .
If the controls are up ( tap the screen to reveal or hide the controls ) , you 'll see similar options to photos , though the play button here will play the video , not start a slide show .
The biggest difference is the Trimming control along the top .
Similar to how Voice Memo works ( we 'll cover that later ) , you can drag to select a point you want to see in the video , or you can drag either end -- at which point the outline turns yellow -- to cut off part of the beginning or end of the video .
Tapping the yellow Trim button will re-save just the selected part of the video .
Note : trimming video is current destructive -- you save over the full clip with the trimmed clip , and can't go back .
i Phone 3.1 Beta , however , looks to provide a Save As function for non-destructive video editing .
Options for sharing video include Email Video , MMS , Send to MobileMe , and Send to YouTube , though video will be highly compressed for sharing , and file size limits may not let all videos be shared via all options .
Camera
For iPhone 2G and iPhone 3G , the Camera app gets a minor tweak .
Now , after you take a picture , instead of the Camera Roll icon at the bottom right , you see a tiny thumbnail of the last photo taken .
( Even if there are additional items in the Camera Roll , like screen - captures , only the last actual camera photo taken is shown ) .
i Phone 3GS gets the above tweak , and a major upgrade thanks to the new auto - focus lens .
Now , Camera will try to focus on what it thinks is the most important element of your photo -- even macro !
If , however , you want to focus on something else instead , just tap the iPhone screen to re-focus .
A handy square overlays the sweet spot , so you can make sure the lens is set exactly where you want it to be .
Perhaps the biggest addition for iPhone 3GS is the ability to shoot not only still pictures ... but video as well .
To switch from still picture to video capture mode , simply toggle the slider at the bottom right of the screen .
When you do , the camera icon , used to take a still picture , is replaced with a red recording icon that stays dark when in standby mode but blinks when video is being taken ( keeping the common vidcam metaphor alive and well ) .
Like with still pictures , video can be taken in portrait or landscape mode .
YouTube
The big news for the YouTube app in iPhone 3.0 is account integration .
You can now enter your YouTube login information for access to your Subscriptions and Playlists .
Stocks
The Stocks widget is still powered by Yahoo , and still lists your favorite stocks on top and a handy graph at the bottom .
You can now swipe across that handy , however , to change it into a news feed or a more detailed set of information including opening price , high , low , volume , P/E , market cap , 52 week high , 52 week low , average volume , and yield .
Rotating Stocks to landscape mode now expands the graph to full , wide screen mode .
But there 's more : youch a point on the graph and you get the exact price for that day , touch a second finger somewhere else on the graph and you get the difference in value between those two days ( delta ) .
Maps
For iPhone 2G and iPhone 3G owners , Maps is the same as 2.1 .
Sure , under iPhone 3.0 developers can now embed the maps in their App Store apps , but from the built - in point of view -- nothing .
( Google Latitude will , apparently get support via the browser , go figure ? )
For iPhone 3GS owners , however , Maps will now leverage the new digital Compass hardware .
Tap the Get Location button to find your coordinates via GPS , then tap it again to get your directional heading via the Compass ( shown as an expanding white spotlight effect extending out ahead of you ) .
Voice Memos
Following iTunes and App Store , Apple 's third new built in app since launching the iPhone is also it 's first new , non-Storefront app .
Voice Memos is also the first new app to shove its way into the middle of the existing apps ( iTunes and App Store were added to the end ) .
( Note to sticklers : Remote and Keynote , though from Apple , are n't built in to the software and require download or purchase separately from the App Store . )
Voice Memos , from icon to main screen , pays homage to an old - style microphone ( though , unlike Calculator , we do n't believe it 's one ever manufactured by Braun ... ) .
The bottom has buttons for Record and ( a rather non-intuitive - looking stack of three horizontal lines ) to access Voice Memos that have previously been recorded .
In the middle is a sound level meter .
Tap Record to begin and the Record button becomes Pause , the More button becomes Stop , and the top of the screen flashes red to show you you 're recording and the duration of the recording .
When you 're finished recording , the More page shows Voice Memos in a similar fashion to Visual Voice Mail in the Phone app .
Tap a Voice Memo to play or pause it , toggle Speaker on or off , or use the buttons along the bottom to Share ( via email or MMS ) or Delete .
You can also tap the blue circles at the far right of each recording to slide into an Info screen where you can further tap to slide across to a Label screen pre-populated with tags including None , Podcast , Interview , Lecture , Idea , Meeting , Memo , and Custom .
Choosing Custom slides another screen over where you can input your own Label names .
Back on the Info screen , tapping on Trim Memo slides up a bare - bones editing interface for taking off any unwanted content from the beginning and / or end of your recording .
Interestingly , Apple chose yellow for trim slider and Trim Voice Memo action button .
Share on the Info screen does the same thing as the Share button on the Voice Memos screen .
Convenience through repetition ?
Notes
First up , you can now " swipe to delete " notes from the main contents screen , just as you could " swipe to delete " email all the way back to the original iPhone OS .
Consistency points !
Next , like messages , Notes benefits from the several system - wide -- or at least multi-app - wide -- improvements in iPhone 3.0 .
The first is the pervasive landscape keyboard .
Just rotate and the accelerometer does the rest .
The big thing , of course , is Cut , Copy and Paste .
It works similarly for text -- though not identically -- across all supported applications , so we 'll do the heavy lifting here .
To start , double tap on some text .
That will highlight the word and pop-up buttons for Cut , Copy , and Paste ( the last of which only appears if there 's already text in the clipboard ) .
You can also tap on an empty area to pop -up buttons for Select , Select All , and Paste .
( Select highlight the closest word to the current cursor position , and again you need text already in the clipboard for Paste to appear ) .
If you want to change the length of your selection , grab one of the blue dot's that form the handles on the top left or bottom right of your current selection and drag them in or out to add or subtract text .
As you move the handles , a magnifying loupe will appear , similar in function to the round curser placement loupe that dates back to iPhone 1.0 .
This loupe , however , is a wide , horizontal , rounded rectangle and lets you more precisely adjust your text selection .
Selected text can then be Cut or Copied to the clipboard , or replaced by Pasting over it with text from the clipboard .
Text can also be pasted at the current cursor location by double tapping to bring up the Select , Select All , and Paste pop up .
If at any time you either type or paste something in by mistake , Apple has added a gimmicky yet semi-cool undo feature -- just shake your iPhone to call up an Undo , Redo , and Cancel dialog .
( Note : While the Mail app , discussed below , gets similar Cut , Copy and Paste functionality , so do most 3rd part App Store application that use standard text input controls .
Awesome ) .
Finally implementing functionality that Steve Jobs listed off during his iPhone 1.0 introduction at Macworld 2007 , Notes now sync via iTunes back to your Windows PC or Mac .
Lastly , predictive text in general seems to have been improved as of Beta 3 .
Or rather , the dictionary that tries to guess and replace words as you type seems to have been updated .
Clock
The Clock app gets a minor tweak -- you get a lap display in the upper right hand corner of the Stop Watch .
While the main stopwatch shows total time as always , the lap counter shows only the time passed since you last hit the lap button .
Settings
Apple typically tucks numerous changes , large and small , neatly away inside the Settings app , and iPhone 3.0 is no exception .
Due to the volume of changes , we 'll break them down by category .
Wi-Fi
Auto - login increases the ease of logging into commercial - style Wi-Fi services ( the kind that typically present a web - based password form for authentication , like at hotels or coffee shops ) .
In Settings , you now have the option to toggle on Auto - Join , which saves passwords and then automatically uses it next time to return to the same network .
Also , when you login , you get a special slide - up window with some new controls and an embeded web - view — no more inconvenient app - jump to Safari .
An added benefit for fans fans of super - strong , pseudo - random passwords -- the kind almost impossible to type by hand -- paste works in the password field .
This means you can copy it from an email or text file of any kind and paste it right in .
Very welcome !
Notifications
Push Notifications gets its own top level button in Beta 3 and as of Beta 5 and Apple beginning Push Notification testing , not only can users globally or individually enable or disable Sounds , Alerts ( text boxes ) , and / or Badges , but each app gets its own sub - screen to do likewise .
( i.e. if you want Twitter to badge but not alert , IM to sound but not badge , etc. you can have it your way ) .
As with GPS on iPhone 3G under OS 2.0 , Push Notification - enabled apps will ask permission on launch , and give you a chance to choose " Do n't Allow " or " Okay " on a per-app basis as well .
General Settings : Network
New to Network Settings is Internet Tethering .
On supported carriers ( and no , AT&T is n't supporting it yet and there 's no word on when they will ) Internet Tethering will display current status , Off or On .
Tap the button to go to the Internet Tethering Settings , then toggle the switch to On .
If Bluetooth is n't currently enabled , an alert will pop up asking you if you want to enable it , or to leave it off and tether via USB .
When tethering is on , a blue bar appears at the top of the screen , similar to the green bar that appears when a phone call is in progress .
Unfortunately , unlike the green phone bar , it tapping the blue tethering bar does n't seem to send you back to the tethering Settings to quickly toggle it off .
General Settings : Restrictions
i Phone 3.0 now provide more in the way of Parental Controls .
First off , iPod has been removed from the top menu and Location has been added .
A secondary menu has now been added below to provide more granular control over iPod content , allowing you to select which country / region ratings you use , and then set Music & Podcasts , Movies , and TV Shows .
Control for Apps is at the very bottom .
App Restrictions can be based on age - ratings .
Currently supported options are :
Do n't Allow Apps
4 +
9 +
12 +
17 +
Allow All Apps
General Settings : Home
Additional options are now available for you to assign to a double - click of the Home button .
They 've grown from Home ( i.e. same as single click ) , Phone Favorites , and iPod to now include Search ( epic win for mobile accomplishers ) and Camera .
A sub-menu for Search Results allows you to check on or off the exact types of information you want called up in a Spotlight Search .
Options include Contacts , Applications , Music , Podcasts , Video , Audiobooks , Notes , Mail , and Calendar .
You can also tap and hold down the line icons on the right side of any category and drag them to change the order of how search results are presented ( i.e. you could move Applications on top of Contacts , and Spotlight will then list Apps first ) .
General : International
Courtesy of BGR , it looks like Voice Control 's languages settings will be found here when iPhone 3.0 is running on iPhone 3GS hardware .
General : Keyboard : International Keyboards and General : International , Keyboards
Even more international language keyboards are now available in iPhone 3.0 : Arabic , Greek , Hebrew , Indonesian , Malay , and Thai .
Good news for people in those regions eager to get their iPhone on .
( And let 's see a hardware keyboard do that ! )
Settings : Mail , Contacts , Calendar
You can add a MobileMe account , just like before , but now if you already have bookmarks , contacts , or other data on your iPhone ( for example , if you synced it over via iTunes ) and you enable MobileMe , a menu will slide up asking if you want to Merge the data , Not merge ( i.e. replace ) , or Cancel .
Once you 've added a MobileMe account , there 's now a new option called Find My iPhone .
Turn it on , then go to www.me.com, login to your Account tab , and choose Find My iPhone from the sidebar .
A map will show you the current , approximate GPS coordinates for your iPhone .
There are also options to send a text and / or sound alert to your iPhone ( e.g. a number where you can be reached if someone finds it ) , and to remote wipe your device if you think it 's been stolen or permanently lost and you want to protect your data .
As mentioned previously , also hidden here are the new LDAP ( contacts directory ) , CalDAV , and Calendar Subscription , features under Add Account , Other .
Settings : Safari
Options can be found here for the new AutoFill feature , and a submenu for choosing who 's Contact Info you want to use for the fill , as well as an option to allow Names & Passwords to be stored and AutoFilled , and a button for Clear All to wipe the AutoFill database clean .
This , at least , gives us some control as to whether we want the security of not storing and filling our passwords on a device that could be lost or accessed without our approval , or the convenience of saving us a lot of typing .
Likewise , the new anti-Phishing Fraud Warning can be toggled on and off .
Keeping it on , of course , provides some level of safety when encountering malicious websites made to look like ones we trust , intent on stealing our login info and / or credit card data .
Of course , no list of Phishing sites is ever complete or completely up to date , so keep surfing safely .
Settings : Messages
With the addition of MMS in iPhone 3.0 , now , of course , Settings follow to includes an MMS Messaging On / Off toggle .
Settings : iPod
New to the iPod Setting is a toggle to enable the Shake to Shuffle option that Apple debuted with the latest generation iPod shuffle .
Settings : Store
Not as elegant as it looks in iTunes or App Store apps , but Settings give you a third , convenient point for on - device switching between iTunes store accounts .
You can sign in , view account details , and sign out .
Then you can sign in under a different account ( i.e. spouse 's account , different country 's store , etc . )
Note :
There was some confusion about whether or not Apple would let you re-download paid apps if you enabled multiple accounts ( so you could n't log in as your buddy , for example , and get all his or her apps for free ) but the restrictions that were in place during the beta period seem to be gone ( for now ? )
ITunes Store
As mentioned above , iTunes Store now allows management of multiple iTunes accounts .
Scroll down to the bottom of a main page ( i.e. before you 've selected a specific piece of content to look at ) and you 'll find a button containing your account username .
Tap on the button and you 'll be given options to View Account , Sign Out , or Cancel .
Much more convenient than having to exit , launch Settings , navigate , switch accounts , go back , etc .
iTunes also adds to the previous music and podcast on - device download capability with support for Movie , TV Show , Music Video , Audio Book , and iTunes U content .
To make room , the tabs at the bottom lose Top Tens and Downloads and now include Videos ( movies , TV , music video ) and a standard More icon , which gives access to a screen offering Audio Books and iTunes U , as well as the displaced Downloads and relocated Redeem ( for gift certificate codes ) .
Like with the iPod App , an Edit button lets you drag around tab icons to lay things out just the way you want them .
When you find a video you want to learn more about , tap on it and you get a detailed description .
Like with music , you can sample before you buy .
Tap the Preview button to see a short clip or trailer .
Instead of just playing like music , however , iTunes opens an embedded iPod video player .
Also , like with video podcasts , music , and App Store apps , 3G is n't an option for anything over 10 MB -- which for video we imagine will be almost everything -- so have your Wi -Fi standing by .
App Store
App
Store gets the same iTunes account management functionality as the iTunes store , above .
Also , Apple has also and again changed the way screen shots appear in the App Store .
Now , you get full screen shots , side by side , with the ability to swipe through them .
You can see additional screenshots on each side when more are available backward or forwards .
( Similar to how you swipe through multiple Safari tab pages ) .
In - App Purchases and Subscriptions
Two other changes coming to the app store , in - app purchases and subscriptions , are more difficult to document right now because no apps that make use of them have currently been released in the App Store .
So , we 'll base this for now on what Apple has presented and update it as soon as real - world examples go wide .
By way of example , if you previously wanted commercial E - Books , a developer had to wrap a reader app around each E - Book , and then sell each E - Book as a separate app on the App Store .
This led to dozens upon dozens of apps that were just more books , or otherwise variations on the same functionality with different content .
With iPhone 3.0 , a developer can now sell you an E - Book Reader app , and inside that app , they can sell you the individual E - Books .
If you choose to buy another E - Book , the same type of iTunes confirmation and password requester will pop up as when you buy a stand - alone app , and the same iTunes - side billing and processing happen .
This can also work to buy additional levels or extra content in games , and theoretically map packs for navigation apps , etc .
Yes , Apple just invented the $ 0.99 " scaleware " model .
Buy the low - price , entry - level version of an App , and if you like it , buy more .
It 's not a demo , it 's not shareware , but it does let developers a way to create a cheap evaluation model for users to try before they buy ... more of it .
Why $ 0.99 ?
To avoid user confusion , Apple wo n't let developers sell additional content to apps they gave away for free .
If you want to charge more later , you have to charge at least something up front .
Otherwise , " free apps stay free . "
Subscriptions , for their part , seem to work just like In - App Purchases , with the pop - up advising you are purchasing X issues of Y content for Z dollars .
( e.g. 6 months of iPhone Monthly for $ 1.99 ) .
Push Notification
Perhaps the highest profile addition to third party apps , if not the App Store proper , is the release of the - anticipated Push Notification service ( PNS ) .
This service is supposed to replace some forms of background multi-tasking support , which Apple allows for their own apps like Mail , Phone , and iPod , but sites battery life , stability , and complexity of management as reasons not to grant third party ( App Store ) apps the same privilege .
So , under iPhone 2.0 , if you exit an Instant Messenger ( IM ) app , you no longer have anyway of knowing when a new IM comes in unless and until you deliberately relaunch the app .
( Sure , there are work around over SMS and Email , but the app itself is dead ) .
Under iPhone 3.0 , if you exit an IM that supports PNS , the developer 's servers will alert Apple 's PNS which then " push " an alert to your iPhone .
( Similar to how MobileMe already pushes alerts for email ) .
If you have IM , Twitter , a news app , etc .
Apple 's servers will handle all of them , so theoretically your iPhone only has to listen to PNS instead of each one separately .
One instead of many is supposed to save battery life .
PNS currently supports 3 kinds of alerts : badges ( like Mail uses to show you unread messages ) , custom sounds ( like a beep or bell or anything already built into the app by the developer ) , or modal text alerts ( like the kind that pop up to tell you about a new SMS ) .
With the text alerts , if an alert comes in , it will stay up until you dismiss it or act upon it ( e.g view an IM ) .
If a second ( or third , or more ) text alert comes in , however , it replaces the previous one , and that previous alert is gone forever .
In other words , if nine alerts come in , you 'll only ever see the ninth one and dealing with it gives you a blank screen , not the eighth -- or previous -- alert .
( Badges , if used and enabled , would still show you 9 messages had come in ) .
If your iPhone is in sleep mode , alerts will still pop up , but the " swipe to unlock " will dismiss them , but not send you to the alerting app .
Less than ideal , but perhaps the best solution given the limited notification handling the iPhone currently employs .
Dock and Bluetooth Accessory Connection
Potentially the biggest and most exciting development for iPhone 3.0 , if not the iPhone in general , is the ability of developers to make apps that directly communicate with accessories / peripherals via the USB dock connector or Bluetooth radio .
This means , in short , the iPhone will be able to connect with , display data for , and / or control medical equipment like glucose readers , production equipment like cameras , barcode readers , game controllers , keyboards -- almost anything developers care to create protocols for .
Peer - to - Peer Connectivity
Peer - to - Peer connectivity leverages Bonjour networking and the Bluetooth radio to create an easy way for apps to join together and exchange data .
It 's clearly directed at multi-player gaming , but Apple points out that any app can take advantage of it to share business cards , photos , or almost anything .
Yes , it 's the return of " beaming " .
i Pod Access
Finally , Apple grants developers access to your iPod library .
Now , third party apps can let you play , switch , and otherwise listen and control your music right from inside the app , without having to exit , launch the iPod app , exit , and re-launch the original app .
Compass
The Compass app is exclusive to the iPhone 3GS hardware , because that hardware is the only current device with a built - in magnetometer .
The app shows a stylized compass that will spin to show either true north or magnetic north , depending on which one you 've chose from the Info screen .
Via the GPS , coordinates are also shown along the bottom .
If magnetic fields or something else prevent clear readings , an interface comes up asking you to rotate the iphone in an figure - 8 patter to reacquire compass headings .
Phone
With iPhone 3.0 , the Phone app's Recents tab , when you tap the arrow to get more information , now shows you incoming calls from that contact , the time , and the duration .
If you spoke to that contact repeatedly without any other contacts in between , multiple entries will show you the information for each one of those calls .
Also , the Contacts tab ( and the stand alone Contacts app ) now integrate the " swipe to delete " functionality we all know and love from Email and other , previous apps going all the way back to iPhone 1.x .
Simply pick a name , and then swipe to call up the red " Delete " button .
Email
Email still has n't gotten a unified inbox or threaded messaging or unified messaging , but iPhone 3.0 does give the Email app a few improvements by way of the new system - wide changes .
Landscape keyboard lovers rejoice , Email now gives you the wide treatment when to rotate to that orientation .
Like with other apps , if you 're already in landscape when you share , link to , or otherwise launch Email , it comes up the very same way .
You also get the same Cut , Copy and Paste functionality as Notes with a couple notable exceptions .
First , you get support to copy rich text formatting ( bold , italic , html ) .
Second you can also paste pictures you may have copied from the Photo or Safari apps .
We 're not sure if there 's a limit to the amount of pictures you can send via 3G from the iPhone in a single mail yet , but we 've received 9 in one shot so far .
If anyone has reached a hard limit , let us know .
Spotlight lives inside Mail to , just like it did inside Contacts with OS 2.0 .
Scroll up slightly inside a mail box and you get the search input and buttons letting you choose between From / To / Subject / All .
As an added bonus , you can also go beyond the local store and " Continue Search on Server ... " on Exchange 2007 or later , MobileMe , or IMAP installations that support it .
Much like Mac OS 10.5 Leopard , Apple has expanded " data detectors " in iPhone 3.0 as well .
While previous iPhone version would identify phone numbers and link them to the Phone App ( just as web and email addresses link to Safari and Mail respectively ) , now 3.0 will try to identify address location to link to Google Maps as well .
Safari
As mentioned in the section on Settings , if you choose to enable it , Safari will AutoFill form fields based on your Contact info , or the Contact info of your choosing .
As a separate option , passwords you 've previously entered as well .
Also mentioned in Settings , Safari will try to protect you from Phishing sites if you enable it , presumably consulting an continuously updated blacklist of sites , presumably the same as recently implemented on the desktop Safari 4 Beta .
In addition , when you go to a site with an enhanced security certificate , the text on top of the browser turns green ( like the green bar , we get it ! ) , with little green lock icon beside it , and the name of the certificate 's trusted organization .
For example , the below screenshots show how Apple 's order status page looks on iPhone 2.2.1 ( top right ) and iPhone 3.0 .
What does this mean for users ?
In an age of increased phishing attacks , where bad sites try to trick you into thinking they 're your bank or shop and steak your login or credit card info , this is one more visual cue in your assessment process for determining if you can trust that the website is what it says it is .
Updates to Safari do n't end there , however , as Apple has also ( yes ! ) given us the option now to open links in new pages ( the iPhone equivalent of tabs ) .
Tap and hold on a link , and a menu pops up with the link path listed on top , and the option to Open the link ( in the current page ) , Open in a New Page , or Copy to the clip board .
As this is the same gesture used to allow Image Save in iPhone 2.0 , if the link happens to be a picture , Image Save is rolled right into the same menu as a an additional option .
( This is also a handy way to check which URL exactly is behind a link before you click on it )
Rendering speeds have also been improved , from 3 x to 16 x faster according to benchmarks .
Apple is using the new Nitro ( formerly SquirelFish Extreme ) engine to throw HTML and especially JavaScript up much faster than iPhone 2.2.1 could .
On mobile devices , this will likely make a far more noticeable difference to users .
The big news , however , is that Mobile Safari gets the Cut , Copy , and Paste love from Apple as well , although it works a little differently here than it does in Mail or Notes .
Perhaps because double - tap is already used for zooming , in Safari you hold your finger down on some text ( as you would in other apps to trigger the magnifying loupe ) and the entire paragraph of text is selected ( everything within the P , and perhaps DIV and other similar containers ) .
Sites that do n't properly format ( i.e. , use several BR , or line - break tags to simulate paragraphs ) are now exposed for their shenanigans by confusing the Copy mechanic , resulting in entire reams , or even pages of text being selected .
( For shame ! )
The blue dot handles at the top / beginning and bottom / end of the selection are used in Safari , but if you drag them enough , the whole block will become selected and you 'll get blue dots centered on all sides , and they can be pulled up or down to select previous or following blocks respectively .
Again , lack of proper HTML formatting can reduce the reliability ( so coders , fix your stuff ! )
Both text and / or images can be selected .
Paste works in form fields the same way it does in Notes and other apps .
i Pod
New in iPhone 3.0 , the formerly useless Repeat and Shuffle Option for when listening to a podcast has been replaced with an email icon on the left hand side , and a speed counter on the right hand side .
The email icon allows you to send an iTunes Link for the podcast ( similar to how you could previously email YouTube video links ) .
The speed indicator on the other side shows x1 during regular playback , and we presume it might show x2 etc. as Apple has previously allowed you to " speed up " talk - heavy content like Audio Books .
Where the Genius button would be on music tracks , we now have a circular backwards arrow with a 30 in the middle , which allows you to jump back in 30 second intervals .
Variable media scrubbing now lets you put your finger on the position indicator at the top , and the buttons change to a text message reading " Slide your finger down to adjust the scrubbing rate . "
Do so and the speed that you scrub though the file changes .
Displayed in place of the track info , options so far include half speed , quarter speed , and a fine grain speed .
While these controls would also be much appreciated in video , right now implementation is not there .
Movies and TV shows have the same Done and Full / Fit to Screen controls as previous OS , as do video podcasts in landscape view .
In portrait view , video podcasts gain the mail link and media scrubber , but retain the shuffle control .
Spotlight search comes to the iPod app .
Just like Mail , scroll up in any list - view ( like Podcasts , Playlists , Songs , etc. and the search bar appears .
Results populate as you type , and if you hit the blue Search button , the keyboard slides down and you can see all results organized by category .
As mentioned in the Settings section , Shake to Shuffle is also now available in the iPod app .
Just remember , if you enable it and then start to dance with your iPhone , your music might jump around with you ...
Another major check - box finally checked is support for Stereo Bluetooth .
Paired to an A2DP device ( similar to current blue tooth phone headset pairing ) , a Bluetooth icon appears to the right of the volume slider , and an Audio Source selector will let you choose from available devices .
( Note : this seems to work in apps like Pandora as well , bonus screen shot included below ! )
Game Center ( Preview )
Game Center is Apple 's new social gaming network ( think Xbox Live or Play Station Network ) complete with invitations , matchmaking , leaderboards ,
Conclusion
This is not a review -- our full rundown of the pros and cons will come soon -- so our conclusion only goes so far as to say that , after going through everything above , anyone who claims iPhone 3.0 is really more fittingly iPhone 2.3 deserves a swift kick in the apps .
This is a hefty release and we 're again impressed not only by Apple 's continuing ability to evolve the iPhone platform and provide software updates ( again , free of charge to iPhone users , $ 9.95 to non-subscription accounted iPod touch users ) , but for the easy and consistent way in which they 're doing it .
Kudos to the iPhone team at Apple .
Ca n't wait for 4.0 !

The Oyster concept for transforming wave power to onshore electricity .
A giant new machine called ’
Oyster ’ designed to harness the power of ocean waves and turn it into ‘ green ’ electricity is being installed on the seabed off the Atlantic shores of the Orkney Islands .
In autumn 2009 it will undergo demonstration trials to prove whether its innovative technology could lead to a commercial source of renewable energy for use in seashores around the world .
In contrast to many other wave power devices , Oyster uses hydraulic technology to transfer wave power to shore , where it is then converted into electricity .
‘ A key design feature is a 18 m wide oscillator based on fundamental research at Queen ’s University Belfast led by Professor Trevor Whittaker using their wave tanks ’ , explains Dr Ronan Doherty , Chief Technical Officer of Aquamarine Power the Edinburgh based company which has developed the first ‘ Oyster ’ .
The oscillator is fitted with pistons and , when activated by wave action , pumps high - pressure water through a sub sea pipeline to the shore .
Onshore , conventional hydroelectric generators convert this high - pressure water into electrical energy .
‘ The whole field of generating electricity from wave power is ground breaking ’ says Dr Doherty , ‘ But Oyster ’ technology is highly innovative because it relies on simplicity .
Its offshore component - a highly reliable flap with minimal submerged moving parts – is the key to its success when operating in seas vulnerable to bad weather where maintenance can be very difficult .
There is no underwater generator , power electronics or gearbox underwater to go wrong .
All the complex power generation equipment remains easily accessible onshore ’ .
Oyster is designed to be deployed at near - shore water depths of 12 to 16 meters , benefiting from the more consistent seas and narrower directional spread of the waves in this location .
The reduced wave height and load enhance survivability and allow a high percentage of annual average power and consistent power delivery .
Any excess energy is spilled over the top of the flap , its rotational capacity allowing it to literally duck under the waves .

The environmental risks associated with the device are minimized by using only water as its hydraulic fluid , rather than oil , and there are no toxic substances involved .
It is also silent in operation .
Based on figures from the Carbon Trust , each Oyster ’s annual carbon saving could be as much as 500 tonnes .
Although at an early stage of development , the Oyster concept could have significant potential for use in many locations around the world .
Dr Doherty explains : ‘ Our computer modeling of coastlines suitable for this technology shows that Spain , Portugal , Ireland and the UK are ideal candidates in Europe .
But globally there is huge scope in areas like the North West coast of the USA and coastlines off South Africa , Australia and Chile .
We estimate that the potential size of the market could be in excess of £ 50 billion ’ .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Big businesses are battling to take home chunks of the government 's billion - dollar stimulus pie and AT&T is among the leaders on the telecom front .
While the telecom giant can't go after stimulus funds directly , its clients include many government agencies that are on the receiving end of those funds .
And that puts AT&T in a strong position .
AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) is by far the nation 's largest telecom company , racking up $ 124 billion in sales last year .
That 's nearly double the revenue logged by its closest competitor , Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) .
AT&T also has a huge client base , which includes some of the largest federal and local government contracts .
The company has been using that base as a springboard to search out more projects , especially as the consumer side of its business slumps in the recession .
" Every conversation we have with federal agencies is about stimulus dollars and how we can help , " said Don Herring , senior vice president of AT&T Government Solutions .
The process .
AT&T has vast resources and is not afraid to use them .
" We have full teams , assigned to every agency in the federal government , who try to better understand the nuances of every agency 's mission and what they need , " said Herring .
" On a weekly basis , we 'll say , ' Here 's another idea about how you may want to do something . ' "
Requests are coming from clients as well .
" Customers have been asking us how we can help them meet their technology and infrastructure modernization goals for stimulus , " said Sherry Charles , AT&T 's vice president of Wholesale and GEM Solutions .
" It helps that we have longstanding relations with our customers . "
The company said the process is identical to how it goes about hunting for other government contracts , which AT&T said is a roughly a $ 65 billion business for tech firms annually .
Sometimes agencies give projects a direct go - ahead , but more often they request formal proposals so projects can be opened up for broader bidding .
So far , the stimulus process has been slow going , Herring said , with only some of the basic infrastructure funding trickling out .
AT&T 's first stimulus - related contract came about through a prior relationship with a client : $ 419,000 to upgrade circuits in several Social Security Administration offices across the country .
It 's small relative to the $ 14.3 billion in stimulus funds already awarded to companies .
But Herring noted that the vast majority of stimulus projects ( more than $ 250 billion worth ) have yet to be funded , and when the money begins to flow faster , AT&T will be well - positioned to be a part of bigger contracts .
Charles said the company is a good candidate help hospitals integrate electronic health records , which is being funded with $ 20 billion of stimulus money .
AT&T has already signed a contract with the state of Tennessee to custom build a virtual private network for e-health information exchange , she added .
AT&T is also working hard to get involved with broadband services in rural America , smart grid wiring , and other health IT programs .
" It 's still way to early to tell how AT&T will do , but they 're going to compete , " said Warren Suss , founder of Suss consulting , a federal IT and networking consultancy firm .
" The battle is on , and it is still to be determined who 's going to come out on top . "
Size matters .
AT&T is one of a very small handful of companies that offer practically every telecom service , including wireless , broadband , telephone and networking solutions .
" Agencies want one place to go , with one network and one carrier , " said Herring .
Analysts say big firms like AT&T are more likely to get stimulus funds than smaller competitors , as they have the resources to quickly act on a wide array projects and have the infrastructure to bid on a large number of contracts .
" AT&T has positioned itself well as an aggressive competitor for stimulus , " said Suss .
" This is n't an inexpensive game -- it takes a lot of resources to go after these big federal deals . "
Experience counts .
AT&T has been working on government projects for years , and at one time , it was the only game in town .
AT&T was a monopoly until the mid 1980s .
In fact , it was n't until 1989 that the government opened up its first telecom contract to a company other than AT&T , when 40 % of the government 's communications contracts were awarded to rival Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) , giving " just " 60 % to AT&T .
AT&T struggled through the 1990s .
And when those big federal telecom contracts were up for renewal 10 years ago , the company was completely left out for the first time ever .
But since then , AT&T has clawed its way back to the lucrative federal sphere , gaining scores of federal networking contracts with 20 different agencies when they were again up for renewal in 2006 .
The company said those contracts are worth more than $ 1 billion , with the first three alone worth $ 700 million .
" AT&T 's star is rising , " said Suss .
" It has won many of the major battles ... and has been very aggressive with pricing . "
Next month , the Nebraska Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an appeal by Maria Luis , a Guatemalan whose rights to her American - born son and daughter were terminated after she was detained in April 2005 on charges of falsely identifying herself to a police officer .
She was later deported .
And in South Carolina , a Circuit Court judge has been working with officials in Guatemala to find a way to send the baby girl of a Guatemalan couple , Martin de Leon Perez and his wife , Lucia , detained on charges of drinking in public , to relatives in their country so the couple does not lose custody before their expected deportation .
Patricia Ravenhorst , a South Carolina lawyer who handles immigration cases , said she had tried “ to get our judges not to be intimidated by the notion of crossing an international border . ”
“ I ’ve asked them , ‘ What would we do if the child had relatives in New Jersey ? ’ ” Ms. Ravenhorst said .
“ We ’d coordinate with the State of New Jersey .
So why ca n’t we do the same for a child with relatives in the highlands of Guatemala ? ”
Dora Schriro , an adviser to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , said the agency was looking for ways to deal with family separations as it prepared new immigration enforcement guidelines .
In visits to detention centers across the country , Ms. Schriro said , she had heard accounts of parents losing contact or custody of their children .
Child welfare laws differ from state to state .
In the Missouri case , Carlos ’s adoptive parents were awarded custody last year by Judge Dally after they privately petitioned the court and he terminated Ms. Bail ’s rights to Carlos .

In February , immigration authorities suspended Ms. Bail ’s deportation order so she could file suit to recover custody .
Ms. Bail ’s lawyer , John de Leon , of Miami , said his client had not been informed about the adoption proceedings in her native Spanish , and had no real legal representation until it was too late .

Advertisement President Barack Obama has said the " cycle of suspicion and discord " between the United States and the Muslim world must end .
In a keynote speech in Cairo , Mr Obama called for a " new beginning " in ties .
He admitted there had been " years of distrust " and said both sides needed to make a " sustained effort ... to respect one another and seek common ground " .
Mr Obama said the US bond with Israel was unbreakable but described the Palestinians ' plight as " intolerable " .
The president made a number of references to the Koran and called on all faiths to live together in peace .
He received a standing ovation at the end of his speech at Cairo University .
White House officials had said the speech was intended to start a process to " re-energise the dialogue with the Muslim world " .
' Not so unique ' Mr Obama said : " I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world ; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect . "
Tim Franks , BBC Middle East correspondent
President Obama 's language towards Israel is strong but also , maybe deliberately , imprecise .
Take these two sentences : " The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements " and " It is time for these settlements to stop " .
It is the same language that Hillary Clinton has recently used .
But what does it actually mean ?
Does it mean that settlement expansion should stop ?
Or , in fact , for existing settlements to be disbanded ?
Could the first sentence even mean that the US is beginning to revisit its studied ambiguity , for the past 30 years , over whether it views all Israeli settlements on occupied territory as illegal ?
Given the amount of time and effort that goes into working and re-working the text of a presidential speech , the apparent veiling of these two sentences is fascinating .
He said " violent extremists " had bred fear and that this " cycle of suspicion and discord must end " .
Mr Obama accepted that " no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust " but urged both sides to " say openly the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors " .
He cited the Koran as saying : " Be conscious of God and speak always the truth . "
Mr Obama said Islam had " always been a part of America 's story " .
He added that much had been made of the fact an African - American named Barack Hussein Obama had become US president , but he insisted his personal story was " not so unique " .
" The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America , but its promise exists for all who come to our shores - that includes nearly seven million American Muslims . "
' Intolerable '
The president also said Muslim perceptions of the US must change .
" Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype , America is not the crude stereotype of a self - interested empire . "
Mr Obama said America was not at war with Islam , but would confront violent extremists who threatened its security .
No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other

On the key issues of Iraq and Afghanistan , the president said the US sought no permanent bases in either country .
He said : " We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can .
But that is not yet the case . "
On the Israeli - Palestinian issue , Mr Obama said the bond with Israel was " unbreakable " .
He said : " Palestinians must abandon violence .
Resistance through violence and killing is wrong . "
But he also said the " situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable " .
" Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel 's right to exist cannot be denied , neither can Palestine 's , " Mr Obama said .
OBAMA'S TOUR
3 June : Saudi Arabia - talks with King Abdullah on Israel - Palestinian peace negotiations
4 June : Egypt - talks with President Hosni Mubarak , keynote speech at Cairo university
5 June : Germany - meets Chancellor Angela Merkel , visits to Dresden and to Buchenwald concentration camp
6 June : France - meets President Nicolas Sarkozy , attends D - Day events in Normandy
On the key issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank , Mr Obama said " there can be no progress towards peace without a halt to such construction " .
Israel is resisting calls to freeze building activity but Palestinian leaders have said there can be no progress towards peace without a halt .
After the speech , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned ministers to a special meeting and ordered aides and officials not to comment until a government statement was released .
The statement said the Israeli government hoped the speech " will indeed lead to a new era of reconciliation between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel " .
BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says Mr Obama was tough on both sides - perhaps tougher on Israel than we are used to hearing from an American president .
Our correspondent says Mr Obama made it clear there was no justification for Holocaust denial but he seemed to associate the state of the Palestinians with that of slaves in America .
A spokesman for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said the speech was a " good start and an important step towards a new American policy " .
The AFP news agency quoted Hamas , the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip , as saying the speech showed " tangible change " but also contained contradictions .
What is interesting is the absence of any threat against Iran .
This is in line with the president 's policy of avoiding threats against Iran - at least for the moment

On the Iranian nuclear issue , Mr Obama said : " No single nation should pick and choose which nations hold nuclear weapons " and said Iran had the right to peaceful nuclear power .
But he said there should be no nuclear arms race in the Middle East .
Before Mr Obama spoke , Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had delivered his own speech , saying the US was still " deeply hated " in the Middle East .
On democracy , Mr Obama said that " America does not presume to know what is best for everyone " .
" No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other . "
The president also touched on women 's rights , saying : " Our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons . "
Mr Obama arrived in Egypt from a visit to Saudi Arabia .
Later on Thursday he visited the pyramids before leaving for Germany and France .

What are these ?

The Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has put together a campaign to raise awareness of privacy issues surrounding Facebook applications , in particular quizzes .
According to this group , the millions of Facebook users taking quizzes are revealing far more personal information to application developers than they are aware of .
This is mostly due to the fact that Facebook 's default privacy settings allow access to all your profile information whether or not your profile is set to " private . "
Even worse , the ACLU reports that even if you shun quizzes yourself , your profile info is revealed when one of your friends takes a quiz .
Want to see how bad the problem is ?
Just take the ACLU 's Facebook Quiz and prepared to be shocked .
As any regular Facebook user knows , quizzes are some of the most popular applications in use on the social network .
Every day , our News Feeds are filled with everything from the latest variation on the " 5 Things " theme to the " What ( insert popular movie title ) character are you ? " and more .
But these seemingly innocuous time wasters could have dangerous privacy implications if they ended up being distributed by malicious app developers who want access to Facebook 's treasure trove of personal data .
The Danger of Quizzes
With each question in the ACLU 's Privacy Quiz , you 're not only told what information a quiz author can see - you 're shown .
For example , after answering the first question , you learn that almost everything on your profile , even if you use privacy setting to limit access , is available to the quiz .
Then , a graphic is shown which reveals select information retrieved from your profile including hometown , groups you belong to , events attended , favorite books , and more .
The second question is even more disturbing .
It informs you that everything on your profile is made available to the developers when your friends take a quiz .
To drive this point home , the ACLU 's Quiz loads up information pulled from your friends ' profiles and displays that data below the answer for your perusal .
Here , information on your friends is shown including hometowns , favorite books , political views , networks , birthdays , number of wall posts , and even personal photos .
Thanks to the quiz , all that info which you can see on your friends ' profiles is now available to the quiz author , too .
Lest you think your info is safe because somewhere , somehow Facebook is looking out for you , the third question shatters any illusions you may have about that , too .
According to the answer to this quiz question , not only do Facebook 's default privacy settings do nothing to prevent application developers from scouring your information , Facebook also does n't screen developers for trustworthiness nor to they require the developer comply with a privacy policy ( something we 've mentioned before ) .
It 's also noted that Facebook does not use any technical measures to limit how developers can collect and use personal information .
Says Chris Conley , a technology fellow with the ACLU , it 's difficult to know how developers use this data , which could , in theory , be collected and sold for marketing and advertising campaigns .
Finally , the last question prompts you to take action .
When the quiz asks you what you should do , the correct answer is : " demand the right to control my information without sacrificing the right to use new technology . "
To get the word out there , the ACLU suggests you update your privacy settings , share their quiz on Facebook , and sign their online petition .
Is This True ?
The nature of the quiz makes it sounds a bit like fear - mongering , especially with statements like this : " Once details about your personal life are collected by a quiz developer , who knows where they could end up or how they could be used .
Shared ?
Sold ?
Turned over to the government ? "
However , outside of these overly dramatic tactics , the claims made by the ACLU are true .
According to CNET , Facebook does n't even deny the fact that quiz developers have access to this sort of information .
The company does point out that users can limit how much information applications ( including friends ' applications ) can see by tweaking their privacy settings .
Note :
To do this yourself , go to Settings -> Privacy Settings ->
Applications .
From there , you can uncheck the boxes next to the items which you do n't want apps to have access to .
Still , the ACLU suggests that access to personal information such as this be opt - in rather than opt - out , as it is now .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt says the company " generally agrees " with the ACLU 's recommendations and notes that the social network recently disabled hundreds of applications that were inconsistent with Facebook Platform policies .
He also mentions the company has been working with the Canadian Privacy Commissioner , Jennifer Stoddart , to improve user data controls on Platform .
This is just one of the concerns that will be addressed later today when Stoddart announces the agreement that has been reached between her country and the social network in terms of privacy protocols .
Stoddart ruled last month that Facebook had 30 days to come up with a plan to comply with Canada 's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act or face court action .

7 Reasons to Keep Your Tyrannosaur OFF Crack Cocaine Dare to keep dinosaurs off drugs .
Grant Ordelheide is a professional landscape photographer based in Denver , Colorado who spends a lot of his time traveling to beautiful places all over the world taking photos and running workshops .
Every location he visits provides an opportunity for incredible pictures but the Grand Canyon is one area that is on his list of favorite spots to shoot , especially when there ’s lightning .
Grant describes his love of this immense National Park .
“ The Grand Canyon is one of the most incredible natural features in the world .
It is one of those places that no matter how many times I visit , my mind is blown each time I look over the rim .
It is even more incredible in mid to late summer during the monsoon .
The daily storms bring drama to the skies above the canyon , lending itself to ideal photography conditions .
If you are patient and a little bit lucky , it is possible to photograph lighting as it strikes the canyon walls . ”
Here are a few really great lightning photos Grant has taken on his trips to the Grand Canyon .
He won the My USA category for 2015 USA Landscape Photographer of the Year with the first image featured .
I photographed this storm as it moved across the canyon , heading straight for where I was standing on the South Rim .
I was able to make several successful photos , but kept telling myself that I would leave after the next strike .
I watched as the bolts got closer and closer .
Finally this one hit and after quickly checking to make sure it was in focus , I grabbed my gear and sprinted back to the safety of my truck .
Lightning strike over Point Imperial on the Grand Canyon ’s North Rim .
This storm really came together right after sunset .
As it moved closer and closer , the strikes were hitting with a greater consistency .
This is two frames , taken about 3 minutes apart and then blended to show all four bolts in one frame .
This image could also have been made using one long exposure , but I chose to do two shorter ones to keep the clouds from having too much motion blur .
Double Strike on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon .
Using a lighting trigger can really increase your odds of capturing a bolt in a photo .
In the daytime , when long exposures are almost impossible , a trigger is really key to being able to capture images like this .

Saviors and Survivors : Darfur , Politics and the War on Terror by Mahmood Mamdani , Verso , 2009 .
In Errol Morris ’s 2004 film The Fog of War , former US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara recalls General Curtis LeMay , the architect of the fire - bombings of Japan during WWII , saying that “ if we ’d lost the war , we ’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals . ”
LeMay was merely articulating an unacknowledged truism of international relations : power bestows , among other things , the right to label .
So it is that mass slaughter perpetrated by the big powers , from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan , is normalized through labels such as “ counterinsurgency , ” “ pacification ” and “ war on terror , ” while similar acts carried out by states out of favor result in the severest of charges .
It is this politics of naming that is the subject of Mahmood Mamdani ’s explosive new book , Saviors and Survivors : Darfur , Politics and the War on Terror .
Like the Middle East , parts of Africa have been engulfed in conflict for much of the post - colonial period .
While the media coverage in both cases is perfunctory , in the case of Africa it is also sporadic .
To the extent that there is coverage , the emphasis is on the dramatic or the grotesque .
When the subject is not war , it is usually famine , disease or poverty — sometimes all together , always free of context .
The wars are between “ tribes ” led by “ warlords , ” that take place in “ failed states ” ruled by “ corrupt dictators . ”
Driven by primal motives , they rarely involve discernible issues .
The gallery of rogues gives way only to a tableau of victims , inevitably in need of White saviors .
A headline like “ Can Bono save Africa ? ” is as illustrative of Western attitudes towards the continent as the comments of Richard Littlejohn , Britain ’s highest - paid columnist , who wrote at the peak of the Rwandan genocide “ Does anyone really give a monkey ’s about what happens in Rwanda ?
If the Mbongo tribe wants to wipe out the Mbingo tribe then as far as I am concerned that is entirely a matter for them . ”
Darfur is the conspicuous exception to this trend , though Rwanda did enter Western vocabulary after the 1994 genocide .
This , Mamdani argues , is primarily due to the efforts of one organization — the Save Darfur Coalition ( SDC ) — whose advocacy has been central to turning this into the biggest mass movement in the United States since the anti-Vietnam mobilization , bigger than the anti-apartheid movement .
While the mobilization did have the salutary effect of raising awareness about an issue otherwise unknown to the majority of US citizens , its privileging of acting over knowing renders this less meaningful .
Indeed , the campaign ’s shunning of complexity , its substituting of moral certainty for knowledge , and its preference for military solutions , precludes the very end that it purports to strive for .
Invoking what it claims are lessons of the Nazi Holocaust and the Rwanda genocide , it combines slogans such as “ never again ” with the battle cries of a new “ good war ” , such as “ boots on the ground ” , and “ out of Iraq and into Darfur ” .
Mamdani contends that SDC is not a peace movement , it is a war movement .
The SDC was established in July 2004 through the combined efforts of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the American Jewish World Service .
It has since been joined by a broad spectrum of political and religious organizations , a gaggle of celebrities and prominent intellectuals .
It has spawned student chapters all across the country that range from the high school to university levels .
Led by an advertising executive , it is the only organization capable of bringing together such unlikely partners as the Reverend Al Sharpton and author Elie Wiesel , actor George Clooney and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton .
If the signature activity of the anti-Vietnam war movement was the teach - in , for the SDC it is the advertising campaign .
The expert has been replaced by the celebrity , the campaigner by the advertising agent .
With an annual budget of $ 14 million the SDC employs the DC - based PR firm M+R Strategic Services ( M&R ) for its publicity .
While M&R boasts a clientele comprising mainly green and humanitarian non-profits , in 2002 it was exposed by PR Watch for using its progressive credentials to greenwash DuPont , one of the world ’s leading polluters .
The centrality of propaganda to the SDC ’s success was underscored by the fact that in the period between Spring 2007 and January 2008 , the president of M&R Bill Wasserman also served as Save Darfur ’s executive director .
The apparent diversity of the SDC ’s affiliates also obscures the fact that its agenda is mainly driven by Zionist organizations and the Christian Right .
However , Mamdani pays scant attention to the composition of the SDC even though he devotes a whole chapter to its politics and methods .
As The Jerusalem Post reported ahead of the SDC ’s rally in Washington on 30 April 2006 , it is “ [ l ] ittle known … that the coalition , which has presented itself as ‘ an alliance of over 130 diverse faith - based , humanitarian and human rights organizations ’ was actually begun exclusively as an initiative of the American Jewish community . ”
It noted that even in 2006 that coalition was “ heavily weighted ” with a “ diverse collection of local and national Jewish groups . ”
The Washington Post reported the same day that “ [ k ] eeping the peace within the diverse Save Darfur Coalition has not been easy ” due to tensions , in particular , between evangelical Christians and the mostly Muslim Darfuri immigrants .
The Sudanese immigrants also objected to the lineup of speakers which , according to the paper , included “ eight Western Christians , seven Jews , four politicians and assorted celebrities — but no Muslims and no one from Darfur ” ( two were eventually added at the last minute ) .
Ned Goldstein has suggested in his investigation of the Zionist interests behind the SDC that Darfur is being deployed as a strategic distraction from Israeli crimes against the Palestinians ( most recently at the UN anti-racism conference ) .
The salient feature of the SDC propaganda is to paint the conflict as war between “ Arabs ” and “ Africans ” and to label the violence “ genocide . ”
The genocide debate hinges on two factors : numbers and identity .
For mass violence to qualify as genocide the killing has to be on a large enough scale , and the intent to eliminate a discrete racial , ethnic , or religious group has to be established .
Mamdani argues that in order to sustain its claim of genocide , the SDC has inflated casualty figures and racialized the conflict .
The mortality figure of 400,000 has become a staple of SDC propaganda even though it has been repeatedly discredited .
In 2007 , the British Advertising Standards Authority chided the SDC ( and the Aegis Trust ) for breaching “ standards of truthfulness ” in its use of the figure for its UK advertising campaign .
The number had already been challenged when a panel convened by the US Government Accountability Office in collaboration with the National Academy of Sciences concluded that of the six estimates they studied , the figures presented by the SDC were the least reliable .
The most reliable estimate was the study carried out by the World Heath Organization - affiliated Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters ( CRED ) that had recorded 131,000 excess deaths at the peak of the conflict of which only 30 percent were due to violence .
The violence had dropped sharply after January 2005 ; this , Mamdani avers , was due mainly to the intervention of African Union peacekeepers .
By 2008 , the total deaths for the whole year had dropped to 1,500 .
These numbers are far lower than what constitutes an emergency according to the UN , let alone genocide .
The conflict began as a civil war in 1987 - 89 , driven less by race or ethnic rivalries than by a struggle for land and resources — it pitted the mostly nomadic landless Arabs against the mostly sedentary Fur peasants .
Compounded by Khartoum ’s botched attempt at land reform during the 1990s , turning it into a party to the civil war , the simmering conflict erupted into a full - scale insurgency in 2003 .
This eventually led to the government ’s brutal counterinsurgency campaign where it turned to nomadic tribes from Darfur and Chad to serve as proxies .
Mamdani identifies three causes as having contributed to the conflict .
First , is the history of colonial rule wherein the British went about a project of retribalizing Darfur through a system of native administration which created tribal homelands and introduced a principle of discrimination that privileged “ natives ” over “ settlers . ”
This led to the dispossession of nomadic tribes , especially the camel nomads of the north .
The tribal identities were further solidified through a census that required each registrant to choose a “ race ” ; a written history that presented Arabs as “ settlers ” from the Middle East ; and laws that gave preferential treatment to whoever was deemed a “ native ” .
This narrative also allowed the British colonizers to present themselves as merely following the precedent of an earlier Arab colonization .
Drought and desertification was the second contributing factor .
The Sahara ’s southern rim expanded by 100 kilometers , forcing nomadic tribes further south and eventually to encroach on the lands of the sedentary Fur tribes .
Finally , the civil war in neighboring Chad where opposition groups armed by Cold War rivals — the US , France and Israel on one side , and Libya and the Soviet Union on the other — had frequently taken refuge in Darfur , leading to a proliferation of weapons and militias .
Mamdani explains that the Western powers were involved in the conflict long before the Sudanese government was ; and Omar al - Bashir ’s Islamist regime was n’t even in power at the time .
The Arab - versus - African narrative obscures the fact that since at least the British colonial era , Arabs have been Darfur ’s most deprived constituency .
“ If Darfur was marginal in Sudan , ” writes Mamdani , “ the Arabs of Darfur were marginal in Darfur . ” Contrary to the British historiography — whose assumptions have since been reproduced in 20th century nationalist writings — most Arabs arrived in Sudan as refugees fleeing persecution in Mamluk Egypt .
Moreover , the diffusion of Arab culture was more a consequence of commerce than of conquest .
Mamdani demonstrates that “ Arab ” is not a racial , ethnic , or cultural identity .
It is an assumed political identity that is more a reflection of preference and power than of genealogy .
For example , former slaves once freed would become Fur in Darfur , and Arab in Funj , the Sultanate in riverine Sudan where Arabs dominated .
To be an Arab in Darfur therefore signifies nothing so much as weakness .
The conflict in Darfur today is as much between Arabs ( the Abbala camel nomads against the Baggara cattle nomads ) as it is against the relatively privileged Fur and Massalit , and the less privileged Zaghawa .
The SDC however emphasizes the north - south axis of the conflict that pits Arab against Fur and ignores the south - south Axis which pits Arab against Arab .
The Darfuri rebels likewise defy easy classification .
When the insurgency began in 2003 , there were two major groups — the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) and the Sudan Liberation Army ( SLA ) — they have now split into 26 .
JEM , which is the largest rebel organization , has an Islamist orientation and draws its inspiration from Hassan al - Turabi , the influential Sudanese Islamist and one time ally of Omar al - Bashir .
In contrast , the SLA is secular - Africanist with ties to the Sudan People ’s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) in the South ( led by the late John Garang ) .
Before the split between the Islamists in Khartoum , the government had employed Darfuri Islamists led by future JEM founder Khalil Ibrahim for its counterinsurgency in the south .
( Ibrahim opposed the power - sharing agreement that ended the war in the south . )
However , according to Sudan scholar Alex de Waal , both organizations learned “ to characterize their plight in the simplified terms that had proved so effective in winning foreign sympathy for the south : they were the ‘ African ’ victims of an ‘ Arab ’ regime . ”
The government ’s response to the insurgency was at first a half - hearted attempt at reconciliation , followed by the arming of a proxy force comprising nomadic militias , many of them from Chad , who have come to be known as the Janjawid .
The consequences were devastating , with large - scale bloodletting and the displacement of 2.5 million people .
Khartoum ’s use of proxies to quell an insurgency and the resulting death and displacement parallel US policies in Iraq , where ethnic - sectarian militias have been deployed against the mostly - Sunni insurgency .
Yet , unlike Iraq , where in excess of a million have died according to the lates ORB poll , and five million displaced , the violence in Darfur has been labeled a genocide .
Darfur has also spawned domestic mobilization in the US on a scale for which there is no parallel in the case of Iraq .
Mamdani argues that this is due to the fact that Iraq requires Americans to act as citizens , with all the responsibility and complicated political choices it entails , whereas Darfur only requires them to act as humans where they choose to take responsibility out of a sense of philanthropy .
He notes that “ In Darfur , Americans can feel themselves to be what they know they are not in Iraq : powerful saviors . ”
As the Nigerian writer Uzodinma Iweala observed , “ It seems that these days , wracked by guilt at the humanitarian crisis it has created in the Middle East , the West has turned to Africa for redemption . ”
In adopting the language of good and evil , Mamdani observes , the SDC has acted as “ the great depoliticizer ” in precluding political reconciliation in favor of a moral ( read military ) solution .
In Saviors and Survivors , Mamdani emphasizes regional over international solutions .
Western modes of conflict resolution in Africa resemble nothing so much as the International Monetary Fund ’s Structural Adjustment Programs : “ Those who made decisions did not have to live with their consequences , nor pay for them . ”
The Western emphasis on the humanitarian crisis in lieu of a political solution merely prolongs the conflict .
By contrast , the AU ’s approach is both humanitarian and political .
The African Union ’s ( AU ) intervention in Darfur had been largely successful in reducing the violence , yet its operation was undermined by Western powers that failed to deliver the support they had pledged when the AU brokered the N’DJamena ceasefire agreement in April 2004 .
It was also vilified in SDC propaganda .
Mamdani asserts that much of the foot - dragging was to discredit the AU so that the notion of an African solution for an African problem could be discredited .
The aim was to “ blue hat ” the AU forces and bring them under Western command .
In a Washington Post op - ed pointedly titled “ Stop Trying To ‘ Save ’ Africa , ” Iweala asked , “ How is it that a former mid-level US diplomat receives more attention for his cowboy antics in Sudan than do the numerous African Union countries that have sent food and troops and spent countless hours trying to negotiate a settlement among all parties in that crisis ? ”
The recent International Criminal Court case has further entrenched the Khartoum government in its defiant stance .
Criminal prosecutions during an ongoing conflict merely exacerbate matters , Mamdani argues .
More so when the adjudicating body has a demonstrable record of bias .
The model for justice must be the post - Apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission rather than Nuremberg — survivors ’ justice rather than victors ’ justice .
The well - being of surviving multitudes must not be subordinated to the imperative of punishing individual perpetrators .
Mamdani offers a trenchant critique of what he calls the “ New Humanitarian Order , ” which has supplanted traditional colonialism and turned human rights into the new pretext for intervention .
The “ international community ” , which Mamdani argues is nothing more than a “ post - Cold War nom de guerre for the Western powers ” , has created “ a bifurcated system whereby state sovereignty obtains in large parts of the world but is suspended in more and more countries in Africa and the Middle East ” reducing citizens to wards in “ an open - ended international rescue operation ” .
The Obama Administration already appears to be making a break with its predecessor ’s approach and has ordered a review of its Sudan policy .
Scott Gration , the new envoy , has already visited Khartoum and Darfur , as has John Kerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
In the case of the Bush Administration , the SDC was able to mobilize Congress against the State Department that was seeking a political resolution modeled on the power - sharing agreement that ended the longstanding conflict in the south .
It remains to be seen how much the Obama Administration is able to resist the formidable lobbying power of the SDC .
While Mamdani maintains that the aim of the SDC is to induce the US government to intervene militarily in Sudan , it appears that the real interest of its core organizations is to perpetuate the conflict so as to continue using the image of the Arab as the perpetrator to distract from the regional reality of the Arab as the victim .

Standing at the Gates of Economic Hell
I look out of the periscope of the Mogambo Bunker Of Security ( MBOS ) , and when I see my neighbor crying , and I remember that the new estimate of real unemployment is almost 20 % , which comes out to one person unemployed out of every five people who need a job , which they need so that they can pay some bills and maybe have enough left over to have a little fun for a change , like maybe having a few drinks and a few laughs with my barstool buddies , just to get away from the wife and kids for just a few precious hours so that I do n’t Freaking Lose It ( FLI ) .
Then I swing the periscope around and see another neighbor getting yelled at by his wife , who keeps shaking some papers in his face as she is screaming , which makes me think it ’s some kind of a bill , which makes me think of the amount of debt that is being carried today by public and private entities that totals more than 350 % of GDP , a new , all - time record of irresponsible stupidity .
Then I make a final sweep of the perimeter , secure from the “ Battle Stations ” and settle down to await a reply from Xxanthaan , new Supreme Overlord of this sector of the galaxy , who had emailed me to find out what was going on here .
I already told him that the economy is crappy ; nobody has any money with which to buy things because all of their money is being used to service a backbreaking load of debt that was accumulated to fuel the booming bubbles in the stock market , the bond market , the housing market and the growth in the size of government that are all bursting , all thanks to Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve creating so , so , so much money and credit , leading us to here , a place I lovingly call “ The gates of economic hell ! ”
I had previously explained the idea of an afterlife in heaven to him , which is kind of like Arthgenoor , but without the glammglobs or smarmies , to which he said , “ What ?
No glammglobs in their afterlife ?
Then who in the hell would want to go there ?
Hahaha ! ” which showed he already knew about economic hell , as the Laws of Economics are universal , as is the hell that results from violating them .
And it is going to get worse , as Charles Duhigg of the New York Times reports that the problems of the credit card business – made worse by renewed meddling of Congress – are such that they “ are expected to withdraw $ 2.7 trillion of credit by the end of 2010 . ”
Since being recently stung by my own poor research , bad work habits , a faltering memory and a complete lack of concern , I feebly try to make amends by precisely looking at a $ 2.7 trillion contraction in available credit , and then mentally comparing that to the $ 14 trillion in total GDP of the Whole Freaking Country ( WFC ) and saying , with Typical Mogambo Inexactitude ( TMI ) , “ That ’s a lot ! ”
And how much “ a lot ” is , depends on whether this $ 2.7 trillion is unused credit , in which case it will not make any difference , or if this $ 2.7 trillion is to be a reduction in currently outstanding credit , which would be calamitous .
But it could be made worse if the money was used to buy stocks in the S&P 500 index , and I was telling the Emergency Medical Technician that the last thing I remember is that I was eating a piece of pizza that had been warmed up perfectly in the microwave , a Mozart piano concerto was playing on the stereo , and one of the kids was predictably whining , “ Give me back my pizza !
Mom !
Dad stole my pizza ! ” which would normally have prompted a rude response from me had I not , just at that very moment , seen that the earnings of the S&P 500 went down to an astonishing $ 7.21 last week , having lost $ 7.67 from the month before when earnings were $ 14.88 , which is down by half in One Freaking Month ( OFM ) !
And this last batch of Bad News On The Earnings Front ( BNOTEF ) is at the tail end of a long string of lower and lower earnings since the end of 2007 , and this latest drop in earnings is down from January , when earnings were $ 45.95 , which were down from this time last year when earnings of the S&P 500 were $ 62.28 , which is down from September 2007 when the earnings of the S&P500 were over $ 85.00 !
The really eye - popping result is that with the S&P 500 selling at 940 , this means that the index has an astonishing price - to - earnings ratio of 130 !
Hahaha !
Insane !
If you are not laughing in total disbelief , then an instructive way of looking at a P/ E ratio of 130 is that if the company pays you all of the money it earns for the next 130 years , you will break even !
Hahaha !
130 years to break even !
Hahaha !
Now you know why the laughter !
But , then again , maybe gold , silver and oil stocks would be a good idea , since they must rise in price in response to all this new money that is being poured into the economy , and they sell at P/E ratios far less than this !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !

Thanks very much , Barbara Mikulski , for your very eloquent , your eloquent introduction .
Distinguished legislator , great spokeswoman for economic democracy and social justice in this country , I thank you for your eloquent introduction .
Well , things worked out a little different from the way I thought , but let me tell you , I still love New York .
My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans , I have come here tonight not to argue as a candidate but to affirm a cause .
I 'm asking you -- I am asking you to renew the commitment of the Democratic Party to economic justice .
I am asking you to renew our commitment to a fair and lasting prosperity that can put America back to work .
This is the cause that brought me into the campaign and that sustained me for nine months across a 100,000 miles in 40 different states .
We had our losses , but the pain of our defeats is far , far less than the pain of the people that I have met .
We have learned that it is important to take issues seriously , but never to take ourselves too seriously .
The serious issue before us tonight is the cause for which the Democratic Party has stood in its finest hours , the cause that keeps our Party young and makes it , in the second century of its age , the largest political Party in this republic and the longest lasting political Party on this planet .
Our cause has been , since the days of Thomas Jefferson , the cause of the common man and the common woman .
Our commitment has been , since the days of Andrew Jackson , to all those he called " the humble members of society -- the farmers , mechanics , and laborers . "
On this foundation we have defined our values , refined our policies , and refreshed our faith .
Now I take the unusual step of carrying the cause and the commitment of my campaign personally to our national convention .
I speak out of a deep sense of urgency about the anguish and anxiety I have seen across America .
I speak out of a deep belief in the ideals of the Democratic Party , and in the potential of that Party and of a President to make a difference .
And I speak out of a deep trust in our capacity to proceed with boldness and a common vision that will feel and heal the suffering of our time and the divisions of our Party .
The economic plank of this platform on its face concerns only material things , but it is also a moral issue that I raise tonight .
It has taken many forms over many years .
In this campaign and in this country that we seek to lead , the challenge in 1980 is to give our voice and our vote for these fundamental democratic principles .
Let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment , high interest rates , and human misery as false weapons against inflation .
Let us pledge that employment will be the first priority of our economic policy .
Let us pledge that there will be security for all those who are now at work , and let us pledge that there will be jobs for all who are out of work ; and we will not compromise on the issues of jobs .
These are not simplistic pledges .
Simply put , they are the heart of our tradition , and they have been the soul of our Party across the generations .
It is the glory and the greatness of our tradition to speak for those who have no voice , to remember those who are forgotten , to respond to the frustrations and fulfill the aspirations of all Americans seeking a better life in a better land .
We dare not forsake that tradition .
We cannot let the great purposes of the Democratic Party become the bygone passages of history .
We must not permit the Republicans to seize and run on the slogans of prosperity .
We heard the orators at their convention all trying to talk like Democrats .
They proved that even Republican nominees can quote Franklin Roosevelt to their own purpose .
The Grand Old Party thinks it has found a great new trick , but 40 years ago an earlier generation of Republicans attempted the same trick .
And Franklin Roosevelt himself replied , " Most Republican leaders have bitterly fought and blocked the forward surge of average men and women in their pursuit of happiness .
Let us not be deluded that overnight those leaders have suddenly become the friends of average men and women . "
" You know , " he continued , " very few of us are that gullible . "
And four years later when the Republicans tried that trick again , Franklin Roosevelt asked , " Can the Old Guard pass itself off as the New Deal ?
I think not .
We have all seen many marvelous stunts in the circus , but no performing elephant could turn a handspring without falling flat on its back . "
The 1980 Republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress , but it is by their long record and not their recent words that you shall know them .
The same Republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said , and I quote , " Unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders . "
And that nominee is no friend of labor .
The same Republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said , and I quote , " I have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer that the Federal Government not bail out New York . "
And that nominee is no friend of this city and our great urban centers across this nation .
The same Republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago that " Participation in social security should be made voluntary . "
And that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation .
The same Republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the preposterous statement , and I quote , " Eighty percent of our air pollution comes from plants and trees . "
And that nominee is no friend of the environment .
And the same Republicans who are invoking Franklin Roosevelt have nominated a man who said in 1976 , and these are his exact words , " Fascism was really the basis of the New Deal . "
And that nominee whose name is Ronald Reagan has no right to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
The great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past .
Progress is our heritage , not theirs .
What is right for us as Democrats is also the right way for Democrats to win .
The commitment I seek is not to outworn views but to old values that will never wear out .
Programs may sometimes become obsolete , but the ideal of fairness always endures .
Circumstances may change , but the work of compassion must continue .
It is surely correct that we cannot solve problems by throwing money at them , but it is also correct that we dare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference .
The poor may be out of political fashion , but they are not without human needs .
The middle class may be angry , but they have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together .
The demand of our people in 1980 is not for smaller government or bigger government but for better government .
Some say that government is always bad and that spending for basic social programs is the root of our economic evils .
But we reply :
The present inflation and recession cost our economy 200 billion dollars a year .
We reply : Inflation and unemployment are the biggest spenders of all .
The task of leadership in 1980 is not to parade scapegoats or to seek refuge in reaction , but to match our power to the possibilities of progress .
While others talked of free enterprise , it was the Democratic Party that acted and we ended excessive regulation in the airline and trucking industry , and we restored competition to the marketplace .
And I take some satisfaction that this deregulation legislation that I sponsored and passed in the Congress of the United States .
As Democrats we recognize that each generation of Americans has a rendezvous with a different reality .
The answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation .
But there is a guiding star in the American firmament .
It is as old as the revolutionary belief that all people are created equal , and as clear as the contemporary condition of Liberty City and the South Bronx .
Again and again Democratic leaders have followed that star and they have given new meaning to the old values of liberty and justice for all .
We are the Party -- We are the Party of the New Freedom , the New Deal , and the New Frontier .
We have always been the Party of hope .
So this year let us offer new hope , new hope to an America uncertain about the present , but unsurpassed in its potential for the future .
To all those who are idle in the cities and industries of America let us provide new hope for the dignity of useful work .
Democrats have always believed that a basic civil right of all Americans is that their right to earn their own way .
The Party of the people must always be the Party of full employment .
To all those who doubt the future of our economy , let us provide new hope for the reindustrialization of America .
And let our vision reach beyond the next election or the next year to a new generation of prosperity .
If we could rebuild Germany and Japan after World War II , then surely we can reindustrialize our own nation and revive our inner cities in the 1980's .
To all those who work hard for a living wage let us provide new hope that their price of their employment shall not be an unsafe workplace and a death at an earlier age .
To all those who inhabit our land from California to the New York Island , from the Redwood Forest to the Gulf stream waters , let us provide new hope that prosperity shall not be purchased by poisoning the air , the rivers , and the natural resources that are the greatest gift of this continent .
We must insist that our children and our grandchildren shall inherit a land which they can truly call America the beautiful .
To all those who see the worth of their work and their savings taken by inflation , let us offer new hope for a stable economy .
We must meet the pressures of the present by invoking the full power of government to master increasing prices .
In candor , we must say that the Federal budget can be balanced only by policies that bring us to a balanced prosperity of full employment and price restraint .
And to all those overburdened by an unfair tax structure , let us provide new hope for real tax reform .
Instead of shutting down classrooms , let us shut off tax shelters .
Instead of cutting out school lunches , let us cut off tax subsidies for expensive business lunches that are nothing more than food stamps for the rich .
The tax cut of our Republican opponents takes the name of tax reform in vain .
It is a wonderfully Republican idea that would redistribute income in the wrong direction .
It 's good news for any of you with incomes over 200,000 dollars a year .
For the few of you , it offers a pot of gold worth 14,000 dollars .
But the Republican tax cut is bad news for the middle income families .
For the many of you , they plan a pittance of 200 dollars a year , and that is not what the Democratic Party means when we say tax reform .
The vast majority of Americans cannot afford this panacea from a Republican nominee who has denounced the progressive income tax as the invention of Karl Marx .
I am afraid he has confused Karl Marx with Theodore Roosevelt -- that obscure Republican president who sought and fought for a tax system based on ability to pay .
Theodore Roosevelt was not Karl Marx , and the Republican tax scheme is not tax reform .
Finally , we cannot have a fair prosperity in isolation from a fair society .
So I will continue to stand for a national health insurance .
We must --
We must not surrender --
We must not surrender to the relentless medical inflation that can bankrupt almost anyone and that may soon break the budgets of government at every level .
Let us insist on real controls over what doctors and hospitals can charge , and let us resolve that the state of a family 's health shall never depend on the size of a family 's wealth .
The President , the Vice President , the members of Congress have a medical plan that meets their needs in full , and whenever senators and representatives catch a little cold , the Capitol physician will see them immediately , treat them promptly , fill a prescription on the spot .
We do not get a bill even if we ask for it , and when do you think was the last time a member of Congress asked for a bill from the Federal Government ?
And I say again , as I have before , if health insurance is good enough for the President , the Vice President , the Congress of the United States , then it 's good enough for you and every family in America .
There were some --
There were some who said we should be silent about our differences on issues during this convention , but the heritage of the Democratic Party has been a history of democracy .
We fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and purposes .
We did not flee this struggle .
We welcome the contrast with the empty and expedient spectacle last month in Detroit where no nomination was contested , no question was debated , and no one dared to raise any doubt or dissent .
Democrats can be proud that we chose a different course and a different platform .
We can be proud that our Party stands for investment in safe energy , instead of a nuclear future that may threaten the future itself .
We must not permit the neighborhoods of America to be permanently shadowed by the fear of another Three Mile Island .
We can be proud that our Party stands for a fair housing law to unlock the doors of discrimination once and for all .
The American house will be divided against itself so long as there is prejudice against any American buying or renting a home .
And we can be proud that our Party stands plainly and publicly and persistently for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment .
Women hold their rightful place at our convention , and women must have their rightful place in the Constitution of the United States .
On this issue we will not yield ; we will not equivocate ; we will not rationalize , explain , or excuse .
We will stand for E.R.A. and for the recognition at long last that our nation was made up of founding mothers as well as founding fathers .
A fair prosperity and a just society are within our vision and our grasp , and we do not have every answer .
There are questions not yet asked , waiting for us in the recesses of the future .
But of this much we can be certain because it is the lesson of all of our history : Together a President and the people can make a difference .
I have found that faith still alive wherever I have traveled across this land .
So let us reject the counsel of retreat and the call to reaction .
Let us go forward in the knowledge that history only helps those who help themselves .
There will be setbacks and sacrifices in the years ahead ; but I am convinced that we as a people are ready to give something back to our country in return for all it has given to us .
Let this --
Let this be our commitment :
Whatever sacrifices must be made will be shared and shared fairly .
And let this be our confidence :
At the end of our journey and always before us shines that ideal of liberty and justice for all .
In closing , let me say a few words to all those that I have met and to all those who have supported me at this convention and across the country .
There were hard hours on our journey , and often we sailed against the wind .
But always we kept our rudder true , and there were so many of you who stayed the course and shared our hope .
You gave your help ; but even more , you gave your hearts .
And because of you , this has been a happy campaign .
You welcomed Joan , me , and our family into your homes and neighborhoods , your churches , your campuses , your union halls .
And when I think back of all the miles and all the months and all the memories , I think of you .
And I recall the poet 's words , and I say : " What golden friends I had . "
Among you , my golden friends across this land , I have listened and learned .
I have listened to Kenny Dubois , a glassblower in Charleston , West Virginia , who has ten children to support but has lost his job after 35 years , just three years short of qualifying for his pension .
I have listened to the Trachta family who farm in Iowa and who wonder whether they can pass the good life and the good earth on to their children .
I have listened to the grandmother in East Oakland who no longer has a phone to call her grandchildren because she gave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment .
I have listened to young workers out of work , to students without the tuition for college , and to families without the chance to own a home .
I have seen the closed factories and the stalled assembly lines of Anderson , Indiana and South Gate , California , and I have seen too many , far too many idle men and women desperate to work .
I have seen too many , far too many working families desperate to protect the value of their wages from the ravages of inflation .
Yet I have also sensed a yearning for a new hope among the people in every state where I have been .
And I have felt it in their handshakes , I saw it in their faces , and I shall never forget the mothers who carried children to our rallies .
I shall always remember the elderly who have lived in an America of high purpose and who believe that it can all happen again .
Tonight , in their name , I have come here to speak for them .
And for their sake , I ask you to stand with them .
On their behalf I ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of our Party .
I congratulate President Carter on his victory here .
I am -- I am confident that the Democratic Party will reunite on the basis of Democratic principles , and that together we will march towards a Democratic victory in 1980 .
And someday , long after this convention , long after the signs come down and the crowds stop cheering , and the bands stop playing , may it be said of our campaign that we kept the faith .
May it be said of our Party in 1980 that we found our faith again .
And may it be said of us , both in dark passages and in bright days , in the words of Tennyson that my brothers quoted and loved , and that have special meaning for me now : " I am a part of all that I have met
To [ Tho ] much is taken , much abides
That which we are , we are --
One equal temper of heroic hearts
Strong in will
To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield . "
For me , a few hours ago , this campaign came to an end .
For all those whose cares have been our concern , the work goes on , the cause endures , the hope still lives , and the dream shall never die .

It ’s widely acknowledged that it is n’t possible to prove absolutely
that no gods exist , any more than it ’s impossible to prove absolutely
that no invisible unicorns exist .
Every atheist I know freely
acknowledges that .
But at the same time , one can easily argue that
gods ( or invisible unicorns ) are very unlikely to exist .
A lot of these arguments are meta-arguments , in that they do n’t stand
on their own , but build upon arguments made by theists .
Lack of evidence
Despite what a lot of people think , atheism is n’t the firm belief that
there are n’t any gods .
Rather , it ’s a lack of belief in gods .
To put it another way , the atheist position is “ You believers have n’t
made your case .
I ’m not convinced that you ’re right . ”
So the lack of evidence is the big one .
There is no good evidence for
any gods .
No verified miracles , no verified prophecies , no burning
bushes , no nothing .
There ’s a saying that “ absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence ” .
This is true as far as it goes , but absence of evidence
where we would expect to see some is evidence of absence .
If I say that there ’s a Thai restaurant at 15th and K , the fact that
you ’ve never heard of it does n’t mean that I ’m wrong .
If , however , you
go down to 15th and K , and look all over , and fail to find the Thai
restaurant , that is good evidence that I ’m wrong .
Theists have had thousands of years to demonstrate that their various
gods are real .
And they ’ve tried .
Oh , boy , have they tried .
And so
far , bupkis .
No divine abodes on top of Mount Olympus , no rainbow
bridge to Asgard , no Noah ’s Ark , no nothing .
Okay , so maybe gods are n’t directly detectable , either with our senses
or simple measurement devices .
Maybe they do n’t reflect visible light ,
or emit sound waves , or pull compass needles toward them .
That still
leaves indirect evidence .
I ’ve seen satellite photos in which you could n’t see ships , but you
could see their wakes .
A lot of extrasolar planets have been
discovered not by direct observation , but by they affect the orbit of
their sun .
Heck , if it comes to that , all nuclear physics is done
through indirect observation : protons and electrons are too small to
see , but we can observe the shape of trails in a bubble chamber , or
flashes of light on a CRT .
It ’s not just the so - called hard sciences , either : there are
statistical methods for figuring out whether an election was rigged by
looking for anomalies in the results , the sorts of things that would
be introduced by a cheater , but unlikely to come up by chance .
And yet , nothing .
No good direct evidence , no good indirect evidence .
The Templeton Foundation keeps throwing money at trying to come up
with evidence of a god — studies on intercessory prayer , that
sort of thing — and so far they ’ve come up with two kinds of
results : ones that come from flawed experiments , and ones that show no
effect .
I do n’t think it ’s just me being overly skeptical : after 2000 years ,
Christians have still failed to convince two thirds of the world ’s
population that they ’re right .
Jews and Hindus have had even longer .
Miracles of Islam
are not convincing to anyone but Muslims .
And so on , and so forth .
Physical reality of string theory demonstrated
String theory has come under fire in recent years .
Promises have been made that have not been lived up to .
Leiden theoretical physicists have now for the first time used string theory to describe a physical phenomenon .
Their discovery has been reported in Science Express .
' This is superb .
I have never experienced such euphoria . '
Jan Zaanen makes no attempt to hide his enthusiasm .
Together with Mihailo Cubrovic and Koenraad Schalm , he has successfully managed to shed light on a previously unexplained natural phenomeon using the mathematics of string theory .
Hot issue
Electrons can form a special kind of state , a so - called quantum critical state , that plays a role in high - temperature super - conductivity .
Super - conductivity at high temperatures has long been a ' hot issue ' in physics .
In super - conductivity , discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in Leiden , electrons can zoom through a material without meeting any resistance .
In the first instance , this only seemed possible at very low temperatures close to absolute zero , but more and more examples are coming up where it also occurs at higher temperatures .
So far , nobody has managed to explain high temperature super - conductivity .
Zaanen :
' It has always been assumed that once you understand this quantum - critical state , you can also understand high temperature super - conductivity .
But , although the experiments produced a lot of information , we had n't the faintest idea of how to describe this phenomenon . '
String theory now offers a solution .
Theory of everything
This is the first time that a calculation based on string theory has been published in Science , even though the theory is widely known .
' There have always been a lot of expectations surrounding string theory , ' Zaanen explains , having himself studied the theory to satisfy his own curiosity .
' String theory is often seen as a child of Einstein that aims to devise a revolutionary and comprehensive theory , a kind of ' theory of everything ' .
Ten years ago , researchers even said : ' Give us two weeks and we 'll be able to tell you where the big bang came from .
The problem of string theory was that , in spite of its excellent maths , it was never able to make a concrete link with the physical reality - the world around us . '
Quantum soup
But now , Zaanen , together with his colleagues Cubrovic and Schalm , are trying to change this situation , by applying string theory to a phenomenon that physicists , including Zaanen , have for the past fifteen years been unable to explain : the quantum - critical state of electrons .
This special state occurs in a material just before it becomes super - conductive at high temperature .
Zaanen describes the quantum - critical state as a ' quantum soup ' , whereby the electrons form a collective independent of distances , where the electrons exhibit the same behaviour at small quantum mechanical scale or at macroscopic human scale .

Because of Zaanen 's interest in string theory , he and string theoreticist Koenraad Schalm soon became acquainted after Schalm 's arrival in Leiden .
Zaanen had an unsolved problem and Schalm was an expert in the field of string theory .
Their common interest brought them together , and they decided to work jointly on the research .
They used the aspect of string theory known as AdS / CFT correspondence .
This allows situations in a large relativistic world to be translated into a description at minuscule quantum physics level .
This correspondence bridges the gap between these two different worlds .
By applying the correspondence to the situation where a black hole vibrates when an electron falls into it , they arrived at the description of electrons that move in and out of a quantum - critical state .
Puzzle
After days and nights of hard grind , it was a puzzle that fitted .
' We had n't expected it to work so well , ' says a delighted Zaanen .
' The maths was a perfect fit ; it was superb .
When we saw the calculations , at first we could hardly believe it , but it was right . '
Gateway to more
Although the mystery of high temperature super - conductivity is n't fully resolved , the findings do show that major problems in physics can be addressed using string theory .
And this is just the start , Zaanen believes .
' AdS/CFT correspondence now explains things that colleagues who have been beavering away for ages were unable to resolve , in spite of their enormous efforts .
There are a lot of things that can be done with it .
We do n't fully understand it yet , but I see it as a gateway to much more . '
The fact that Science was keen to publish this discovery early confirms this .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Rep. Patrick Murphy , an Iraq war veteran , kicked off a push Wednesday to persuade Americans that the president should repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the policy that prevents openly gay troops from serving in the U.S. military .
Rep. Patrick Murphy , a veteran of the Iraq war , says it is time to end " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
Murphy , D - Pennsylvania , appeared along with several gay , lesbian and straight service members to launch the initiative .
" We can not afford to wait any longer " for the policy 's repeal , Murphy said at the National Press Club in Washington .
" Now is the time to change this , when our military is stretched so thin " with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A " Voices of Honor " tour , sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign , will travel across the country , sharing stories of gay , lesbian and straight servicemen and - women in hopes of garnering support for the Military Readiness Enhancement Act , which would repeal the law that established the policy .
The act would allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the military without concealing their sexuality .
Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said in a statement , " We must repeal this discriminatory policy and ensure that our military can recruit and retain the best and the brightest troops regardless of their sexual orientation . "
President Obama has said he wants Congress to repeal the law , but gay rights groups have been angered that the president has not done more to hasten the change .
Since Obama took office , 287 service members have been discharged for being gay , according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , which supports the repeal .
The bill , introduced by Colin Powell in 1993 and signed into law by President Clinton , ended the protocol requiring service members to state their sexual orientation .
But Powell now says the time has come to review whether the policy is still necessary .
" Sixteen years have now gone by , and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country , and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed , " Powell said .
" I am withholding judgment , because the commanders of the armed forces of the United States and the joint chiefs of staff need to study it and make recommendations to the president and have hearings before the Congress before a decision is made , " he added .
The military 's top uniformed officer , Adm .
Mike Mullen , said Wednesday that it 's clear the president wants the law changed and that he is beginning to work with his staff on how a repeal would be implemented .
But , he advised , with two wars ongoing , that the decision not be hurried .
" When I talk about looking at this in the future , we have a force that 's under extraordinary stress , and it's a force that , you know , should this occur , I think we need to implement in a way that is -- that recognizes the challenges and the stress that we 're under right now , " said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
" But , if it does occur , when it does occur , you know , I 'll certainly lead it and carry it out . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently said he is looking for ways to make the policy " more humane , " including letting people serve who may have been outed because of vengeance or a jilted lover .
But there is plenty of opposition to the repeal .
In the spring , more than 1,000 retired officers signed a letter organized by Flag and General Officers for the Military urging Obama to uphold the law .
" We believe that imposing this burden on our men and women in uniform would undermine recruiting and retention , impact leadership at all levels , have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service , and eventually break the all - volunteer force , " the letter said .
The recent shooting death of a sailor has also raised questions about acceptance of gays among troops .
The family of Seaman August Provost of Houston , Texas , said they believe that he was killed because of his sexual orientation and his race .
But a spokesman for Camp Pendleton , where the shooting took place , said there was no indication early in the investigation that the killing was a hate crime .
Still , Genevieve Chase , a straight veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and the founder of American Women 's Veterans , said she believes that not much would change in the military if " do n't ask , do n't tell " were repealed .
Chase appeared with Murphy at the event Wednesday in Washington .
Calling them service members of a " new era , " Chase said , " Gays have been and are already serving openly .
...
Allowing discrimination and bigotry to continue is what disrupts cohesion . "
There is no clear timeline for when the bill will be debated in Congress .
Obama has said he will sign the repeal if it comes to his desk .

Hey , I 've gotten a complaint from a Vista user about the site freaking out Norton .
Anyone else getting this ?
Also , the response from MatLab masters has been overwhelming !
Thanks to everyone who helped or offered to .
The bug I was having yesterday has been eliminated , but no doubt I will fail many more times in the future .

It 's kick ass except that it looks too much like Hobbes to me from Calvin and Hobbes .
I 'd love it more if it looked like a more original tiger .
Are people really this clueless about the joke on this tee ?
Nice work , the hobbes doll is so wonderfully rendered .

It 's a great illustration .
I 'm always on the fence about Calvin and hobbes stuff , because Watterston himself was so against merchandising his creation .
The shirt sums up how a lot of people feel about Calvin and Hobbes , I believe !

Hey , a 2.8 is my best score yet , so I 'll take it .
Among other things , the update for Mac OS X 10.5.8 also fixed an interesting kernel bug related to the way the fcntl call is handled .
The bug was identified as CVE - 2009 - 1235 and the first exploit seems to be from June 2008 .
The variant that I discovered is much simpler and is , as far as I know , the one that really convinced Apple to solve the issue . :-)
The oldest kernel I was able to test the problem was Darwin 8.0.1 which corresponds to Mac OS X 10.4 “ Tiger ” .
The Tiger was announce in June 28 , 2004 but was released to the public on April 29 , 2005 and it was advertised as containing more than 200 new features .
The bug was closed on August 5 , 2009 so the number of days the vulnerability was alive was 1599 days ( 4 years and 3 months ) .
Here is a way to trigger a kernel panic using Python :
import termios , fcntl fcntl.fcntl(0 , termios .
TIOCGWINSZ )
The first paramter to fcntl. fcntl indicates a file descriptor and any open one ( 0 to 4 in Python ) will work .
The C variant is also very simple ( it even fits in a tweet ! ) :
#include < fcntl.h > # include < sys/ioctl.h > int main ( ) { fcntl( 0 , TIOCGWINSZ , 0 ) ; return 0 ; }
As expected , this code will also generate a kernel panic when the first parameter for fcntl is 1 ( stdout ) or 2 ( stderr ) .
Let ’s now take a better look at what really happens .
First , here is the correct version of the program :
#include < stdio.h > # include < sys/ioctl.h > int main ( ) { unsigned short buff [ 4 ] ; ioctl( 0 , TIOCGWINSZ , & buff ) ; printf ( " %d %d %d %d
" , buff [ 0 ] , buff [ 1 ] , buff [ 2 ] , buff [ 3 ] ) ; return 0 ; }
What the code does is obtaining the windows size .
TIOCGWINSZ and other terminal related ioctl are fully explained in tty ( 4 ) .
The output of the above program is the following :
24 80 484 316
The first two numbers are the height and length of the window in characters and the second is the same in pixels .
The first parameter for ioctl is also a file descriptor and the above output is also obtained for 1 ( stdout ) and 2 ( stderr ) .
The size in pixels depends on the terminal program ( in mrxvt 0.4.1 the two numbers are always zero ) .
Comparing the two programs it ’s obvious that the buggy one is erroneously using fcntl instead of ioctl .
As incredible as might sound , I managed to do this by mistake . :P
This should ( obviously ) not generate a kernel panic .
The good news is that debugging a Darwin kernel is quite easy because Apple is providing Kernel Debug Kits which contains the debug symbols for all the shipped kernels together with some handy gdb macros .
The fact that debug takes places over Ethernet is another useful thing .
Investigating the call traces of the good and buggy program are like this :
( buggy ) unix_syscall --> fcntl_nocancel
------------------->
VNOP_IOCTL --> cptyioctl --> ttioctl ( non-buggy ) unix_syscall --> ioctl --> fo_ioctl --> vn_ioctl --> VNOP_IOCTL --> cptyioctl --> ttioctl
So both calls end up in the same place but taking slightly different paths .
The end point in / bsd / kern / tty.c is the following :
963 case TIOCGWINSZ : /* get window size */ 964 *( struct winsize *) data = tp-> t_winsize ; 965 break ;
The problem is the data in the buggy case is whatever we give as a third parameter in the fcntl code .
Considering that the 8 bytes are controlled by the user it means he can write that amount of information anywhere in the kernel memory !
Pretty scary right ? :-)
A way to really show this is to overwrite some memory that is not used and the examine the region to see if it contains the right thing .
Below is an example that is using iso_font for this .
Here are the steps ( ten is the name of the target machine and it ’s a G4 running 10.4.7 ) :
( gdb ) attach ten Connected .
( gdb ) print &iso_font $ 1 = ( unsigned char ( *) [ 4096 ] ) 0x433268
So iso_font is located at 0x433268 .
( gdb ) x/4hx iso_font 0x433268 < iso_font > : 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000
And as expected , the first 8 bytes are zero .
( gdb ) c Continuing .
Next I run the buggy code with the 0x433268 as the third parameter .
The program was this :
#include < fcntl.h > # include < sys/ioctl.h > int main ( ) { fcntl( 0 , TIOCGWINSZ , 0x433268 ) ; return 0 ; }
When I run this the system did n’t crash .
What I did next was to crash it ( using 0xdeadbeaf as the third parameter for the fcntl call ) in order to be able to take another look at iso_font .
Here is what I saw :
Program received signal SIGTRAP , Trace / breakpoint trap .
0x002bdd44 in ttioctl ( tp=0x2292a04 , cmd=1074295912 , data=0xdeadbeaf < Address 0xdeadbeaf out of bounds > , flag=0 , p=0x21b7b18 ) at / SourceCache / xnu/xnu-1228.12.14/bsd/kern/tty.c:964 warning : Source file is more recent than executable .
964 *( struct winsize *) data = tp-> t_winsize ; ( gdb ) x/4hx iso_font 0x433268 < iso_font > : 0x0018 0x0050 0x01e4 0x013c ( gdb ) print tp -> t_winsize $ 2 = { ws_row = 24 , ws_col = 80 , ws_xpixel = 484 , ws_ypixel = 316 }
So the iso_font was indeed changed in the expected way . :-)
To make this disclosure full : I discovered the kernel panic in August 2008 .
I wrote to Apple but the only reply I got was indicating that they are investigating the problem .
In July 2009 I finally spent some time and debug the problem .
After I found that it could be used to write arbitrary data in memory I wrote again to Apple .
This time they wrote back asking me if I want to be credited in the Security Update .
They kept their promise . :-)
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Sunday the Obama administration 's demand that Israel halt the planning of a Jewish housing project in a predominantly Arab East Jerusalem neighborhood .
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu consults with an advisor regarding the controversial construction project .
" Our sovereignty over [ Jerusalem ] cannot be challenged .
This means that residents of Jerusalem may purchase apartments in all parts of the city , " Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting .
" We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and purchase in all parts of Jerusalem . "
In a meeting last Thursday with Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren , U.S. State Department officials had demanded the project be stopped , Israeli officials said .
The project is being developed by American millionaire Irving Moskowitz on land that he purchased in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood .
Moskowitz , an avid supporter of Jewish building in East Jerusalem , purchased the land in 1985 .
The neighborhood , near Jerusalem 's Old City , is highly desired by Jewish nationalists .
The land for the project includes the Shepherd Hotel , built in the 1930s for a leader of the Arab Palestinian movement .
The property is abandoned .
The municipality of Jerusalem issued a statement Sunday saying that the acquisition of the Sheikh Jarrah property was legal and necessary renovation and construction permits were issued .
Netanyahu 's statements could add to U.S. - Israeli tensions over the issue of Jewish settlements and housing in Palestinian areas .
Asked about his remarks , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment Sunday on ongoing negotiations .
But Clinton , on a visit to India , emphasized the matter is a high priority for President Barack Obama 's administration .
In a major speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo last month , President Barack Obama said Middle East peace hinged on both Palestinian progress in governance , security and financial sector reforms and Israel lifting restrictions on Palestinian movement and implementing " an immediate and comprehensive settlement freeze . "
The conservative Israeli leader , however , remained steadfast .
" I can only describe to myself what would happen if someone would propose that Jews could not live in certain neighborhoods in New York , London , Paris or Rome , " Netanyahu said .
" There would certainly be a major international outcry .
Accordingly , we cannot agree to such a decree in Jerusalem . "
CNN 's Shira Medding contributed to this report .

Update : When Herta reported to the authorities on August 19 she was told she can remain in the country until November 9 .
She says there was a 9 - inch stack of letters from supporters that her attorney has asked be added to her file .
The campaign continues .
Herta Llusho is a 19 - year old student at risk of being deported from the United States to Albania on Wednesday , August 19 .
Bloggers at DreamActivist.org and other immigrant rights blogs are calling on Americans to help delay her deportation until new legislation is enacted that would enable her to stay .
And they have listed numerous ways for people to help , including : calling senators and congress members , joining groups and organizations or by simply blogging about her story .
Herta's Story
Herta is a freshman at the University of Detroit Mercy , majoring in electrical engineering .
Eight years ago , as a child , Herta arrived in the United States from Albania with her mother , in pursuit of the ‘ American dream ’ .
She graduated middle school and high school with good grades .
By definition , Herta is an “ undocumented immigrant ” but her family have been trying to obtain legal status for her since her first year in the U.S. On August 19 , their hopes for her future may be shattered .
This is when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) plan to return her to Albania .
In an email sent to Dreamactivist.org subscribers , Hersha writes :
“ Despite our best efforts , on August 19 , I will be removed by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) from the only place I know as my home .
I will be sent back to a country that has become a foreign place to me .
I do n't even speak Albanian well anymore . ”
Herta ’s father stayed in Albania , while her mother and siblings ventured across the Atlantic Ocean .
“ My parents brought me to the United States because they believed in the promises this country had to offer .
To them it was the land of opportunities , values , and ideals .
They were faithful believers of the American Dream , meaning that through hard work , education , and good character their children could accomplish anything they wanted . ”
In this video made with Kyle de Beausset from Citizen Orange , Herta explains what she is going through .
Blogging for Llusho
Several bloggers have written about Herta and encouraged their readers to fight for her cause , including American Humanity , B - Listed , Documenting Me , Nuestra Voice and Standing FIRM .
Change.org is hosting an online petition to help Herta , and the SEIU ( Service Employees International Union ) is facilitating phone calls to senators on their website .
On Facebook Herta 's cause has attracted more than 2000 supporters .
Kyle from , Citizen Orange wrote about meeting with Herta and her older brother Lirjon , who has a student visa .
“ Lirjon and Herta are incredible people .
Herta is especially lucky to have a brother like Lirjon who has been tirelessly advocating for her .
Even in the short time that Lirjon and Herta introduced themselves to my family , they had a huge impact .
It was a special moment for me , too .
My family is used to seeing me type away at a computer .
This was the first time they got to meet the real people whose lives I 'm affecting .
He continues :
“ Herta would probably not want me to describe it this way , but the U.S. has spit in her face and she has responded only with love .
That deep , true , and endearing love in the face of injustice , when acted upon even by one person , does more for the betterment of the universe than millions of angry demonstraters will ever do .
By fighting to stay in the U.S. , Herta is participating in what Gandhi would call “ satyagraha ” , which the Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. often translated into “ truth - force ” or “ love - force . ”
Those who support Herta are participating in satyagraha , too . ”
“ I continue to believe … ”
With the support of DreamActivist , Citizen Orange , and many others – Herta has shared her story with the world .
Their hope is that a proposed bill called The DREAM
Act will be passed soon .
It would allow undocumented students , like Herta , to become legal residents depending on certain prerequisites , like age of arrival and years of study .
Although federal lawmakers first rejected the bill in 2007 , it was re-introduced with some changes in March 2009 and supporters hope that it could gain enough support to be passed with President Barack Obama in office .
Should it pass , it is estimated that around 65,000 undocumented students who entered the U.S. as children would be permitted to stay .
Herta hopes that her life may take the same turn as another 18 - year old undocumented immigrant and student , Taha in New Jersey .
Taha , would have been sent back to his ancestral home of Bangladesh – however , after support from two senators and other Americans – Homeland Security deferred his deportation .
Now , Herta is asking for the same .
Do Tax Cuts Starve the Beast : The Effect of Tax Changes on Government Spending
NBER Working Paper No. 13548
Issued in October 2007
NBER Program(s ) : Development of the American Economy , Economic Fluctuations and Growth , Monetary Economics , Public Economics
The hypothesis that decreases in taxes reduce future government spending is often cited as a reason for cutting taxes .
However , because taxes change for many reasons , examinations of the relationship between overall measures of taxation and subsequent spending are plagued by problems of reverse causation and omitted variable bias .
To deal with these problems , this paper examines the behavior of government expenditures following legislated tax changes that narrative sources suggest are largely uncorrelated with other factors affecting spending .
The results provide no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending ; indeed , they suggest that tax cuts may actually increase spending .
The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases .
Examination of four episodes of major tax cuts reinforces these conclusions .

America ’s Contaminated Food Supply
Spread the love
The truth about America ’s contaminated food supply is not told to the American public .
You see , the vast majority of Americans simply do not realize that the FDA expressly allows rat excrement , maggots and insect heads to be put into their food .
Seriously .
After learning the truth about America ’s food supply , you will want to eat organic food forever .
The reality is that the FDA explicitly allows large levels of the most disgusting contaminants in the food that we buy in the supermarket every day .
If you do n’t believe us , perhaps you will believe the FDA .
You see , the FDA has actually published a pamphlet entitled “ The Food Defect Action Levels : Levels of Natural or Unavoidable Defects in Foods That Present No Health Hazards for Humans ” that instructs our food producers on exactly how many “ natural contaminants ” are allowed in our food .
The list below are just a few examples from the pamphlet of the allowable levels of “ natural contaminants ” that the FDA allows to be put into our food …..
Canned Citrus Juices ( such as orange juice ) – 5 or more Drosophila and other fly eggs per 250 ml or 1 or more maggots per 250 ml
Cornmeal – Average of 25 or more insect fragments per 25 grams
Cranberry Sauce – Average mold count of 15 %
Fig Paste – 13 insect heads per 100 grams of fig paste
Macaroni And Noodle Products – Average of 225 insect fragments per 225 grams
Mushrooms – Average of over 20 or more maggots of any size per 100 grams of drained mushrooms
Crushed Oregano – Average of 300 insect fragments per 10 grams
Peanut Butter – Average of 30 insect fragments per 100 grams
Spinach – Average of 50 aphids , thrips and / or mites per 100 grams
Tomato Paste , Pizza And Other Sauces – Average of 30 fly eggs per 100 grams OR 15 or more fly eggs and 1 or more maggots per 100 grams
Wheat – Average of 9 mg or more rodent excreta pellets and / or pellet fragments per kilogram
Are you starting to get the picture ?
We do n’t know about you , but we do not want ANY insect heads in our fig paste .
But , oh boy , if there is a 14th insect head in 100 grams of fig paste THEN the food producers get into big trouble .
The truth is that the food that you eat every day , unless it is organically grown or you get it from your own garden , is full of insect parts , mites , maggots , fly eggs and rodent crap .
No wonder so many Americans are getting sick from their food .
No wonder the organic health movement in America is gaining so much steam .
Even the ingredients in the American food supply that are supposedly “ safe ” have been found to be quite the opposite .
Remember all those sappy commercials recently that told us how safe and wonderful high fructose corn syrup is ?
Well , it turns out that those commercials were complete fraud .
In one stunning new study , almost half of the tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup contained significant levels of mercury .
In addition , the same study found mercury in almost a third of 55 popular brand name food and beverage products where high fructose corn syrup is the first or second listed ingredient .
If you are not familiar with high fructose corn syrup , you should be .
It is in thousands of our food and beverage products .
Go into your refrigerator and look at how many products contain high fructose corn syrup .
And the truth is that high fructose corn syrup is chock full of mercury .
You see , mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal .
Among other things , mercury can cause serious brain damage , deafness and blindness .
It is incredibly harmful for humans .
And yet it tastes so good !
And who cares if there are insect fragments in our peanut butter ?
After all , it tastes so great on a piece of toast !
Once you know the truth , the inescapable conclusion is that America ’s food supply is contaminated .
The day is quickly coming when if you have not grown something yourself , you are not going to be quite sure if you want to eat it .
But many Americans are starting to demand better .
Many Americans are starting to see the wisdom of organic health principles .
Many Americans are getting sick and tired of the garbage that the food industry continually tries to shove down our throats .
If you know of other great articles about America ’s contaminated food supply , please let us know in the comments section below .
Also , please help us get the word out about these issues , because in order for positive change to occur , the American people need to be informed .
Fighting began around the stadium almost two hours before kick - off A man has been stabbed in the chest during " large - scale trouble " involving hundreds of fans at West Ham 's Carling Cup match against Millwall .
Fights broke out at 1800 BST and were still raging five hours later .
A 44 - year - old man is stable after being stabbed in Priory Road at 2025 BST .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said missiles had been thrown at officers but none were injured .
Inside Upton Park stadium West Ham fans invaded the pitch three times .
By 2300 BST several hundred West Ham fans had congregated outside the stadium chanting and bombarding police with crates and bottles .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The first pitch invasion was after West Ham 's equaliser , while the second more serious invasion happened after they scored a penalty .
It took officials about six minutes to clear about 50 people from the pitch and police had to redeploy within the stadium to tackle the invasion .
West Ham won the game 3 - 1 after extra time , upon which there was a third invasion by hundreds of fans .
About 200 riot police and at least 20 mounted officers were at the ground and a police helicopter circled the area .
The Press Association quoted an unnamed 19 - year - old saying he saw a police officer being kicked on the ground .
The police spokesman said : " There is large - scale trouble involving hundreds of fans which we are dealing with at the moment .
About 50 fans invaded the pitch after West Ham equalised " Officers are now containing it but there is still disorder .
Hundreds of fans are estimated to be involved . "
One pub reportedly had its windows broken by bricks during running battles across several streets up to half a mile from the stadium .
Eyewitnesses told of hooligans trying to rip out bollards and lighting " small fires " .
Five arrests have been confirmed , including one for affray and one for breaching a banning order .
BBC radio reporter Ben Jacobs , who was at the stadium , said : " The trouble broke out outside the Tube station about 600 yards from the ground .
" There were [ hundreds of ] riot police and Millwall fans managed to break through the divide . "
' Really intimidating '
Tony , a steward at the game , told BBC Radio 5 live they were powerless to stop the violence .
He said : " When you have 2,900 Millwall fans it is really intimidating .
" There is not a lot you can do - you have to hope the police presence can help you out . "
There were loads of people with bloodied faces
Local shop owner A 29 - year - old man had to close his kebab shop in nearby Green Street for two hours .
He said : " All hell broke loose - it was very frightening .
" Bottles and bricks were being thrown from the back and some were hitting West Ham fans at the front .
" There were loads of people with bloodied faces . "
Aaron Smith , from Hemel Hempstead , who was at the game , said : " I saw one man cornered by at least a dozen Millwall fans before kick - off .
Terrifying scenes . "
And a Millwall fan told the BBC : " It was like a war zone outside the stadium .
There was fighting all round .
" I brought my kids with me tonight and they 've seen some violence that is indescribable . "
A Football Association spokesman said : " We absolutely condemn the disorder .
" We expect all culprits to be banned from football for life - they have no place in our game . "

PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia City Council is going to look at whether it should ban smokeless tobacco .
It 's been three years since the city banned smoking .
City councilman Jim Kenney now is proposing an outright ban in Philadelphia on all smokeless tobaccos , including snuff , chewing tobacco and dipping tobacco .
Kenney cites the popularity of baseball and other sports in which players use smokeless tobacco .
He says " kids are putting this stuff in their cheeks " and creating many of the same health problems with their gums and teeth that occur from smoking cigarettes .
Kenney 's plan would ban all smokeless tobacco sales , not just sales to minors , because he says the industry has spent its time targeting those products at teens .

A mini “ nuclear reactor ” constructed by two six - year - old boys in the town of Oelde in western Germany led German police to evacuate a street .
The nuclear reactor was actually a computer case with a radioactivity warning sign taped to its side .
The boys left their reactor for a short time , but when they returned they were sent away by police .
Police explained in a public statement :
When the boys returned to their ‘ nuclear power plant ’ from a brief stop at home they were sent away again as the area and a wide radius around it had been cleared and blocked off .
The boys ’ parents were unaware of what was happening when residents were ordered to remain indoors as firefighters tested for radiation .
It was only when they learned about the operation online that they realized that their boys had been the cause and reported what had happened to the local police station .

Julia wields a mallet on The French Chef , circa 1970 .
Right , Dan Aykroyd as Julia in the Saturday Night Live skit , 1978 .
From Everett Collection ; by Owen Franken / Corbis .
The French Chef officially premiered on February 11 , 1963 , and ran through 1973 ( Julia did many other television shows , and won three Emmys ) .
As the show caught on , a whole cult of Julia stories sprang up .
That dropped potato cake soon became , in the retelling , a dropped chicken , a roast , a whole salmon on the floor , which she picked up while saying ( not ) , “ Your guests will never know . ”
And because Julia used wine in her cooking and toasted viewers at the show ’s end , people thought she was drunk on - camera , not knowing her glass of wine was really Gravy Master mixed with water .
In 1978 , Saturday Night Live presented a Grand Guignol spoof of The French Chef , co-written by Al Franken and starring Dan Aykroyd as Julia , who slices off her thumb while making poularde demi-désossée , bleeds copiously , and then passes out crying , “ Save the liver . ”
The skit is still aired today and still funny , a testament to Julia ’s continuing stature in the culture .
( She herself loved the skit , and kept a videotape of it under the television in her kitchen . )
In the 10 years that The French Chef aired , Julia ’s subtext was not out of sync with the era ’s counterculture or its overt message of psychosexual liberation .
Julia wanted her viewers to loosen up , get physical , not with controlled substances but with food , not through a glass darkly but at table , with delight .
Hers was a civilized sensuality , the integration of the senses that she ’d learned in France .
This is why her following was legion — Julia ’s appetite appealed to young and old alike .
“ Americans did n’t come over on the Mayflower trusting food , ” says Laura Shapiro .
“ Julia ’s whole thing about food was that you had to trust it .
That , to me , is her great message .
Getting your hands into it — touch it , breathe it , smell it , live it .
If we as Americans have overcome to any degree our fear of food , our weird neurotic thing about the body , it starts with Julia . ”
“ I felt very related to her , ” says Judith Jones , “ because we were both released from very traditional , middle - class American values .
And it was France that released us .
She wanted to bring this message to America — that we were still steeped in the Puritan attitude towards food , and what the food industry had done to make us feel that food was not for the modern woman .
It ’s what an artist does : you want to express it so that you awaken sensibility .
And she really did that . ”
“ Her favorite point in her life was the years in France , that period of discovery and awakening , ” says Alex Prud’homme .
“ As she said , ‘ I felt myself opening like a flower . ’
It was a lovely phrase .
And I think one of the reasons that — this is my personal theory — she wanted to write all these recipes down and transmit them to Americans is it was a form of distilling experience , almost like a short story or a poem .
She used the recipe as a way of talking about France and its values , which are so different from ours .
You know , doing things correctly and taking the time to get it right , and to work hard and learn your technique , and also to have fun . ”
Paul Child died at the age of 92 , in 1994 .
Ten years later , in 2004 , Julia Child died two days short of her 92nd birthday .
In the last year of her life she suffered knee surgeries , kidney failure , and a stroke .
On August 12 , when her doctor called to say she had an infection and would need to be hospitalized , she chose not to be treated .
The meal that turned out to be her last , before she went to sleep and never woke up , was * Mastering ’ *s recipe for French onion soup .
“ Her birthday was August 15 , ” says Alex Prud’homme .
“ And we had people from all over the country and around the world coming for this big party in Santa Barbara for her 92nd birthday , and she died two days beforehand .
And I ’ve always wondered , Did she do that on purpose ?
We ’ll never know .
But it would be a very typical Julia move , knowing that all her favorite people were coming from all over , and would n’t this be a nice moment for her to , as she would say , ‘ slip off the raft . ’ ”
Did they still come ?
“ Everybody came .
And it turned into a sort of three - day Irish wake , everybody telling stories and laughing and crying and eating and drinking .
I think she felt very lucky to live the life she did .
I think she loved it . ”

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Sears
Tower is history .
As of Thursday , the iconic Chicago , Illinois , skyscraper is now named Willis Tower .
It still looks the same , but Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , will have a new name : Willis Tower .
more photos »
At least that 's what the owners of the 110 - story skyscraper now call it after its new main tenant , the London , England - based insurance broker Willis Group Holdings .
However , there are plenty of people who refuse to call it that .
More than 90,000 people have joined the group " People Against the Sears Tower Name Change , " on the social networking Web site Facebook .
" This name change is absurd , " one member wrote .
" Would Paris change the name of the Eiffel Tower ?
Or London change Buckingham Palace ?
Or New York , the Statue of Liberty ?
I believe the Illinois Congress needs to proclaim the Sears Tower a recognizable landmark that is known all over the world by people who have traveled to Chicago . "
The group has gathered more than 34,000 signatures on an online petition against the name change .
The name change seemed to be a fait accompli , though .
A renaming ceremony was scheduled for Thursday with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley .
The skyscraper 's
Web site also features the new name .
Watch sky - high perspective of tower »
" Having our name associated with Chicago 's most iconic structure underscores our commitment to this great city , and recognizes Chicago 's importance as a major financial hub and international business center , " Willis CEO and Chairman Joseph J. Plumeri said in a news release .
The landmark opened in 1973 with its original occupant , Sears Roebuck & Co .
The retailing giant has since moved its headquarters to suburban Chicago .
That does n't matter to those against the name change .
" I asked a cabdriver to take me to the Willis tower .
He said , ' Where the hell is that ? ' " a member of the Facebook group wrote .
" That pretty much sums it up .
No one will start calling it the Willis Tower . "

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : epoll bindings 0.1.1
Hi , I am pleased to announce the release of epoll bindings 0.1.1 available from : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/epoll
Epoll is an I/O event notification facility for Linux similar to poll but with good scaling characteristics .
Currently the bindings are fairly low level and close to the C API .
In the future I hope to add some buffer or stream abstraction on top .
Eventually , when GHC can make use of epoll / kqueue etc. in addition to select , this library will not be needed anymore .
Until then it might be useful for applications which monitor large numbers of file descriptors .

NASHVILLE , Tenn . --
Last summer , police responding to complaints about campfires under a highway overpass found dozens of homeless people living on public land along the Cumberland River .
Eviction notices went up -- and then were suspended by Nashville Mayor Karl Dean , a Democrat , who said housing for the homeless should be found first .

Ammonia and organic compounds in icy plumes on one of Saturn 's moons provide strong evidence for the existence of liquid water beneath the surface
The idea that liquid water exists below the surface of one of Saturn ’s moons has been given a boost thanks to researchers in the US and China who have detected ammonia , various organic compounds , and possibly argon in plumes of gas and ice particles that spew out of the moon ’s south pole .
The work should help scientists further understand the formation of this and other planetary bodies and keeps hope alive that Enceladus , Saturn ’s sixth largest moon , might have the necessary components to support extraterrestrial life .
When plumes of ice water were first observed erupting from Enceladus by NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft in 2005 , scientists immediately began to wonder if they were being propelled by liquid water present in the moon ’s interior .
Now , Jack Hunter Waite Jr and colleagues from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , US , and a number of other institutions in the US and Taiwan have added to mounting evidence in support of this theory by analysing INMS ( ion neutral mass spectrometer ) data on the plumes ’ gas constituents obtained from a recent Cassini flyby .
’ Our evidence [ for liquid water ] comes from the detection of ammonia which acts as an antifreeze and can lower the melting point of water ice , ’ explains Jonathan Lunine , one of the paper ’s co-authors and a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson , US .
Moreover , the team believe their analysis points to an abundance of an isotope of argon ( 40 Ar ) in the plumes .
The most plausible explanation for its presence , they say , is that a fluid must be leaching either the 40 Ar or its parent potassium out of the rock deep inside Enceladus ’ interior .
’ Ice does n’t do that so it really should be liquid , ’ adds Lunine .
Growing support
Last month , German scientists , led by Frank Postberg from the University of Heidelberg , put forward strong evidence for subsurface liquid water by publishing their discovery of sodium salts in Saturn ’s outer - most ring which is thought to originate from Enceladus ’ plume material .
’ The two studies are complimentary and now , for the first time , we are getting an idea of the full picture of what ’s happening on Enceladus , ’ says Postberg .
Also excited about the new findings is Dave Stegman from the University of Melbourne in Australia , who has previously hypothesised the presence of ammonia and liquid water on Enceladus based on dynamic modelling work .
’ Certainly , the discovery of ammonia will help influence what scientists consider to be a viable model for Enceladus , ’ he says .
The latest study is also important for its discovery of diverse organic molecules detected in the plumes .
’ Their presence indicates that chemistry is going on in the interior , ’ says Lunine .
What ’s more , finding these organic molecules adds to the possibility that Enceladus may have the right conditions for life to exist .
’ This work helps build the case that the components for life are there - heat , liquid , some organic compounds , and chemical gradients , ’ adds Stegman .

TEWKSBURY — A longtime town employee and her son , a newly appointed Tewksbury police officer and former School Committee member , have both resigned after irregularities were uncovered in the town ’s health - insurance program .
Melanie Sitar , a decade - long worker in the Administrative Services Department , left two weeks ago , after reimbursing the town $ 1,850 .
Michael Sitar III this week tendered his resignation from the Tewksbury police force , which he had joined last year .
The town is now poised to conduct an audit “ on dependents who were added to the town ’s health - insurance policy or switched to COBRA coverage ” between January 2007 and the middle of last month , according to a statement released to The Sun yesterday .
The case was also to be referred yesterday to the office of Middlesex District Attorney Gerard Leone , who would have the power to levy criminal charges .
The statement , which was released by Town Manager David Cressman , said that the town was first informed by Blue Cross / Blue Shield of “ possible irregularities to its health - insurance program enrollment ” on July 15 .
Cressman declined yesterday to give more details about the alleged irregularities .
Melanie Sitar , 50 , handed in her resignation and the reimbursement on July 16 .
After further investigation by Cressman and Police Chief Alfred Donovan , the town launched discharge proceedings against her this week .
She was officially terminated yesterday .
The Chandler Street resident was one of two employees in the Administrative Services Department .
She handled employee benefits , occupational - injury compensation , medical - costs analysis , COBRA coverage , family medical leave and Medicare Part D , according to the town report .
COBRA is a federal law that allows workers who lose their jobs to temporarily keep their health - insurance coverage , though usually at a higher cost .
Sitar had run unsuccessfully for the Tewksbury School Committee in 2004 , when she was defeated by Keith Rauseo .
Her son joined the committee in 2006 after an uncontested race .
The 24 - year - old did not run for re-election this year , saying that his new job as a Tewksbury police officer was infringing on his committee work .
He also cited his upcoming wedding , which would have interfered with meetings at the height of the budget season .
Sitar and his fiancee were thinking about temporarily moving out of town , he had said at the time , because they had found it challenging to find a home they could afford in Tewksbury
He turned in his resignation from the police force on Wednesday .
The mother and son are not the only members of the Sitar family who work for Tewksbury ’s town government .
Michael Sitar Jr. , Melanie ’s husband and Michael ’s father , is a captain in the Fire Department and serves as Tewksbury ’s emergency management director .
His brother , Daniel Sitar , is also a Tewksbury firefighter .

The World is Your Swap Meet
It ’s not very often that I give a Republican — let alone a self - described “ libertarian ” Republican , which I consider a contradiction in terms — credit for a great idea , but Eric Dondero nails it with his recommendation that the best way to move back toward a real market in health care is to revert to “ cash and carry ” and even more so to barter .
Not just versus “ ObamaCare ” and other overtly state - powered programs , but also versus the existing hodge - podge of “ managed care ” schemes which primarily serve to funnel health care dollars into the bank accounts of state - privileged middle men .
And for that matter , not just in the health care arena , but for virtually any good or service imaginable .
Shattering the state ’s monopoly on money is a big part of the anarchist project .
A lot of schemes for competing currencies — mutual currencies , commodity - backed currencies , you name it — are already in play in both theory and practice .
But there ’s a lot to be said , at this particular point in time , for plain old barter .
Here ’s why :
Almost every currency / money idea requires some sort of centralized system , making it vulnerable , to one degree or another , to a jealous government .
If the currency is digital , then offshore servers and encryption can provide some degree of security , but that security is usually not total and the schemes can quickly get more complicated than most people are willing to put up with .
Even a straight commodity currency — coins minted from precious metal and valued according to the quality / quantity of that metal — will generally need to be minted by a widely trusted organization before they can themselves become widely trusted instruments of commerce .
As we ’ve seen with e-gold and Liberty Dollars , the state moves quickly to crush such efforts , and it can do so effectively because of the centralization they require .
Barter , on the other hand , is a one - on - one of goods in which any two parties who trust each other can get the job done .
A state bust of one barter transaction , or even of one exchange for such transactions , is n’t going to impact the overall viability of doing things that way .
And in this day and age , it ’s more efficient than it used to be , in two important ways .
First , it ’s more efficient relative to “ government money ” than it used to be .
At the time of the American Revolution , the real tax rate appears to have been in the low single digits .
These days , between up - front taxation , inflation and costs of regulatory compliance , it ’s somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 % .
In other words , using money instead of making a direct ( and presumably unmonitored , unreported and untaxed ) exchange of good / service for good service means accepting a 50 % discount on value .
In order to purchase $ 500 “ worth ” of something , one must first earn $ 1,000 and give the state its baksheesh .
But one can trade $ 500 “ worth ” of something for $ 500 “ worth ” of something else at full value .
Secondly , the main inherent inefficiency in barter — the problem of finding someone who wants what you have and has what you want — has been greatly reduced by the information revolution .
In 1709 , someone who wanted to trade two goats and a sack of turnips for a ground lens to build a telescope with was going to have to do a lot of walking around to find an optics guy who needed two goats and a sack of turnips , if he was there to be found at all .
It was easier to take his goats and turnip to market , sell them for shillings , and use the shillings to buy the lens .
In 2009 , the equivalent of that trade — a few cases of homebrew ale for a used PC , for example — can be posted on Craigslist , and the parties will likely find find each other , or at least find other people to barter with until they get “ where they want to go ” through a series of such exchanges .
Presumably there ’s a point at which the effect of the rising real tax rate and the effect of the falling inconvenience of finding barter partners cross each other on a graph of “ exchange efficiency . ”
“ Building the new society in the shell of the old ” may very well involve re-inserting some of the old society ’s ways into the new .
Imagine this .

Many people want to start a healthy diet , but the constant pressure of time prevents them from taking specific actions and breaking their unhealthy eating habits .
Where to start ?
What products should be included in the daily menu , in order to eat healthily and at the same time choose them consciously ?
For a start , it ’s important to make a gradual change in nutrition so that the body gets the chance to get used to it .
To start with , it is a good habit to change the amount of food you eat : change them to five modest meals .
Take particular interest tomatoes when building healthy habits , as they contain a very high amount of lycopene , distinguished by antioxidant functions .
Consuming large quantities of vegetables daily will provide you with not only the necessary nutrients and many valuable vitamins , but also more energy every day .
Functional food mainly consists of consuming a large amount of natural products , such as e.g. : Soya , which contains phytosterols , saponins , phytic acid , as well as isoflavones .
This product category also includes cranberry juice , which prevents the formation of serious urinary system diseases , and helps with the proper functioning of the bacterial flora .
What other products should you find on your shopping list ?
It ’s black and green tea , which have strong antioxidant properties .
Also worth adding to the list are corn oil , rapeseed oil and sunflower oil , as they are the source of beta - sitosterols and help to overcome hypercholesterolemia .
We certainly love our movies here at Forever Geek .
In many movies cars play a very big role and we are fans of cars as well .
Actually there are three things we particularly like in / about movies :
Great movie title sequences , special effects and robots and last but not least cars .
So we went ahead and compiled a list of the geekiest cars in movies .
While selecting these cars it was imperative for us that we chose only modified cars , so no Eleanor ( Shelby GT500 ) .
Gadgetmobile
The Gadgetmobile is based on a 1964 Lincoln Continental Convertible and designed by Brenda Bradford .
The Gadgetmobile can speak , track Inspector Gadget ’s location , camouflage itself and move its tires upwards , among other things and thinks its stands above the laws ( and does not need to respect speed limits ) .
American Graffiti Hot Rod
Millner ’s yellow hot rod in American Graffiti is a ’ 34 Ford Coupe , carrying custom “ THX 138 ” license plates , which refer to THX 1138 , George Lucas ’ first movie .
Fab1 Thunderbird
The Fab1 in the 2004 Thunderbirds movie was a heavily modified Ford THunderbird and provided by the company itself .
The Thunderbird on 6 wheels is completely road legal and has been featured in Top Gear .
The car has bullet - proof , run - flat tires but ca not fly .
Minority Report Lexus 2054
The Lexus 2054 in Minority Report is a concept car running on fuel cells , with advanced safety features , including biometric security systems .
The car , painted in blue this time , also features in Micael Bay ’s The Island .
I , Robot Audi RSQ
Built on the chassis of an A4 this Audi concept car , designed for product placement has 2 reverse butterfly doors and the Multi Media Interface ( MMI ) driver - to - car control system .
This collaboration was a first for Audi and similar to the previously mentioned Lexus concept car in Minority Report .
Judge Dredd Land Rover
22 Land Rovers 101 Forward Control were converted with fiberglass bodies for the movie Judge Dredd and only one had a functional interior for inside shots .
The NY Cab is not road legal and had no floors .
To see out the windshield you had to tilt your head to one side or the other and lean forward , this basically requiring a second person on board to look out for traffic .
Star Wars Land Speeder
Luke Skywalker ’s Land Speeder actually was a modified car .
Numerous problems hiding the wheels were encountered .
Easiest was to photograph the car from angles not showing the wheels .
In longer scenes the Land Speeder had a reflecting skirt , mirroring the sand beneath .
Blade Runner Spinner
Sinners have been used in several movies ( See also The Fifth Element Taxi further in the list ) .
Main characteristic is that the cars can take off vertically .
In Blade Runner the Spinners are mainly used by the police to patrol the city .
The Blade Runner spinner has been designed by Syd Mead .
Tumbler Batmobile
When Warner Bros decided to reboot the Batman franchise with Christopher Nolan at the helmet , the Batmobile was reinvented .
Contrarily to previous Batmobile , the Tumbler was made around functionality .
Instead of being one beautiful car with many gadgets , now it was a practical vehicle with rather ugly looks .
1990 Batmobile
When Batman made his first box office appearance on the widescreen , he needed a new car .
Much meaner and darker than the 1954 Lincoln Ventura used in the TV series .
Gotham was darker and so was the car .
The Batmobile in “ Batman ” ( 1990 ) was built on the longer platform of a Chevrolet Caprice , while producer Tim Burton opted for the platform of a Buick Riviera for “ Batman Returns ” ( 1992 ) .
The exterior of both Batmobiles was similar and all built - in gadgets were functional .
DeLorean Back to the Future
Who had ever thought that a car , based on a failure like the DLorean , could have become this iconic ?
Although based on a fairly vanilla DeLorean , the BTTF car was a genuine flux - capacitor powered time machine .
No one would have imagined the DeLorean could reach the needed 88 mph to activate the time machine , but it really did ( in the movies at least ) .
Lotus Esprit James Bond The Spy Who Loved Me
James Bond ’s Lotus Esprit is probably the most understated Bond car but came with lots of special features : rear firing mud sprayers , full ‘ underwater ’ kit turning the car into a fully operative submarine , surface - to - air missiles , depth charges , underwater smoke screens and torpedoes .
A Bond car as you ’ld expect them .
Ecto - 1 Ghostbusters ( 1959 Cadillac Ambulance )
The original Ecto 1 recently was listed on Ebay but with $ 45.100 the reserve was not met .

Kaneda ’s Bike – Akira
From the poplaur Akira movie , not much is known about Kaneda ’s bike .
Only very little information about the build and construction / design has been released .
There is a big Japanese subculture , building replicas .
You can often buy a customized replica .
The Fifth Element Taxi
The cab in The Fifth Element is a spinner car as well .
All cars in this movie are spinners and there are very interesting trivia about the car designs and their decorations in the movie .
Speed Racer Mach 5
Speed Racer Mach 5 featured the same original button steering wheel as the car in the anime series .
Most of time the car was hung from a crane and effects were computer generated .
Herbie
Although only a slightly modified VW Beetle , Herbie has managed to win the hearts of many kids and adults over the years .
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ( Paragon Panther )
Bumblebee Transformers ( 1977/2009 Chevrolet Camaro )
Contrarily to in the series , Bumblebee is a Chevrolet Camaro in the 2007 feature Transformers and not a VW Beetle .
According to Michael Bay , producer , Bumblebee stands at 17 foot tall as Autobot .

As various health reform bills move through House and Senate committee , coverage of reproductive health care , including but not limited to abortion care , hangs by a thread , and the drumbeat from the far right against coverage of primary reproductive health care has been growing louder .
Last week ,
White House Advisor Tina
Tchen told women 's advocates from across the country , that it will be up to the grassroots to win the campaign to cover reproductive health care .
Want your basic reproductive health services covered under health reform ?
Want to keep the coverage for reproductive health care , contraception , and abortion care you already have ?
Want to ensure that you , your mother , daugher , sister , friends , neighbors and the millions of women in the United States living without health insurance get coverage for primary reproductive health care once Congress gets through serving up sausage for your health benefits ?
Then it ’s time for women to “ bring it ” and get back into campaign mode , according to Tina Tchen , director of the White House Office of Public Engagement , speaking to more than 400 attendees at the 2009 Planned Parenthood Organizing and Policy Summit last week .
PPFA is one among many national and state groups , including the National Women ’s Law Center , NARAL Pro-Choice America , and the National Partnership for Women and Families working “ night and day ” and mobilizing constituents to protect coverage of basic reproductive health care .
Tchen , who shared a panel with Representative Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) and PPFA President Cecile Richards , provided participants with a status update on health care reform and reiterated the Obama administration ’s commitment to women ’s health .
“ I can say this directly from the White House , the President reiterated to all of us in the senior staff that health care is the most important issue , ” said Tchen .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

It is the signature issue that he ran on , it is what he believes is one of the singularly most important reforms that need to be made that affects America , that affects our economy .
Tchen also reminded the group that they had elected a pro-choice president .
President Obama publicly re-affirmed his support for a woman ’s right to choose just days after his inauguration , on Thursday , January 22nd , the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .
He stated :
Roe v.
Wade “ not only protects women ’s health and reproductive freedom , but stands for a broader principle : that government should not intrude on our most private family matters , ” Obama said in a statement .
But , the PPFA panelists warned , his support for a woman ’s right to choose and for access to the services needed to prevent unintended pregnancy , stem the spread of infections and ensure all women have primary reproductive health care wo n’t be enough to secure passage of a health reform bill that includes these essential health services .
In fact , both Republicans and conservative Democrats are pushing for restrictions in health reform legislation that could result in the loss of current benefits to millions of women .
“ Health care reform must not leave women worse off than they are under our current system , ” wrote Richards in a recent action alert .
But as various bills move through Congress , the “ steady assault from anti-choice groups has become an avalanche , ” she said .
If the Right Wins , Women Will Lose
Today , the majority of American women with private or employer - provided health insurance have policies that cover both contraceptive supplies and abortion care , as well as pap smears , well - woman exams , testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections , pregnancy care and other forms of primary , preventive reproductive health care .
A federally supported study conducted by the Guttmacher Institute assessing levels of insurance coverage for a wide range of reproductive health services found that 87 percent of typical employer - based insurance policies in 2002 covered medically necessary or appropriate abortions .
It also found that 86 percent of typical plans covered all five of the leading contraceptive methods .
Using different methods of collecting data , a 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF ) study found that 72 percent of employees had coverage for five reversible methods of contraception ( 88 percent for oral contraceptives specifically ) and that some 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortion .
( Differences in the two studies are explained here . )
This coverage would be lost if reproductive health becomes the “ bipartisan ” bargaining chip for which it has been used by Democrats and Republicans for far too long .
You know the refrain : “ We need a ‘ common - sense , ’ ‘ bipartisan ’ compromise to pass this bill . ”
Translation : Women get thrown off the bus .
But if reproductive health care including but not limited to abortion is not covered under whatever health care reform results , we can be sure that both women and society will continue to pay a high price .
There will be more infection and disease , more unintended pregnancy , and more , not fewer , abortions .
A number of recent articles on Rewire have explored in depth the social , economic and health costs of disparities in access to reproductive health care that currently exist .
For example , today , roughly 16.7 million women are uninsured , and thus likely to postpone care and delay or forego important preventive care .
This means preventable illness goes undiagnosed .
For example , increased access to pap smears for women who do not have these services will save lives and money .
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009 , about 11,270 cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the United States .
Non-invasive cervical cancer is estimated by some researchers to be 4 times more common than invasive cervical cancer .
About 4,070 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States during 2009 according to the ACS .
Early detection and early treatment = lives–and money –saved .
Poor women also rely heavily on publicly funded contraceptive services , which prevent 1.94 million unintended pregnancies , including almost 400,000 teen pregnancies , each year .
These pregnancies would otherwise result in 860,000 unintended births , 810,000 abortions and 270,000 miscarriages .
Taken together , all of these are critical to being able to prevent an unintended pregnancy and hence a potential abortion .
Not surprisingly , the groups experiencing the highest rates of unintended pregnancy have the least secure access to contraception .
Of the 36.2 million women in the United States who expressed a need for birth control in 2006 , 17.5 million were in need of publicly funded services and supplies , more than 71 percent of which were adults and the vast majority of which were already parents .
Yet in 2006 , only about half ( 54 percent ) of those in need of publicly funded birth control actually had access to services provided by Medicaid , Title X and other sources of government funding .
Indeed , as Elisabeth Sowecke wrote here just this week , the number of women who qualify for but are as yet unable to access Medicaid - funded abortion services is large and growing .
This denial of care represents a particularly insidious level of discrimination against both the women and their families and a violation of basic human rights .
The reality of these costs also are not lost on the governors of some of the largest states , whose budgets are reeling from a combination of high unemployment and growing demands on social safety nets , including Medicaid .
Today , 16 governors , led by Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio , sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to support the inclusion of the Medicaid Family Planning State Option in health care reform .
This critical provision provides basic preventive health care , including breast and cervical cancer screenings and contraception , to millions of women and is currently in President Obama ’s fiscal year 2010 budget .
“ Currently , 27 states have sought and recieved federal waivers to expand eligibility for family planning services , ” wrote the governors .
States have repeatedly demonstrated that expanding health care coverage for women in this way also results in significant cost savings .
Expanding the Medicaid Family Planning State Option would allow states to expand Medicaid coverage for family planning services , without a waiver , to those who do n’t otherwise qualify for full Medicaid benefits .
These cost savings could help states avoid additional cuts to critical health programs and allow them to use the savings for other pressing needs .
The Medicaid Family Planning State Option will also save federal funds .
The Congressional Budget Office determined that the Medicaid Family Planning State Option saves the federal government $ 200 million over five years and $ 700 million over 10 years .
Where ’s the Opposition ?
Irrespective of the cost savings , these benefits are in fact in danger at the hands of a majority - male Congress whose coverage for Viagra remains well - protected .
Some of the opposition comes from likely suspects and is based on misinformation campaigns that belie their true purpose .
Republicans in Congress , like Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Mike Pence–who introduced an amendment today to the House appropriations bills to defund Planned Parenthood –just can’t seem to get the connection between increased access to prevention services , improved health and reduced need for abortions , the women ’s right they love to hate .
And it is no surprise that groups like Family Research Council and the National Right to Life Committee are against not only funding for abortion services , but also for contraception .
FRC , for example , continues to perpetuate myths about an amendment to the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pension ( HELP ) Committee health reform bill originally sponsored by Senator Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) .
This amendment , which passed as part of that bill , would ensure coverage of well - woman care , HIV prevention and testing , pap smears , pregnancy care , and contraceptive supplies .
FRC continues to claim it forces taxpayers to pay for abortions for the first time in 30 years .
It does not address abortion coverage .
At all .
Watch Your Frenemies
But then there are Democrats who may either “ cut a deal ” on coverage of abortion services or who oppose it outright .
For example : while the House and Senate HELP Committees have passed their bills , and neither of those includes any restrictions on coverage of reproductive health care , Tchen noted :
This was not easy to achieve in committee and wo n’t be easy to hold on to the Senate floor or on the House floor .
And the President can not do it alone .
His efforts alone will not be enough .
It will take each of you to raise your voices when you go home and here in DC and to spread the word .
In fact , as of this writing , trouble may be brewing in the Senate Finance Committee and is boiling up in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Senate Finance has been promising a bill “ for weeks ” according to one source , but nothing has as yet materialized publicly .
Meanwhile , Senator Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , chairman of Committee has according to Dana Goldstein , “ indicated some openness to compromising on abortion rights in exchange for Republican support for a final reform bill . ”
While Baucus ’s office underscores his pro-choice position , co-Chair Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) is not pro-choice , and in the still largely old boys club that is the Senate , that “ bipartisan ” thing trumps women ’s rights every time .
“ Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee are pushing for language in health care reform legislation that would eliminate coverage for abortion services , ” stated a coalition of religious groups that support abortion rights .
“ If this happens , many women could lose coverage for abortion services that their private insurance currently includes .
Plus , millions of uninsured women will still lack a basic health care service despite having been promised a better quality of life , ” says Rev. Carlton Veazey , president and CEO , Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice .
“ If these senators are allowed to deny coverage of abortion services , ” Veazey continued ,
the burden will inevitably fall on low - income women and widen the huge gap in health status and access to health care services that reforms are meant to remedy .
Compared to their higher - income counterparts , low - income women are four times as likely to have an unintended pregnancy and five times as likely to have an unintended birth .
“ As people of faith , we believe that health care reform should expand coverage to provide for the basic services that every human being deserves ; it should not deny essential services to half of the population and aggravate the troubling disparities in health care affecting minorities and low - income individuals , ” Veazey adds .
In the House , Congressman Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) ( who this week helpfully tried to re-insert funding for abstinence - only - until - marriage programs into the House appropriations bill ) has threatened to halt passage of legislation unless it explicitly “ excludes public funds for abortions . ”
Stupak claims to have 39 House Democrats in line to vote against passage .
Today ’s Congress Daily reports that :
Stupak said he will consider voting against the health reform bill if leaders do not allow a floor vote on an amendment that explicitly prohibits using public funds for abortions .
If the vote is not allowed , he and other Democrats opposing abortion rights will likely vote against the rule allowing consideration of the health reform bill , he said .
Even the Senate HELP Committee –which as noted above has passed its bill –debated a half - dozen abortion - related amendments , defeating most on identical 12 - 11 votes , including one that would have barred people who get government insurance subsidies from buying private insurance plans that include abortion coverage .
In fact , even the “ contraceptive option ” was deemed to controversial for at least one Democrat .
Senator Bob Casey ( D - PA ) voted against the Mikulski Amendment ensuring coverage of contraception and of essential service providers .
Calls to his office inquiring as to the reason for his vote against contraceptive coverage were not returned .
Public v. Private : Confusing the Issues
The basic argument for those who are trying to completely eliminate even the possibility of coverage for abortion services under health care reform is that “ no public funds should be allocated for abortions ” because “ we do n’t do that . ”
But that is , not surprisingly , a misleading argument because health reform is intended to completely transform insurance coverage and to expand the range of essential coverage , and as noted earlier , most private plans today already cover these services .
In order to ensure all Americans are covered , most health reform proposals include options for “ insurance exchanges ” and other methods through which the federal government might partially subsidize the costs of insurance coverage for those without employer - based insurance , or those who can not afford to pay out - of - pocket for an insurance policy .
What the Republicans and the Democrats opposed to continuing current coverage ( including current abortion coverage ) for women want to do is to elminate the possibility of coverage from either subsidized or private plans whether or not the federal government is subsidizing a particular person .
This is sort of like applying the “ global gag rule ” to private insurance plans because even if you are paying for 90 percent of your policy , the restrictions apply both to the federally funded portion ( 10 percent ) as well as to the 90 percent of the policy you pay for .
Moreover , some analysts believe the implication is that even in cases where you pay for 100 percent of the policy you choose , if the federal government is involved in any way in that insurance plan by subsidizing others , your coverage would still be restricted .
Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse ( D - RI ) told NPR last week that not letting people use what might be very small subsidies to buy private coverage was going too far .
“ The next step in this logic will be to require anybody seeking these services to walk to the clinic , lest they use federal highways , supported by federal highway funds , ” he said .
What is more :
The public is against having the Senate or the House dictate their medical choices .
A survey conducted by the Mellman Group for the National Women ’s Law Center of 1,000 likely voters found that :
Voters overwhelmingly support the broad outlines of reform and requiring coverage of women ’s reproductive health services .
Seventy - one percent of voters support requiring health plans to cover women ’s reproductive health services , as opposed to 21 percent opposing this coverage .
Absent coverage for women ’s reproductive health services , majorities oppose reform .
If reform eliminated current insurance coverage of reproductive health services such as birth control or abortion , nearly two - thirds ( 60 % ) would oppose the plan and nearly half ( 47 % ) would oppose it strongly .
Voters want an independent commission to make coverage decisions , not politicians .
A strong majority of voters ( 75 percent ) prefer that an independent commission of citizens and medical professionals make decisions about what should be covered under reform rather than the President and Congress .
Fully 73 percent of voters want an independent commission to decide whether abortion should be covered , while just 16 percent want the President and Congress involved .
Even in the face of opposition arguments , majorities support requiring coverage of abortions under reform .
After hearing strong arguments both for and against covering abortion under reform , two - thirds ( 66 percent ) support coverage , agreeing that health care , not politics , should drive coverage decisions .
A majority of voters ( 72 percent ) reported that they would feel angry if Congress mandated by law that abortion would not be covered under a national health care plan .
Voters want rules to stop insurance companies from discriminating against women .
Even in the face of industry claims of too much government interference , 62 percent agree that reform should establish new rules to treat everyone fairly and stop discrimination , while far fewer ( 32 percent ) side with opponents ’ claims .
Where does it go from here ?
Even despite the evidence , the benefits and the clear public support for women to continue making their own medical decisions with their families and their doctors , and for full coverage of these services , anti-choice activists and politicians continue to play the same political shell games with women ’s health and lives .
So groups are heeding the call to “ bring it . ”
And you can join them .
Here are links to action by some of the organizations mobilizing to ensure reproductive health services remain available to women and their families :
Planned Parenthood Action Fund
National Women ’s Law Center
NARAL Pro-Choice America
National Partnership for Women and Families
Earlier this month , ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl did something he has resisted doing for the last three and a half years : he asked President Donald Trump why he lied to the American people .
A WOMAN is pregnant with 12 babies and plans to have a natural birth with all of them despite medical experts ' advice that it is impossible .
The unnamed mother - to - be - a teacher from Tunisia - is said to be defying medical advice by vowing to give birth to six girls and six boys , reports The Sun newspaper .
If she succeeds , her brood - conceived after fertility treatment - will smash the world record for multiple births .
The tots ' father , identified only as Marwan , is backing her .
He beamed : " In the beginning we thought that my wife would give birth to twins .
" But more foetuses were discovered .
Our joy increased with the growing number . "
British fertility experts warned the pregnancy in the Tunisian oasis town of Gafsa carried " colossal " risks .
All nine babies born to the current record - holder - an Australian mum in 1971 - died in Sydney .
She was also " looking forward to hugging her six boys and six girls " .
The wife had sought help after previously suffering the anguish of several miscarriages .
The Tunisian government is said to have pledged to do all it can to care for the mother and her babies .

Halting deforestation is essential to preventing dangerous global warming , the energy and climate change secretary , Ed Miliband , has told indigenous tribesmen and women on a visit to the heart of the Amazon rainforest .
Cutting down trees causes 17 % of global carbon emissions — more than global transport — and much of it happens in the Amazon .
But mechanisms by which rich nations can persuade forested nations that the trees are worth more standing than felled have been problematic , with issues of land ownership , the role of indigenous people and corruption hindering progress .
" We can only get an agreement on climate change if it involves Brazil and it involves forestry , " Miliband said during a boat trip on the Xingu river near the remote indigenous community of Pavuru .
The world 's governments will gather in Copenhagen in December to agree a global treaty on fighting global warming , with deforestation very high on the agenda .
" There is no solution to the question of climate change without forestry , " he added .
During the five - day diplomatic offensive Miliband will meet environmentalists , policy makers and scientists as well as the people on the frontline of Brazil 's battle against climate change – Brazil 's indigenous communities , cattle ranchers and soy farmers .
Yesterday afternoon he touched down in the Xingu National Park — a sprawling indigenous reserve home to 5,000 Indians from 14 different ethnic groups — to discuss the perils of climate change and deforestation with those who inhabit the world 's greatest tropical rainforest .
Addressing the Indians in a straw - roofed auditorium in Pavuru , Miliband said :
" We recognise the very important steps that you are taking to protect the environment against illegal activities and other threats against the forest and we are very grateful to you .
But we know there is more that we can do to help you manage the forest in a sustainable way . "
Tribesmen and women had travelled from across the 2.8 m hectare Xingu National Park to reach this tiny village at the heart of the reserve .
" They told us the minister wanted to talk to us about deforestation , about water , " said Tom Aweti , 48 , the leader of the Aweti people who had travelled several hours by boat to reach the meeting .
" We will listen . "
But the Indians also came to be heard ; from the early hours of Sunday dozens of boats carrying tribal leaders and their families began mooring on Pavuru 's small beach .
Others came onboard a single motor aeroplane .
" The white man is invading our land , " Chief Tinini , from the Xingu's Juruna village , told Miliband , holding a tribal spear in his right hand .
" Many fish are dying , " he added , blaming the construction of hydroelectric plants in the Xingu region .
" Our children will starve . "
Napiku Ikpeng , 33 , from Pavuru 's indigenous association , said he was concerned government infrastructure plans , involving roads and hydroelectric plants , would harm his peoples ' way of life .
" We are n't against economic growth … but this growth has to respect the Indians who live in this place , " he said .
Speaking to the Guardian after the meeting Miliband said he had been shocked " seeing the actual logs piled up and the illegal roads that have been built " during a flight over the Amazon rainforest .
" The Amazon forest is such a beautiful place when it is untouched and then you see these scars on the landscape of the deforestation , bigger and bigger scars , " he said .
" Brazil is up for a deal we just need proper ambition from developed countries , the right financial architecture in place , " he added .
Mainstream Media Economic Recovery Propaganda , False Profits and Some “ Surprises to the Upside ”
321gold.com founder Bob Moriarty never fails to get a rise out of The Gold Report readers , simultaneously raising hackles and awareness .
In this interview , his fifth with us since last November , he rails against continuing business , media and government shenanigans .
He prophesizes bankruptcy , riots and revolution .
But he also sees a bit of silver lining in the thunderheads , predicting “ a lot of surprises to the upside ” in the resources sector .
The Gold Report : Just reading the papers today , we ’re seeing lots of interesting news .
We see GM has come out of bankruptcy , we see Goldman Sachs , BofA and Citigroup all recording record profits .
We ’re even hearing , in some cases and some places that home sales are increasing .
What is going on ?
Bob Moriarty :
That ’s an example of how total the distortion is in the news media in the United States .
First of all , 96 % of the news media is controlled by six people .
Their vested interest is not in telling the truth ; their vested interest is in selling products .
What we call the news media is really better termed a propaganda media .
It ’s all propaganda .
Let ’s take , for example , year - on - year railway shipping of automobiles is down 49 % .
Nobody in creation could honestly believe that GM is in better shape now than they were a few weeks ago .
Coming out of bankruptcy is a legal maneuver ; it ’s not a financial maneuver .
They ’re out of bankruptcy ; it ’s perfectly true and perfectly meaningless at the same time .
The government now controls GM .
As negative as I am toward American management in business today , the only people who are far worse would be government bureaucrats .
For example , in mid-July I saw Paulson ’s testimony about how they threatened bankruptcy when BofA ’s negotiations with Merrill Lynch almost came unglued .
Bank of America President Lewis did n’t take care of his shareholders , which he has a legal obligation to do .
He pandered to the government and Paulson said , “ We ’ll just replace you . ”
Since when did we become a communist society or socialist society ?
It ’s no longer capitalism ; it ’s government control of industry .
On one hand , we ’ve got the financial system totally controlled by Goldman Sachs .
On the other hand , we ’ve got government control of Chrysler and GM and major segments of the economy .
We have the worst of all possible worlds .
As to the record profits you mention , we ’re in a depression .
If these guys are making money , it ’s because they ’re manipulating the markets and stealing from the taxpayers .
There ’s a difference .
TGR : We have this big push for more government oversight and if we already are allowing banks to steal money , what will additional government oversight going to give us ?
BM : Congress gave these guys the ability to steal .
There ’s been something like $ 14 trillion total in government guarantees and loans and giveaways .
In 5 , 10 or 20 years from now , we ’re going to look back and say this was absolutely unbelievable .
That money is simply evaporating .
The government talks about the deficit going over $ 1 trillion dollars this year .
In the first six months , the actual debt of the United States increased $ 2 trillion .
On a $ 14 trillion economy , the debt is going to go up $ 4 trillion this year .
That ’s never happened before in history .
It ’s just absolutely amazing .
TGR : Speaking of debt , as you probably know , California is not hinged on either financial industries or the auto industry , but it ’s been paying government contracts with IOUs .
BM : California is a disaster waiting to happen .
It could fire every state employee and still not balance its budget .
California has the eighth largest economy in the world and although they threw together a budget at the 11th hour , the prospect of having to declare bankruptcy still looms .
One thing that no government bureaucrat will do at any level in the United States today is decrease spending .
We ’re bankrupt ; we ca n’t afford to pay the debt that we already have .
Obama is just expanding power and size of government enormously .
What we must do at all levels is reduce government spending and these guys do n’t want to do it .
The government always wants to increase their power , not decrease it .
The way they gain power and votes is to spend money .
So they say there ’s no alternative .
TGR : Is n’t it true that no U.S. state can declare bankruptcy ?
BM : Oh , of course , they can declare bankruptcy .
Cities go bankrupt all the time ; so can states .
We have 37 states that are not going to be able to balance their budgets .
This is so simple and it ’s been happening for millennia .
Periodically you go through a time where there ’s too much debt .
You ’ve got to wipe out debt and start all over again .
Nobody wants to admit that .
California ’s not going to pay their debts , and neither is the United States .
They can ’t .
TGR : Thinking about potential bankruptcy and the debt of the Federal government , one of your common themes is that there will be riots in the streets .
You talk about this on an international level , but you also apparently expect it to also happen in the U.S.
So far , it has n’t happened .
Do you think part of that is because social legislation is making the U.S. population complacent ?
BM : I do n’t think so .
I will say the U.S. population is complacent to just an incredible degree .
We saw a lot of attention focused on Iran over charges of malfeasance in their elections .
The last two presidential elections prior to Obama coming in were absolutely stolen by the Republicans .
It was so crooked , it was unbelievable the American population did n’t do anything .
But when I ’ve talked about rioting in the streets in the United States , you can look and see what ’s happening in China right now .
Everybody in the world is sitting on a powder keg and it would take very little to ignite that and it absolutely is going to happen .
The fact that it has n’t happened yet does n’t mean I ’m wrong .
It just means I ’m wrong with the timing , but my call was for this summer and we ’ve still got some summer to go .
TGR : Shifting from social unrest to financial unrest , when we last interviewed you , you were talking about the $ 600 trillion of outstanding derivatives and the potential — if it begins to unravel — of putting heavy selling pressure on the financial markets .
Do you see that beginning to happen ?
BM : Absolutely .
The big crash that took place from last July through November was unusual because it had far more to do with unwinding or deleveraging of derivatives .
For the first time in about 10 years , derivatives actually went down .
I ’ve been making the comment since 2001 that derivatives were a financial time bomb and the bigger they grew , the bigger the explosion was going to be .
Here are the numbers you need to focus on .
According to the latest figures put out by the BIS ( Bureau of Industry and Security , U.S. Department of Commerce ) , derivatives decreased by about $ 100 trillion from July through December 2008 .
But for derivatives to deleverage $ 100 trillion , it wiped out $ 50 trillion worth of net asset value .
For us to knock that $ 600 trillion to something more manageable — like $ 50 trillion — could wipe out $ 250 - $ 275 -$ 300 trillion worth of assets .
There is n’t $ 300 trillion worth of assets in the whole world .
So the simple explanation is that there is far more debt in the world than assets to cover it .
We have not come to grips with that .
We ’ve not seen the bottom of the stock market and I believe there will be a massive deleveraging starting shortly .
The bankruptcy of CIT or the situation in California could well be what starts it .
TGR : Do we necessarily have to unwind all of the debt ?
Ca n’t we live peacefully with some amount of derivatives ?
BM : No .
With derivatives , people bet on things that make no financial sense .
There ’s nothing gained financially .
It ’s a giant crap game , where everybody ’s playing with Monopoly money , and the game is rigged .
I ’ve been saying that for years .
I ’m the last guy in the world to believe in conspiracy theories , but Goldman Sachs just brought criminal charges against one of their programmers for stealing a software program that allowed them to front - run their own customers .
I think 87 % of their trades were profitable and they were doing $ 100 million a day in profit .
They were stealing from their own customers .
TGR : How is it they ’re suing this programmer and not the management ?
BM : The programmer stole the code and was going to take it to another company .
But in their criminal complaint , they said the software would allow someone to manipulate the stock market — that the software was designed to manipulate the stock market .
TGR : If the papers are filed and they ’re admitting that the software is designed to front run and cause abnormal profits , why is n’t someone bringing Goldman Sachs to court ?
BM : Goldman Sachs owns our government .
The government of the United States is a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs .
TGR : How do we break that link ?
BM : We go bankrupt , we have riots , we have a revolution .
You hang people from the nearest yardarm .
TGR : Your conversation about the riots and the bankrupt and the further crash in the stock market goes back to something you ’ve been saying all along — to invest in gold and silver .
In fact , you suggested that the percentage of gold and silver in investors ’ portfolios should equal the probability of financial collapse they expect .
You ’re talking about 100 % probability for financial collapse , and the last time we talked , you were 100 % in gold and silver and various forms of it .
But your recent writings suggest that you ’re moving out into some other sectors now .
What ’s the story ?
BM : I was a little bit inaccurate in what I said .
Here ’s a more accurate way of putting it .
The very most important thing that anyone can do for themselves and for their family is to have an insurance policy of physical gold , physical silver or physical platinum .
Those are insurance policies .
Once you get past the insurance policy , the very safest things that you can invest in right now are producing gold or silver mines , near - term producing gold mines or energy .
The scary thing about energy is that it goes up and down .
Natural gas right now is an absolute disaster .
Nobody is making money in natural gas .
We could still have more declines in the price of natural gas and oil .
However , we have passed peak oil .
Demand has continued to increase even with a depression and we ’ve got not only peak oil , but we ’ve got peak food .
Potash is interesting .
Potash has n’t come down very much .
It got up to about $ 1,000 a ton and it ’s about $ 550 a ton now .
There are three or four or five really good potash companies and I think they ’re very attractive .
But you want to invest in real things , tangibles that produce something that is valuable in real - world Economics 101 — silver , gold , platinum , potash , oil and natural gas .
So when I talk about gold being insurance against financial collapse , all of the rest are , too , to varying degrees .
TGR : Thank you for clarifying that .
You mentioned your focus on producing or near - term producing gold and silver .
You ’ve been saying this all along , and in fact , we give you credit for calling a couple of great companies in this sector .
One is Evolving Gold ( TSX.V: EVG ) , which just this week has gone up 225 % .
You also called Minco Silver Corp . ( TSX : MSV ) .
BM : Those are not great predictions on the part of Bob Moriarty .
The stock market got absolutely creamed last October and November , so hundreds of stocks were up hundreds of percent .
That said , I really like Minco and Evolving Gold .
I like Passport Metals Inc. ( TSX - V : PPI.V ) in potash .
I went to see Great Panther Resources ( TSX : GPR ) and Endeavour Silver Corp . ( TSX : EDR ) ( NYSE.A:EXK ) earlier this month .
These are producing companies with good management and those are exactly what you want to be buying .
I also saw Silvermex Resources Ltd. ( TSX - V : SMR ) on that trip .
TGR : What ’s new with these companies ?
BM : I was the first person to ever write about both Endeavour and Great Panther , and I ’ve reported on them since then .
I ’ll be following up on the reports that I did a couple of years ago .
I ’d never been to Silvermex before .
Interestingly enough , it ’s run by the same management of Timmins Gold Corp . ( TSX.V: TMM ) .
But I am extremely biased as anybody who knows me knows and I love Mexico .
I think it ’s a great mining environment .
TGR : Any others on your radar ?
BM : I just recently visited Hawthorne Gold Corp. ( TSX.V:HGC ) , too , a near - term producer in Canada .
They own a mill in Jade City , BC , and they ’re going back into production .
Pediment Gold Corp. ( TSX : PEZ ) ( OTCBB : PEZGF ) ( FSE : P5E ) came out with an announcement in mid-July that they ’re going to get started on a drill program at their gold project in Sonora .
I want them to do what they ’re doing ; I just want them to do it faster .
Timmins is on track .
They ’ll be producing gold either the third quarter or fourth quarter , good management , good project .
They ’re financed now .
And these are all kind of things that you want to be looking at .
TGR : Are there any other companies that you ’d like to point out as potential rising stars ?
BM : I came across a really interesting company that ’s very attractive called Commerce Resources Corp .
( TSX.V: CCE ) ( PK SHEETS : CMRZF )
It has the world ’s next tantalum and niobium project ; it ’s still an exploration play at this point .
TGR : Any more ?
BM : Actually , there are hundreds of gold companies , silver companies , resource companies selling very cheaply .
They are cheaper than they ’ve ever been relative to the price of gold and silver and that creates good opportunity .
Gold is very cheap at $ 940 , silver is pretty cheap at $ 13.40 .
But it ’s important to understand that even though prices have come down , the supply of commodities has dwindled faster than demand has decreased , so we could see explosions in the price of copper or lead or zinc or niobium or tantalum or silver or gold .
There will be a lot of surprises to the upside .
Shares of resource companies are still at record lows , so you could see lots of companies go up 1,000 % .
Evolving Gold is one of my favorites .
It got down to 14 cents in November and has been trading around $ 1.80 recently .
TGR : With supply falling faster than the demand , what other metals should we be watching for surprises ?
BM : All of them .
We ’re all familiar with the concept that demand for metals goes down when you go into a depression .
That ’s absolutely true .
Rail car shipments of metals in the United States are down 40 % .
But the key is a lot of these mines have high - cost operations , and when the price of metal goes down , they just put the mines into care and maintenance .
So the surprise in the metals will be a surprise to the upside .
TGR : When do you expect all of the government ’s infusion of currency into the system to produce inflation ?
BM : Everybody is talking about deflation .
We do n’t have deflation .
Housing prices may be down , but we have inflation and it ’s a lot higher than most people realize .
Ignoring the reported numbers because any government numbers today are fantasy , what do you suppose the core inflation rate is today ?
What do you feel from your experience ?
TGR : I would say not quite double digits .
BM : You called it very well .
I ’ve told people for years that their own experience is as good as or better than anything else .
John Williams from shadowstats.com is saying that inflation is close to 9.5 % .
That ’s what the real numbers are .
We have a lot of inflation right now and it ’s only going to get worse .
TGR : But at the same time , are n’t a lot of the discount stores in essence keeping prices capped ?
BM : They are .
The opportunities are shocking now .
It ’s extraordinary .
I ’m just knocked out when I go to the stores and see the number of items on sale .
That said , though , the consumer is broke .
If you do n’t have the money , it does n’t make any difference if there are sales going on or not .
But for the core items , I see a lot of things going up .
I just sent a book , interestingly enough , overnight from Florida to Colorado .
For a five - pound book , it cost me $ 42 .
I was in absolutely shock .
I thought it would be $ 10 or $ 15 or maybe $ 20 tops .
TGR : Any parting comments ?
BM : There are opportunities , as I said , but we are not out of the woods .
The economy is not recovering .
Unemployment is still shooting through the roof and things are going to get far worse before they get better .
We have another crash coming this fall .
TGR : We look forward to one day when we say things are looking up .
BM : We ’re going to have to smarten up first .
We ca n’t keep doing incredibly stupid things like all these recovery programs .
They ’re nothing but giveaways for the vested interests .

Fans who wish to attend Michael Jackson ’s star - studded memorial service at Staples Center will have to shell out $ 25 to sit in the stands , RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively .
Family , friends and VIPS will have seats on the main floor for The Tuesday , July 7th Staples service , first reported by RadarOnline.com , while the general public will be plucking down $ 25 to sit in the stands .
The memorial service will feel like a concert production featuring guest speakers , a lot of music and video screens inside and outside of Staples , a source close to the planning tells RadarOnline.com .
Michael Jackson ’s close friend Elizabeth Taylor is expected to attend , along with Diana Ross .
T - shirts that were going to be sold on Michael ’s upcoming “ This Is It ” tour will not go to waste .
They will be sold outside Staples to people entering the service .
The service will be held between 10 am PST and noon PST .
The Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey circus will be on standby , literally .
The circus act just happens to be in town and is slated to begin their run at the Staples Center from July 8 to July 11 .
“ We will not be taking part in the memorial service , ” spokesperson Stephen Payne confirmed .
“ We are prepared to make any logistical changes with equipment and such to help out . ”
They 're a cinch to make and require no kneading .
They ’re not smooth and perfect and aesthetically flawless , but they ’re rustic and charming .
Oh , and delicious !
Pour 4 cups of milk into a stock pot or Dutch oven .
Add one cup of sugar and 1 cup of vegetable oil .
Stir to combine .
Now , turn the burner on medium to medium - low and “ scald ” the mixture ( bring it to just before a boil . )
Cool to lukewarm ( between 90 and 110 degrees ) .
Before the mixture boils , turn off the heat .
NOW .
Very important stuff here : walk away .
Walk away and allow this mixture to cool to warm / lukewarm .
The mixture will need to be warm enough to be a hospitable environment for the yeast , but not so hot that it kills the yeast and makes it inactive .
I do n’t usually use a thermometer , but if you ’d like to , a good temperature is between 90 and 110 degrees .
I usually feel the side of the pan with the palm of my hand .
If it ’s hot at all , I wait another 20 minutes or so .
The pan should feel comfortably warm .
When the mixture is the right temperature add in 4 cups of flour and 2 packages of ( 4 - 1/2 teaspoons ) of active dry yeast .
After the yeast and flour are nicely incorporated , add another 4 cups of flour .
Stir together and allow to sit , covered with a tea towel or lid , for an hour .
After about an hour it should have almost doubled in size .
If it has n’t changed much , put it in a warm ( but turned off ) oven for 45 minutes or so .
When it had risen sufficiently add 1 more cup of flour , 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder , 1 scant teaspoon of baking soda and about 2 tablespoons of salt .
Stir ( or knead just a bit ) until combined .
Butter 1 or 2 muffin pans .
Form the rolls by pinching off a walnut sized piece of dough and rolling it into a little ball .
Repeat and tuck three balls of dough into each buttered muffin cup .
Continue until pan is full .
Cover and allow to rise for about 1 to 2 hours .
Bake in a 400 - degree oven until golden brown , about 17 to 20 minutes .

Since I ’ve kept you all waiting , I ’m not going to do my usual ten - minute monologue waxing rhapsodic on the recipe I ’m about to give you .
But I will summarize this roll recipe by saying a ) they ’re a cinch to make ; b ) they ’re totally tasty ; and c ) I ca n’t think of a “ c ” .
So let ’s get started , shall we ?
The Cast of Characters : Flour , Sugar , Milk , Vegetable Oil , Salt , and Active Dry Yeast .
Everyone has this stuff !
Begin with 4 cups of milk .
Pour the milk into a stock pot or dutch oven .
To the milk , add 1 cup of sugar …
And 1 cup of vegetable oil .
Stir to combine .
Now , turn the burner on medium to medium - low and “ scald ” the mixture , which means heat it up just until the point that it would boil .
Before the mixture boils , turn off the heat .
( Note :
At this point in the game , I have walked away and forgotten about it more times than I care to count .
If you come back to the stove and it ’s boiling , do n’t freak out .
Just turn off the heat and it ’ll be fine . )
NOW .
Very important stuff here : walk away .
Walk away and allow this mixture to cool to warm / lukewarm .
The mixture will need to be warm enough to be a hospitable environment for the yeast , but not so hot that it kills the yeast and make it inactive .
I do n’t usually use a thermometer , but if you ’d like to , a good temp is between 90 and 110 degrees .
I usually feel the side of the pan with the palm of my hand .
If it ’s hot at all , I wait another 20 minutes or so .
The pan should feel comfortably warm .
When you ’re ready , throw in 4 cups of flour .
Then sprinkle in 2 packages ( or 4 1/2 teaspoons ) Active Dry Yeast .
Stir together to get the yeast into the warm moistness .
( Warm moistness … for some reason that phrase makes me want to take a nap .
I ca n’t explain why . )
After the yeast and flour are nicely incorporated , add another 4 cups of flour .
The reason I did n’t add the 8 cups all together is that I wanted to give the yeast a chance to mingle with the warmth a little more .
Stir together and allow to sit , covered with a tea towel or lid , for an hour .
The dough will seem overly sticky .
Make sure you do n’t set it next to a freezing cold window ; it ’s best if it ’s in a relatively warm environment .
Near the stove is fine .
After an hour ( or so ) the mixture will have poufed up quite a bit .
Here ’s what mine looked like .
If yours does n’t look like it ’s changed much , put it in a warm ( but turned - off ) oven for 45 minutes or so .
Now , to finish it off , add 1 more cup of flour …
1 heaping ( more than level ) teaspoon baking powder …
1 scant ( less than level ) teaspoon baking soda …
And 2 tablespoons salt .
Now stir together until combined .
It ’ll be a little tough to stir , so sometimes I ’ll knead it around on the countertip a few times just to get the ingredients combined .
But remember …with this dough , there ’s NO NEED TO KNEAD !
When it ’s all mixed , you can put it in the fridge , covered , for up to two days before using the dough ( which means you can go make the dough NOW if you ’re using it tomorrow . )
Or , if you make it the day of , you can just leave it on the counter until you need it .
Keep in mind , though , that the dough will continue to rise ( though more slowly in the fridge ) so you ’ll have to occasionally punch it down if it overflows .
NOTE : If you do refrigerate the dough , be sure to remove it from the fridge an hour or two before you need it .
When you ’re ready to make the rolls , here ’s what to do :
Butter 1 or 2 muffin pans , depending on how many rolls you need .
Do n’t be shy , turkeys !
Lay it on as thick as you want .
I like to poke the dough .
It ’s fun and makes me feel kind of funky inside .
To form the rolls , pinch off a walnut - sized piece of dough .
Make like a six - year - old and roll it into a ball .
Repeat , and tuck three balls of dough into each buttered muffin tin .
Continue until the pan is full .
Now , it ’s very important to give the rolls plenty of room to RISE , as that will make all the difference in the ultimate consistency of the rolls .
How quickly they rise depends on many factors : how warm the room is , where the pan is , and whether or not the yeast is in a good mood that day .
I always allow myself a good 2 to 3 hours before the meal to allow the rolls to rise , as there ’s nothing worse than having to bake flat rolls .
This is what the rolls looked like after an hour of rising .
The dough had been slightly cold when I formed the balls , so the rising process moved along a little slowly .
I decided to speed up the process a little by heating up a long griddle on my stovetop , then turn off the heat and place the muffin pan on top .
This provided a little more warmth — just enough to make the yeast jump for joy .
Here they are after another thirty minutes or so .
I went ahead and baked them at this point , but they could have risen for another thirty minutes or so .
Give ‘ dem rolls plenty of time , my friends !
Bake at 400 degrees until golden brown , about 20 minutes .
Keep your eye on them , though .
I ’m the biggest roll burner there is and you should n’t listen to me .
If you think of it ahead of time , you can brush melted butter on the tops of the unbaked rolls .
Or , you can brush the tops with eggs whites and sprinkle them with poppyseeds .
Or , if you ’re lazy like me , you can just do this .
Or , you can just leave them plain .
Put them into a bread basket and take a big whiff .
They ’re not smooth and perfect and aesthetically flawless , but they ’re rustic and charming .
Oh , and delicious !
Mmmmm .
This is my favorite part .
See how conveniently the sections open up for you ?
They ’re just begging for butter .
Listen … you can hear them .
“ Butter , please .
Butter , please .
Butter .
Butter .
Butter . ”
You ’d better go do what they say .
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone !
And for Christmas …PIES will be first on the list , I promise .
Nesting
There is some evidence of communal nesting by Bushtits , but it is limited to southeastern Arizona .
Helpers at the nest are usually adult males .
During nesting season , flocks break up , and pairs establish loose territories , although they appear to tolerate other Bushtits within their territories .
Both members of the pair help build the nest .
The nest is an impressive , woven , hanging basket with a hole high up on the side of the nest and a passageway to the nest chamber at the bottom .
It can be up to a foot long , and is generally built of spider webs , moss , lichen , and other plant material .
Inside , the nest is lined with plant down , fur , and feathers .
If the pair is disturbed during the early stages of nest - building , they will abandon the nest and find a new location , sometimes finding a new mate as well .
Both parents incubate the 4 - 10 eggs for 12 - 13 days , sometimes at the same time .
Both brood the young and bring them food until shortly after they leave the nest at about 18 days .
They generally raise two broods a year .
Brick - breaking games have been around since the beginning of videogames .
The most notable efforts in the genre include the original , simple Breakout and then Arkanoid , which added power - ups and a loose story line .
It took more than 20 years , but the next revolution in the genre has arrived .
Shatter might be the best brick - breaking game ever made .
It takes the original premise of using a paddle to knock a ball against brick walls and runs with it into brave new territory .
Players can now use force to push and pull the ball , giving them a greater ability to manipulate the playing field .
Levels are no longer restricted to the square presentation with your paddle at the bottom of the screen -- Shatter turns the game on its side and introduces circular levels .
Add in beautiful visuals and sound and you 've got one of the most impressive PlayStation Network games of the year .
You , the paddle , are a slave to the machine overlords , until one day you break free from your confines and must battle your way back home .
There are ten worlds to journey through , each guarded by a large , robotic dominator ( some of which provide quite the challenge ) .
A stage is cleared when all bricks are shattered -- and there are a handful of ways Shatter has improved on that formula .
Typically , with these games , nailing that last block can be quite irritating , as getting your ball to go where you want it to is n't very easy .
Here , the ability to push and pull ( or blow and suck , if you like ) gives you much more control over the ball .
Watch the Video Review for Shatter .
Even more useful for hitting a lone straggler : your balls act as your lives ( or chances ) and can be dispensed at any time .
At the start of a game you have three balls and you can throw them all into play if you like .
The moment when you launch a ball is when you have the greatest control over its trajectory , meaning you can almost always hit the final brick if you have at least one extra ball .
Levels are inventive and are always throwing new ideas at the player .
At the beginning of the game , bricks will patiently wait to be shattered , but variations are slowly added to the mix .
Some float freely in gravity and will encroach on your personal space -- if you 're hit by a brick you 'll be knocked out of play for a moment and may miss your volley .
Shattered bricks release shards that can be collected and spent on either a shield or a devastating " shard storm " laser attack .
Players are constantly posed with the conundrum of what to spend those valuable shards on .
They can be sucked in with your pull technique , but loose bricks may also come crashing towards you and your ball will be bent with the pull of gravity .
There 's a lot to consider in this game .
Shatter is a bit limited in that , once the story is completed , there is n't a whole lot to return to .
You 'll unlock a boss rush mode and can play a bonus game where you try to keep three balls in play for as long as possible , but that 's about it .
Some sort of multiplayer made would have been nice .
But , this is an arcade game and there 's always that high score to shoot for and leaderboard glory .
Accompanying you on your journey is some of the best videogame electronica I 've heard in a long time .
Composer Jeremiah
Ross did a great job creating energetic , catchy techno that perfectly suits the game 's robotic aesthetic .
Trophy hunters will be happy to hear that Shatter offers many easy medals .
Beating each of the worlds results in a bronze and completing story mode wins you a silver .
My love for mangosteens or มังคุ ด Mang Kut ( the first syllable rhymes with “ young ” and the second with “ put ” ) is legendary .
There ’s even a picture of me as a toddler sitting next to a gigantic pile of empty mangosteen shells with curious purple stains around my lips .
With an innocent face , I stare blankly at the camera as if to say — I have no idea who ate these .
Informally dubbed “ the queen of fruits , ” taking a second place only to durian , the reigning monarch of the fruit kingdom , mangosteens have proven themselves worthy of the royal title .
The flesh boasts a variety of textures : crunchy in some places , firm in some places , but mostly soft and creamy .
The flavor is a combination of sweet and a tinge of tartness .
I was recently asked on Twitter to describe the taste and texture of a mangosteen and I struggled greatly before arriving at what I thought wasa pretty lame answer , though I could n’t come up with anything better .
The truth is there ’s nothing like Mang Kuts .
Sadly , fresh mangosteens are n’t always readily available in the US .
They usually come frozen or canned ( shudder ) in most Asian grocery stores .
Otherwise , mangosteens are marketed in juice form as one of the tropical super - fruits .
I have sometimes seen fresh mangosteens at a local Vietnamese market , but there ’s something about those fresh mangosteens being capless and bald that has always stopped me from buying them .
They may actually taste fine , but they look a bit scary to me .
Just moments after landing in Bangkok , I dashed to the nearest green grocer and brought home a big bag of fresh mangosteens .
Although it may seem like I lacked the patience to wait until I at least unpacked and put on some fresh clothes , the truth is — I was doing this for all of you .
Someone needed to take on the responsibility of cracking open these purple beauties so a blog post could be written about them .
I am not a glutton ; I am a responsible food blogger .
The anatomy of mangosteens is quite interesting .
Each one is about the size of a tangerine .
They come with four greenish caps at the top .
Turn them upside down and you will see the brown raised ridges that look like flowers .
The number of the “ petals ” corresponds with the number of sections in each mangosteen .
In other words , you know how many sections are inside a mangosteen just by looking at its bottom .
The question you may have is — does it matter how many aril sections there are in a mangosteen ?
Yes and no .
In general , the bigger the section , the bigger the seed underneath the aril .
Large seeds need to be spit out and that causes a mild inconvenience .
Smaller sections contain no seeds at all or very tiny ones that can be eaten whole .
A larger number of sections , therefore , means each section is often smaller in size .
This means more edible flesh and fewer seeds to spit out .
But , to be quite honest , in a grand scheme of things , this does n’t really matter all that much .
Good mangosteens sport healthy - looking green caps and a nice glossy sheen on their outer skins .
They should be firm and have no cracks with juices oozing out or bugs under the caps .
Steer clear of ones that have hardened beads of yellow resin on the outer rinds as those often contain sections that have suffered from resin seepage .
The yellow sections in the picture above are very bitter .
Good mangosteens have aril sections that are opaque white , firm , and not translucent or yellowish .
To cut open a mangosteen , with a sharp paring knife , make a 1/4 - to 1/3 - inch deep horizontal cut around the middle and twist off one half of the shell , exposing the white , creamy flesh .
( Knifeless ?
Fret not .
Hold the mangosteen between your palms and squeeze your hands together to crush open the purple shells .
Once the shells are cracked , you can easily peel them off .
It ’s a bit more messy and sometimes results in the sections getting crushed along with the shells , but hey …)
Mangosteens are often served half exposed to allow people to pick out the flesh with a small fork .
See the sections inside this one ?
The two larger sections contain hard and bitter seeds that need to be spit out ; the other five sections can be eaten whole .
Two large sections out of seven are n’t too bad , though better mangosteens contain all smaller sections with but one large seed or none at all .
Mangosteens are generally eaten raw and unadorned .
But some people juice them , shell and all .
Some make ice creams , sorbets , and fruit salads with them .
Some turn them into savory dishes — an idea I ’m interested in exploring further .
We are blind to what is truly going on in the world , it is an unexplained mystery .
After all that has happened in the last decade , how will politicians , religious leaders and financial institutions ever to regain our trust ?
The answer is simple , they do n't have to .
From the point of view of the masses , after the propaganda machine went on , they never lost our trust .
We are blissfully unaware of what truly happened since we only read and watch the mass media .
None of them lied to us , none of them worked for their own interests , all is well in the best world there is , and salvation is just around the corner .
Trust me , I know what to do , things will be much better afterwards .
Trust me , you do n't need to know anything about it .
Although this is all done in secret , I 'm working toward solving all humanity 's problems .
Here is the truth , or at least a distorted version of it .
Will we ever learn how bad things are ?
How close countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are to declare bankruptcy ?
I do n't think so .
We will learn about it when it happens , not even the day before .
As to how this was made possible , it is unlikely the general population will ever know .
After all , is it important that they should know ?
No one should be held accountable anyway , no one will at any rate .
So let 's just forget it , let 's just bury everything .
I think Madonna is trying to adopt another African baby .
If there is one thing every single kid learns early on , it is not to trust anyone .
We learn very quickly that this world is filled with deception , as if lying was second nature to everyone on this planet .
I 'm sure there are some religions out there preaching of always telling the truth , but as more religious leaders are caught lying and promoting hate against even the teachings of their own religion , you might wish to think twice before trusting anyone .
In politics it is as bad , that no politician could ever survive by telling the truth , no matter the justifications and how nicely it could be presented .
And about financial institutions , do I need to say more ?
Make a quick buck now , forget the consequences on the international financial markets in the long term , and suffer for an eternity afterwards .
Your parents will lie to you on a daily basis , most likely when you are young , so they can escape all sorts of traps and embarrassment .
Just look at how Madonna justified to her kid Lourdes that kiss to Britney Spears .
It was all about passing up energy .
Why not tell your children the truth ?
Mummy is not a lesbian darling , it was just a marketing stunt .
And it worked wonders , since it shocked the world .
My God , this world is so easily shocked .
The truth is , no one was shocked by that kiss , we all understood what it meant , more marketing gimmick .
Only a few journalists appeared to have been shocked by a kiss between two great pop stars .
Those journalists are not allowed to report real news , so they report how shock we are supposed to be by anything unimportant , whilst none of us are shocked by anything these days .
I wish we could all be shocked by what happened in the last decade , and maybe we are despite the appearances .
It is like at the height of the Russian propaganda machine , when those poor Russians were lied to by their government on a daily basis .
At least then , none of them believed it , none of them were fooled .
The government then did not try to hide the truth , they just expected you to hear the lies and shut up , or suffer the consequences .
In America it is quite different , as we will not believe that this is propaganda , we believe it is the truth .
I tested it many times at work with the lightest conspiracy theories you could find , the most believable ones as they are mostly all proven already , and everyone thought I was a lunatic .
Of course , George W. Bush was such a great President , perhaps the best we ever had .
And those religious leaders , what they are stating is so perfect for us , women need to go back to being home makers , serve their husbands and have babies , whilst gay people should be shot where they stand .
Teachers , managers , bosses , the prosecution and police officers in Court , none of them will tell you the truth straight , they will lie to safeguard themselves until it is proven that you are the one who 's been lying all along for most of your life .
Lying is definitely a law of human nature .
Even animals lie .
Apparently the more intelligent they are , the more likely they are to do so .
The less elaborate the language , the more they will use subterfuge instead , bluffing and deception .
It has to be said that these are instincts link to survival , to avoid punishment , embarrassment or losing everything .
So should it be forgiven that we are all liars and deceivers ?
It could very well explain why humans are today at the top of the food chain in the animal kingdom .
We are what we are .
At the very least we need to be made fully aware of it , so we can protect ourselves .
So many still think they live in such a perfect world where everyone is working so hard to make it all so much better for the rest of humanity .
I could puke just about now .
I have read enough on the independent news websites to be aware of what has really gone on this last decade , even this last year alone is quite something no one in their right mind could forgive .
Trust is not something to be taken lightly , as I find it almost unthinkable that you could trust anyone on this planet , perhaps you should not even trust yourself .
Is n't that a sad statement ?
That the truth needs to be hidden at any cost , at every level , and if truth needs be told , then many white lies here and there might make it more acceptable .
What is this thing we all have about lying ?
What is it that is so frightening about the truth ?
Some utopian world would first have to eliminate all lies from its ranks , so trust would not be such a hard concept to grasp and accept .
Unless of course we were already living in a corrupt world .
The saddest part about trust is when you reach the point where when reading a newspaper or watching the news on TV , you feel it is all false , that someone somewhere is manipulating everything and feed spoon you the most unconceivable things .
Whilst you are completely aware of it , worried that the rest of the population might buy it , even brainwash them , or at least condition them .
It works most of time .
It is crippling me at times , makes me wish I could find out the truth and shout it everywhere , expose it all so everyone will be aware of what everything is really about .
Please , please , please , at the very least stop reading that freely distributed Metro newspaper .
It is the first step to get out of your lethargic lifestyle , living unaware of what is truly going on in the world .
You should only accept and read news from independent sources , there are plenty all over the Internet freely downloadable to your mobile phone every morning .
Enough propaganda , stop the conditioning , get really informed about the real issues this world is dealing with .
Yet , better be aware that the source cannot be trusted , than be blind and gobble it all up .
For a long time I was naive enough to believe everything I heard , I trusted everyone and everything .
I was never however a weak mind .
I do not state any opinion which is not mine in the first place , neither should you .
I have seen that there is a tendency in society to simply adopt the opinions of everyone else as our own , and so from my point of view most of the population is simply weak minded , and this is how lies can be fed so easily and trust gained so quickly .
Most are just parrots repeating over and over again all that comes from some unknown and untrustworthy source .
You should think and make up your own mind .
I have been called paranoid several times , yet , paranoia serves me well .
It stops me from being mindless , from accepting for cash anything I am being told .
I feel this world would be a better one if everyone was just a bit more paranoid , or at the very least , aware that what they read and watch on TV might not be all the truth , and so they would not be so trusting and feel that all is right in the world .
There is a whole branch of psychology dealing with deceptions and how to detect them , I think it is not going far enough .
I believe they 're not reaching out at all , because we have not been prepared to detect lies , question everything that is being served to us , to stop for a second before trusting any bit of information reaching us .
What is the point of psychology if , in the end , it only serves psychologists trying to help problematic individuals on an individual basis , instead of collectively teaching us how to see the world as it really is globally ?
As soon as something becomes a science , that is it , it is closed to everyone else except the experts of that particular field .
So no one understands what public relations mean , whilst PR is all governments are about these days .
Well , I may have a small contribution to make , apart from stating that no one should trust so easily , or consider that everything is the truth until proven otherwise somehow .
You need to always have these questions at the back of your mind in all situations :
What is this person telling me ?
Why is this person telling me this ?
What does it really mean ?
What is at the back of his or her mind ?
What is the real source of that new information ?
What can I read between the lines ?
What is the real truth behind all this ?
Who profits from this ?
What are their real motivations and the interests at stake ?
Does it really benefit me , and if so , how ?
What do I lose compared with what I seem to be gaining ?
Finally , how should I respond to this ?
I believe these simple questions could get you a long way before you go on granting anyone a well deserved trust , as if you cannot find cracks after answering these questions , then that statement or information may be worth taking into account and accept , to a certain extent .
How could you go on with life without constantly re-assessing everything you are being told ?
You must be a lunatic indeed if you trust everyone implicitly without questioning the motivation of everyone around you , if you believe everything everyone tells you , including the media , the admitted government propaganda machine , and what else .
Trust should never be easily acquired or given .
If you can trust someone or a source of information once , never assume you can trust him , her or it twice .
And once you think you found the truth , dig deeper , there 's probably a second truth underneath the neatly prepared one .
Anyone who appears to be working for your wellbeing , your own interests , stop right there and ask yourself how probable it really is when we all know that most people only work for their own personal interests .
It is true for anyone with any kind of authority or power in this world , they care little for you , why should they ?
If you are honest , you certainly do n't care for them or anyone else yourself .
It is human nature .
You can only count on yourself for anything in this world .
If you believe everyone is up to get you , you are damn right , because everyone is up to get something out of you .
There is no such thing as a free lunch , and this expression has never been so true .
And if you cannot even trust yourself , where does this leave you then ?
In a pitiful state indeed .
It is not easy , but if you learn to observe more carefully and ask yourself the right questions , you might trust a bit less quickly and learn to read what is behind it all , what are the true motivations of everyone else around you .
And then you will be a little bit less taken advantage of without being aware of it .
And then perhaps you can start taking advantage of the people who take advantage of you and who are trying to deceive you on a daily basis .
You will then never read a newspaper or watch the news the same way again .
You will learn how to read the truth , you will learn to read between the lines .
Just research a bit further , search engines are but one click away .
It may seem like a pessimistic view of the world , nevertheless I believe it is a true account of what this world has become .
Too many people are being controlled by others in this world , too many people give much more than they receive in return , too many people are too easily manipulated into believing and doing anything others want them to believe and do .
Do n't be a victim , start second - guessing everything , and in the process make it harder for anyone to gain your trust .
No one is even aware the propaganda machine is on , we have to turn it off .

“ Without irony , this life would hardly be worth living . ” Roland Michel Tremblay http://www.themarginal.com/destructivism.pdf
With the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing just two days away , NASA on Friday released the sharpest images ever taken of astronaut work sites on the moon , showing hardware and soil disturbances left behind by the 12 Americans who visited the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 .
The images , taken over the last few weeks by cameras aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , include some of the 10 - foot - tall landing structure called the descent stage .
It was left behind when the astronauts returned home and is seen casting long shadows over the pale surface of the moon .
“ It ’s fantastic to see the hardware sitting on the surface , waiting for us to come back again , ” Mark Robinson , chief of the camera science team , said in a news briefing in Washington , D.C .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched June 18 on a mission to map the lunar surface in preparation for the planned return of astronauts to the moon in 2020 .
It carries instruments designed to search for ice deposits in sunless canyons and crevices ; those deposits could be a source of water and rocket fuel for future moon colonists .

The cameras started clicking away in the last few weeks , as the spacecraft settled into an orbit that brought it as close to the surface as 18 miles .
Over the years , Japan , China and India have all sent probes to the moon that have focused on the old Apollo sites .
But the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ’s images of the hardware left behind are the sharpest yet , NASA said , resolving features as small as 3 feet wide .
The reconnaissance orbiter took pictures of five of the six landing sites , missing only that of Apollo 12 , which launched on Nov. 14 , 1969 .
Some of the best images are of the Apollo 14 landing site , where a set of scientific instruments can be seen , along with marks in the topsoil , known as regolith , left by the astronauts walking around in their spacesuits .
The pictures also show the tracks of the tool cart the astronauts towed behind them , Robinson said .
Apollo 14 launched on Jan. 31 , 1971 .
As impressed as they were by the images , NASA officials said they expect better quality after the orbiter finishes commissioning its instruments , a process similar to tuning a new musical instrument to get the best sound .
Images of the Apollo 11 landing site , for one , are expected to be twice as good in the future , officials said .

Referring to conspiracy buffs who question whether the moon landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin really occurred , one reporter asked if the images show the American flag planted by the astronauts .
Robinson said that would be difficult to resolve from space .
“ If it ’s standing , it would be very , very narrow , ” he said .
“ We might be able to see its shadow at some point . ”
But he said he believed the flag was knocked over by the exhaust from the Apollo 11 lunar module ’s ascent engine as Armstrong and Aldrin lifted off for the trip home .
The mission ended on July 24 , 1969 , when the module carrying Armstrong , Aldrin and Michael Collins parachuted into the Pacific Ocean .
Aside from the curiosity value connected with the images , NASA said the pictures could be important to future moon colonists .
Changes in the surface , in the form of new cratering , would help scientists understand how often a particular region on the moon is hit by rocks from space .
That information would be important in designing habitats .

( CNN ) -- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan , causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind .
A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura 's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005 .
Sounds like a great sci - fi flick .
But it 's not .
It 's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen .
The massive sea creatures , called Nomura 's jellyfish , can grow 6 feet ( 1.83 meters ) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds ( 204 kilos ) .
Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters .
For the third year since 2005 , ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan .
Monty Graham , a marine biologist at Alabama 's Dauphin Island Sea Lab , said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents .
He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward , they get caught in fishermen 's nets .
The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world .
But Nomura 's stands out because of its enormous size .
" The sheer size of them , individually , makes them fairly spectacular , " Graham said .
Spectacular , perhaps , to scientists , but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past .
They had giant - jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007 , and because they 've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan , they 're bracing for another , potentially harmful wave this summer .
The jellyfish destroy fishermen 's nets , getting trapped in them , tearing holes and ruining catches .
Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers .
When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them , the result is devastating .
" Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets , " Graham said .
" When these nets get wiped out , it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community . "
The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen .
While they still risk losing a big catch , they can , at least , save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish .
It 's not clear why waves of Nomura 's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years .
Some have speculated that overfishing , pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura 's jellyfish in the polyp stage .
However , no one is certain , Graham said .

His family support Lord Hutton 's conclusion and have said they do not want the inquest to be re-opened .
However a team of doctors unconvinced by the findings of the Hutton Report has compiled a dossier which claims that a cut to the ulnar artery in Dr Kelly 's wrist could not have killed him .
" Halloween II " may not have won the box office this weekend , but Weinstein Co. is taking a lesson from the movie that did as it prepares a sequel for next summer .
The independent studio's co-Chairman Bob Weinstein said today that the 3 - D sequel , titled , appropriately enough , " Halloween 3D , " is in development .
The investment it takes to shoot movies in digital 3 - D has proved particularly lucrative for horror films .
For " The Final Destination , " this weekend 's No. 1 movie , theaters with at least one 3 - D screen earned 3.25 times as much as those that showed the movie in 2 - D only , according to distributor Warner Bros .
That 's substantially higher than for other recent releases .
The equivalent 3 - D multiple for last month 's " G - Force , " for instance , was only 1.7 on its first weekend .
For July 's " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " it was 1.4 andm for June 's " Up " it was 2.2 .
January horror flick " My Bloody Valentine " earned 6.4 times as much from 3 - D theaters as it did from 2 - D on its opening weekend .
Weinstein said Rob Zombie , who directed " Halloween II " and 2007 's reboot of the 31 - year - old horror series , wo n't return for " Halloween 3 - D . "
He said the studio is in negotiations with a new director , whom he declined to name , who has experience in horror and has a " different take " on the franchise .

Having children is the surest way to send your carbon footprint soaring , according to a new study from statisticians at Oregon State University .
The study found that having a child has an impact that far outweighs that of other energy - saving behaviors .
Take , for example , a hypothetical American woman who switches to a more fuel - efficient car , drives less , recycles , installs more efficient light bulbs , and replaces her refrigerator and windows with energy - saving models .
If she had two children , the researchers found , her carbon legacy would eventually rise to nearly 40 times what she had saved by those actions .
“ Clearly , the potential savings from reduced reproduction are huge compared to the savings that can be achieved by changes in lifestyle , ” the report states .
The impact of children varies dramatically depending on geography :
An American woman who has a baby will generate nearly seven times the carbon footprint of that of a Chinese woman who has a child , the study found .
The calculations take account of the fact that each child is , in turn , likely to have more children .
And because the calculations derive from the fertility rate — the expected number of children per woman in various countries — the findings focus on women , although clearly men participate in the decision to have children .
“ In discussions about climate change , we tend to focus on the carbon emissions of an individual over his or her lifetime , ” said Paul Murtaugh , a professor of statistics at O.S.U. , in a statement accompanying the study ’s release .
“ Those are important issues and it ’s essential that they should be considered .
But an added challenge facing us is continuing population growth and increasing global consumption of resources . ”
The full report is published in the February 2009 edition of the journal Global Environmental Change : Human and Policy Dimensions .
In the 360 blog ( sub - heading , “ 12 tables , 24 chairs , and plenty of chalk ” ) , blogger Ξ ( Xi ) recently wrote about “ Ethiopian Multiplication ” ( and followed it up with a series of interesting posts on different ways to multiply , here , here , here , and here , so far ) .
Here ’s the “ Ethiopian ” version , as Xi tells it :
Here ’s the basic idea : Suppose you want to multiply two numbers like 14 and 12 .
You could use your fingers , of course , but here ’s another way : Start with the two numbers on top .
Halve one , ignoring any remainders or fractions , and double the other , stopping when you get to 1 .
14&12
7&24
3 & 48 [ See how I ignored the fact that halving 7 leaves 1 left over ? ]
1 & 96 <— Stop here .
Now look at the numbers on the right .
Some are across from an even number : in this case , 12 is across from the original 14 .
Ignore those , and add the rest .
So we ’ll add 24 , 48 , and 96 , which were across from odd numbers , and get 168 .
And that ’s the product !
Is n’t that cool ?
0 14 12 ( 12 × 20 ) 1 7 24 ( 12 × 21 ) 1 3 48 ( 12 × 22 ) 1 1 96 ( 12 × 23 )
It ’s cool , because it ’s binary ... but it ’s not at all surprising that it works .
Look at what we ’ve really done :
In the left column , we ’ve represented the multiplier ( 14 , here ) in binary , where even numbers represent 0 and odds represent 1 .
In the right column , we ’ve multiplied the multiplicand ( 12 , here ) by the corresponding powers of 2 .
Thus :
By “ ignoring ” the numbers on the right that match even numbers on the left , we ’re omitting the entries that correspond to a binary zero .
Think about how we learn to do long multiplication in school .
If we multiply 12 by 14 using that method , it looks like this :
1 2
1 4
------
4 8 ( 12 * 4 * 100 )
1 2 ( 12 * 1 * 101 )
------
1 6 8
We use the visual left - shift on the second line of the answer to represent multiplication by another 10 ( the shifted “ 12 ” really means “ 120 ” ) .
And that ’s exactly what the Ethiopians were doing , except instead of doing it in decimal ( powers of ten ) , they were doing it in binary ( powers of 2 ) :
1 1 0 0 ( binary representation of 12 )
1 1 1 0 ( binary representation of 14 )
--------
0 0 0 0 ( 12 * 0 * 20 )
1 1 0 0 ( 12 * 1 * 21 )
1 1 0 0 ( 12 * 1 * 22 )
1 1 0 0 ( 12 * 1 * 23 )
---------------
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 ( binary representation of 168 )
Now , why the Ethiopians did their multiplication in binary is n’t clear , but one can surmise that it ’s easier to learn to double and halve arbitrary numbers than it is to learn the units multiplication table ( quick ! :
What ’s 8 times 7 ? ) .
But here ’s the thing : now that we ’re using digital computers , we can readily see that this is essentially how computers do multiplication internally .
Basic logic circuits to take binary numbers and add them or shift them are easy , and that ’s really all this has : a one - bit shift to the left doubles , while a one - bit shift to the right halves , and then we add things up at the end ( or , really , as we go ) .
So to look at the algorithm a computer would use , let ’s assume we have a computer with at least three “ registers ” , and a “ condition ” indicator that ’s set if we shift a “ 1 ” bit off the end of a register .
01 Load first number into R1
02 Load second number into R2
03 Set R3 to zero
04 Shift R1 right one bit
05 If condition is not set , jump to 07
06 Add R2 into R3
07 If R1 is zero , jump to 10
08 Shift R2 left one bit
09 Jump to 04
10 Store R3 as answer
If we ’re robust about it , we ’ll also check for an overflow after step 06 ( the answer is too large for our registers ) , but that ’s basically it .
It ’s a simple , fast method , requiring the simplest computer hardware instructions .
To see how it works with the 14 * 12 example , we ’ll run through it :
Instruction R1 R2 R3 cond 01 Load first number into R1 14 02 Load second number into R2 14 12 03 Set R3 to zero 14 12 0 04 Shift R1 right one bit 7 12 0 no 05
If condition is not set , jump to 07 no ( jump ) 07 If R1 is zero , jump to 10 ( no jump ) 08 Shift R2 left one bit 7 24 0 no 09 Jump to 04 04 Shift R1 right one bit 3 24 0 yes 05 If condition is not set , jump to 07 yes ( no jump ) 06 Add R2 into R3 3 24 24 07
If R1 is zero , jump to 10 ( no jump ) 08 Shift R2 left one bit 3 48 24 09 Jump to 04 04 Shift R1 right one bit 1 48 24 yes 05 If condition is not set , jump to 07 yes ( no jump ) 06 Add R2 into R3 1 48 72 07
If R1 is zero , jump to 10 ( no jump ) 08 Shift R2 left one bit 1 96 72 09 Jump to 04 04 Shift R1 right one bit 0 96 72 yes 05 If condition is not set , jump to 07 yes ( no jump ) 06 Add R2 into R3 0 96 168 07
If R1 is zero , jump to 10 ( jump ) 10 Store R3 as answer 0 96 168
The interesting thing is that if you ask beginning computer students to write a low - level program for multiplication , most of them will use the old lesson that “ multiplication is repeated addition ” , and do something like this :
01 Load first number into R1
02 Load second number into R2
03 Set R3 to zero
04 If R1 is zero , jump to 08
05 Add R2 into R3
06 Decrement R1
07 Jump to 04
08 Store R3 as answer
The program is two steps shorter ... but it will take much longer to run , because the loop is dependent on the value of the number , rather than on the number of bits ( that is , the problem is now order n , as opposed to order log ( n ) ) .
Your refrigerator / freezer combo is the biggest energy consumer among all of your appliances – seriously .
It gobbles down around $ 100 in energy each year .
Even worse , it ’s often home to lots of wasted food – leftovers forgotten and allowed to spoil and so on .
To put it simply , your refrigerator and freezer are money sinks .
They ’re expensive in the first place , gobble down energy like there ’s no tomorrow , and sometimes ruin the food that ’s inside .
What ’s a thrifty person to do ?
Here are a few simple techniques to overcome and reduce these costs with surprisingly little effort .
Clean the coils regularly .
The coils on the bottom and the back of your refrigerator tend to gather dust over time .
As that dust builds up , your refrigerator does n’t run as well as it used to .
The condenser kicks on more often , it has to work harder , it eats up more energy ( costing you ) , and it wears out quicker ( costing you ) .
So , do a little bit of maintenance once a year or so .
Pull out your refrigerator and dust the coils in the back and underneath the device .
Use a low - power vacuum to make sure there ’s no excess dust floating around in the place where the refrigerator normally sits .
Doing this little thing will cause your refrigerator ’s condenser to work more efficiently – it wo n’t kick on as often ( trimming your energy bill ) and it wo n’t wear out as quickly ( saving on your repair and replacement costs ) .
Fill your empty milk or juice jugs with water , then stick ’em in the freezer .
A freezer , whether it ’s a deep freezer or a freezer housed in the same appliance as a refrigerator , functions best when it ’s really full , as the cold items help keep other items cold and maintain the low temperature .
But how can you keep it full without stocking it with a bunch of food that you may or may not eat ?
If you ’re not into filling your freezer with food , fill it with water .
It ’s simple .
Take an empty milk jug ( or juice jug ) , rinse it out , then fill it about 75 % full with tap water .
Stick that jug in the freezer and just leave it there .
It ’ll freeze , then it will help keep the temperature of your freezer low over the long haul , causing your freezer to kick on a bit less often to keep your items cool .
Even better , you can directly use these jugs when you need a lot of ice .
You can either stick the jug entirely in a cooler or smash it open and use the broken ice pieces to your desire .
Works like a charm – we do it all the time !
Start a miscellaneous vegetables box .
We cook a side dish of vegetables with almost every meal we make , and we often have just a few spoonfuls of leftovers .
Often , these wind up in the compost bin , but that ’s not particularly efficient – I ’d rather throw actual waste in the compost bin , not food .
Our solution is a clever one .
We just stuck a small resealable container in the freezer .
Whenever we have any sort of leftover vegetables , we just spoon those veggies into that container .
When the container is full , we boil up some water , add some spices , toss in some diced chicken breasts ( and some stock if we ’ve got it ) , then add the vegetables and let it all boil together .
Boom – really inexpensive ( and delicious ) chicken soup that ’s different every time you make it .
You can thicken the water / broth with a bit of corn starch to make it more like a stew if you want .
This is a killer way to not waste leftover vegetables , add volume to your freezer , and produce a very delicious and simple meal for pennies .
Pull the fridge forward an inch or two .
In many kitchens , refrigerators are pushed back as close to the wall as possible in order to eke out a few more inches of floor space .
Those few inches are really expensive .
If your refrigerator is pushed back as far as possible , pulling it forward one inch can reduce the energy usage of the refrigerator by as much as 40 % , and you ’ll barely notice the difference in your floor usage .
Subsequent inches help , but are n’t quite that effective .
Stick a thermometer in your fridge .
Ideally , the temperature in your refrigerator holds pretty steady around 37 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit ( 3 - 5 C ) .
We keep ours at almost exactly 38 , and it ’s almost perfect for us .
If you keep it below 37 degrees , you ’re pushing up against the freezing point of water , which can affect food quality and burns a lot of extra energy .
If you keep it above 40 degrees , it can affect food quality in a different way , leading towards spoilage .
The range between the two is optimal – and it ’s also optimal for refrigerator efficiency , since devices are designed to run in this range .
How can you be sure you ’re hitting that sweet spot ?
Get out a thermometer , put it in a glass of water , then put that cup in your refrigerator for 24 hours .
Check the temperature afterward – that ’s the true temperature of your fridge .
Adjust upward and downward as needed – you might be surprised how much your temperature is off .
A freezer has a different optimum temperature – 0 to 5 F ( - 18 to - 15 C ) .
You can get this temperature by putting your thermometer between two frozen items for 24 hours .
Chuck your refrigerated leftovers .
Ah , the refrigerated leftover .
Inevitably , some of those items wind up getting pushed to the back and forgotten , left there to slowly decompose , become a potential breeding place for yeasts and molds , and potentially contaminate other foods .
So chuck ’em .
One easy way to do this is to have a handful of washable markers near your fridge .
Doodle on any new item with a color for each day – say , purple for Monday , red for Tuesday , etc .
Then , when you ’re glancing in the fridge on Sunday , you know you can chuck anything with a red or purple mark on it without thinking at all .
Just mark on the Saran wrap , aluminum foil – even on the rim of a plate .
Once you get into the routine , it works really well , makes leftover cleanup really easy , and keeps nasty things from growing in your fridge .
Go hardcore – build your own and reduce energy consumption by 90 % .
Willing to go way outside the box to trim your home energy consumption ?
You can build your own chest refrigerator with a few simple modifications to a chest freezer and cut your energy use by about 90 % over a typical standup fridge .
With clever rack systems in the chest fridge , they can be pretty convenient .
I ’m tall , so I actually quite like chest freezers , as I have no problem reaching clear to the bottom , but I can see how this might not be easy for some .
I ’ll admit it – I ’d love to have such a fridge if I had adequate kitchen space .
Do you have any simple refrigerator or freezer hacks for saving energy or reducing food loss ?
Stop the presses .
There ’s been another newspaper - blog dustup .
On Thursday , July 9 , Washington Post reporter Ian Shapira wrote a feature story about Anne Loehr , a “ generational guru ” who advises companies and organizations about to deal with Generation Y .
That same day , Gawker writer Hamilton Nolan excerpted several of Loehr ’s quotes from Shapira ’s story — for the purpose of mocking Loehr ( “ Generational Consultant ’ Holds America ’s Fakest Job ” ) — and linked back to Shapira ’s article .
So far , so normal in today ’s world .
Yesterday , however , Shapira took to the Post opinion pages to deliver a cri de coeur entitled “ The Death of Journalism ( Gawker Edition ) . ”
A few weeks ago , I scored what passes these days for one of journalism ’s biggest coups , satisfying a holy writ for newspaper impact in the Internet age .
Gawker , the snarky New York culture and media Web site , had just blogged about my story in that day ’s Washington Post .
. . .
But when I told my editor , he wrote back :
They stole your story .
Where ’s your outrage , man ?
His consciousness has been raised .
Now the more Shapira contemplated the Gawker item , he writes , “ the angrier I got , and the more disenchanted I became with the journalism business . ”
I enjoy reading Gawker and the growing number of news sites like it — the Huffington Post , the Daily Beast and others — but lately they ’re making me even more nervous about my precarious career as a newspaper reporter who enjoys , at least for the time being , a salary , a 401 ( k ) and health insurance .
I started thinking about all the labor that went into producing my 1,500 - word article .
The story was n’t Pulitzer material ; it was just a reported look at one person capitalizing on angst in the workplace .
With all the pontificating about the future of newspapers both in the media and in Capitol Hill hearings , I began wondering if most readers know exactly what is required to assemble a feature story for a publication such as The Post .
Journalism at a major newspaper is different from what ’s usually required in the wild and riffy world of the Internet .
And that wild world is killing real reporting — the kind of work practiced not just by newspapers but by nonprofits , some blogs and other news outlets .
. . .
After all the reporting , it took me about a day to write the 1,500 - word piece .
How long did it take Gawker to rewrite and republish it , cherry - pick the funniest quotes , sell ads against it and ultimately reap 9,500 ( and counting ) page views ?
Shapira ’s essay instantly became fodder for the Sunday morning crowd on Twitter .
Media critic Rachel Sklar : “ Did Gawker Rip Off The Washington Post ? Yep . ”
No , said web evangelist Jeff Jarvis .
This is just another instance of newspapers not understanding the new “ link economy . ”
Tim O’Brien , who edits The Times ’s Sunday business section , was not buying Jarvis ’s frame : “ Giving people gifts involves an exchange of value but it ’s not an ‘ economy ’ .
Reboot the terms of the debate . ”
Jim Brady , a former editor of WashingtonPost.com : “ So , a few thousand people encountered something you wrote who might not have otherwise ?
Great ! ”
Nick Denton , Gawker founder and owner : “ Shapira ’s piece on the appropriation of his work by Gawker was eminently reasonable .
Fanatical bloggers should chill . ”
Media critic Jay Rosen : “ To me , the Gawker free riding story is compelling because it treats the conflict between old media and new as ambivalence within Ian Shapira . ”
As the day passed , the controversy moved from Twitter to blogs .
At Columbia Journalism Review , Megan Garber picked up on the same themes that that had interested Rosen : “ Shapira ’s essay . . . is a Socratic dialogue - unto - itself , a conversation engaged in by two characters of the same name : Ian Shapira the Washington Post writer , and Ian Shapira the Washington Post staffer . ”
Shapira - the - writer is , he notes , initially thrilled with the Gawker pickup .
“ I confess to feeling a bit triumphant , ” he notes .
. . .
But Shapira - the - Washington Post - staffer … not so thrilled .
Shapira - the - staffer cares — or , more accurately , is made to care — about the bottom line .
( “ They stole your story , ” Shapira ’s editor tells him , igniting indignation .
“ Where ’s your outrage , man ? ” )
He wants recognition , but not merely through the vagueness of attribution or the imprecise compensation of credit - via - link .
He wants monetized attribution — attribution that will help , in turn , pay his salary and contribute to his 410k .
He wants to be remunerated for the troubles he ’s gone to to create the story in question .
So : he nitpicks .
He nickels - and - dimes .
He measures his worth as much by the hours he ’s spent working as by the result of those hours .
He defines his impact not by the fuzzy metric of “ attention , ” or even by the slightly - less - fuzzy metric of the links his piece has garnered , but by the revenue that comes from those online reverberations .
Or , you know , the lack thereof .
In her column at Mediaite , Rachel Sklar expanded on her Twitter assessment : “ The blogosphere has done something weird to the media industry : Now , the imprimatur of having contributed something is not the original byline , but whether your piece was ‘ picked up . ’ ”
Pickup provides that extra stamp of relevance , that what you did is worthy of inclusion by the all - important aggregators — the outlets which determine the days need - to - know stories , so busy people with no time to read any of it will at least know what ’s up .
Yes , yes , congratulations on getting your little article published in a top national newspaper — but a Drudge / Romenesko / HuffPo / Gawker link ?
Awesome !
It ’s not just about traffic , it ’s about affirmation :
You ’re on to something .
You ’re relevant .
But while affirmation is nice , attribution is nicer .
The issue of attribution is in play here , because Nolan did not explicitly mention Shapira or his article , but did link to the latter , three times in all .
For Sklar , that ’s not enough .
These things are not cut - and - dried .
If the Gawker item had credited Shapira by name up top , and praised his reporting at the bottom , it still would have been 8 paragraphs worth of summarizing his work .
. . .
Fair
Use rules take into account how much of the work was used , whether it was added to / improved / commented on , and whether the allegedly - infringing use affects the market for the original work .
There ’s no formula for this and , especially with respect to the latter , these are murky things to assess across platforms ( would anyone reading Gawker have clicked on this link from WaPo anyway ? ) .
And it ’s hardly fair to blame Gawker for a form that has become institutionalized across the blogosphere .
( Not to mention all those times that major newspapers picked up stories first broken by blogs without crediting ! )
But we ’re at a point where something ’s gotta give :
Where aggregators are surfing to new heights on the backs of content providers going broke paying for reporting ; where audiences are now so fragmented that distribution relies so much more on the grace of these aggregators ; where attribution and credit is becoming that much more important for personal brands , more important now that platforms at established publications grow more scarce and opportunities for paying work plummet .
At minimum , if something ’s gotta give , then let it be credit and links , considering what ’s being “ given ” from the other side .
Matthew Ingram is willing to concede Nolan should have been more forthcoming with the credit : “ I ’d be willing to agree that Gawker could have — and maybe even should have , in an ethical sense — mentioned Shapira and his story specifically . ”
Still , even absent that , Ingram is not buying the accusation of theft .
But there is no way in heck that a post with three links and an explicit reference to the source constitutes anything approaching a “ rip- off ” or the “ death of journalism . ”
How about the death of hyperbole , and the rebirth of rational debate about the value of linking and traffic , and / or the ethics of sourcing online ?
That would be nice .
At the Book Over , Hugh McGuire sees the controversy not as one of fair use or link etiquette , but something else entirely : “ The problem is measuring the value of content . ”
Pre-web , written content was relatively scarce , and people wanted to read fluff .
So newspapers paid writers to write lots of fluff , which filled a demand for a valuable commodity .
The fluff was used that to sell newspapers & ads , and subsidize hard news .
But in the world of the web , we are swimming in a sea of written content .
Much of it fluff .
The overwhelming majority of it produced without a cent getting exchanged – by bloggers .
Some of it is produced by professional blog outfits like Gawker , who produce it much cheaper than a newspaper does .
So , when other people are providing for free some of the kinds of content you used to sell , then you ca n’t keep selling it .
And the “ free ” is on both ends : free for readers , and free from producers .
. . .
So . . . my question is : why would newspapers pay a staff writer to spend a full day investigating & writing a 1,500 word fluff piece when there are a million fluff pieces all over the web getting published every day ?
What value are they adding to the info marketplace , and is that value worth the money / time they ’ve spent on it ?
Shapira ’s essay also drew a response today from Gabriel Snyder , Gawker ’s editor - in - chief , who readily agreed with the charge that “ blogs are killing newspapers , ” though not in the way you might think .
It ’s not by mindlessly cutting and pasting from newspaper web sites .
Gawker would go out of business if we did that all day .
The bigger threat is that blogs say the things that hidebound newspaper editors are too afraid to let their reporters write .
Look at Shapira ’s article , says Snyder .
It ’s missing “ anything resembling a point of view . ”
And that ’s exactly what Nolan ’s Gawker post provided .
Hamilton succinctly digested Shapira ’s piece and gave his post a headline ( “ ‘ Generational Consultant ’ Holds America ’s Fakest Job ” ) and lede ( “ The fakest job corporate America ever created was ‘ Branding Consultant ’ — until now ” ) that was probably much closer to what Shapira wanted to write but could n’t .
It ’s hard to imagine that in the course of working on his piece — a process that Shapira describes as two hours of sitting in on one of Loehr ’s courses and what must have been four truly grueling hours of transcribing the session — that he did n’t have a chuckle or two at lines like , “ I want to touch 500,000 lives this year .
I am going to touch 500,000 lives this year .
I do have spreadsheets that mark how many people I am touching . ”
He suggests as much in his Outlook piece , complaining that Hamilton got to “ cherry - pick the funniest quotes . ” ( Emphasis mine . )
So why was n’t there an ounce of humor in the profile ?
Now confronted with existential threats , newspaper people rarely look at the failings of their own editorial product .
After all , it ’s tough to criticize something when you ’re also trying to argue it ’s worth saving .
. . .
Synder closed with a return to Sklar ’s topic — the need for affirmation .
In this instance , that of a certain DC daily .

Rubber Sidewalks Give the Bounce to Concrete
July 19th , 2009 by Tina Casey
[ social_buttons ]
Rubber sidewalks are all grown up .
Once perceived mainly as a safe surface for playgrounds , rubber sidewalks have developed into a means of preserving urban trees , reducing stormwater runoff , recycling tires , and curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
A company called Rubbersidewalks ( what else ? ) began installing the modular units in 2002 , and its rubber sidewalk products now appear in almost 100 cities across the country .
Even the U.S. military is getting into the act .
Plans are in the works to install rubber sidewalks at Coast Guard Island in Alameda , California , and they ’re being promoted by the Pollution Prevention Program at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland .
The Benefits of Rubber Sidewalks for Urban Trees
Rubbersidewalks ( the company , that is ) attributes its core concept to Richard Valeriano , a senior public works inspector for the City of Santa Monica .
The original idea behind a rubber sidewalk was to achieve a flexible surface that would reduce cracking around tree roots .
In turn , that would reduce the need to cut or drastically trim trees with overgrown roots .
Over the course of several years , city workers noticed that the rubber surface seemed to slow the growth of roots while providing the tree with sufficient water and oxygen , helping to mitigate the problem of root overgrowth at the source .
The modular installation system also enables workers to remove sections of sidewalk to inspect tree roots , without the need for pavement - breaking equipment that could damage a tree .
The Other Benefits of Rubber Sidewalks
Aside from the potential savings in reduced personal injury lawsuits , the modular rubber surface makes it easier to open and close sections of sidewalk for maintenance or utility work .
Seams in the modules enable stormwater to infiltrate into the soil instead of running into gutters .
They ’re handy to use for temporary sidewalks , and they ’re suitable for surfacing urban tree wells .
On the sustainability side , Rubbersidewalks ’s first - generation product was made from 100 % recycled tires .
It now offers a second incarnation called Terrewalks , which uses a mix of tires and waste plastic from farm irrigation equipment .
As a means of finding a use for the millions of tires disposed every year , rubber sidewalks promise a scale similar to that of recycled tire roof shingles — a big leap over smaller projects like tire shoes and toys .
Rubber Sidewalks and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Walking and biking instead of driving are often cited as effective ways to lower one ’s personal greenhouse emissions , but the equation skews when you factor in the greenhouse emissions involved in constructing more sidewalks and bike paths .
A good chunk of those emissions have to do with concrete surfaces .
Concrete is made from cement , which is a significant source of greenhouse gasses .
Worldwide , cement is estimated to account for about 5 % of all carbon dioxide emissions from human activity , with concrete accounting for about 8 % overall .
Though rubber surfaces do involve some greenhouse gas in the manufacturing process , there would seem to be a savings in emissions related to transportation , installation , maintenance , and urban street tree health .
If there is any way to have your cake and eat it too , a rubber sidewalk could be it .

The occult Bush family ' dossier '
When Saddam Hussein talked of ' the devil Bush ' he may not have been so far from the truth .
U.S. president George W. Bush , his father and grandfather are proven initiates of this multi-generational occult lodge .
George W. was tapped ( initiated ) in 1968 at the group 's Yale University HQ , a mausoleum known as ' the tomb ' .
When undergraduates broke in they found that the ' holy of holies ' inner sanctum has red velvet walls and carpet , with a large pentagram emblazoned on the wall .
[ see Kris Millegan and Anthony Sutton sites ]
Any serious researcher on this subject should get a copy of Kris Millegan ( ed. ) 's book - Fleshing Out Skull and Bones ... and read ' Proofs of a Conspiracy ' by John Robison
Adolf Hitler was obsessed with the occult , in his case the Thule Society , closely inter-connected with German Theosophists .
The jolly roger , skull and cross bones , " der Totenkopf " was an emblem worn by Hitler 's SS soldiers and was emblazoned on SS armoured cars and tanks ( see images on this page ) .
The SS was a religious cult of sworn Hitler / German ancestor worship .
If the Nazis ' occult lodges had been exposed then shut down , not treated as a taboo , millions of lives could have been saved .
A small price to pay for insane racism and the blood of millions of people .
The second world war need never have happened .
Unless you want the occult fuelling a totalitarian West's Third World War ' on terror ' and their ' New World Order ' - please - do your bit to expose George W. Bush , the bonesmen and other interconnected lodges round the world .

Chapter 7 - The Barbecue
...... As the journalist drove them through the streets of the city , Richard asked him : ' While doing your job .
have you ever come across any evidence that there are Satanist gatherings in Santiago ? '
The Scottish - educated Chilean laughed .
' Good gracious .
no , Mr Eaton .
As in every city there are a few old crones who are credited with practising witchcraft , but I 've never heard of their getting together to hold a Sabbat .
What with their radios , motor - cycles and self - service stores , most of the people who live in Santiago are much too modern - minded to believe in that sort of thing . '
' That applies to most other countries now , ' Richard replied .
But the fact remains that Satanism is still practised in them . '
' If you say so , Señor .
I will take your word for it .
But any educated person would now look on believing in the Devil as nonsense . '
' Of course they would if they think of the Devil as people did in the Middle Ages : a terrifying apparition with horns , hooves and a spiked tail .
But that was only a form his emissaries took as suitable to the beliefs of the period .
Now that people have so many things , other than religion .
to occupy their minds , they naturally give little thought to the powers of good and evil .
That is because they are not tuned in to such influences .
But it does not mean that the Devil no longer exists . '
To Richard 's surprise McTavish replied .
' If not by nation - ality , by heredity and education I 'm a down - to - earth Scot .
I can accept that the Devil is still stooging round tempting people with this an ' that in exchange for their immortal souls . '
' May I ask if you are a Christian ? '
' Aye , I 'm certainly that . '
' Then , if you believe in God , you cannot logically disbelieve in the Devi1 , because he was part of the original Creation .
What is more , when Lucifer was cast out of Heaven .
God gave him this world as his province .
That is made abundantly clear in the New Testament , in the passage where Satan took Jesus Christ up into a high place , showed him all the cities and the fertile valleys and said , " All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt bow down to me . "
He could n't have offered something that was n't his to give . '
' I suppose that is so . '
' It certainly is .
And it 's a great mistake to imagine that the Devil went out of business with the coming of the scientific age .
He simply went underground , and adapted his methods to modem conditions .
' One of his names is " Lord of Misrule " , and his object is to destroy all law and order among mankind .
What could do that more effectively than the creation of wars , in which countless thousands of people legally murder one another , and there follows widespread .
arson , pillage , rape and anarchy ?
In the present century , the Devil has brought about two world wars and a score of minor ones , by bemusing the minds of statesmen , and about the best interests of their peoples ; so it seems to me that he has surpassed himself . '
' Am I right , Señor , in thinking you have formed the idea that these parties given by Glasshill are some form of Sabbat ' ? '
Suddenly it struck Richard that , should that prove the case , it would be just as well to keep McTavish in ignorance of the fact .
Although Don Caesar had banned any account of what they found out being published , McTavish might , if the story had the making of a juicy scandal , sell it to a friend for publi-cation in another paper .
After a moment , he replied , ' It 's just possible ; but I doubt it .
Otherwise , surely you or one of your colleagues would have picked up some rumour about Satanic rites being practised in Santiago .'............
09Apr08 - Dennis Wheatley - New World Order is ' another name for hell '
Have you ever wondered what the origin of the phrase ' New World Order ' is ?
Earliest source I can find is from 1941 .
THis is the first time this quotation has ever been posted on the web .
I just checked .
Seems pretty clear to me , by New World Order '
Wheatley means the central objective of Nazi political control .
Which by no means died in 1944 .
Thankfully , though these C21 Nazi control freaks are convinced their diabolical plan is possible , they can and will never achieve it .
They may rather burn the world to the ground trying , and failing .
Closing paragraphs of
STRANGE CONFLICT by Dennis Wheatley
First published by Hutchinson , 1941
From Chapter XXII - THE GREAT GOD PAN
Spoken by Wheatley 's protagonist Monseigneur le Duc de Richleau , Knight of the Most Exalted Order of the Golden Fleece .
The Duc is addressing his friends Simon Aron , Marie Lou , Rex Van Ryn and Richard Eaton who he 's just helped rescue from a Nazi-Voodoo priest who has been remote viewing Britain 's vital Atlantic convoy routes :
" Whether or not Hitler and Mussolini themselves are great masters of Black Magic , nobody can possibly contest that it is through such ambitious and unscrupulous men , German , Italian and Japanese , that the Powers of Darkness are working and in recent years have acquired such a terrifying increase of strength upon our earth .
" The New World Order which they wish to bring about is but another name for Hell .
If through them Evil prevailed , every man and woman of every race and colour would finally be enslaved , from the cradle to the grave .
They would be brought up to worship might instead of right and would be taught to condone , or even praise , murder , torture and the suppression of all liberty as ' necessary ' to the welfare of ' the State ' .
" Incontestable proof of that has already been given us by the way in which the young Nazi-educated Germans have behaved in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Norway , Holland , Belgium and France .
They butchered old men , women and children who did not even seek to oppose them .
That was part of the Plan , and they obeyed the order to commit these murders in cold blood without a single recorded instance of any protest against them by officers or men .
Seven years of the Totalitarian poison has been enough for the Evil to grip five million German youths and with it their hearts have gone cold and stony .
If they triumph , within seventy years such words as justice , toleration , freedom and compassion will have ceased to have a place in the vocabularies of the races of mankind .
" In the New World Order all family life will be at an end , except for the conquerors , and only the worst elements , spiritually , will be allowed to procreate fresh generations to populate a world divided into masters and slaves .
The right to homes and children of their own would be reserved to the Overlords ; the rest would be herded into barracks and reduced to the level of robots without the right to read or speak or even think for themselves .
There could be no revolt , because every officer , priest , deputy , editor , magistrate , writer and other leader of free thought and action in the conquered countries would already have been executed by the firing - squads ; and leaderless herds cannot prevail against tanks , tear - gas , bombs and machine - guns .
" And unless men are free how can they progress upon the great spiritual journey which all must make ?
" This war is not for territory or gain or glory , but that Armageddon which was prophesied of old .
That is why all the Children of Light .
wherever they may be , captive or free , must hold on to their spiritual integrity as never before and must stick at nothing , physically , in the fight , lest the whole world fall under the domination of these puppets who are animated by the Powers of Darkness . "
As he ceased speaking they knew that although it would be many days before their burns , weals and wounds were healed there had come into their hearts a little glow of warmth .
The Battle was still far from being over , but they had done the thing which they had set out to do .
Their Victory was an episode¬ no more - in the Titanic struggle that was in progress , but the flame which animated their spirits was burning an the brighter for it , and they were returning to fight on for the England that they loved .
It seemed that the Duke guessed their thoughts , for he spoke again .
" As long as Britain stands the Powers of Darkness can not prevail .
On Earth the Anglo - Saxon race is the last Guardian of the Light , and I have an unshakable conviction that , come what may , our island will prove the Bulwark of the World . "
Let 's hope he is as right about 21st Century Britain as he was about 1940s Britain eh !?
01Dec06 - Skull and Bones lodge in Cambridge UK ?
from an anonymous Cambridge source
There is a Masonic Hall in Cambridge , on Bateman Street , on the corner of St. Eligius St.. Several lodges met at this hall including the ' University Lodge ' .
This means a lodge for members of the university .
The emblem of the University Lodge includes , or possibly even consists entirely of , something like a skull and cross bones .
I wonder whether other prestigious universities , such as Yale , also have masonic or secret societies with associations with skulls and bones ?
Nazi black magic and the anti-christ order

Nazi black magic and the anti-christ order
Heinrich Himmler , whose arrest as a traitor Hitler had ordered on 28 April 1945 for negotiating with the Allies , was captured by a British patrol on 23 May .
A few hours later he killed himself with cyanide , and , dying as Reichsführer - S.S. , set his final seal upon the destruction of the world 's most sinister order , which the Third Reich 's military defeat had already inflicted .
Hitler had sown seeds of the deepest hatred between Nazis and Communists in his teaching and in the cruelty and mass murder he had launched in Russia .
Now it was the turn of the Soviets .
Nazism reached its end in a Berlin turned into a battleground of unparalleled violence , fire and brutality as the Soviet forces dealt blows of destruc - tion and revenge .
It was as if the Satanic essence of Nazism shone through the flames and the ruins .
From 20 November 1945 to 1 October 1946 the Nuremberg International Tribunal tried 24 members of the Nazi hierarchy as war criminals , accusing them of crimes ' against Peace , War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity ...'
Von Papen , Schacht , and Hans Fritsche were acquitted .
Twelve were sentenced to death , Bormann in his absence .
Goering poisoned himself shortly before he was due to be executed .
Ribbentrop , Streicher , Keitel , Kaltenbrunner , Frank , Frick , Jodl , Rosenberg , Sauckel and Seyss - Inquart were hanged .
Von Schirach and Speer were sentenced to 20 years , von Neurath to 15 and Admiral Doenitz to 10 years .
Lesser lights , such as obscure S.S. murderers , were tried before the various Allied Military Tribunals .
Many Nazis thus paid with their lives for the misery and death they unleashed upon the world in seeking to clamp their creed of hatred and domination upon its peoples .
Can the mystery of the evil of Nazism be explained ?
Was there a Satanic nucleus at the heart of it ?
One inter-pretation of its nature that should be mentioned is the link between Nazism and the alleged attachment to black magic and occultism of Hitler and his inner circle , including Goering , Himmler , Goebbels , Ley and , in the early days , Dietrich Eckart and Professor Karl Haushofer .
Hitler , according to what may seem to many people a far - fetched belief , was the medium through whom contact was made with supernatural powers of evil .
Hermann Rauschning , who observed Hitler with a cold and analytical eye , declares that he was a medium , ' possessed by forces outside himself - almost demoniacal forces ' .
Rudolf Olden , political editor of the Berliner Tageblatt in the days of Nazism 's rise to power , remarked how the overwhelming , almost superhuman Niagara of words that poured forth during Hitler 's speeches sometimes reached a climax during which he literally ' spoke in tongues ' and seemed possessed .
André François - Poncet , French Ambassador to Berlin , also referred to this apparent demoniacal possession .
Hitler 's mediumistic powers supposedly provided the link with Satanic forces which spoke through him and led to the black magic and occult practices in the inner circle of Nazi leaders .
Insignia of Hitler 's SA in 1923
Rauschning also reports in ' Hitler Speaks ' a warning given to Hitler by a percipient woman in his circle , one of the few who dared to speak forthrightly to him .
' My Fuhrer , do not touch black magic , ' she said .
' As yet both white and black magic are open to you .
But once you have embarked upon black magic it will dominate your destiny .
It will hold you captive .
Do n't choose the quick and easy successes .
' There lies before you the power over a realm of pure spirits .
Do not allow yourself to be led away from your true path by earth - bound spirits which will rob you of creative power . '
Apparently Hitler disregarded the warning and was dominated by the evil forces , who , bribing him with early successes , forced him along the path of their own choosing towards an inferno which destroyed him , split Germany and impoverished Europe and Britain for two decades .
To believe this theory one must suspend rational judge - ment , but are there not in any case fields of human experi-ence which it cannot explain ?
And does not this theory of Hitler being dominated by evil supernatural forces throw light for the first time on the reason for Auschwitz , Treblinka , the deaths of six million Jews , the plan to murder 33 million of the Slav population of Russia , the readiness to sacrifice three or four million of Germany 's young man - hood in war and , finally , the long - term aim , reported by Fabian von Schlabendorff , for the total and permanent destruction of Christianity throughout the world ?
In Ernst Röhm 's expressive phrase , the Nazis were out to lift the world off its hinges , to destroy the power both of the proletariat and the middle classes and to found a new order of society to accord with the commands of the demonic voices which spoke through Hitler .
' I will tell you a secret , ' he told Rauschning .
' I am founding an Order ...
In my Ordensburgen there will stand as a statue for wor - ship the figure of the magnificent , self - ordaining God--Man ...'
Hitler at this point checked himself with the remark that there were matters of which even he must not permit himself to speak .
[ my emphasis - ed. ]
Until more research has been devoted to the issue of Hitler 's link with supernatural forces the subject must remain a closed book .
Perhaps we should content ourselves with the words of General von dem Bach - Zelewski , at the Nuremberg International Tribunal : ' You will never know the whole truth . '

' It has been said that , as a young man , Winston Churchill was a member of the Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt .
In view of his tirelessly inquiring mind , it would not be very surprising if that were so . '
' Hitler once confided to Rauschnig that he was founding a secret order at the second stage of which a man - god would be worshipped throughout the world '
Magic and the fate of nations
The French and Russian revolutions were among the greatest upheavals in modern history .
During them many million people lost their lives , and scores of millions more had loved ones killed or were reduced to beggary .
One of Satan 's titles is Lord of Misrule .
No circumstances could have better served his purpose .
It has been said that , as a young man , Winston Churchill was a member of the Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt .
In view of his tirelessly inquiring mind , it would not be very surprising if that were so .
But one is reminded of the saying ' A man who at the age of twenty is not a Communist has no heart ; if he is still a Communist at the age of thirty , he has no head . '
Of one thing I feel positive .
During the war Churchill had no truck with occultism of any kind .
For three years it was my good fortune , as a member of the Joint Planning Staff of the War .
Cabinet and therefore one of Churchill 's staff officers , to work in the fortress basement under Whitehall , from which the war was directed .
I state this as evidence to my readers that I am no woolly - minded mystic , but have my feet very firmly planted on the ground .
Unlike the majority of the other Planners , doubtless owing to the fact I was already a very well known author , I was ' privileged to count among my friends General Lord Ismay , Major Sir Desmond Morton and Commander ' Tommy ' Thompson , R.N. , who were respectively the Prime Min-ister 's Chief Staff Officer , his Personal Assistant , and his personal Aide - de - Camp ; so were all constantly with him .
All three lunched and dined with me , and I with them , on many occasions .
( cannot believe that I would not have picked up at least a rumour of it from one of them , had our great war leader owed anything to the Power of Darkness .
There is evidence that Hitler expressed great interest in Satanic ceremonies , and an American correspondent writes to me that Hitler once confided to Rauschnig that he was founding a secret order at the second stage of which a man - god would be worshipped throughout the world - and presumably Hitler intended to be that man .
Himmler was obsessed by a belief in occult power .
He listened greedily to every potential magic - maker that his sycophants could produce for him ; and Hitler frequently consulted astrologers whom he kept as permanent members of his entourage .
Not once , but on half a dozen occasions , he escaped assassination when by all the laws of chance he should have been killed .
But , in view of the work he was doing , it paid the Power of Darkness well to keep him alive until it was no longer possible for him to do further harm .
We recall , too , his last desperate efforts to destroy the German people with himself .
That he survived as long as he did could surely be termed the ' luck of the Devil ' .
The Black Art Today
Insignia of Hitler 's Allgemeine SS
In every age there have been secret societies , and the greater part of them have been brotherhoods concerned , to a greater or lesser degree , with magic .
In the , Western World , until the middle of the eighteenth century , their members dared not admit to belonging to them for fear of being accused of heresy .
With the coming of the Age of Reason the power of the Church declined ; so such societies were more freely talked of and written about ; but , right up to very recent times , few people would freely confess that on certain nights they attended a sabbath , for to the ordinary person that still suggested evil doings and sexual promiscuity .
During the past decade , human behaviour has entered a new phase .
It is termed the permissive society .
The restraining powers of the Churches , parental authority and public opinion have all been overthrown by the younger generation .
The majority of young people believe that they have the right to do what they like with their lives , irrespective of others , and comparatively few of them follow a religion .
Basically , of course , their instincts do not differ from those of their predecessors .
Because a man chooses to grow his hair long , that does not indicate that he is effeminate or lacks courage , and it does not follow that , because a girl exposes all but a small portion of her body to the public gaze , she is necessarily immoral .
But this young generation has been brought up in a new and terrible era , in which some maniac may bring an abrupt end to everything by launching nuclear war .
In consequence young people lack a feeling of security and feel the urge to drown fear in excitement and excess .
It is this , and the desperate seeking for some mental crutch to lean on , that has brought about this great upsurge in the practice of magic .
For many decades it had become so dormant that in 1951 Parliament repealed the ancient
Act that made witchcraft a crime .
This enabled its practitioners to come out into the open .
One such was the late Dr Gerald B. Gardner , who lived in the Isle of Man and opened there the museum that , he claimed , was the only one in the world devoted to magic and witchcraft .
He was responsible for the formation of many covens in Britain and initiated rites which are still followed by a considerable percentage of covens today , although they are repudiated by others who adhere to rites handed down from the Druids , and others again who regard their rites as more orthodox . "-
In Britain , the number of covens has now increased to several hundred , and in an article in the New York Times dated October 31st 1969 , the Hampshire witch Miss Sybil Leek , who emigrated to the United States , is reported as saying that she knows of 400 covens there .
At sabbaths all indications of class are eliminated by the fact that those present wear uniform black robes or strip themselves naked .
The latter custom is much more usual and is claimed to have the advantage because garments form , to some extent , a barrier that lessens the free flow of spiritual emanations from the body .
With the object of raising a cone of power the participants perform the follow - my - leader dance with increasing frenzy until one of them becomes possessed , falls and , like a medium , speaks with the voice of the possessing spirit .
The procedure is therefore essentially the same as that which takes place at a Voodoo ceremony .
The great majority of modern witches stoutly maintain that they practise only white magic , but the fact remains that anyone attending a sabbath lays himself open to Satanic influences , and in certain cases the evil resulting is incontestable .
The Wall Street Journal , of all papers , devoted to the subject an impressively long article , which opened with a column on the front page of the issue dated October 23rd 1969 .
It quotes Mr Anton Szandor LaVey - who acted as technical adviser in the film Rosemary 's Baby - as saying with a grin , ' I am very much a devil 's advocate . '
He added that sex played a big part in the weekly night - time services he held , and that the ' Church ' he had founded three years before had grown to a membership of 7,000 .
In California there was the appalling case in which , apparently , members of a coven brutally murdered the eight - months - pregnant Sharon Tate and a number of other people .
Nazi Nurenberg Rally in 1938
That it was a Satanic killing I had no doubt from the first account of it , because , although they were not hung , two of the victims were found with the traditional sign - the end of a rope tied round the neck .
In Britain , too , the black art is gaining votaries by the thousand .
The biography , published in 1969 , of Mr Alex Sanders , a Manchester man now living in London , states that , as a youth , he one day came upon his grandmother in her kitchen standing naked in a pentacle .
She disclosed to him that she was the last of a long line of hereditary witches .
Then , in due course , she initiated him , both into her secrets and sexually .
He now claims to be the King Witch of England .
Personally I do not believe that there are many more genuine sorcerers practising today than there have been in the past .
By that I mean initiates of the genuine Rosicrucians or adepts possessing the secrets of the Cabala who , by a perverted use of them , can call to their aid the Powers of Darkness .
The majority of these covens , I am convinced , are run by unscrupulous individuals who , to satisfy their lusts , impose on the credulity of young people and induce them to participate in rituals ending in orgies , by promising the girls rich husbands , the men other women they desire , or success in other ventures on which they have set their hearts .
I believe , too , that in certain cases covens are operated for purposes of blackmail .
In these , a ' talent scout ' picks up a likely victim at an ordinary spiritualistic seance and says to him , ' This is only nursery stuff .
I 'll take you to a place next week where you can see the real thing . '
After attending a few meetings of the coven , the victim is photographed from behind a curtain , bending over a lovely nude girl .
He is then told to pay up - or else .
Assuming that I am right , and that such genuine black magicians as there are concern themselves very little with romps , but a great deal with bringing about disruption through causing conditions that lead to widespread labour unrest and ( wherever possible ) wars , this does not mean that the covens run by frauds are harmless .
Far from it .
One does not have to know the secret rituals to attract the interest of the Powers of Darkness .
By prayer to any source of good in which one believes , one can receive comfort and fortitude ; by participating in Satanic rites , however sham , one can make oneself a focus for evil .
The spilling of blood by the sacrifice of animals , the spilling of semen in lust without affection , and the practice of perversions are like ringing a bell for the Devil .
All these thousands of young people who have become initiates of covens are liable to become pawns of the Power of Darkness in its eternal war with the Power of Light .
If this continues on an ever - increasing scale , the inevitable result will be a return to the brutal lawlessness , poverty and insecurity of the Dark Ages .
It is the duty of every responsible person who values a life of order , stability and decency to do his utmost to prevent this from happening .
But how are we to set about it ?
01Nov06 - various - Bild Zeitung : German NATO soldiers use Nazi ' Totenkopf ' symbol in desecrating human graves

http://www.bilderberg.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=131
One of Bild - Zeitung 's pictures of German troops in Afghanistan shows remains arranged into a ' skull and crossbones ' symbol .
Well looks like firther evidence that NATO may , in some way , be a modern manifestation of the Nazis .
It is this connection which has made the German Authorities so sensitive about this issue - and why the photo itself does not appear to be available on the net - though I saw it flash up on Channel 4 news on Saturday night 28th October 2006 .

BERLIN : A German newspaper yesterday published new photographs of German soldiers desecrating human bones in Afghanistan , including a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains .
The images were published three days after photographs of soldiers striking poses with skulls were plastered across a leading newspaper .
Germany on Friday suspended two soldiers for involvement in the desecration .
Yesterday , Bild published a front - page photograph of a soldier holding a pistol to a skull assembled with other bones to form a human skeleton .
The paper said more soldiers may have been involved in the scandal than previously thought .
In another picture , a soldier sat on a mound of earth above a skull and crossed bones .
A further image showed a pit filled with bones , which Bild said was near Kabul .
The Defence Ministry said the two suspended soldiers were involved in images taken in 2003 .
Others were said to be from 2004 .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German newspaper on Saturday published new photographs purporting to show German soldiers desecrating human bones in Afghanistan , including a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains .
The images were published three days after photographs of soldiers striking poses with skulls were plastered across a leading newspaper .
Germany on Friday suspended two soldiers for involvement in the desecration .
On Saturday , Bild published a front - page photograph of a soldier holding a pistol to a skull assembled with other bones to form a human skeleton .
The paper said more soldiers may have been involved in the scandal than previously thought .
In another picture , a soldier sat on a mound of earth above a skull and crossed bones .
A further image showed a pit filled with bones , which Bild said was near Kabul .
The Defense Ministry said on Friday the two suspended soldiers were involved in images taken in 2003 .
Others were said to be from 2004 .
Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to seek out and punish those responsible and appealed to the Afghan people to react calmly to the scandal .
Fears have arisen that German troops could be exposed to greater dangers after the publication of the photos .
" It is essential that Afghanistan sees that such offences will not be tolerated , but instead pursued relentlessly and punished , " Merkel told Focus magazine .
Nine suspects have been investigated so far over the matter .
The photographs emerged as Merkel 's government unveiled a long - term national security policy which sees an increasinglyimportant role for the army outside Germany .
On Thursday , Germany told its embassies to tighten security measures due to concerns the photos could harm its image abroad .
POPULATION CONTROL
The ' meditation room ' where a candidate for freemasonry is left alone before being conducted to the ' Lodge ' in order to be initiated into the first degree .
Just before he ' receives the light ' the candidate , who is regarded of being still ' profane ' must draw up his philosophical and moral testament
The Order of the Skull & Bones ; the Eugenic Societies ; and Population Control organisations
Alfred Mendes also writes for Spectrezine - you can read more of his stuff there
01Jul06 - Alfred Mendes - Bilderberg site exclusive
early paragraphs revised by the author 24th July 2006
Eugenics ( Greek for ' good birth ' ) is the study of methods to improve the human race by controlled selective breeding - bolstered by its concomitant term ' population control ' .
The colonisation of the so - called under - developed , poorer countries of this world by the more developed  capitalist - orientated countries ( primarily European ) , benefitted the latter greatly - at the expense of the former .
Slavery was one of the more tragic outcomes - another being that thecolonisers were now imbued with racist perceptions , which led to widespread usage within the English - speaking countries of such derogatory terms as : niggers / coons  ;  coolies  ;  wogs / ragheads  ; yids  - and - the - like .
Organisations reflecting this were subsequently set up , and the fact that the membership lists of these organisations flaunt the names of very influential politicians / statesmen , business tycoons and bankers , surely calls for a closer look at the matter .
And because of Americas currently leading role in this matter , it is necessary to recall that she gained independence as the United States of America after much infighting between the colonisers ( primarily British ) who had invaded that country of Indian Tribes - which led to genocidal attacks on those  Red Indians .
A story not unlike Britains colonisation of Australia , wirh its indigenous Aborigines .
As a backdrop to this , in 1798 , an English clergyman - cum - economist , Thomas Robert Malthus published a theory with eugenic ( a term not then used ) overtones , arguing that an un-planned population grew faster than food production - adding that famine and poverty were God 's way of coping with man 's laziness .
This was a theory much - welcomed by the colonisers and the organisations mentioned above .
Moreover , the close relationship noted above between Corporate America ( with its  Skull and Bones - ridden Administration ) and Nazi / fascist Germans makes a mockery of the formers claim to democracy .
Using eugenicists  terminology , they could more accurately be described as crypto - democrats ( fascists ) .
The definition of ' Fascism ' in a dictionary is a philosophy or system of government that advocates or exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right , typically through the merging of state and business leadership , together with the ideology of belligerent nationality  .
In plain English : capitalism lies at the core of fascism .
But , as noted above , this is a fact which must be hidden by these global capitalists .
This article will consider three such organisations : the Order of the Skull & Bones ; the Eugenic Societies ; and Population Control organisations , in a more - or - less chronological order , thereby leading to a more rational grasp of the subject matter .
Of the three , the Skull & Bones ( of Yale University ) was the earliest formed .
' The Order ' , as it is referred to by its members , bears the aura of secrecy and freemasonry , and is a bastion of White Anglo Saxon Protestant ( WASP ) culture , wealth and influence .
A partial list of its more prominent members reflects said influence : The Russell Family ; Alphonso Taft ; William Howard Taft ( his son ) ; Henry Lewis Stimson ; Averell Harriman ; Robert A Lovett ( partner of merged Brown Brothers Harriman in1926 ) ; Harold Stanley ( of Morgan Stanley ) ; Robert A. Taft ; Prescott Bush Snr. ; George Herbert Walker Bush ; G.W. Bush ( current President ) ; McGeorge Bundy ( National Security Advisor to JFK ) ; the Heinz family - et al .
In other words , the ' corporate establishment ' , as it is more popularly known .
The following very brief story of its birth is intriguing , to put it mildly :
In 1823 , using the old pirates ' ' Skull & Crossbones ' as its logo , Samuel Russell founded an opium - smuggling company , Russell & Co. - and by 1829 , he had bought out the Perkins & Co. , which had controlled the smuggling of Turkish opium into China since 1789 .
In 1833 , Samuel 's second cousin , William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft ( who had served as Secretary of War under President Rutherford B. Hayes ) founded the Order of Skull & Bones .
In 1856 , said William Huntington Russell ( who had been valedictorian of his class at Yale in 1833 ) incorporated Skull & Bones as the ' Russell Trust Association ' .
It must be recalled here that the opium trading noted above was still being run by the British East India Company ( BEIC ) - Britain then being the great empire - builder - and that without Britain 's collaboration Russell & Co. would have collapsed .
Simply put - the birth of Skull & Bones ( whose members are more commonly known as the ' Bonesmen ' ) - was paid for by opium drug - smuggling !
While on the subject of Russell & Co. , it is intriguing to note that Warren Delano Jnr. ( grandfather of that popular ' democrat ' , FDR ) , though not a ' Bonesman ' - while acting as US Vice - Consul in Canton , acted as Chief of Operations for Russell during the Opium War of 1839 - ' 42 , which resulted in the legalisation of opium in China , and the acquisition of Hong Kong by the British .
In the 1860's , Francis Galton ( a cousin of Charles Darwin ) took this Malthusian theory ( see above ) a step further : in his own words he defined ' Eugenics ' ( a word he coined ) as " the science of improvement of the human race germ plasm through better breeding " - adding that the poor were biologically inferior - and he further advocated state intervention to solve the problem .
In 1904 , he founded a research chair in eugenics at University College of London University .
In 1905 , Dr. Alfred Ploetz and Dr. Ernst Rudin founded the Society of Race - Hygiene in Germany .
( about which , more later ) .
In 1907 , the Eugenic Education Society ( which later became the Eugenic Society ) was founded in England .
In 1910 , the Eugenics Record Office ( ERO ) was founded in America .
In their own words , the ERO felt that " ultimate economic betterment should be sought by breeding better people , not fewer of the existing sort . "
In 1912 , the First International Eugenics Congress was held at London University .
It demonstrated the growing strength of the movement especially in England , Germany and the United States .
The opening speech at this congress was given by Arthur James Balfour , who had been British Prime Minister from 1902 - 5 ; and , as Foreign Secretary under Lloyd George from 1916 - ' 19 , made a deal with the Zionists whereby Britain would support the setting up of a ' home ' for the Jews , in return for the Zionists using their considerable political clout to persuade America to enter the war against Germany .
( Britain was by then in dire economic straits ) .
This secular Zionist group of Ashkenazi Jews were surely not entitled to a ' homeland ' in Palestine , as their country of origin had been the Khazar Empire ( which had adopted Judaism ) of southern Russia .
In 1916 , Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States .
It was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942 .
She wrote : " the unbalance between the birth rate of the ' unfit ' and the ' fit ' is admittedly the greatest present menace to civilisation ...
The most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over - fertility of the mentally and physically defective . "
In 1922 , the American Eugenics Society was founded .
One of its co-founders , Henry Laughlin ( who had been Superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office from l910 to 1921 ) later became President of the Pioneer Fund , a white supremacist organisation .
Another co-founder , Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn , in 1923 , during a national debate on restricting immigration , spoke enthusiastically about the results of intelligence testing carried out by the Army : " I believe those tests were worth what the war ( World War I ) cost , even in human life ... We have learned once and for all that the Negro is not like us . "
He also became president of the Pioneer Fund from 1947 to 1956 .
Well documented is the fact that in between WW1 and WW2 , Prescott Bush Snr. - as an executive of W.A. Harriman & Co. ( later becoming Brown Bros. Harriman ) - had , through a number of mergers with German companies , helped finance Hitler 's Nazi regime .
Furthermore , in 1926 , as a board member of bankers Dillon Read , Major ( as he then was ) William Draper co-operated with W.A. Harriman & Co. ( Prescott S. Bush Snr. was Vice - President then ) in the handling of the corporate banking for Fritz Thyssen 's German Steel Trust .
Thyssen had helped to fund the Nazi Party .
By 1931 , sterilisation laws had been enacted in 27 states in the United States , and by 1935 enacted in Norway , Sweden , Denmark , Switzerland and Germany .
As for Germany : as noted above , Ploetz and Rudin had set out an effective eugenics program which resulted in the tragic killing of millions of Jews , communists et al. by the Nazi Regime of Hitler .
In fact , Rudin had been the chief architect of Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Disease in Posterity passed July 1933 four months after Hitler came to power .
An inriguing aside : as noted in the Rockefeller Foundation Annual Reports 1928 1939 , Rockefeller gave money for the " Kaiser Wilhelm Institute " and thus subsidized Rudin .
From 1932 - 1972 , the US Public Health Service studied the natural history of syphilis in hopes of justifying treatment programs for blacks .
It was called the " Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male " , and involved 600 black men--399 with syphilis and 201 who did not have the disease .
Researchers told the men they were being treated for " bad blood " .
In fact , the men were never given adequate treatment for their disease .
Even when penicillin became the drug of choice for syphilis in 1947 , researchers did not offer it to the subjects .
In 1972 , as a result of a New York Times article , an Ad Hoc Advisory panel reviewed the study and found that the Tuskegee Study was " ethically unjustified " .
In August 1932 - and financed by the eugenicist , Major William Draper ( see above ) - the third " International Conference on Eugenics " was held in New York 's American Museum of Natural History under the supervision of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies .
The proceedings were dedicated to Averell Harriman 's mother , who had financed the foundation of the Eugenics Record Office back in 1910 ( see above ) .
Dr. Ernst Rudin ( see above ) travelled to attend the Congress via the Hamburg - Amerika line ( owned by W.A. Harriman & Co ) - and was unanimously elected president of the International Federation of Eugenics Societies !
A few years after WW 2 , Professor Dr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer , who , in 1937 , had been Director of the Third Reich Institute for Heredity , Biology and Racial Purity ( and Josef Mengele 's mentor ) founded the Institute of Human Genetics in Munster , and also became a foreign member of the American Eugenics Society .
The setting up of the state of Israel by the Zionists in 1948 was an irrational act ( as implied above ) , the main beneficiary being America , which would now have a well - armed , suborned ally in an Arab region rich in oil .
The resulting deaths of the many Arabs at the hands of the Israelis could have been stopped by America many years ago .
That it was not stopped can only mean that it was in keeping with the policy of the eugenicist - dominated US Administration - after all , Arabs are merely ' ragheads ' .
In 1950 and ' 51` , John Foster Dulles , then chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation ( later to be appointed Secretary of State by Eisenhower ) , led John D. Rockefeller III on a series of world tours , " focussing on the need to stop the expansion of the non-white populations " .
In 1952 , Frederick Osborn ( 1889 - 1981 ) nephew of Henry Fairfield Osborn Sr. ( see above ) , an officer of the American Eugenics Society / SSSB for more than 30 years , helped John D. Rockefeller III establish the Population Council in 1952 , served as the council 's first administrator and was on its board of trustees for many years .
In 1958 , Eisenhower appointed Draper ( see above ) as head of a committee to study the proper course for military aid to other countries .
Draper changed the focus of the committee and recommended that the US goverment react to the threat of the population explosion by formulating plans to depopulate the poorer countries , as the growth of the world 's non-white population should be regarded as dangerous to the national security of the United States !
Eisenhower had the sense to reject this .
In the 1960 's Draper founded the Population Crisis Committee and the Draper fund , and joined with the Rockerfeller and Du Pont families to promote eugenics as population control ...
While serving in Congress - and with Draper as his ' population expert ' - George H.W. Bush chaired the Republican Task Force on Earth Resources and Population and invited Professors William Shockley and Arthur Jensen to explain to the committee how allegedly runaway birth - rates for African - Americans were down - breeding the American population .
On August 5 1969 , Bush summed up the testimony his black - inferiority advocates had given to the Task Force before Congress .
With the term ' eugenics ' now , in the Post - War period , tainted with an aura of genocide and racism , Major General Frederick Osborn , founder member of both the American Eugenics Society and the Pioneer Fund , stated the public relations problem bluntly : " Eugenic goals are most likely to be attained under a name other than eugenics . " ...
In other words , the goals must be camouflaged - it would now be known as crypto-eugenics .
In 1960 , the British Eugenics Society agreed with this , stating " The Society 's activities in crypto-eugenics should be pursued vigorously ... " - and adopted the proposal .
In 1973 , this resulted in the American Eugenics Society becoming the more academic - sounding ' Society for the Study of Social Biology ' .
Crypto-eugenics would now be the order - of - the - day .
On June 9th 1969 , Dr.D.M. MacArthur , Deputy Director of Research & Technology for the Pentagon , requested a sum of $ 10 million from the Congressional House Subcommittee on Appropriations to develop a new contagious micro-organsm capable of destroying the human immune system - in order to counteract any possible future virus capable of affecting said human immunity .
It would therefore be necessary , first , to create such a virus !
This resulted in a ' virus ' discovered some ten years later in America which became known as ' acquired immune deficiency syndrome ' ( AIDS ) .
It should be stressed that this virus first appeared in America , and , as noted by Neville Hodgkinson on the website businessonline.com in May 2006 : increasingly complex procedures were taken to diagnose this virus in a reliable manner - " but the basic problem - not being able to validate any of these procedures against pure virus taken from patients - still remains " .
Furthermore , he reveals in comprehensive detail , that both the HIV tests and statistics concerning AIDS have been manipulated in a duplicitous manner .
It would seem that the main beneficiaries have been the pharmaceutical firms !
In April 1974 , Kissinger drew up a secret plan for population control called the ' National Security Plan of Action 200 ' ( NSSM 200 ) , which was endorsed by the National Security Decision Memorandum 314 , and finally declassified in 1900 .
In brief , it claimed that population growth in the less - developed countries was " .. creating political or even national security problems for the US " , and it would seek help from the UN Fund for Population Activities ( UNFPA founded in 1969 ) - but stressing that it would be under US leadership .
NB : this was at a time when America was being wracked by the Watergate scandal , as a result of which its president , Richard Nixon , had to resign .
At the very least , it would seem that - in the eyes of the Administration - the policy of ' population control ' stood high in its list of priorities .
In August 1974 , at a meeting in Bucharest , the UN passed a resolution adopting The World Population of Action as proposed by the US delegation .
It would seem that US leadership was indeed essential !
The UNFPA was to hold similar meetings at 10 - year intervals thereafter .
On October 2nd 1979 , Robert McNamara ( President of the World Bank ) addressed a group of international bankers thus : " We can begin with the most critical problem of all , population growth " .. concluding that " .. either the current birth rates must come down more quickly , or the death rates must go up ... There are , of course , many ways in which the death rates can go up .
In a thermonuclear age , we can accomplish it very quickly and decisively " ( as indeed they had done in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in1945 ) .
Not surprising statements , coming , as they do , from a man who was Secretary of Defense during the genocidal Vietnam War - but surprising in view of the crypto-eugenic stand taken by the American Eugenics Society noted above , a stand which McNamara , a self - evidently keen eugenicist , would have certainly been aware of .
It can only be assumed that he did not agree with the society 's stand , and was arrogant enough to ignore it .
In 1980 , William Draper III ( General Draper 's son ) served as co-chairman for financing G.H.W .
Bush 's campaign for the presidency that year .
Reagan won and appointed Bush as his Vice President .
In 1986 - as a result of Vice President George H.W. Bush 's advice to Reagan - William Draper III was appointed Administrator and CEO of the UN Development Program ( UNDP ) , which was founded in 1965 by merging two existing U.N. organizations : the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance ( EPTA ) , and the U.N. Special Fund .
Since 1971 , it has been responsible for coordinating all development assistance supplied by the United Nations system .
UNDP was a key player in the global aid network - and the UNFPA ( see above ) .
The foregoing is not a comprehensive list by any means - but is surely enough evidence that eugenics , population control ( call it what you will ) has played , and continues to play a crucial role in the policy - making of the so - called ' developed ' countries - America in particular .
A recent event of pertinence follows : an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 on the Richter scale struck the Indian Ocean region on December 26th 2004 , resulting in a Tsumani which killed approximately a quarter - of - a- million people .
It was subsequently revealed that the Americans - with their European partners / acolytes - were aware of this earthquake almost immediately , as they controlled a number of seismic stations in the region ( to say nothing of their earth - scouring satellites ) , the most important being the American military base on Diego Garcia .
However , thay had not notified those countries threatened by the Tsunami .
The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that this was a deliberate act on the part of the Euro - Americans , and , keeping in mind the chronological events listed above , it can justifiably be assumed that , in this instance , the eugenists and their cohort ' Bonesmen ' had scored a hit !
Moreover , the close relationship noted above between Corporate America ( with its ' Skull and Bones ' - ridden Administration ) and Nazi / fascist Germans makes a mockery of the former 's claim to democracy .
Using eugenicists ' terminology , they could more accurately be described as ' crypto - democrats ' ( fascists ) .
The definition of ' Fascism ' in a dictionary is " a philosophy or system of government that advocates or exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right , typically through the merging of state and business leadership , together with the ideology of belligerent nationality ' .
This , in turn , reveals that capitalism lies at the core of fascism .
But , as noted above , this is a fact which must be hidden by these global capitalists .
It is therefore imperative that this subject of eugenics / population control is subjected to far greater public scrutiny than it has received from ' our media ' - which , after all , is in hock to its corporate owners : it says what it is paid to say !
Third SS Panzer Division ' Der Totenkopf '
Living quarters of the Dutch Volunteer Legion
on the Leningrad front , December 1943
Adolf Hitler was also obsessed with the occult , in his case the Thule Society which was closely inter-connected with German Theosophists .
The jolly roger , skull and cross bones , " der Totenkopf " was an emblem worn by Hitler 's SS soldiers and emblazoned on SS armoured cars and tanks .
( see pictures and text by A.J. Barker throughout this page particularly that of Paul Hausser ) .
The SS was a religious cult of Hitler worship .
If the Nazis ' occult lodges had been exposed and shut down , not treated as a taboo , millions of lives could have been saved .
The second world war need never have happened .
Unless you want the occult fuelling a totalitarian West's Third World War ' on terror ' and their ' New World Order ' - please - do your bit to expose the George W. Bush and the bonesmen .
Military use of Skull and Bones - JP speaks
The use of Skull and Bones is a popular symbol , especially in military circles .
It is usually associated with the concept of ' death before dishonour ' .
It is also meant to intimidate the enemy .
To show the enemy the black flag ( which is usually adorned with the death 's head ) meant you were not taking prisoners .
The cavalry connection was also important because cavalry are associated with danger and daring .
There have been many stories of fateful cavalry charges from the Crimean War to WWII ( by Polish and Italian cavalry men ) .
Panzertroops also wore the the Totenkopf because armor is seen as the modern equivalent of horse cavalry .
In the case of the 3rd SS division " Totenkopf " , this unit was created from members of the Totenkopf - Verband , a section of the SS .
The skull and cross bones is a very popular symbol .
Some of the more prominent uses of the symbol in the war came from Bulgaria , Serbia , Latvia , and Hungary .
Italy used a lot of variations but most of theirs were a skull with a dagger in its teeth , probably a salute to the Italian " Arditi " of WWI .
It is foolish to try to link the use of this symbol to some kind of world wide conspiracy .
There are only so many symbol designs out there , and they tend to get reused often .
J.P. Slovjanski
Skull and bones motif used by UK far left and far right
Advocates of hatred and violence at both ends of the left - right political spectrum in the UK use the skull and cross bones as their symbol .
Both the following groups have a higher profile than their actual support in the country might suggest , probably because their controversial ideas attract attention .
It is far from impossible that BOTH organisations are political plants supported and funded by a wealthy Satanic death cult involved in drug / arms smuggling .
Combat 18
Far right race - hate organisation Combat 18 ( known to some as wombat 18 ) use the skull and cross bones logo on their web site .
The web site changed at the end of 2004 .
It is now a user login only site .
www.combat18.org
Is it necessary to point out to any vaguely intelligent person or sentient being why Combat 18 is not a nice organisation ?
Their open support for the Nazi fascists and ' White Power ' ( do whites really need any more power ? ) and anti-Jewish stance unashamedly welds them in with the vilest race - hate atrocities committed by the SS and Gestapo etc. in World War II .
One section of the combat 18 web forum is entitled ' The Zyklon Zone ' , taking its name from IG Farben 's poison gas used for mass murder in Nazi death camps .
The two sub-sections of this forum zone are demeaningly entitled ' Jew Stuff ' and ' Blackie Stuff ' .
Only someone who rejoices in the worst excesses of man 's inhumanity to man could support or connect themselves with such an organisation .
Class War
Hailing from the extreme left , skull and cross bones logo users Class War believe that " violence is a necessary part of the class war " .
www.classwaruk.org
Class
War are left wing advocates of violence , blaming the upper and middle ' ruling ' classes as a whole for the ills of working people and advocating a fundamentalist Marxist worldview .
They make no distinction between well - off groups and individuals that fight for social justice and those selfish capitalists that work to destroy the lives and communities of the poor , exploiting and legitimising the jealousy of the poor for the rich .
I have been personally criticised by Class War's Paul Marsh for exposing what I believe to be their infiltration by Britain 's counterintelligence service MI5 .
Class
War supports important groups such as Against Prison Slavery but attacks Britain 's first black MP Diane Abbott for " maintaining close relations with the biggest racists of the lot , the Metropolitan Police " .
Class
War also blame the MP personally for Hackney 's " bizzare mixture of grinding poverty and wealthy middle class idiots " .
One of the issues Class War appear to have avoided is the fact that far - right organisations such as Combat 18 ( above ) and the BNP are essentially working class movements .
In an era where the U.S. administration is leading the world into a state of permanent ' war on terrorism '
Class War 's violent response and perpetuation of the ' war ' mindset begs the question " can you fight violence with violence ? "
In fact the issues raised by Class War lie at the heart of differences on the left between those that see man 's propensity for violence against the person as the solution and those that see it as the problem .

The Brotherhood of Death - from ' America Betrayed '
Extract from America Betrayed , Bush , bin Laden , 9 - 11 . by R. Joseph , Ph.D. University Press , ISBN : 0971644578
http://universitypress.info/AmericaBetrayed11.html
Prescot Bush and Rockefeller 's Standard Oil had been in business with the Hitler regime and the Nazis since 1933 , and in 1942 , three Bush businesses were seized by the U.S. government , for violation of the Trading With the Enemies Act .
IT ALL BEGINS AT YALE : SKULL & BONES
In 1823 , Samuel Russell , a child of the Wall Street banking establishment , founded  Russell & Company  the largest opium smuggling operation in the world .
Russell and Company was based in Connecticut , and in addition to Chinese tea and silk , specialized in acquiring opium in Turkey and smuggling it to China ( 16 ) .
In 1830 , Russell and Company bought out their primary competitor , the Perkins ( Boston ) syndicate and thus established Connecticut as the epi-center of the illegal opium trade .
Because of the incredible wealth generated , and through his connections to Wall Street , Russells company ( and thus Connecticut ) became an epicenter of illegal and secret political power ( 16 ) .
The grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Warren Delano , Jr. , served as Chief of Operations , at Russell and Company , and later became a partner ( 16 ) .
In 1831 , William Huntington Russell , half - brother to Samuel , left the United States and Yale college , to spend a year studying in Germany ( 17 ) .
Germany was in a fever , the epi-center of new ideas and a scientific revolution in psychology , philosophy , and educational reform .
In the new Germany , children were being educated according to the scientific method . 
They were taught what to think and how to think it , as well as total obedience to the state .
William Huntington Russell wanted to learn first hand ,  The Scientific Method and the ideas and philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel .
Hegel held the Chair in Philosophy at the University of Berlin from 1817 until his death in 1831 .
In Germany , the scientific method , and the Hegelian dialectic were being applied to every aspect of human endeavor : through reason and the application of the scientific method , it was possible to create a pre-determined synthesis and thus the most desirable predetermined outcomes ( 1 ) .
Russell was particularly impressed with the concept of  thesis versus anti-thesis and Hegels historical dialectic : the state is absolute , individuals are granted their freedoms based on their obedience to the state , controlled conflict , by an intellectual elite , can produce a pre-determined outcome .
Russell , being a child of the Wall Street banking elite , quickly realized the implications .
Hegels philosophy and the  Scientific Method could be applied to banking : Through controlled conflict , it was possible to create a synthesis in the form of incredible financial wealth .
Those engaged in this conflict would require financing .
Controlled conflict , when conducted in secret , would be good for business .
Indeed , secrecy is mandated when the dialectic is applied to the creation of opposing forces  who are to be manipulated into engaging in a controlled conflict . 
Secrecy is also necessitated so that the opposing forces do not realize that the same banks are providing funds to both of those in conflict .
Of course , William Huntington Russell was not the first to realize the necessity of secrecy for the purposes of applying Hegels dialectic to banking and commerce .
Banking requires secrecy , particularly when it comes to laundering incredible sums of money acquired through criminal enterprise and the drug trade .
Long before he arrived in Germany , Russell had learned the value of secrecy .
What he wanted was to learn first hand was the Hegelian scientific method .
So , it is not surprising that after he enrolled at the University of Berlin , Russell became a member of a secret society which also incorporated Hegelian ideas .
Russell joined the secret order of  Skull and Bones ( 17 ) .
The membership of the Berlin order of Skull and Bones came from the privileged class , the aristocracy , and the families of bankers and the moneyed elite .
Russell fit fight in and formed a warm and close relationship with many of its members .
When it came time for his to return to America and Yale college , Russell sought and obtained permission to form an American chapter of the secret German Society of Skull and Bones : chapter 322 , The Brotherhood of Death ( 17,18 ) .
Russell returned to the United States and Yale College in 1832 .
Russell , along with his very close friend , Alphonso Taft ( the father of William Howard Taft who became President of the U.S. and then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ) , and 13 other children of the Wall Street elite , established and became the founding members of  The Order of Scull and Bones ,  later changed to  The Order of Skull and Bones . 
The Order of Skull and Bones was to be a super secret society for the elite children of the Anglo - American Wall Street banking establishment ( 17,18 ) .
Its purpose :
To generate incredible wealth and power for its members .
Presumably , the Order of Skull and Bones exists only at Yale .
As detailed in Antony C. Suttons superbly researched 1986 text , Americas Secret Establishment ( 17 ) :
 Those on the inside know it as The Order .
Others have known it for more than 150 years as Chapter 322 of a German secret society .
More formally , for legal purposes , The Order was incorporated as The Russell Trust in 1856 .
It was also once known as the  Brotherhood of Death . 
Those who make light of it , or want to make fun of it , call it  Skull & Bones , or just plain  Bones . 
The Order of Skull and Bones , however , is certainly not a college fraternity fun-house .
Rather , the purpose of Skull and Bones is the application of skull duggery , piracy , and the scientific method to the creation of power , wealth , and the inducement of controlled conflict between opposing individuals , businesses , and states .
The Order of Skull and Bones is also geared to promote the mutual success of its members in the post - collegiate world .
Hence , only those of the incoming senior class become members ( 17,18 ) and membership is retained for life .
Each year fifteen juniors are selected by the graduating seniors to be initiated into next years group .
New members are reportedly given a large sum of money , and a clock the significance of which is to remind them that the Order of Skull and Bones is timeless .
As detailed by Antony Sutton ( 17 ) it is the timeless  nature of this secret brotherhood which provides it with continuity and thus the capacity to build up both vertical and horizontal chains of influence .
These multi-generational chains of influence ensure the success of its members in their varied schemes , be it drug smuggling or the creation and financing of controlled conflict for the purposes of acquiring power and incredible wealth .
Prescott Bush , George H.W. Bush , and his son , George W. Bush , are alumni of Yale and members of Skull and Bones ( 17,19 ) .
THE BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH
After its founding , Russell and friends hoisted a pirate flag as a symbol and talisman of their brotherhood .
The pirate flag has an obvious meaning : death .
Pirates are terrorists , murderers , marauders , cutthroats and thieves , answerable to no one , above the law , and without morals and scruples .
Soon after its establishment at Yale , the Order of Skull and Bones began to develop an unsavory reputation ( 17 ) .
In October of 1876 , an investigative article on The Order , appeared in Volume 1 , Number 1 , of  The Iconoclast . 
The Inconclast was published off campus , in New Haven , because the college press is closed to those who dare to openly mention Bones . 
The Iconoclast reported evidence of Satanism , i.e. walls covered in black , and in room 322 , the sanctum sanctorium of the temple ...[ was ] furnished in red velvet ...[ with ] a pentagram on the wall ... and in the hall .... pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale , and of members of the Society in Germany , when the chapter was established here in 1832 . 
The Iconoclast goes on to report that  Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men .
They have gone out into the world and have become in many instances , leaders in society .
No doubt they are worthy men in themselves , but the many , whom they looked down upon while in college , cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands .
Bones men care far more for their society than they do for the college . 
 At first the society held its meetings in hired halls ; in 1856 , the tomb ,  a vine - covered , windowless , brown - stone hall was built .
This is where they hold their strange , occultist initiation rites and meet each Thursday and Sunday . 
 Year by year the deadly evil is growing ,  The Iconoclast warned .
 The society was never as obnoxious as it is today .
Never before has it shown such arrogance and self - fancied superiority .
It grasps ... and endeavors to rule .
It clutches at power with the silence of conscious guilt ... a society guilty of serious and far - reaching crimes . 
An uninvited guest to the tomb reported seeing :  On the west wall , an old engraving representing an open burial vault , in which , on a stone slab , rest four human skulls , grouped about a fools cap and bells , an open book , several mathematical instruments , a beggars script , and a royal crown ( 17,18 ) .
On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words , in Roman letters ,  We War Der Thor , Wer Weiser , Wer Bettler Oder , Kaiser ?  and below the vault is engraved , in German characters , the sentence ;  Ob Arm , Ob Beich , im Tode gleich .
The English translation of the German words reads as follows :  Who was the fool , who the wise man , beggar or king ?
Whether poor or rich , alls the same in death . 
And what does that mean ?
There are no morals .
There is no right or wrong .
The ends justify the means .
Everything ends the same , in death . 
*******
For the next 30 years after its founding , various members of The Order of Skull and Bones made a pilgrimage to Germany and the University of Berlin ( 17 ) .
The University of Berlin was Ground Zero for the study of Hegelian principles and the scientific method as applied to business , government , education , psychology , and the acquisition of power and wealth .
In Germany , the state had taken complete responsibility for the education of children .
The purpose of a German education was to mold the character and thinking of all German citizens and to make them obedient to the German state ( 1 ) .
These Hegelian principles were absorbed by the visiting Bonesman , three of which , upon returning to America , applied these principles at home ( 17 ) .
Timothy Dwight ( class of 1849 ) became Professor in the Yale Divinity School and then 12th President of Yale University .
Daniel Coit Gilman ( class of 1852 ) became the first President of the University of California , first President of the Johns Hopkins University and first President of the Carnegie Institution .
Andrew Dickson
White ( class of 1853 ) became the first President of Cornell University .
For these three  Bonesmen ,  a university education was the key to shaping the thoughts , prejudices , and ideas of future generations and training those who would someday become the future leaders of America .
Of course , these noble  Bonesmen had no interest in providing a university education to the masses .
A university education was only for the children of the rich and powerful ; men who would seek to fulfill the Hegelian dialectic and the eventual creation of a New World Order which would be ruled over by the moneyed elite .
NEW WORLD ORDER : CIVIL WAR & THE MONEYED ELITE
Although , most certainly , the founding of colleges and universities is to be commended in the most laudatory of terms , not all  Bonesmen were interested in improving the lot of mankind .
Education would be a form of thought control and mankind would serve only one purpose : to engage in controlled conflict , to help create a New World Order , and to thus make the Bonesmen and their banker and business friends very powerful and very rich .
The American civil war offered the Bonesmen and their associates in banking , the first opportunity , in America , to fund controlled conflict .
The resulting synthesis would include the erosion of democracy at the local level ( states rights  ) , the elimination of state - chartered  Free Banking  and the establishment of centralized national  banking and thus the establishment of a few private national  banks that could be owned and controlled by a handful of families .
From the outset of the American civil war , these private national banks ( as well as the  Free banks ) , loaned money to both the Union and the Confederacy ( 20 ) .
Many of these bankers also funded and equipped  bushwakers ,  death squads ,  and private militias whose specialties included the torture and assassination of Union or Confederate sympathizers .
Neighbors were sometimes slain before the eyes of their wives and children ,  some were killed for fun ( 21 ) .
Not uncommonly these death squads  would pick off neighbors one by one ,  ambushing and assassinating suspected enemies , and spreading terror .
Every man , armed or unarmed , was fair game .
Men were shot down in their fields , on their doorsteps , while on the road .
Men taken captive were scalped , beheaded , castrated , and mutilated .
Crops , homes and entire towns were burned ( 21 ) .
The owners of these banks , these merchants of death , essentially funded the war and the many competing death squads in order to reap the incredible , staggering profits .
Indeed , by the end of the war , over $ 6.6 billion dollars in direct costs ( that is , in 1860s dollars ) had been consumed by the civil war and the government of the Union and Confederacy ( 20 ) .
War and terror were good business .
The merchants of deathmade incredible fortunes .
In 1863 , Abraham Lincoln identified this moneyed elite , as the enemies of mankind and the enemies of the United States of America :
 The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity .
It is more despotic than a monarchy , more insolent than autocracy , more selfish than bureaucracy .
It denounces , as public enemies , all who question its methods or throw Light upon its crimes .
I have two great enemies , the Southern Army in front of me and the bankers in the rear .
Of the two , the one at my rear is my greatest foe ... corporations have been enthroned , and an era of corruption in high places will follow , and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few , and the Republic is destroyed . 
 Abraham Lincoln
Thomas Jefferson was of the same opinion :  I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs . 
In 1863 , after a failed attempt to bring the banks under centralized government control , President Lincoln and Congress took the advice of his Secretary of the Treasury and the northern banking establishment , and created a national banking system and a uniform national currency to be issued only by national banks  ( 20 ) .
The National Banking Act of 1863 and a subsequent law passed in 1865 ( which levied a 10 - percent tax on State banks ) put the free banks out of existence .
The control of the national banks was put squarely into the hands of the members of the order of Skull and Bones ( 20 ) .
It wasnt just banking but money which was put under the control of a handful of individuals .
National Bank Notes were printed by private bank note companies under contract to the Federal government .
The Guaranty Trust Company was one of the national bankswhich emerged during the war between the states .
The Guaranty Trust Company , established in 1864 , was controlled almost entirely by families whose sons were , or would soon become , members of Skull and Bones : Vanderbilt , Whitney , and Harriman ( 17,22 ) .
THE BROTHERHOOD OF SHIPPING & BANKING : HITLERS ANGELS
The concept of a bank is quite simple .
Money is deposited in the bank for safekeeping , and the bank may pay a small interest fee to depositors in return .
This same money is loaned to businesses , governments , and men of means , at a high rate of interest .
This same money can be loaned to those who own the banks , at a 0 % interest rate , and the loans may even be forgiven . 
A bank is a risk - free money - making machine for those who own the bank .
If anyone defaults on a loan , and if the bank goes bankrupt , only the depositors lose money .
With the incredible amounts of money flowing into the coffers of the Guaranty Trust Company , the Harriman family was able to finance and buy the bankrupt Union Pacific Railroad , as well as create the W. A. Harriman investment firm .
Bert Walker ( the maternal great - grand - father to the current George Walker Bush clan ) was one of Harrimans principal partners .
Bert Walker had sought and lost the Republican presidential nomination , but in so doing , had established himself as a member of the Republican power - elite ( 23 ) .
Bert Walker and then later , his son , George Walker , were not only partners with the Harrimans , but , due to their Republican credentials , were well situated to influence the administrations of successive Republican presidents .
The Harrimans were also partners with the Rockefellers .
The Harriman railroad shipped the oil pumped out of the ground by John D. Rockefeller , the founder of Standard Oil .
Samuel P. Bush the father of Prescott , was also in business with the Harriman - Walker - Rockefeller clique .
Samuel P. Bush , owned Buckeye Steel Castings Co. which manufactured parts for the Harriman railroad company ( 23 ) .
It is men likes these , if not these very men , who Lincoln referred to as
 The money powers [ who ] prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity ... until the wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few , and the Republic is destroyed . 
TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
In the 1930s , Bush , Harriman , and Rockefeller , established themselves as enemies of democracy by going into business with Hitler , and by importing Nazism to the United States .
As detailed in chapter 2 , it is because Bush was still in business with the Nazis after Hitler declared war on the U.S. , that several of his companies , including the Hamburg - Amerika shipping line , was confiscated by the government of the United States .
History was repeating itself , for at the close of the first world war , and Germanys defeat , the Hamburg - Amerikas commercial shipping fleet was first confiscated by the American government in 1919  part of the spoils of war .
In 1920 , the Harrimans became the new owners of Hamburg - Amerika .
The Harrimans also obtained the exclusive right to 50 % of all shipping business that originated in Hamburg and 100 % control of all activities of the Hamburg line that originated in the United States .
In 1931 , Harriman & Co. merged with Brown Brothers to become one of the biggest investment banks in the world .
Prescott Bush became a senior partner in the new firm .
That same year , George Walker began running the North American operations of the Hamburg - Amerika shipping line under the auspices of Walkers American Shipping & Commerce , which in turn was controlled by a holding company called the Harriman Fifteen .
Averell Harriman , George Walker , and Prescott Bush were the directors of this holding company and thus the owners of the Hamburg - Amerika line ( 4,23 ) .
Three years later , U.S. government investigators determined that several of the directors of the Hamburg - Amerika line , were major contributors to the Nazi Party .
These men , it was determined , had provided a wealth of funds to Hitler for his 1932 election campaign ( 12 ) .
Prescott Bush was one of these men .
Prescott Bush was financing Nazi terrorism as a means of destabilizing Germanys democratic government and catapulting Hitler to power .
Prescott Bush and one of the companies that he directed , the Hamburg - Amerika Line , was identified by the U.S. embassy in Berlin as providing the funds to support Hitlers costly election campaigns  and  the cost of maintaining a private army of 300,000 to 400,000 men . 
It was these men who spread terror throughout Germany .
As detailed by Tarpley and Chaitkin ( 24 )  The American embassy also reported that the Hamburg - Amerika Line was purchasing and distributing propaganda attacks against the German government , for attempting this last - minute crackdown on Hitlers forces . 
After Hitler came to power , the Hamburg - Amerika Line also began financing Nazi propaganda and subsidizing pro-Nazi newspapers here in the U.S.
The purpose of this propaganda was clear .
The Bonesmen were not just seeking to support Nazi Germany , but were seeking to undermine the constitutional government of the United States ( 4,24 ) .
The Bonesmen were sworn enemies of democracy .
THE BROTHERHOOD
Nato=Nazi link seven - let me
know another and / or return to the start
After Hitler came to power , his dreaded terrorist organization , the SS was unleashed upon the German people ( 3,5,6 ) .
The SS was not just a terrorist organization , but deeply involved in spying and espionage as well as business .
Other long range goals was to establish monopolies not only in Germany , but in all the countries it conquered ( 6 ) .
Himmlers dreaded SS , had a lot of friends in the business world who also hoped to benefit from the spoils .
They gave him and his SS incredible sums of money , making them , so to speak , stockholders in his money - making terrorist organization .
The Hamburg - Amerika line , which was directed by Prescott Bush , not only contributed money and helped to distribute Nazi propaganda in the U.S. and Germany , but it was also one of the official  Friends of the Reichsfuhrer SS  ( 6 ) also known as  The Order and the  Brotherhood of Death . 
Like its American counterpart , the  Order of Skull and Bones the German  Order was dedicated to making money , and recruited its membership from the aristocracy and the moneyed elite .
HITLER AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH
In 1922 , Averell Harriman , an alumni of Skull and Bones ( Class of 1913 ) , made a pilgrimage to Germany .
But Hamburg was nt the lure .
It was Berlin the ancestral home of Skull and Bones , the Brotherhood of Death .
Indeed , various members of The Order of Skull and Bones had been making pilgrimages to Germany and the University of Berlin since the inception of the American chapter of the Brotherhood of Death ( 17 ) .
Harriman was a dedicated  Bonesman . 
According to his third wife , Pamela , Averell  Harriman regularly went back to the tomb ( the Bones Temple ) on High Street , once even lamenting that his duties as chief negotiator at the Paris Peace Talks prevented him from attending a reunion ( 25 ) .
While in Berlin he made contact with Fritz Thyssen , also , allegedly , a member of a Germany - based secret society ; though which one , of course , is a secret .
A number of German secret societies were in existence at the time , such as the Illuminnati of Bavaria and the Thule Society .
These secret societies counted rich industrialists , mystics , aristocrats , bankers and high ranking military men among their members ( 26 ) .
In the early 1920s , when Harriman paid his visit to Germany , the membership of the Thule Society included Dietrich Eckart , Rudolf Hess , and Heinrich Himmler ( 27 ) all of whom were directly associated with Adolf Hitler , and all of whom became Nazi leaders ( 3,5 ) .
The secret society that had anointed Hitler as its leader , would later become known to the world as the SS  The Brotherhood of Death ( 6 ) .
Although it cannot be proved , there is evidence to suggest that Himmlers SS , and its American counterpart , Skull and Bones , were one and the same and directly linked with the Thule Society or the Illuminnati .
In fact ( and as will be detailed later in this chapter ) , some of the occult rituals that were said to be part of the initiation into the Thule Society and the SS ( 27 ) , are similar to those that are said to be practiced by initiates into the American chapter of the Brotherhood of Death , that is , Skull and Bones ( 17,28 ) .
For example , both employ initiation ceremonies in which the initiate dies to the world and be born again into the Order ...( 29 ) .
In October of 1988 then Vice - President George H.W. Bush was asked by a reporter if he were a Christian . 
At first Bush seemed confused by the question , but then said , if you mean born again , then , yes , I am a Christian . 
In his book , Mein Kamph ( 7 ) and in some of his speeches , Hitler also refers to being born again , that is born anew . 
Likewise , George Bush jr. , refers to himself as born again  and freely admits he was honored  to be chosen to be a member of Skull and Bones .
As reported in the August 7 , 2000 issue of Time magazine , Bush was asked :  Did you have any qualms , say , about joining an elite secret club like Bones ? 
Bush replied ,  No qualms at all .
I was honored .
The motto of Hitlers SS begins as follows :  It is an honor to be an SS man .
It is an honor ... ( 6 ) .
The leaders of the Thule Society also believed it to be an honor to have inducted Hitler into the mysteries of its secret order ( 27 ) .
In 1919 , Dietrich Eckart , a leading member of the Thule Society , met Adolf Hitler for the first time .
Eckhart believed that Hitler was the German  Messiah ... the long - awaited savior who would lead Germany to her destiny .
Eckhart took Hitler under his wing and initiated Hitler into the mysteries of the secret order :  Follow Hitler ; he will dance , but it is I who have called the tune .
I have initiated him into the Secret Doctrine , opened his centers of vision , and given him the means to communicate with the powers ( 27 ) .
Hitler , in turn , referred to Eckhart as the spiritual founder of the Nazi party ( 7 ) .
In Table Talk ( 7 ) Hitler says of the man :  Weve all taken a step forward on the road of existence , and we could no longer picture to ourselves exactly what Dietrich Eckart was for us .
He shone in our eyes like the polar star . 
In the final paragraphs of Mein Kampf ( 7 ) , Hitler says of Eckart , he was one of the best , who devoted his life to the awakening ...
Prominent members of Thule also included Rudolf Hess .
Fritz Thyssen , who Harriman visited in 1922 , reports that it was Hess who introduced him to Adolf Hitler .
Thyssen too , thought Hitler would be the savior of Germany ( 30 ) .
Like the Bonesmen , Thyssen believed that the New World Order would be ruled by the kings of banking and commerce .
THE BANKING BROTHERHOOD
Thyssen and Harriman agreed to establish a banking association , and two years later , in 1924 the W.A. Harriman Co. , established an international investment firm ,  Union Banking Corporation ,  which was in business with the Thyssens ( 31 ) .
Bert Walkers son , George Herbert Walker , was made president ( 24 ) .
As detailed by Webster G. Tarpley & Anton Chaitkin in their superbly documented book , George Bush : The Unauthorized Biography ,  by personal agreement between Averell Harriman and Fritz Thyssen in 1922 ... the Union Banking Corporation has since its inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the Dutch bank by the Thyssen interests for American investment .... transferring funds back and forth between New York and the Thyssen interests . 
The Union Banking Corporation and the Thyssen bank also acted as Nazi fronts and served to launder funds for Thyssen and the Nazismoney and funds that could be used to buy guns , arms , favorable publicity , and dozens of U.S. senators , congressman , and newspaper editors ( 12 ) .
 Prescott Bush became vice president of W.A. Harriman & Co. in 1926 .
That same year , a friend of Harriman and Bush set up a giant new organization for their client Fritz Thyssen , prime sponsor of politician Adolf Hitler .
The new German Steel Trust , Germanys largest industrial corporation , was organized in 1926 by Wall Street banker Clarence Dillon .
Dillon was an old comrade of Prescott Bushs father Sam Bush ( 24 ) .
Thyssen went into business with Harriman for the same reasons he went into business with Hitler , to increase his wealth and power .
It is unlikely that Thyssen did not inform Harriman of his intention of helping Hitler come to power .
Indeed , Fritz Thyssen was Adolf Hitlers primary financial backer and had been providing considerable financial support to Hitler and the Nazis , since 1923 ( 30 ) .
At their first meeting , Thyssen gave the new  German Messiah ,  $ 25,000 .
At the same time , Thyssen and Harriman were also making big plans , some of which were dependent on Hitler coming to power .
As Thyssen explained ( 30 ) :  We were at the worst time of the inflation .
In Berlin the government was in distress .
It was ruined financially .
Authority was crumbling .
In Saxony a communist government had been formed and the Red terror , organized by Max Hoelz , reigned through the countryside .
The German Reich ... was now about to crumble .
Thyssen states that it was General Erich Ludendorff who first told him of Hitler and that Hess made the introductions .
In 1923 , General Erich Ludendorff was also the chief patron of Hitlers SA  which , because it had been outlawed by the German government , had been renamed  Frontbann  ( 6 ) .
The SA ( Frontbann ) was a terrorist organization , which counted among its members , Heinrich Himmler .
Thyssen admits that he was mesmerized by Hitler ( 30 ) .
 I realized his orator gifts and his ability to lead the masses .
What impressed me most however was the order that reigned over his meetings , the almost military discipline of his followers . 
In 1924 , after his meetings with Hitler , Fritz Thyssen sent Hendrick J. Kouwenhoven , the managing director of his bank , to meet with the Harriman - Walker clique .
It was after that meeting that the Union Banking Corporation was established .
In 1926 George Walker made his son - in - law Prescott Bush , vice - president of Harriman & Co. and president of Union Banking ( 24 ) .
The Thyssen banking relationship was expanded to include partnerships in the new German Steel Trust , Germanys largest industrial corporation , which was also headed by Fritz Thyssen , Adolf Hitlers primary financial backer .
According to the United States Government , Prescott Bushs Union Banking Corporation ( which he directed ) was working as a front for the  Thyssen family  of  Germany ... nationals ... of a designated enemy country  ( 31 ) .
As summed up by John Loftus , former U.S. Department of Justice Nazi War Crimes prosecutor , and the President of the Florida Holocaust Museum :  Thyssen ( and the Nazi Party ) obtained  his early financing from Brown Brothers Harriman , and its affiliate , the Union Banking Corporation .
Union Bank , in turn , was the Bush family s holding company for a number of other entities , including the Holland American Trading Company .
The Bushs Union Bank bought the same corporate stock that the Thyssens were selling as part of their Nazi money laundering .
These Nazi - front companies ,  Brown Brothers , Harriman and  Union Banking Corporation ,  were controlled almost entirely by men who belonged to the American chapter of  Skull and Bones ( 32 ) .
Prescott Bush and associates , and Standard Oil , also provided loans , executive expertise , and petroleum - related products to IG Farben ( 12 ) .
IG Farben used that expertise to develop poison gas and petroleum to drive the Nazi war machine , and to run its slave labor and death - camps , the most notorious of which was Auschwitz where 83,000 people worked as slaves .
It is estimated that in the concentration camps alone , Himmlers SS , worked to death and killed over 10 million men and women ( 6 ) .
A favored method of killing was using a special gas developed by IG Farben .
As detailed in chapter 2 , Prescott Bush and Harriman were also in business with several other leading Nazis , such as Friedrich Flick who later became Hitlers minister of the Interior , as well as IG .
Farben , the company that developed the poison gas to kill Russians , gypsies , and Jews .
Like Harriman and Bush , Flick was a member of The Order ( 6 ) .
The Flick - Harriman partnership was managed by Prescott Bush ( see chapter 2 ) .
According to a U.S. government brief presented in 1946 at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal , industrialist Friedrich Flick , was a leading financial contributor to the Nazi Party from 1932 on and a member of the Circle of Friends of Himmler who contributed large sums to the Nazi SS . 
The  Circle of Friends  is also known as the  Friends of the Reichsfuhrer SS . 
The Hamburg - Amerika line , which was directed by Prescott Bush , was also counted among the Friends of the Reichsfuhrer SS ( 6 ) also known as  The Order and the  Brotherhood of Death . 
Frick joined this most secretive and powerful of societies in 1932 .
By contrast , Prescott Bush and the Harriman brothers ( W.A. and E.R ) joined the American chapter of The Order , in 1917 , 1913 , and 1917 , respectively , long before Hitler had taken the first steps on his long road to power .
They were all part of the same brotherhood , however .
Indeed , be it the Thule Society , the SS , or the American version of  The Order ,  all sprouted from the same German roots .
THE BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH
The evil , diabolic symbolism of Skull and Bones is designed to stir feelings of terror and to warn of death which is why it appears on bottles of poison and has been the symbol of choice for pirates and death squads .
It is precisely because it is designed to induce terror that the symbol of the death head became the talisman worn on the black uniforms of Adolf Hitlers Nazi elite : The Order the dreaded SS , the Brotherhood of Death .
The Bonesman of Yale shared not just the symbolism of the Skull and Bones with the SS Nazi elite , but practiced many of the same exact initiation rituals and recruited their elite members from the same strata of society .
Like the Bonesmen of Yale , the Nazi SS recruited its members from the upper echelons of society , i.e. the blue bloods , bankers , and aristocrats .
As detailed by Heinz Hohns ( 6 ) ,  the first arrivals were from the aristocracy .
Even before the Nazi seizure of power certain great names had been added to the SS list including Grand Dukes , Counts , and Princes .
However , in spring 1933 came a further infusion of blue blood .
Many of the senior SS posts were occupied by the nobility ... and the ruling class elite .
The primary requirements in the SS , were money and officer material , and they could come only from one source the old - established ruling class elite the nobility , the world of commerce and the financiers ...
Germans captains of industry .
There were , however , different ranks within the SS .
Those who were to belong to the highest ranks underwent an initiation ceremony similar to that of the Order of Skull and Bones at Yale .
As detailed in Heinz Hohns , The Order of the Deaths Head ( 6 ) , initiates into the SS underwent an occult - like quasi- religious midnight ceremony involving oath - taking , question and answer confessions , and prayer - like sessions , all of which were designed to impress upon the initiate that he was able to become a knight  and a member of a secret brotherhood .
The ceremony took place at midnight , in a castle , beneath the dining hall where there lay a stone crypt and  the realm of the dead  ( 6 ) .
 A flight of steps in the middle of the crypt led down into a well - like cavity ; in the centre of the cavity were twelve stone pedestals . 
Bones and relics , including the skull and skeleton of noble men and kings were also kept within the holy of holies  including the bones of  King Heinrich . 
Initiates would thus commune with the spirits of the dead , who might appear and even speak .
The initiate into the SS , by undergoing this spiritual journey , would also be reborn , as a knight , and a member of the secret order ( 6 ) .
Likewise , we are informed that initiates into Yales ' The Order ' , were required to undergo an array of exotic and occult bonding rituals  including a quasi-religious midnight ceremony which involved question and answer confessions that took place while the initiate lay in a coffin ( 17,29 ) .
The ceremony took place in castle , at midnight , in  the tomb . 
As explained by Ron Rosenbaum ( 29 ) while lying in the coffin the initiates goes off on a symbolic journey through the underworld to rebirth , which takes place in Room Number 322 .
There , the Order clothes the newborn knight in its own special garments , implying that , henceforth , he will tailor himself to the Orders mission ( p. 89 , 148 ) .
The Castle walls of Himmlers SS headquarters , were heavily decorated with Nazi symbols and regalia .
Likewise , based on several independent reports by those who visited the Skull and Bones Yale Castle what Bones initiates call  the Tombsome of the walls and rooms are covered with Nazi symbols and regalia , including swastikas , and SS macho Nazi iconography . 
One visitor described a room with a little Nazi shrine inside ( 17,18 ) .
In yet another room of the Order of Skull and Bones , one visitor observed mantelpieces decorated with loads of skulls . 
She and others have been told  that in order to prove their mettle and perhaps to bond them in mutual guilt over participation in an illicit act , each class of 15 new initiates to Skull and Bones are required to dig up the skull of a famous person and bring it to the Tomb to be enshrined in its skull collection ( 17,18 ) .
Like the SS , The Order of Skull and Bones is also known as the Brotherhood of Death .
And we are told , initiates into the SS and The Order of Skull and Bones , are required to say the words :  It is an honor ...
When George W. Bush was asked ,  Did you have any qualms , say , about joining an elite secret club like Bones ? 
Bush replied ,  I was honored  ( 33 ) .
The identical symbolism and use of similar language is not just coincidence .
In fact , Prescott Bush and several of his fellow Bonesmen , felt such an affinity with Nazi terrorist ideals , that they helped arm Hitlers SS and the Nazi terrorist war machine .
However , Bush and his partners in banking and oil , did not link up with Hitler and his SS just because of shared ideology but because of money , oil , and an unquenchable thirst for power .
THE OIL BROTHERHOOD I
As the 1932 presidential elections began , Hitler and the Nazi party were almost broke .
They were desperate for funds .
And then , after meeting with the captains of industry , Hitler was suddenly flush with cash .
According to Hitlers vice - Chancellor , Franz von Papen ( 34 ) ,  the most documented account of the National Socialists  sudden acquisition of funds was contained in a book published in Holland in 1933 .
It was published by the old established Amsterdam publishing house of Van Holkema & Warendorf , called De Geldbronnen van Het Nationaal - Socialisme ( Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler ) under the name  Sidney Warburg . 
The comment period for the new draft Massachusetts office - file - format policy ended last Friday the 9th .
During the week before that date , there was some pretty intense back - room politics going on .
There are a ton of industry associations and lobbying groups , including : Mass Software Council , Technet New England , Mass High Tech Council , Mass Network Communications Council , Associated Industries of Massachusetts , and AeA .
You can bet that every one of them was coming under pressure last week to speak up pro or contra the state ’s position .
Since you have IBM and Sun on one side of this issue and Microsoft on the other , you can also bet that they were getting pulled both ways .
I ’m pretty sure that a lot of them ended up with a statement along the lines of “ On the subject of the new draft from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , we ’re in favor of motherhood and apple pie . ”
But , I got my hands on a copy of the other side ’s talking points , and I think they make interesting reading .
[ Update : I hear unofficially from someone at Adobe corporate that they ’re “ generally happy with how things went ” , so I was wrong , sorry .
Fixed . ]
Somebody at one of those associations knows somebody who ’s on a mailing list with me and thus I got these talking points ; I ca n’t say for sure who wrote them , but I can guess .
Let ’s give them a look , then walk through point by point .
The direction toward interoperability using XML data standards is clearly a good one .
However , limiting the document formats to the OpenOffice format is unnecessary , unfair and gives preferential treatment for specific vendor products , and prohibits others .
The proposed approach and process for use of XML data is quite open to multiple standards , yet the proposed standard for documents is quite narrow , preferential , and may not enable optimal use of the data - centric standards .
The proposed policy would create significant costs and problems for state agencies , for the private sector and for citizens , which have not been evaluated , considered , or factored in .
There are practical considerations for conversion of documents in older formats which apparently have not been considered .
This policy would prohibit certain innovations and solutions from technology vendors , denying future benefits to MA agencies .
There are less costly , less limiting , non-preferential policy options to achieve the same goals .
Bottom line :
We feel strongly that this proposed policy is costly and unnecessary and would result in limiting the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to desktop software that is less functional , less open and less flexible than the State of MA already has .
We will continue to work with a variety of State officials to help them achieve their various public and organizational goals .
On the Other Hand ... · Recently we spent a few days on a farm on Saskatchewan , during which I had occasion to help clean the floor of the barn , one of whose inhabitants was a Hereford bull named “ El Presidente ” , being boarded for a friend .
So , when I assert that these talking points are , by and large , Dung of Male Bovine ( DoMB for short ) , I do so in an educated voice .
Let ’s take them up one by one .
The direction toward interoperability using XML data standards is clearly a good one .
Well yes , but just standardizing on “ XML ” is laughably inadequate .
XML just labels parts of files ; it does n’t tell you what they mean ; by itself , it does n’t do semantics at all .
But interoperability and business value are all about shared semantics ; for example , once everyone publishing documents onto the Internet decided to agree to use HTML , the Web revolution was born .
So “ standardizing on XML ” is useless ; the business benefits are in standardizing on an actual individual set of tags and what they mean .
For example , in Massachusetts ’ case , OpenDocument 1.0 .
However , limiting the document formats to the OpenOffice format is unnecessary , unfair and gives preferential treatment for specific vendor products , and prohibits others .
DoMB .
Not only is anyone free to implement OpenDocument 1.0 without any legal or licensing issues , anyone is free to join the committee which defines and maintains it .
The claim that any product is “ prohibited ” casts serious doubt on the intelligence and integrity of whoever has the nerve to make it .
The proposed approach and process for use of XML data is quite open to multiple standards , yet the proposed standard for documents is quite narrow , preferential , and may not enable optimal use of the data - centric standards .
The first half of this is pretty well DoMB , anyone who claims that the combination of OpenDocument 1.0 and PDF ( what Massachusetts is proposing ) is “ narrow ” clearly has n’t taken the time to study either of them .
The second part of this , I suppose , is code for “ lets you use InfoPath ” .
They might have a point here , except for I ’ve seen outfits like Propylon build the same kind of application using OpenOffice data , and there are all sorts of standard approaches like XForms and so on just coming over the horizon .
Abandoning the benefits of standardization to enable the use of a frankly experimental and unproven product from one vendor strikes me as a lousy trade - off .
The proposed policy would create significant costs and problems for state agencies , for the private sector and for citizens , which have not been evaluated , considered , or factored in .
Really ?
How do they know that Massachusetts has n’t been evaluating , considering , or factoring in ?
Seems like a pretty offensive claim , frankly .
But there ’s some real meat here .
There are significant costs in converting away from a proprietary , vendor - controlled data format , and you can be sure that such vendors take those costs into account when they set their licensing prices .
Let ’s see , in the year ended June 30 , 2005 , I see that Microsoft reported 7.915 billion profit on $ 11.013 billion in revenues for “ Information Worker ” products ( i.e. Office ) .
Yes , proprietary data formats are are a big part of the story behind that remarkable profit margin .
Once the world has converted to a common file format so everyone has to compete on features and quality , this will still be a good business to be in , but nobody will be reporting 72 % operating profits , which in this particular case means less money going from Massachusetts to Redmond , year after year , forever .
Put it another way : every so often in coming generations , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is going to change its office software .
Assuming they ’ve standardized the file format , the cost of changing the software will be just the cost of changing the software .
If they have n’t , it ’ll also include the cost of changing over all the data .
Unless the cost of conversion right now is awfully damn high , this sounds like a good investment .
There are practical considerations for conversion of documents in older formats which apparently have not been considered .
Once again , whoever wrote this had a lot of nerve accusing Massachusetts of failing to consider obvious issues .
Let me tell a little story .
A couple of months ago , I bought my Mom a new Macintosh , and also Microsoft Office for the Mac .
We transferred her files over from her old Windows computer , but Office would n’t open a bunch of them .
That was OK , I went and got NeoOffice / J , a free OpenOffice - based software suite , and it opened most of them just fine .
This is a story you hear over and over , on the net .
Having said that , there are going to be cases ( particularly heavily - engineered Excel spreadsheets ) , where there will be some pain transferring to the open alternative .
But ( see previous discussion ) there will also be some pay - offs ; you take the pain now or you support a 72 % profit margin forever .
This policy would prohibit certain innovations and solutions from technology vendors , denying future benefits to MA agencies .
This is particularly gloppy ugly stinky DoMB .
The notion that using standardized formats and protocols gets in the way of innovation is twenty - year - old thinking , it was wrong then and it ’s wrong now .
I remember perfectly well , back in the Eighties , IBM and Wang and Pr1me and DEC explaining why their proprietary networking stacks were much more innovative and better than this new - fangled least - common - denominator “ Internetworking ” thing , and why their proprietary operating systems were more innovative than Unix .
( Hey , most of those companies are out of business , are n’t they ? )
These days , anybody trying to sell a one - vendor proprietary networking stack would be laughed out of the market .
I am quite certain that in another decade or two , anyone trying to sell a proprietary office - document format will be too .
Massachusetts is smart enough to be a little ahead of the game .
There are less costly , less limiting , non-preferential policy options to achieve the same goals .
Well , I have a new car - engine technology to sell that runs on tap - water and accelerates a Ford Expedition 0 - 60 in 2.7 seconds .
You should n’t take either my statement or the one before it seriously , because each lacks supporting evidence and flies in the face of common sense .
Bottom line :
We feel strongly that this proposed policy is costly and unnecessary and would result in limiting the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to desktop software that is less functional , less open and less flexible than the State of MA already has .
We will continue to work with a variety of State officials to help them achieve their various public and organizational goals .
That barn - floor stench threatens to overcome me .
In particular , the claim that office technology based on an open , standardized , file format that has already been implemented multiple times is necessarily “ less functional , less open , and less flexible ” is outrageous .
In free - market economies , functionality and flexibility generally arise as a result of competition , not of monopoly control of key standards .
As for open - ness , the notion that a proprietary technology unilaterally controlled and licensed by a single vendor can be “ more open ” than a public soon - to - be - ISO standard is simply , well , that ’s what El Presidente produces and what I was pitchforking out last August .
