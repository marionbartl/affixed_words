That is probably the most detailed crash photo sequence I have ever seen .
That was really amazing .
I 'm glad to see you are ok but I can't help but think that the new and improved SV is a bit of a bad luck charm .

You 're constantly told how easy it would be to hack your weak passwords , but complicated passwords just are n't something our brains get excited about memorizing .
Reader calculusrunner offers a brilliant tip that turns weak passwords into something much , much better .

His clever solution : Stick with your weak , dictionary password if you must ; just move your fingers over a space on the keyboard .
If you want a secure password without having to remember anything complex , try shifting your fingers one set of keys to the right .
It will make your password look like gibberish , will often add in punctuation marks , and is quick and simple .

When John Pozadzides showed us how he'd hack our weak passwords , he listed his top 10 choices for getting started hacking away at your weak passwords .
Let 's take a look at how a few of those popular passwords fare when run through calculusrunner 's method :
password => [ sddeptf
[ sddeptf letmein => ; ry , rom
; ry , rom money => .pmru
. pmru love => ; pbr
Something longer but still really lame , like , say , " topsecretpassword " , becomes " yp[drvtry [ sddeptf " .
These may not be perfect compared to secure password generators , but they 're likely orders of magnitude better than a lot of people 's go - to passwords .

15:40 UPDATE : TimesOnline has now returned to Google 's index .
Jaamit Durrani reports that the Times 's SEO team are citing technical problems but , as he argues , this is n't convincing .
How could a technical error remove an entire site from Google 's index ?
I think it 's safe to assume this was a dry run .
Rupert Murdoch has long threatened to remove his papers ' stories from Google as part of his war against the company 's " content kleptomaniacs " .
And today , at least in the case of the Times , he 's done just that .
In advance of the launch of the paper 's paywall this summer , all Times Online content has disappeared from Google 's index .
Try searching for the latest columns by David Aaronovitch , Daniel Finkelstein et al and you 'll have no luck .
As others have noted , the absence of a robots .
txt file telling Google to remove pages from the index , suggests that they were manually removed by the company at Murdoch 's request .
Given the huge amount of traffic that Google drives to news websites , this amounts to a big gamble .
But Murdoch 's view is that the presence of his news stories on Google , among thousands of others , robs them of their distinctiveness and value .
In any case , the News Corp head is more concerned with pushing people back to print than he is with successfully charging for digital content .
As his biographer Michael Wolff has written : " The more he can choke off the internet as a free news medium , the more publishers he can get to join him , the more people he can bring back to his papers .
It is not a war he can win in the long term , but a little Murdoch rearguard action might get him to his own retirement .
Then it 's somebody else 's problem . "
With the Sun and the News of the World set to follow their Wapping neighbours and charge for content later this year , we can expect those titles to soon exit Google as well .

There ’s always been speculation that Steve Carell would leave The Office for the greener pastures of the big screen once his contract is up , but BBC Radio may have confirmed it .
In an interview with Carell and Date Night co-star Tina Fey , he was asked about returning to the series , about which he had this to say :
Question : How long will you stay with The Office for ?
How many more series ?
How long does your contract run ?
Carell : Contract through next season .
Question :
And will you stay after that ?
Carell : I do n’t think so .
I think that will probably be my last year .
You can listen to a clip of the interview here .
It ’s been common knowledge for a while that Carell ’s contract ends after this next season , but as OfficeTally notes , this is the first time he ’s publicly talked about leaving the show .
Of course , some will speculate that this all might be a prelude to renegotiating his contract for some of that Seinfeld money , but others — particularly those of you who pop up in the recaps and insist the show is no longer worth watching — might see Season 7 as an appropriate place to end things , rather than allowing the show to outstay its welcome .
John King talks to West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall about the tragedy at the Massey Energy mine and the two of them go through a list of possible solutions to improve mining safety and of course they leave out the most obvious one , unionization .
We need to be asking both of them to go read this article by Meteor Blades at Daily KOS -- Want Safer Mines ?
Unionize
Them :
In fact , union mines may have a higher number of citations for safety violations than non-union mines .
That is because union inspectors accompany Mine Safety and Health Administration inspectors when they check out a mine .
They are far less likely to pass over problem situations than are inspectors who are being pressed by company officials to finish up and get out of their hair so they can get back to digging .
Union inspectors seek those citations because they want to prevent injury and death .
Read on ...
According to the United Mine Workers of America , in 2007 - 2009 , there were 45 underground coal - mining fatalities .
Six of these were in union mines .
Thus , for the 15 - year period , less than one - fifth of the fatalities occurred in union mines . [...]
A report from the March 28 , 2007 , hearing on Protecting the Health and Safety of America 's Mine Workers released by the House Committee on Education and Labor contains the following statistics for the five - year period of 2002 - 2006 :
It is n't a matter a matter of speculation .
If you 're an underground coal miner , your chances of emerging alive at the end of your shift are better if you work in a union mine than if you do n't .
In contrast , look at the ridiculous list of items they come up with that wo n't do an ounce of good .
Hotlines , creating a fund so mines can be shut down for inspections if there are concerns so the workers do n't lose pay , Congressmen " chaining themselves to a fence " and telling industry not to cut corners .
It 's painfully obvious neither of these two have ever worked in a dangerous industry .
The only thing that 's going to prevent these kind of tragedies is the workers being able to report problems without fear of being fired and being trained properly in the first place to recognize hazards on the job .
Recognizing and removing hazards before someone gets killed takes day in and day out cooperation between the company and the workers and safety issues being addressed as soon as they are found .
No inspector or outside group is ever going to do that efficiently or in a timely manner .
That takes boots on the ground in the form of workers and their supervisors being trained to recognize the hazards in their workplace and being allowed to report problems without fear of retribution or firing even if it means shutting a job down to get a problem fixed .
When a company does not care about the safety of its workers , a union is the only other organization that 's going to fill that gap in a manner that truly protects their workforce .
Seeing the types of abuses these miners have suffered just sickens me and knowing the track record of this mining company , sadly the tragic results of their neglect does n't surprise me either .
Transcript via CNN below the fold .
KING : But we have these accountability questions only after brave men die .
And my question to you , sir , and is -- is if this place was a bad actor -- you used those terms yourself , has a maverick reputation , you used on our air this morning -- we have talked to miners who say -- that were worried about the evacuation plan .
They were worried about the ventilation plan .
There have been citations about methane gas and citations about coal dust .
Why is n't there a system to say , We 're not assigning blame here , but enough allegations have been raised that we 're going to stop work until we figure this out ?
If my car does n't have a blinker , I can't get a safety inspection .
If my brakes are worn too low , I can't get a safety inspection .
The government stops me because that car might hurt somebody and might kill somebody .
Why does n't the government , the congressmen , somebody stop a mine when people are saying it 's a ticking time bomb ?
RAHALL : That 's a valid point , John , and certainly , we need to pay attention when there are warning signs issued .
The unfortunate fact is here that when many of those warning signs come from the miners themselves , those most directly affected , those who have to go into the mine before the sun comes up and do n't come out until the sun goes down , we have to have verification .
Certainly , any agency would have to have some sort of verification from that miner .
Now , to just go on an anonymous tip wo n't work .
But believe you me , MSHA is doing a better job in recent years .
They 've had cutbacks in the past , yes , but in the last year or so , they are beefing up their personnel , they are training their personnel , again a requirement under the Miner Act .
They 're having practice sessions at least quarterly , and these individuals now that are inspecting our mines are being better informed and are better trained than mine safety inspectors of the past .
So it is a new age and it is coming into effect , and we will certainly follow up in the Congress .
KING : That 's my question , in the sense that I know you will follow up , sir , and I 'm not questioning your commitment to this issue .
But it is only after people die that we start asking these questions .
I am trying to figure out , is there a way to have a circuit breaker that does n't blame anybody -- I know the company is innocent until proven guilty .
Some of these violations , as you mentioned , are very , very minor .
They can be taken care of quickly , but some of them are not , the allegations .
And is there a way -- and the miners say they have to go to work because they have to feed their families .
Is there a way for the industry , somebody , to create a fund that if you need to stop work for a day or three or even a week or three , to check these things out , that these guys get paid ?
So that they are not afraid to raise their hands ?
And that somebody can go in and say , is there a methane buildup in there ?
Is there an evacuation plan ?
Is there too much coal dust before we have to have a conversation under these circumstances ?
RAHALL : I will admit to you the warnings signs were there on this particular operation , this particular mine .
And as I have said and you 've accurately quoted , this has been a bad apple , and it 's incumbent that we find methods , perhaps an anonymous 800 toll - free line -- and we have experimented with that in the past -- to get people to call in with information .
And then that 's not enough .
And even the law passed by Congress is not enough if it's not implemented and enforced .
And that 's the key here , is implementation on the ground , enforcement .
And that takes integrity .
That takes honesty .
That takes a no cutting the corners approach not only by the industry , but those that inspect the industry as well , and who may be later on in life , in their careers , looking for a job within that same industry .
We 've seen that in the past .
I 'm not saying that 's happening today , but that is a warning to these mine inspectors that they have to be on the alert for the warning signals , and then run it up the chain of command , no matter how frivolous you may think it is at the time .
KING : But you said yourself , sir , that there were warning signs , you just said warning signs were there at this particular mine before this accident .
RAHALL : Yes , they were .
KING : So why did n't somebody , maybe the local congressman -- that would be you -- or somebody , chain themselves to the damn fence and say , there are enough warnings signs , you 're not going in there ?
RAHALL : Well , the fact of the matter is that those warning signs were n't brought to the proper officials .
We know now , for example , because of your research of the violations issued as late as Monday , although I do n't think serious , but there were violations I 've just learned that were issued as late as March 30th that perhaps were of a more serious nature , involving ventilation .
When you have violations or citations issued because of ventilation , improper ventilation for methane and CO and other hazardous gases , then that should be a warning something is wrong .
But it should be made public .
It should be made knowing to the members of Congress .
That was not made to my attention .
It was not brought to my attention .
And as far as I know , I 'm not sure whose attention it was brought to , except perhaps some listing in an anonymous register somewhere .
That do n't get it .
And that 's where we need to have some other type of alert when these violations , citations are issued .
KING : Congressman Nick Rahall , I appreciate your time tonight , sir .
And let 's talk in the days ahead , if there 's anything you think our business can do , my business can do to help bring these things to people 's attention , I hope in the days and weeks ahead you drop us a note or give us a call , because we would like to be part of it as well .
Congressman Nick Rahall , thank you , sir .
RAHALL : Thank you , John .
A California - based consumer watchdog called , er... Consumer Watchdog is calling for a Department of Justice investigation into Google .
The group , supported by mobile entrepreneur Simon Buckingham and lawyers for two price comparison websites , praised the DOJ for its action against Google Books and the FTC probe into the acquisition of AdMob .
But Consumer Watchdog said Google was unfairly using its dominance in search to the detriment of both advertisers and users .
John M Simpson , consumer advocate at the group , said : “ Google exerts monopoly power over Internet searches , controlling 70 percent of the U.S. market .
For most Americans – indeed , for most people in the world – Google is the gateway to the Internet .
How it tweaks its proprietary search algorithms can ensure a business ’s success or doom it to failure . ”
The watchdog accused Google of subsidising its other business with cash from its stranglehold on search .
The group suggested forcing Google to make its ad platform more transparent by making public the maximum bid for search terms , how many search terms are shown per page and how Google 's " quality score " is calculated .
Simpson said such action could even include breaking Google into separate businesses or regulating it like a public utility .
Consumer Watchdog said it welcomed the ongoing investigation into Google Books by the DoJ , and the Federal Trade Commission 's probe into the AdMob buy , but said it was : " past time to act against Google ’s monopolistic and pervasive power over the entire Internet " .
More details and the full letter to the DoJ are here . ®
Sarah Palin :
God wrote on his hand too
At an Ohio Right to Life fundraiser Friday night , former Alaska governor Sarah Palin once again defended the notes she wrote on her hand during last month 's Tea Party Convention .
She said she did n't have a good answer to media criticism at the time , but now she has one : God did it too .
A supporter sent her the biblical passage Isaiah 49:16 : " See , I have engraved you on the palms of my hands ; your walls are ever before me . "
" If what was good enough for God , scribbling on the palm of his hand , it 's good enough for me , for us , " Palin said .
" In that passage he says , I wrote your name on the palm of my hand to remember you .
And I 'm like okay , I 'm in good company . "
For years , it 's been a staple of the White House calendar .
On the first Thursday of May , dedicated as the National Day of Prayer , President George W. Bush hosted an ecumenical service in the East Room , a big public endorsement of evangelical Christians .
( This event is different from the National Prayer Breakfast , held outside the White House gates every year on the first Thursday of February . )
President Obama opted not to have a service in the White House this year .
" Prayer is something that the president does every day , " explained White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , adding that Obama will sign a proclamation to recognize the day .
" I think the president understands , in his own life and in his family 's life , the role that prayer plays . "
President Truman signed the first National Prayer Day proclamation , and President Reagan made it a permanent occasion .
Under Bush , the day was a political event , confirming a conviction that religion was a core tenet of Republican politics .
Naturally , prominent evangelicals , including National Day of Prayer Task Force Chairman Shirley Dobson , and her husband , Focus on the Family founder James Dobson , expressed disappointment in Obama 's decision .
" At this time in our country 's history , we would hope our president would recognize more fully the importance of prayer , " Shirley Dobson said in a statement .
But Obama has shown an unusual sensitivity toward atheists , the first president to mention non-believers in an inaugural address when he said , " For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness .
We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus and non-believers . "
Non-believers took heart at Obama 's decision but urged him to go further .
" It 's not his job to tell people to pray , " David Silverman , national spokesman for the organization American Atheists , told CNN .
" We are very happy he did away with the George W. Bush - era celebrations and party , but we wish he would n't do it at all . "

The government said it would " disrupt " terrorists when it could not prosecute A total of 201 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism last year , 66 of whom were eventually charged , Home Office figures reveal .
The number is up on last year , when 178 arrests were made .
In total there have been 1,759 terrorism arrests since 11 September 2001 , the figures show .
The number of people stopped and searched under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act fell to 200,444 in 2009 , a 12 % drop from 2008 .
The figures relate to England , Wales and Scotland .
Northern Ireland publishes separate figures .
Of the 66 people charged , 17 were charged under terrorism legislation while seven were charged with terrorism - related offences in the period ending September 2009 .
Possession of an article for terrorism purposes ( 30 % ) and fund - raising ( 14 % ) , are the most common charges under terror laws since 2001 .
' Complex threat '
The figures show that since the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001 , in the UK 383 suspects have been charged with terrorism - related offences , with 310 prosecutions completed .
Of those , 74 % were convicted .
Last year there were 29 terror trials , with 86 % resulting in a conviction .
Policing and security minister David Hanson said the figures underlined the success of the authorities in disrupting terrorists , and the CPS in prosecuting them .
This shows that we should not have allowed our whole way of life to be changed by intrusive technology like ID cards and body scanners on account of government - manufactured hysteria about terrorism
Alex Deane
Big Brother Watch " There can be no doubt about the complexity of the threat we face and the aspiration of those intent on committing acts of terrorism .
" That is why the government is committed to wherever possible prosecuting those involved in terrorism .
And where we can't prosecute , we seek to deport or disrupt . "
But Alex Deane , of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch , said the figures showed that actual terrorism - related charges were rare and demonstrated the relatively - small objective threat they posed .
" This shows that we should not have allowed our whole way of life to be changed by intrusive technology like ID cards and body scanners on account of government - manufactured hysteria about terrorism , " he said .
Stop and search Meanwhile , the figures show the number of stop and searches in the second quarter of 2009 - 10 was down by 53 % on the same period the previous year .
The arrest rate resulting from searches under Section 44 , which must take place within a designated area , was just 0.5 % , with 965 people detained .
The use of these powers was escalated after the failed terror attack at London 's Tiger Tiger nightclub in 2007 , resulting in more than 250,000 people being searched in total in the year to April 2009 , the highest on record .
In January last year , an Equality and Human Rights Commission report suggested black people in England and Wales were seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people .
Asians were twice as likely .
Parliament now needs to do its job , respond to the damning Court of Human Rights judgement and tighten up the law without delay
Corinna Ferguson
Liberty Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson ordered section 44 searches to be scaled back in the face of suggestions they had been alienating people from ethnic minorities in the capital .
' Recruiting radicals '
Section 44 does not require police to have reasonable suspicion that the person being stopped is a terrorist .
In January the European Court of Human Rights ruled police who use anti-terrorism powers to stop and search members of the public without suspicion are acting illegally .
In a surprise ruling , the judges said Section 44 of the Terrorism Act violated individual freedoms .
Lib Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne welcomed the reduction in the use of Section 44 powers .
" The police are getting the message , but ministers should tighten up the law after the critical European ruling .
Random stop and search is arbitrary and discriminatory , and acts as a recruiting sergeant for radical Islamism , " he said .
Mr Huhne also called for intercept evidence to be used in court .
" This is a better option than undermining civil liberties through detention without charge , control orders and secret evidence , " he added .
Corinna Ferguson , a barrister at human rights charity Liberty , welcomed the drop in stop and searches saying it demonstrated a " growing understanding on the part of the police of the dangers of such a sweeping anti-terror power " .
" But Parliament now needs to do its job , respond to the damning Court of Human Rights judgement and tighten up the law without delay , " she said .

One bite of Mile End ’s Ruth Wilensky sandwich proves definitively that handmade food wins out .
It is an homage to  some might say a copy of a famous Montreal sandwich , the Wilensky ’s Special .
Ruth Wilensky is the matriarch of the family that owns Wilensky ’s Light Lunch , a classic deli that once served a full menu , now pared down to just a single menu item : beef salami , bologna and mustard compressed between the griddled halves of an onion - sprinkled roll .
Asking for “ no mustard ” used to cost an extra nickel ; now , mustard is compulsory .
The Ruth Wilensky ; the pastrami biscuit at Neal ’s Deli in Carrboro , N.C. ; and the Jimmy ’s Special ( a Reuben sandwich in which bread is replaced by peppery potato latkes ) at Jimmy & Drew ’s 28th Street Deli in Boulder , Colo. , provide a taste of what a great modern deli  both neo and retro  might serve .
If anything can save the deli single - handedly , it ’s pastrami .
A Romanian - Jewish - American hybrid of barbecue , basturma ( Turkish dried , spiced meat ) and corned beef , it is loved by pit masters , salumieri and chefs alike .

Credit ... Travis Dove for The New York Times
Mr. Gordon , of Kenny & Zuke ’s in Portland , who grew up in Queens , graduated from La Varenne cooking school in France and cooked French food for 30 years before returning to the meaty tastes of his childhood , smokes 2,500 pounds of pastrami a week .
“ Once I settled down in Portland , Ore. , I realized that if I wanted to eat pastrami , I was going to have to make it myself , ” he said .
Pastrami , traditionally made from a fatty cut of beef belly called the navel , is not easy to master .
It must be brined for days or even weeks , rubbed , smoked , steamed and sliced at the peak of juiciness .
The seasonings  coriander , black pepper , salt , sugar , sometimes cumin or fennel seed  must sing in harmony .
At each step , attentiveness is required : to the shape of the piece , its fat content and the tendons that run through it .
Great slicers have become the stuff of legend : Katz ’s and Langer ’s , in Los Angeles , are among the only old - school delis that do it by hand .
Some feel strongly that the slices should be thick ; others , cold - cut thin .
All this means that pastrami fits right into two major contemporary food cults : traditional cured meats and barbecue .
Modern cooks are so enamored of meat that even those with no particular connection to delis  like Tom Mylan , of the Meat Hook in Brooklyn ; Elizabeth Falkner , of Orson in San Francisco ; and Amorette Casaus , of Ardesia in Midtown  now make their own small - batch versions .
Jake Dickson , of Dickson ’s Farmstand Meats in Chelsea , has developed a spicy lamb version ; housemade pastrami pork belly is on the menu at the elegant Aureole in Midtown ; and pastrami- style tongue has been spotted at Marlow & Daughters in Williamsburg , Brooklyn .

Note : due to a technical issue , this post has been republished .
Not everyone has the stomach for perusing the national income and product accounts , but one who does can learn a great deal about what ails the present economy and about its prospects for returning to a healthier condition .
( I draw the data I discuss here from Table B - 2 , “ Real gross domestic product , 1960 - 2009 , ” in the statistical appendix that accompanies the 2010 report of the president ’s council of economic advisers . )
We ’ve all been told , of course , that the real gross domestic product has fallen from its peak in the second quarter of 2008 .
The data show a fall of nearly 4 percent by the second quarter of 2009 .
Although this drop bears no serious comparison with the precipitous decline of real GDP during the Great Depression — about 30 percent between 1929 and 1933 — it has certainly entailed a great deal of difficulty and frustrated expectations in a situation where many people had made plans based on their anticipation of ongoing economic growth .
Between the second quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009 , real GDP grew by about 2 percent , making up for roughly half of the preceding decline .
To see why the recession has brought out the doomsayers in such great numbers during the past two years , notwithstanding the rather slight decline in national output , we must examine , among other things , the national product ’s components .
Doing so , we find , for example , that as usual in an economic slump , private consumption spending has held up much better than private investment spending : the former fell by less than 2 percent , and most of the decline was erased during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 , so that by the final quarter of last year , real private consumption spending was less than 1 percent below its previous quarterly peak .
So , judging by what has happened to GDP and to private consumption , one might conclude that the recession has been only a minor dip — how much difference can it make in our style of life if our consumption falls by 2 percent for a short while ?— and we might be tempted to conclude that getting out of the present troubles will be a task easily accomplished in the next few quarters .
Reaching such a conclusion , however , would be a mistake , because despite what the news media are always telling us about the preeminent importance of consumption spending in the determination of GDP , consumption does not drive genuine economic growth except in the very short run in a depressed economy .
Real economic progress turns on a high rate of investment — primarily business purchases of structures , equipment , software , and additions to inventories — and on this front the news has been much bleaker and the prospects for quick recovery much less encouraging .
Gross private domestic investment peaked in 2006 .
Between the first quarter of that year and the second quarter of 2009 , it fell by almost 34 percent .
During the following two quarters , it rose by only 10 percent , so that late last year it was still ( when measured at an annual rate ) running about 29 percent below its level early in 2006 .
Such a huge shortfall in investment spending portends an extended period of slow economic growth in the next few years , and perhaps in an even longer run .
Worn - out equipment , obsolete software , ill - maintained structures , and depleted inventories are not the stuff of which rapid , sustained economic growth is made .
The current investment drought does not simply reflect the housing bust consequent to the boom that drove residential investment to a peak in 2005 .
To be sure , real residential investment has fallen tremendously , by almost 53 percent between 2005 and 2009 , with especially rapid declines during the past three years .
Yet , real nonresidential investment also fell greatly last year , by 18 percent from its peak in 2008 .
Even real investment in equipment and software — a category only loosely connected to the housing boom and bust — declined last year by 17 percent , after occupying a high plateau during the preceding three years .
Business firms have also fled from inventory investment , trimming their holdings by an unprecedented $ 125 billion in 2009 , after lopping off $ 35 billion in 2008 .
If real investment spending has taken a huge hit , however , federal government spending has raced ahead in high gear .
Between 2007 and 2009 , federal purchases of newly produced final goods and services — the federal government ’s “ contribution ” to GDP — increased by more than 13 percent in constant dollars .
Unfortunately , whereas private investment is the engine of economic growth , government spending ( despite what generations of Keynesian economists have asserted ) is the brake .
Although increased government purchases by definition increase the measured national product , their substantive effect on the process of sustained economic growth is decidedly detrimental .
To understand this negative relationship , we need only to scrutinize how the federal government ’s spending is determined , namely , by political processes devoid of economic rationality , and to examine the overwhelmingly adverse effect of government ’s growth on the private economy ’s functioning .
In this light , we can appreciate that enhanced government spending does not actually bulk up the economy — it does not simply compensate for “ leakages ” from the circular flow of income generation , as the Keynesians imagine .
Nor does it merely crowd out worthwhile private activity .
Instead , it undercuts , penalizes , and distorts everything that private parties attempt to do to create genuine wealth .
Beefed - up regulations , additional taxes , and government takeovers are the known killers of the economic growth process .
Much of the government ’s “ contribution ” to GDP , of course , is pure waste , even if the recipients of the payments do nothing more to stand in the way of real progress : the government simply increases the compensation of its legions of drones and wreckers , or it spends money on items for which no private person , if he had any choice in the matter , would pay .
Worst of all , the investors ’ famine and the government ’s feast are not merely coincidental , but causally connected .
The explosion of the federal government ’s size , scope , and power since the middle of 2008 has created enormous uncertainties in the minds of investors .
New taxes and higher rates of old taxes ; potentially large burdens of compliance with new energy regulations and mandatory health - care expenses ; new , intrinsically arbitrary government oversight of so - called systemic risks associated with any type of business — all of these unsettling possibilities and others of substantial significance must give pause to anyone considering a long - term investment , because any one of them has the potential to turn what seems to be a profitable investment into a big loser .
In short , investors now face regime uncertainty to an extent that few have experienced in this country — to find anything comparable , one must go back to the 1930s and 1940s , when the menacing clouds of the New Deal and World War II darkened the economic horizon .
Unless the government acts soon to resolve the looming uncertainties about the half - dozen greatest threats of policy harm to business , investors will remain for the most part on the sideline , protecting their wealth in cash hoards and low - risk , low - return , short - term investments and consuming wealth that might otherwise have been invested .
If this situation continues for several years longer , the U.S. economy may well suffer its second “ lost decade ” for much the same reason that it suffered its first during the 1930s .
In the nearly two years since the US Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia 's ban on handguns , more than 190 challenges have been filed seeking to overturn other gun-control laws or to reverse firearms convictions .
Now , with the justices examining a similar ban in place in Chicago , gun-rights advocates are hoping for another landmark constitutional victory – this time extending an individual right to keep and bear arms in cities and towns across the country .
( To see a preview of this case , click here . )
But the ultimate showdown over gun control in America will be waged in a future legal case not yet on the high court 's radar , analysts say .
At issue in that case : Are Second Amendment rights as fundamental as freedom of speech and religion , or will gun rights be subject to lesser constitutional protection ?
The answer to that question – and the potential future course of gun control – may rest with a majority of the nine men and women on the Supreme Court .
When that future case arrives , it will all boil down to a three - word phrase of legal jargon : " standard of review . "
What does ' standard of review ' mean and how does it relate to gun rights ?
The way the Supreme Court protects individual constitutional rights against encroachment by the government is by weighing the government 's interest in a particular law against the individual right preserved in the Constitution .
For example , when the government passes a law censoring people from engaging in core political speech , the court requires the government to demonstrate it has a compelling interest in the censorship and to prove that the measure is the least intrusive means of achieving that governmental interest .
If it can't prove both , the law must be struck down .
Not all rights warrant the toughest level of constitutional protection .
In the intermediate level , judges often attempt to balance competing interests to reach the proper outcome .
What standard of review do gun-control advocates want ?
The Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence has filed a friend - of - the - court brief in the Chicago case urging the justices to establish a standard of review in which judges would be reluctant to overturn gun-control regulations enacted by elected officials .
" Gun policy is best determined as it always has been in this country : in the political arena , without courts second - guessing reasoned legislative judgments , " writes Paul Wolfson in his brief on behalf of the Brady Center .
What standard of review are gun-rights supporters seeking ?
Many argue that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right that can be limited only in the narrowest circumstances and only when the government demonstrates a compelling reason .
" We think the Constitution provides the proper test .
It is : ' shall not be infringed , ' " said Larry Pratt , executive director of Gun Owners of America , quoting from the amendment .
" We think ' shall not ' means ' none . ' "
Are the Supreme Court 's gun cases interconnected ?
The court is engaged in what could become a three - step process .
The Washington decision in 2008 established that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self - protection in the home .
In the second step , the court will determine whether the Second Amendment applies to state and local governments .
The case currently before the court , McDonald v. Chicago , is a challenge to Chicago 's handgun ban , which is like the one struck down in Washington .
If the high court extends the same Second Amendment protection nationwide , then the third step would involve the court establishing a uniform standard of review to guide lower court judges in assessing which gun-control measures are permitted under the Second Amendment .
What have the justices said about the standard of review in gun cases ?
The majority justices addressed this issue briefly in the Washington decision .
" Like most rights , the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited , " wrote Justice Antonin Scalia .
" Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms , " Justice Scalia said .
( For Monitor coverage of the Washington decision , click here . )
This suggests that the majority justices were of the view that some gun-control laws will be subject to a level of intermediate judicial scrutiny .
But it 's not clear whether that standard will apply in all cases , or whether others will require more rigorous " strict scrutiny . "
Why is the standard of review so important ?
It is potentially the most significant aspect of the Supreme Court 's emerging Second Amendment jurisprudence , because it will determine which gun-control laws will be upheld and which wo n't .
The Washington decision brought a flood of challenges to gun-control laws , but most were upheld , said Dennis Henigan , vice president for law and policy at the Brady Center .
" There has not been a wholesale invalidation of gun laws , with only one exception , " he said .
That involved a law forcing anyone indicted for child pornography to immediately surrender his or her firearms .
Two federal judges invalidated the law because it violated the presumption of innocence .
What record do state judges have when ruling on gun-control measures ?
In assessing the constitutionality of gun-control laws , Mr. Henigan said , state judges have placed significant weight on the government 's interest in regulating firearms as a means to protect public safety .
The Supreme Court should adopt the same rationale , he said .
Mr. Pratt of Gun Owners of America disagreed : " I should be able to carry a firearm wherever and however I want without any never mind from the government , " he said .
On Sunday , vigils around the country and internationally will be held for my friends Sarah and Shane , and their friend Josh , who have been held in jail in Iran since July 31 of last year .
The last time any outsiders saw them was in October .
A month ago they were each able to make a short phone call to their families .
They have not been charged .
They have not been allowed to see their lawyer .
Most recently , Iran 's intelligence minister said he has " credible evidence " that my friends are linked to U.S. intelligence .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Such a claim would be laughable if it were n't so serious .
If you are able to join a vigil on Sunday , please do so .
Here 's the list .
The NYC vigil will take place at Grand Army Plaza , the main entrance to Prospect Park in Brooklyn , at 1 PM .

Bush , Obama , and the Intellectuals
Spring 2010
America 's intellectual class seems to adore President Barack Obama nearly as much as it reviled his predecessor .
While George W. Bush was routinely derided for his purported lack of intelligence and learning , Obama has been embraced by the intellectuals as one of their own — to a degree unmatched by any president since perhaps Woodrow Wilson .
Indeed , New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof spoke for many when he argued after the 2008 election that " American voters have just picked a president who is an open , out - of - the - closet , practicing intellectual . "
Rebecca Mead of the New Yorker even sought to make it official , calling Obama a " certified intellectual . "
This difference in attitudes says as much about the state of American intellectuals as it does about Bush and Obama .
It also highlights the complicated relationship between intellectuals and the modern American presidency .
That relationship has been of great interest to recent presidents ; most chief executives since John Kennedy have tended , in some overt way , to their links with the nation 's intellectual elite .
They have sought to use these intellectuals to their own advantage , whether as expert advisors , cultural ornaments , or political cover .
The story of those efforts , and of the assumptions underlying them , illustrates the changing role of intellectuals in our culture — from esteemed and establishmentarian , to countercultural and oppositional , to highly politicized and partisan .
This narrative can also help us better understand the interplay of elitism and populism in our recent political history .
Above all , it is a cautionary tale for President Obama .
THE RISE OF THE INTELLECTUALS
The term " intellectual " took the place of the old - fashioned " man of letters " sometime near the end of the 19th century — first among the French , and then the English and Americans .
This difference in terms also reflects a difference in kind .
A man of letters — while not necessarily a professor in a university — was a learned observer of the times , but tended to offer insights rooted in more timeless truths and principles .
Drawing from a broad knowledge of the canon — of history , philosophy , science , literature , or art — he informed the views of other educated people about various social , political , or cultural issues of the day .
Modern intellectuals , too , are learned commentators on contemporary events .
But they tend to be less concerned with a knowledge of the canon , and more fixated on these issues of the day , and often seek a mass audience in our mass democracy .
We even have a subset of intellectuals who are particularly involved in public affairs , either inside or outside of government .
Historian Russell Jacoby labeled them " public intellectuals , " usually well - known , well - educated generalists who can speak or write about most subjects , injecting their own overarching worldviews into their pronouncements .
These public intellectuals are , in many ways , the opinion - shapers of the growing educated class .
Some are academics ; others are writers , critics , or journalists ; most have gone through a few elite universities , at least as undergraduates ; all try to contend with social and political reality at the conceptual level , so as to offer a perspective that provides some coherence to politics and current events .
Of course , the reality of their existence is not always so high - minded :
They also form a community of intellectuals , with its own , often low - minded , politics and culture , and its own complex connections to the popular culture and the rough - and - tumble of American politics .
Intellectuals have in fact played a conspicuous role in our national politics , and especially presidential politics , since at least the 1930s .
To contend with the Great Depression , and to assure the country that he was putting the best minds in America to work on the crisis , Franklin Roosevelt famously gathered a " Brain Trust " of prominent academics and policy experts around him .
These men , drawn from elite universities ( particularly the faculties of Harvard and Columbia ) , helped both to design the programmatic substance of the New Deal and to shape the administration 's early case for it .
The prominence of the Brain Trust coincided with a broader improvement in the standing of intellectuals in American life .
Since the days of Andrew Jackson , if not earlier , Americans had been suspicious of the sophisticated expert claiming to know it all .
But the Roosevelt era marked the start of a 60 - year period of almost constant crisis — from the Great Depression through World War II and the Cold War — and of increasingly complex governing challenges at home and abroad .
This period raised the stakes of American politics , and created a need for expert advice .
Although intellectuals do not inherently make for superior policy advisors , presidents throughout this era were eager to reassure the public that the country 's brightest minds were on the job ; the constant state of emergency also motivated many intellectuals to donate their services to the nation .
The traditional American suspicion of the arrogant and over - educated expert began to subside , and in its place emerged a palpable desire — if not admiration — for responsible expertise and learned opinion .
This trend intensified after the Soviet Union beat the United States into space with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 .
As historian Richard Hofstadter put it , after Sputnik , " the national distaste for intellect appeared to be not just a disgrace but a hazard to survival . "
Washington issued a call for experts , and an assortment of specialists answered .
The initial pursuit of scientific and technical expertise quickly grew into an appreciation for experts and academics of all sorts — including intellectuals .
By the 1960s , Hofstadter found the nation 's capital decidedly " hospitable to Harvard professors and ex-Rhodes Scholars . "
Changing educational patterns also played a role in this evolving attitude .
In the years following World War II , as a result of higher living standards and the G.I. Bill of Rights , many more Americans were attending college .
By 1956 , the final year of the original G.I. Bill , American institutions of higher learning granted almost 240,000 more degrees and employed almost 150,000 more faculty members than they had at the time of the bill 's enactment 12 years earlier .
This influx of students and faculty not only provided more jobs for the intellectually inclined , but also changed the attitudes of a vast swath of the country about the significance of academic training and the value of those who possessed it .
The elite intellectuals ' rise to prominence was especially noticeable in Democratic Party politics , and demonstrated best by Adlai Stevenson — the party 's presidential standard - bearer in 1952 and ' 56 — who both embodied and made use of the Democrats ' growing reputation as the party of the brainy avant garde .
As Stevenson eventually learned , being an " egghead " — a term famously used to describe him — was not always a good thing in electoral politics .
But being associated with the educated and sophisticated set did have its political advantages :
It lent the Democrats a certain cultural cachet as the party that governed with expertise .
And Stevenson 's successor to the Democratic presidential nomination would do a far better job of accentuating those advantages .
INTELLECTUALS AND THE MODERN PRESIDENCY
John Kennedy understood the glamour and mystique that intellectuals could bring to a White House .
The only president to win a Pulitzer Prize ( in 1957 for Profiles in Courage ) , Kennedy worked to secure intellectual support for his presidential campaign through the Academic Advising Committee — a group of professors from elite universities , brought together by Ted Sorensen , who coordinated policy proposals and academic endorsements .
As a result of the AAC 's efforts , Washington Post reporter Thomas Winship concluded in late 1959 that Kennedy stood " on the verge of ‘ owning ' a remarkable segment of New England 's university and industrial brain power — lock , stock , and speechwriting pad . "
Kennedy saw intellectuals as opinion - shapers of the liberal establishment , and thought that by being identified with them , he could reinforce his own elite establishment credentials .
According to Sorensen , Kennedy even saw himself as " something of an ivory tower president . "
So while building his own image as a cool and debonair leader , Kennedy consciously cultivated the sense that his administration was composed of serious , earnest thinkers — the best and brightest America had to offer .
In addition to tapping prominent academics to serve in cabinet posts and as White House advisors , Kennedy even created a role for an administration " in-house intellectual " — a job specifically designed for and filled by historian Arthur Schlesinger .
Schlesinger laid out his vision of the job in a memo to Kennedy written during the post-election transition .
The historian saw himself as part cultural advisor , part liaison to the academy and the world of ideas , and part one - man liberal idea factory .
He also knew that his role would incorporate a political purpose : to make the left feel better about Kennedy .
" I should add that it might also be of use to have someone in the White House in whom labor and liberals would find what you once called ‘ visual reassurance ' and whom they could trust as a channel for communications , " Schlesinger wrote to the president - elect .
By shunning any particular policy responsibility , Schlesinger excluded himself from Kennedy 's inner circle , and his activities suggest that he was kept at a distance from key policy decisions and debates .
In his time at the White House , Schlesinger wrote articles and film reviews for various publications , corresponded with the nation 's intellectual and cultural elites , advised Kennedy on assorted cultural matters , worked with Americans for Democratic Action to promote the liberal agenda , and accumulated research for the book he eventually wrote about the Kennedy White House .
In short , Arthur Schlesinger was paid a handsome salary to be ... Arthur Schlesinger .
From Kennedy 's perspective , he was worth every penny — not only as a link to intellectuals who offered important public support ( like Archibald Cox and John Kenneth Galbraith ) , but , it turned out , also as a guardian of the Kennedy legacy .
In no small part because of Schlesinger and his Pulitzer Prize - winning book , A Thousand Days , the Kennedy mystique endured long after the president 's untimely death — sustained by this narrative of intellectual seriousness and cultural sophistication .
No president until Barack Obama managed to win the trust and adoration of American intellectuals as Kennedy did .
The reasons have as much to do with changes in the culture of elite American intellectuals as with the attitudes of subsequent presidents .
Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon Johnson , was not nearly as well suited to attract the adulation of the smart set :
The Texan was uneasy with the liberal , East Coast intellectual community , and its members more than repaid his unease — generally viewing " Uncle Cornpone " as some kind of reactionary southern demagogue , even as he advanced the liberal agenda far more effectively than Kennedy had .
Johnson did follow Kennedy 's example of hiring a court intellectual to help burnish his image and manage his relations with the academy and the world of high culture .
But Johnson 's choice , Princeton history professor Eric Goldman , ended up reinforcing rather than mitigating the perception that Johnson was anti-intellectual .
As the anti-Vietnam War movement heated up , Goldman found himself caught between his boss and the worlds of the academy and the arts , where opposition to the war was growing .
American intellectuals were becoming radicalized , and the norms of the elite establishment no longer governed their behavior .
These changes came to the surface in 1965 , when Goldman was assigned to organize a White House Festival of the Arts , intended in large part to boost Johnson 's reputation among the intelligentsia .
The event achieved just the opposite :
One prominent invitee , the poet Robert Lowell , publicly pulled out to protest Johnson 's Vietnam policies ; cultural critic Dwight MacDonald , another invitee , attended but circulated a petition supporting Lowell 's protest against the war .
These actions prompted the prim and proper White House social secretary Bess Abell to tell Goldman that " these people of yours — and this festival — have done nothing but cause trouble for the President . "
MacDonald followed up with a scathing essay against Johnson in the New York Review of Books , and the whole episode only heightened the tensions between the White House and many intellectuals over Vietnam .
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , particularly as a result of the Vietnam debate ( though also in connection with the broader culture war then heating up ) , America 's elite intellectuals — from perches at leading universities , prominent publications , and key cultural institutions — gradually transformed themselves from the voice of the establishment to the leading edge of a newly radicalized liberalism .
Johnson 's attempts to contend with this change would come to embody the Democrats ' approach to presidential relations with American intellectuals — offering symbolic gestures meant to borrow some cultural cachet , while often ignoring the intellectuals ' substantive views on policy questions .
Johnson 's successor , Richard Nixon , pursued what would become a Republican model for contending with the radicalization of the academy and the arts : the elevation and cultivation of alternative intellectuals , men and women disenchanted by the radicalism of their colleagues and more inclined toward cultural and political conservatism .
In this way , Republicans actually came to give intellectuals more meaningful roles in the management of the government , while liberals tended to employ them for symbolism and cover .
Nixon 's in - house intellectual was a thorn in the side of many liberals : Daniel Patrick Moynihan .
A Harvard professor who had served as assistant secretary of labor in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations ( where he gained notoriety for a 1965 report warning about the collapse of the black family ) , Moynihan had little patience for the increasing radicalism of many fellow academics .
He was ( and always remained ) a Democrat , but by the time Nixon was elected in 1968 , Moynihan was part of the emerging neoconservative movement of intellectuals disenchanted with the left .
And Nixon was drawn to the possibility of offering up his own intellectuals to oppose those of the liberal intelligentsia he so detested .
As urban - affairs advisor and later in the nebulous role of " counselor to the president , " Moynihan wrote a number of brilliant memoranda for Nixon , criticizing liberal elites for the very excesses that had brought about Moynihan 's own disenchantment , from cultural radicalism to misguided welfare policies .
His enmity toward the radical left was repaid in kind ( and then some ) :
In one 1970 memo , Moynihan wrote to the president that " yesterday in Cambridge the SDS [ Students for a Democratic Society ] announced that my house would be burned during the night .
The University asked my family to ‘ evacuate ' and they , in effect , went into hiding . "
Nothing happened that night , but upon receiving the memo , Nixon ordered Secret Service protection for Moynihan 's family .
Moynihan eventually left the White House under a cloud of controversy after liberals attacked his recommendation that the administration adopt a policy of " benign neglect " toward the black community .
Moynihan 's intent in the memo was to encourage the administration to dial down its racial rhetoric so as not to send the black community into the arms of radical black leaders .
But when his memo on the subject was leaked to the New York Times ( quite possibly by a young Leon Panetta ) , the subsequent , sensationalized front - page story put Moynihan at the center of yet another controversy involving race .
Civil - rights leaders and liberal journalists responded with outrage , and the furor made Moynihan 's continued tenure at the White House impossible .
Despite his difficulties , however , Moynihan played an important role in the development of a conservative intellectual response to liberalism .
In his informal role as intellectual liaison , Moynihan tried to encourage Nixon to cultivate conservative intellectuals to defend the Republican point of view .
As Moynihan wrote in a long 1970 memo to Nixon , " No one writes articles for us , much less books , plays , or folk songs . "
He also warned Nixon of the possibility of a Kulturkampf in the political press , which the left was winning by driving out liberal but non-radical reporters in favor of younger , radical replacements .
As Moynihan described this process at the New York Times , " every time one of [ the veterans ] goes and is replaced by a new recruit from the Harvard Crimson or whatever , the Maoist faction on West 43d Street gets one more vote .
No one else applies . "
The solution to these twin problems , Moynihan argued , was to have Nixon begin associating with academics and intellectuals who understood what he was up to , and who could amplify Nixon 's agenda " on the basis of their special competencies . "
Moynihan understood his own limitations in this regard , writing that he could n't do it because " It needs to be done by real Republicans . "
He therefore recommended that the administration increase its outreach to non-liberal professors who could begin to defend the administration 's positions .
Some of the people Moynihan suggested should be invited to meet with the president included James Q. Wilson , Aaron Wildavsky , David Riesman , Sidney Hook , Lionel Trilling , Irving Kristol , and Robert Nisbet .
None of them ended up filling Moynihan 's shoes , but Moynihan did begin the process of putting non-liberal intellectuals , including some thinkers who were emerging as neoconservatives , on the White House radar screen .
He established a model for what a more conservative , or at least a non-liberal , intellectual — one expressly out of line with the mainstream of the academy and highbrow culture — could do in the White House .
It was a model subsequent Republican presidents , beginning with Nixon 's successor Gerald Ford , would look to and build upon .
During Ford 's brief tenure , the White House intellectual - in- residence was political - philosophy professor Robert Goldwin — the first out - and - out conservative to serve in such a role .
( Moynihan , for all of his neoconservative tendencies , reverted back to liberalism after winning election as a Democratic U.S. senator from New York in 1976 . )
While Goldwin had significant intellectual credentials — as a professor at the University of Chicago and Kenyon College , and later as dean of St. John 's College — he served less as a policy advisor , and more as a link between the president and the burgeoning conservative intellectual world .
Prominent conservative thinkers like Irving Kristol , Thomas Sowell , and James Q. Wilson were beginning to build a kind of elite case for populism in American politics — for defending traditional American values against a radical onslaught led by the left - leaning intellectuals , who increasingly inhabited the upper tiers of America 's educational and cultural institutions .
It was these conservative intellectuals whom Goldwin invited to meet with and advise President Ford ; he made no pretense of serving as a liaison to his more liberal academic colleagues .
As Donald Rumsfeld , who was Ford 's chief of staff , wrote in a recent obituary for Goldwin : " Bob Goldwin was the Ford administration 's one - man think tank , its intellectual compass , and bridge to a new conservatism — a conservatism that was unashamed to be conservative . "
Goldwin's approach to his job foreshadowed the growing split between liberal and conservative intellectuals ( a split that , in our time , has become an outright chasm ) .
This alternative conservative intelligentsia would always claim much smaller numbers ( and less general influence ) than the liberal academic community , which would continue to dominate American intellectual life and define the mainstream of intellectual culture .
But when it came to the White House , conservative thinkers would often be taken more seriously by Republican presidents than liberal intellectuals were by Democrats — and so would come to play a crucial role in American public life .
This relative marginalization of liberal intellectuals could be seen in 1976 , with the election of Jimmy Carter — who returned to something like Lyndon Johnson 's ambivalence toward intellectuals .
Carter had run as a centrist populist who had promised to clean up Washington in the wake of the Watergate scandal ; he did not feel compelled to brandish intellectual credentials or surround himself with eggheads .
He also shared some of Johnson 's mistrust of the intellectual elite : Former Carter speechwriter James Fallows notes that when experts from Harvard and the Brookings Institution came to brief Carter on various policy issues during the ' 76 campaign , the candidate joked with his staff that these wonks would call him " a dumb southern redneck when he made his first mistake . "
Carter employed no permanent representative to the intellectual class , and his occasional efforts at outreach often did not end well .
One famous attempt to co-opt the reigning intellectual zeitgeist — Carter 's so - called " malaise speech " in 1979 , which drew on the writings of and reflected consultation with historian Christopher Lasch — ended in political disaster .
And Carter 's initial diffidence toward liberal intellectuals left him with few defenders among them when things went awry .
Carter 's successor , Ronald Reagan , resumed the " alternative intellectuals " approach begun by fellow Republicans Nixon and Ford .
Although Reagan was despised and derided by most liberal intellectuals , he did not share Nixon 's intense resentment toward them .
He did , however , make use of the growing — if still quite small — conservative intelligentsia that had been gathering in Washington since the Nixon years .
This was what journalist Theodore White called a " corps of intellectual outriders , absent in Republican politics since Theodore Roosevelt had given up the White House seventy - two years earlier . "
Though Reagan did not employ one particular " White House intellectual , " he did tap Martin Anderson — an alumnus of the Nixon White House and a member of Reagan 's Economic Policy Advisory Board — to serve as an informal advisor on intellectual developments , and to provide a link to the world of conservative thought .
Anderson also acted as a one - man job bank for conservative scholars :
In the 1980 campaign , he had compiled a list of roughly 500 professors , think - tank scholars , and writers who supported Reagan ; after the election , many of them filtered into administration jobs .
In addition , the Heritage Foundation , a relatively new think tank , set up a computerized personnel system to help find conservatives to fill administration positions .
The list of pundits , experts , and intellectuals who worked in the Reagan administration is enormous : William Kristol , William Bennett , Jeane Kirkpatrick , Chester Finn , Dinesh D'Souza , Michael Ledeen , Peggy Noonan , Richard Perle , Pe ter Robinson , Peter Wallison , John Cogan , Murray Weidenbaum , Elliott Abrams , Doug Bandow , Peter Wehner , Michael Horowitz , Paul Wolfowitz , William Niskanen , Christopher DeMuth , and Terry Eastland , just to name a few .
Most of these people served in positions too junior to have spent significant time with Reagan himself , yet they all felt his affinity for " idea people , " and many still cite his presidency as the epitome of a conservative administration .
This infusion of conservative thinkers helped give the Reagan administration its flavor , and is one reason Reagan remains a favorite of conservative intellectuals to this day .
George H. W. Bush , in contrast , avoided selecting his political appointees from among academics and writers .
In fact , he tended to avoid the conservative intelligentsia in general , preferring to cultivate the image of a down - to - earth pragmatist and manager .
After the 1988 election , one Bush transition official told the Washington Post that " Our people do n't have agendas .
They have mortgages . "
This refusal to nurture the intellectuals ultimately hurt Bush , just as it had damaged Jimmy Carter 's standing on the left in the 1970s .
Many of the leading conservative thinkers felt frozen out by Bush , and many Washington conservatives abandoned him .
Some , including the New York Times 's William Safire and the American Enterprise Institute 's Joshua Muravchik and Ben Wattenberg , even ended up supporting his opponent in the 1992 election , Bill Clinton .
For his part , Clinton courted left - leaning intellectuals far more effectively than had fellow Democrats Carter and Johnson .
Some received prominent appointments in Clinton 's administration , like Harvard political economist - turned - labor secretary Robert Reich .
More noteworthy , however , was Clinton 's concerted effort to demonstrate his interest in the views of well - known public intellectuals — stroking their egos , and treating them as a constituency in themselves .
In preparation for the 1996 State of the Union address , for example , Clinton aides compiled a briefing book full of ideas from writers as different as radio commentator Garrison Keillor and historian David Herbert Donald .
Clinton also hosted White House dinners with scholars like Henry Louis Gates , Jr. , Alan Ehrenhalt , and Robert Putnam ; he even took pains to flatter the intellectuals by letting reporters know whose books he was reading .
In his second term , Clinton hired the sharp - penned journalist Sidney Blumenthal — in part to help formulate policy , but also to sell Clinton 's agenda in Washington intellectual circles .
As it turned out , Blumenthal was of greatest value during the Monica Lewinsky scandal , when he worked with many liberal intellectuals to defend Clinton and got several noted historians to sign a petition saying they felt impeachment was historically and constitutionally inappropriate .
The support Blumenthal helped generate — coming at a time when many analysts were ready to toll the death knell for Clinton 's political career — may well have helped save the Clinton presidency .
Clinton 's approach both exploited and intensified the partisan character of the American intellectual world .
By the 1990s , both the left and the right had their own intellectuals , and even those not professionally expert in politics — like professors of literature and cultural critics — regularly involved themselves in partisan disputes .
While most liberal American intellectuals no longer fanned radical student revolts , they had become radicalized in a different — more mundane and political — way , and had become dully reliable partisans .
Their conservative counterparts , meanwhile , existed mostly in reaction to the liberals , and so were often nearly as predictable .
This gradual evolution of American intellectual culture helps to explain the reaction of the country 's liberal cultural and scholarly elite to George W. Bush — a response that was intensely and unremittingly negative from the moment he stepped on the national stage .
BUSH DERANGEMENT
On paper , George W. Bush ( Andover ' 64 , Yale ' 68 , Harvard M.B.A. ' 75 ) might have held some appeal for American intellectuals .
He certainly had more formal education , and at more highly regarded schools , than most American presidents .
In practice , however , Bush was the epitome of everything the culturally liberal intellectuals despised .
He was much more a Texas businessman — an oil man , no less — than a northeastern Ivy Leaguer .
Both his personal instincts and his political ambitions led Bush to present himself as more redneck than blueblood :
After he lost his first election — a 1978 congressional race , and the only election he ever lost —
Bush vowed , as he would later put it , " never to get out - countried again . "
But his determination not to get " out - countried " did not mean that Bush was uninterested in engaging scholars and wonks .
In an interview with Time magazine 's Walter Isaacson at the 2000 Republican Convention , Bush said , " My job is to get good thinkers and get the best out of them . "
His approach to the campaign suggested this was more than mere rhetoric :
In 1998 , while contemplating a run for the White House , Bush met with Hoover Institution scholars over dinner at former Secretary of State George Shultz 's home .
The encounter impressed Martin Anderson , who had collected intellectual support for Nixon and later Reagan .
According to Anderson , the scholars " all kind of looked at each other and said , ‘ Hey , this guy 's really good . ' "
From then on , Anderson and his colleagues helped Bush gain the support of conservative think - tank scholars and writers , which proved critical to his success in the 2000 Republican primaries .
But even as he pursued the usual Republican path of drawing on the conservative intellectual community that had developed as an alternative to the increasingly liberal world of the academy , Bush also cultivated an alternative to the alternative .
He assembled a group of religiously inclined and culturally conservative writers and scholars who embodied what had come to be known as " compassionate conservatism " — a set of ideas that Bush put at the center of his 2000 campaign agenda .
These thinkers argued that , to win elections , the right would need to do much more than offer a vision of a smaller federal government .
Conservatives , they said , should speak to the concerns of the poorest and weakest , and take up the mantle of humanitarianism through conservative means .
They called for conservative - minded approaches to dealing with poverty , education reform , and assisting the children of prisoners , among other causes — approaches that would take culture and not just economics seriously , and that would seek solutions beyond welfare checks .
The core of their vision was fostering greater cooperation between government and local grassroots groups — including and especially religious groups , previously denied access to most federal support — in providing social services .
Their ranks included Manhattan Institute scholar Myron Magnet , former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith , University of Texas journalism professor Marvin Olasky , and the University of Pennsylvania 's John DiIulio , as well as Michael Gerson — a congressional aide whom Bush hired as his chief speechwriter , and who imbued Bush 's rhetoric with compassionate - conservative themes .
Bush brought only two of these prominent compassionate - conservative thinkers into the White House — Gerson , who was his chief speechwriter during his first term and an important policy advisor during both terms , and DiIulio , who briefly headed the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives during Bush 's first year in office .
But Bush drew on the ideas that had emerged from the circle of compassionate - conservative thinkers throughout his eight years in the White House ( something I observed first - hand , as a Bush domestic - policy advisor and deputy secretary of Health and Human Services ) .
Bush relied heavily on that close circle of thinkers , but he also went out of his way to forge links with the broader intellectual world .
His approach reflected his M.B.A. training :
He employed a more corporate model than previous presidents had , and explicitly assigned the role of intellectual outreach to one unit within the White House .
Bush created an Office of Strategic Initiatives , to be headed by a deputy assistant to the president who would report to senior advisor Karl Rove .
For most of Bush 's eight years in office , OSI was headed by Peter Wehner , a conservative writer and long - time protégé of former education secretary and drug czar William Bennett .
Wehner did not come to the White House with a defined intellectual persona or an outsized national reputation , as Moynihan or Schlesinger had .
But he was known and respected among the conservative intellectual set , and proved well suited to act as a bridge between the administration and the world of ideas .
Wehner saw his task as two - fold : to keep the president informed about developments in the intellectual world that might have implications for his decision - making , and to communicate the administration 's views and policy goals to intellectual elites in Washington and around the country .
Wehner soon began the practice of sending mass e-mail messages to a large list of opinion leaders and scholars , making the president 's case at a level of detail that went far beyond the typical government document .
He would often answer critics at length , or direct his readers ' attention to important new essays or articles .
Unlike press releases or official communiqués , these messages did not go through the cumbersome White House clearance process ; they were relatively informal , and therefore gave readers some fresh , genuine insight into the administration 's thinking .
Wehner was also responsible for keeping the president and his senior staff informed of debates about administration policy in the world of serious opinion writing .
As White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten described the job to the Washington Post in 2007 : " Pete has the luxury of not having a specific line [ of ] responsibility so he can step back and read all of the informed commentary , digest it and draw the right conclusions from it . "
Wehner 's other activities included , as the Post put it , " organiz[ing ] meetings for the president with historians and scholars , host[ing ] a lecture series and put[ting ] together luncheon discussions for White House staff members to talk about the Federalist Papers , Abraham Lincoln , Martin Luther King Jr. or Alexis de Tocqueville . "
While his charge was not limited to the right , Wehner did work mainly with the conservative intellectual world , and made little headway in countering the larger liberal intelligentsia 's intense hatred toward Bush .
He brought left - leaning historians and other liberal scholars ( including David Hackett Fischer and David Kennedy ) to meet with the president on occasion , and made an effort to engage Bush 's more thoughtful critics directly .
But the general view among the smart set — that Bush was an untutored Texas cowboy — seemed only to worsen over time .
Bush himself contributed to that perception , of course .
Part of his appeal to voters in both 2000 and 2004 was his regular - guy image , and his campaigns openly mocked the more urbane ( if not effete ) mannerisms of both Al Gore and John Kerry .
This grated on many liberal intellectuals , who saw it as a kind of demagoguery .
As Damon Linker of the New Republic put it in November 2009 :
Everything about Bush — from his economically libertarian and socially conservative policies to his swaggering gait , mannered Southern drawl , and studied inarticulateness — was intended to convey the message that he was " one of us , " an average American bringing his hard - won common sense to bear on the most challenging problems of our time , many if not all of which could be traced to the influence of the godless liberal elites who " really " run the country from their decadent enclaves in New York and Hollywood .
Bush may have successfully used his regular - guy appeal to win the presidency , but it could not have been a surprise — indeed , it must surely have been , in part , his intention — that this approach would draw the ire of liberal intellectuals .
Linker 's diatribe , and the broadly shared attitude it described , indicated the shrill partisanship of many on the intellectual left .
But these objections were also reactions to cultural provocations .
They represented a flare - up of the longstanding hostility between elitists and populists in American culture — a hostility that appears undiminished , even in the post - Bush era .
Apart from his fraught interactions with the left , Bush 's relationship with the right - leaning intelligentsia was also far from smooth .
His compassionate - conservative agenda , for all its intellectual credentials , was not the preferred , limited - government approach of most conservative scholars and writers .
And his efforts at outreach notwithstanding , Bush 's policies — particularly those involving domestic spending — alienated important elements of the conservative intellectual world .
As an institutional matter , Bush 's outreach to intellectuals could well serve as a model for future presidents ( especially Republicans ) .
The establishment of an office specifically tasked with such outreach , and given a formal place in the White House organizational structure , helped Bush avoid some of the difficulties previous administrations had faced with their court intellectuals — such as ill - defined responsibilities , or the lack of a clear channel for getting ideas to the president .
But as a matter of substance and outcomes , Bush 's experience highlights the limits of intellectual outreach .
Like other Republican presidents , he confronted a relentlessly hostile liberal intelligentsia ; but unlike some Republican presidents , he sometimes chose sides within the conservative world — and so often divided , rather than strengthening and unifying , the right 's alternative intellectual infrastructure .
Bush did , however , continue the pattern by which Republican presidents actually use intellectuals and allow them to help define presidential agendas , while the Democrats often treat intellectuals as cultural ornaments .
The first year of Barack Obama 's term suggests that he , too , will extend this pattern — and so also suggests that he could face real dangers in his relationship with the liberal intellectual elite .
IS OBAMA AN EXCEPTION ?
Barack Obama 's reception by academics and intellectuals could hardly have differed more from Bush's .
Of course , Obama certainly has the formal credentials to be embraced by the smart set :
He is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School , was editor of the law review at Harvard and a law professor at the University of Chicago , and authored a thoughtful ( if youthful ) memoir .
More important , however , is the fact that Obama shares the cultural predilections of many liberal intellectuals .
The insight he offered up at a 2008 campaign fundraiser in San Francisco — that Pennsylvanians and Midwesterners " get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations " — inadvertently revealed a mind very much at home on the left flank of the culture wars .
Other occasions have also highlighted Obama 's comfort among the intellectuals : Last year , when Harvard 's Henry Louis Gates , Jr. — perhaps the nation 's best - known African - American professor — was involved in a bizarre confrontation with the Cambridge Police Department , Obama strangely weighed in by publicly criticizing the cops and proclaiming that " Skip Gates is a friend . "
It was the sort of response one might expect at a faculty meeting — but not from the president of a law - and - order nation that reveres its first responders .
Obama 's style and approach to decision - making in office have also won him kudos from intellectual observers who appreciate " his deliberateness , his empiricism , and his suspicion of easy answers , " as Paul Glastris wrote in Washington Monthly late in 2008 .
This easy praise from academics and the literati — praise that often seems to be driven as much by distaste for George W. Bush as admiration for his successor — has largely spared Obama the task of cultivating relationships with the intellectuals .
While there is no shortage of Ph.D.s in his administration — most prominently among Peter Orszag 's staff at the Office of Management and Budget — Obama has no liaison to the intellectual world , formal or informal .
He has closed down the Office of Strategic Initiatives , and has so far avoided explicit outreach to the academic world ( aside from occasional meetings with historians — a longstanding White House tradition ) .
When recently asked by a reporter about his reading habits , Obama replied : " I do n't get a chance to read things other than briefing books very often these days . "
It is almost impossible to imagine that any of his recent predecessors would have given such an answer ( or gotten away with it if he had ) ; all made a point of showing off their reading lists to highlight their intellectual seriousness .
Curiously , Obama 's most famous meeting with public intellectuals actually involved conservatives .
Shortly before his inauguration , he attended a dinner at the home of Washington Post columnist George Will ; the other invitees were some of the most prominent gatekeepers of the conservative press , including Weekly Standard editor William Kristol and conservative columnists like the Washington Post 's Charles Krauthammer and the New York Times 's David Brooks .
According to one report , the evening was filled with " considerable wonkery and in - depth discussions of taxes . "
It also earned the president - elect some good , if anonymous , reviews from some of the attendees , one of whom said : " He 's an articulate , smart guy . "
After some grumbling from the left , the Obama team put together a meeting for liberal columnists the next morning .
The whole incident showed both that Obama felt confident that he could hold his own among some of his smartest critics , and that he felt less of a need to reach out to liberal thought leaders whom he assumed would remain on his side .
This degree of both comfort and detachment , like so much of Obama 's governing style in his first year , suggests the expectation of indefinite good times ahead .
It is not a style well suited to times of trial and difficulty , which inevitably arise in any presidency .
In their tending to the intellectual community , Obama 's predecessors understood that they were building links and foundations that would prove useful when the going got tough .
The two other recent presidents who failed to do so — Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush — both paid a political price .
Obama , of course , begins from a position of much greater strength in his relationship with liberal academics and writers .
But as George W. Bush learned from some conservative intellectuals , disappointed former supporters can be at least as dangerous as outright political enemies .
President Obama would be foolish to assume that he can count on the support of liberal intellectuals regardless of his actions in the coming years ( especially when it comes to his foreign - policy decisions , which have already stoked liberal discontent ) .
Nor should he underestimate the damage he would suffer if the cultural and academic elites who have backed him so far suddenly turned their knives against him .
Precisely because Obama 's presidency rests , in part , on his status as a cultural phenomenon , he would pay a heavy price for losing their support .
Obama would therefore be wise to learn some lessons — both positive and negative — from his predecessors ' relationships with the intellectual world .
From Kennedy comes the insight that an in - house intellectual can play a useful role , even if largely for show .
From Johnson , Obama should learn never to assume that liberal intellectuals will always be on his side in changing times .
Nixon provides a useful model for reaching across the aisle to bring in a noted centrist intellectual — one who might provide Obama a counterweight to some of his own White House 's regnant orthodoxies .
Or Obama might follow Ford 's approach , and call upon an orthodox thinker of his own party — but one who would bring in some top minds , of differing opinions , to consult on a regular basis .
Reagan could teach him that friendly intellectuals can be useful as political appointees — and that drawing them in can greatly improve his standing , both in a crunch and over the long term .
Looking to George W. Bush 's example , Obama might consider formalizing some structure for communicating with prominent opinion leaders — and so break through the bubble that often traps presidents and isolates them from the outside world .
These approaches , for all their differences , do offer one lesson in common : that a president ignores the intellectual community at his peril .
And the trajectory of this tale of intellectuals and presidents suggests a deeper , and perhaps more troubling , lesson about American society : that we now live in an era of distinctly blue and red intellectuals — of two competing realms of ideas , on opposite sides of a culture war that , in some important respects , is more heated than ever .
This polarization of public intellectuals makes policy formulation — not to mention governing — far more difficult .
As both Bush and now Obama have witnessed , ideas generated by one side are automatically — and , thanks to the internet , immediately — derided by the idea generators on the other side .
In an ideal situation , intellectuals could help guide a nation facing seemingly intractable divisions — by cooling passions with reasoned argument , or proposing new and innovative solutions .
A world divided into red and blue intellectuals , however , is more apt to add to , rather than diminish , both our challenges and our divisions .
This development portends ill not only for Obama , but also for our ability to address the many complex problems we will face in the years to come .
On this front , as on a host of others , President Obama 's first year in office suggests that he believes his administration will be an exception — that he alone can find the easy solutions to problems that routinely vexed the men who came before him .
History , as ever , suggests otherwise .
IF WE’RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AUDIENCE SOPHISTICATION … .
There have been a few entertaining exchanges of late between “ The Daily Show ’s ” Jon Stewart and Fox News contributor Bernie Goldberg , but there was something the conservative media critic said last night that seemed especially noteworthy .
It started when Goldberg and other Fox News personalities started over - generalizing about what liberals think , after having complained about the way liberals over - generalize .
It prompted Stewart to tell Fox News , “ Go f*ck yourselves . ”
This was n’t well received at Fox News HQ , and led to a discussion between Goldberg and Bill O’Reilly .
Goldberg conceded that Stewart had a point about over - generalizing , but proceeded to go after “ The Daily Show ” host anyway .
Responding directly to Stewart , Goldberg said , speaking into the camera :
“ You ’re just a safe Jay Leno , with a much smaller audience , but you get to say the F - bomb , which gives your incredibly unsophisticated audience the illusion — the illusion — that you ’re courageous and a renegade , but it ’s only an illusion . ”
Stewart ’s response is well worth watching —
I ’ve included the video below — and I was especially pleased to hear him explain , “ I know that I criticize you and Fox News a lot , but only because you ’re truly a terrible , cynical , disingenuous news organization . ”
Stewart also noted the contradiction underscoring the criticism of his audience — Goldberg thinks “ Daily Show ” viewers are “ elites ” and “ unsophisticated ” at the same time ?
But there ’s a related point I wanted to emphasize that Stewart did n’t mention .
In 2004 , the National Annenberg Election Survey found that Fox News viewers were the most confused about current events , while viewers of “ The Daily Show ” were among the best informed news consumers in the country .
Comedy Central , relying on data from Nielsen Media Research , also found that Stewart ’s audience not only knew more about current events , but were far better educated than Bill O’Reilly ’s audience .
Three years later , the Pew Research Study published a report showing that “ viewers of the Daily Show and the Colbert Report have the highest knowledge of national and international affairs , while Fox News viewers rank nearly dead last . ”
Bernie Goldberg , if you want to talk about “ incredibly unsophisticated audiences , ” we can talk about incredibly unsophisticated audiences .

Researchers at National Jewish Health have discovered a fundamental step in the development of the immune system , one that allows B cells to mature and fight disease by producing effective antibodies .
Immunologist Roberta Pelanda , PhD , and her colleagues have demonstrated that immature B cells in the bone marrow must receive a positive signal before they can migrate to the spleen where they mature and are activated .
In the March 15 , 2010 issue of The Journal of Experimental Medicine , the researchers also reported that a protein known as Erk helps deliver that positive signal .
" Our work demonstrates that the immune system uses both positive and negative selection processes to create an effective population of B cells , " said Dr. Pelanda , Associate Professor in the Integrated Department of Immunology at National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado Denver .
" A defect in either selection process could lead to autoimmunity or immune deficiency . "
Humans make millions of B cells every day , each one equipped with its own unique B - cell receptor .
Each receptor recognizes a specific protein fragment .
Once the receptor recognizes that fragment , the B cell becomes activated and releases antibodies that attack the protein or the cell it is on .
B - cell receptors first appear on developing B cells in the bone marrow .
Some of those receptors bind to proteins that are a normal part of the body , and could trigger an autoimmune attack .
Other receptors can be non-functional .
The selection process weeds out these dangerous and non-functional B cells to produce a population that can recognize a wide variety of foreign , potentially harmful invaders , but tolerate proteins that are a normal part of the organism .
Negative selection occurs in the bone marrow when potentially autoimmune B cells are detected , rejected and instructed to produce a different receptor .
The next step has been unclear .
Do B cells that survive negative selection leave the bone marrow on their own ?
Or do they need a signal that tells them to leave the marrow and migrate to the spleen ?
Dr. Pelanda and her colleagues knew that B - cell receptors deliver a constant , or ' tonic , ' signal , even when they are not activated .
They thought that tonic signal might direct appropriate B cells to leave the bone marrow , migrate to the spleen and mature .
Using a unique mouse model and an in vitro system designed specifically for B cells , Dr. Pelanda found that mice who make fewer B - cell receptors have fewer mature B cells in their spleens .
The B cells could have left the bone marrow but died because they did not have a B - cell receptor , known to be necessary for survival .
If that were the case , then a pro-survival factor , bcl - 2 , should have rescued mature B cells and increased their population .
It did not .
Thus , it became clear that immature B cells must receive a signal from the B - cell receptor that allows them to escape the bone marrow , migrate and mature .
" It is a very important checkpoint , " said Dr. Pelanda .
" Without it , B cells are stuck in the bone marrow , unable to circulate , mature and contribute to immune defense . "
Dr. Pelanda and her colleagues then activated the protein Erk by turning on the Ras gene , and saw that more B cells escaped the bone marrow to mature .
Conversely , when they blocked activation of Erk in normal B cells , few were able to mature .
Thus , Erk helps deliver the positive - selection signal that allows B cells to mature .

Like many of his neighbors , farmer Tony Goltstein has to deal with the aftermath of the dairy bubble .
But besides his mounting financial troubles , Mr. Goltstein also must contend with bubbles the size of small houses that have sprouted from the pool of manure at his Union Go Dairy Farm .
Some are 20 feet tall , inflated with the gas released by 21 million gallons of decomposing cow manure .
But ...
It is unconscionable to place worldwide access to comprehensive reproductive health services and accurate information about women 's health care , including abortion care , in jeopardy every four to eight years .
That is what the Global Gag Rule does .
In one of his first acts in office President Obama issued an executive order to repeal the Global Gag Rule .
President Clinton did the same thing -- only to have a succeeding president reverse it .
That is why it is imperative that Congress pass the Global Democracy Promotion
Act that would permanently prevent all future administrations from reinstating the Global Gag Rule .
Send a message to members of your congressional delegation urging their support of the Global Democracy Promotion Act .
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change authoritative Fourth Assessment Report made the alarming suggestion that global warming could cause Himalayan glaciers to melt completely away by 2035 .
The IPCC assessment reports are supposed to be rigorously peer - reviewed by thousands of climate scientists .
In November , the Indian Ministry of the Environment issued a comprehensive scientific review [ pdf ] of the dynamics of Himalayan glaciers which , among other things , concluded :
It is premature to make a statement that glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating abnormally because of the global warming .
The report was immediately denounced by the head of the IPCC , Rajendra Pachauri , who scathingly dismissed it as " schoolboy science . "
Now it turns out that the IPCC 's magisterial declaration that the Himalayas would be glacier - free in 25 years was based on a statement from an Indian glaciologist lifted from a 1999 article from popular science magazine New Scientist .
Schoolboy science indeed !
BBC News notes :
Some commentators maintain that taken together with the contents of e-mails stolen last year from the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit , it undermines the credibility of climate science .

Flask is a new microframework for web development .
Created by Armin Ronacher , it grew from an April Fools ’ prank into an elegant , usable tool in a very short time , mostly thanks to its clever leveraging of Armin ’s two other babies , the Werkzeug webserver and the Jinj a2 templating language .
I work daily with Django and love it , but after reading about Flask I got a small case of microframework envy .
Why ca n’t Django development scale down as well as it scales up , and let a beginner have fun with single - file web development without becoming swamped in the full complexity of modern web development ?
It turns out Django can easily scale down .
Single - file Django
import os from django.conf.urls .defaults import patterns from django.http import HttpResponse filepath , extension = os.path.splitext(__file__ ) ROOT_URLCONF = os.path.basename( filepath ) def yoohoo ( request ) : return HttpResponse (' Yoohoo !') urlpatterns = patterns ('' , ( r ' ^hello / $ ' , yoohoo ) )
If you ’re not familiar with Django , this code simply defines a 2 - line function ( yoohoo ) that accepts an HTTP Request and returns a webpage to the browser .
In Django this is called a view .
After we create the view , we have to associate it with a URL .
The last line of code simply means “ when someone asks for the page http://your.server.com/hello/ , run the yoohoo view and display the result ” .
To try this code out in Mac OSX or Linux , all you need to do is install Django , copy the above code into / some / path / to / somefile.py and type the following incantation into a terminal : PYTHONPATH=/ some / path/to DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=somefile django-admin.py runserver
This will run a local webserver in your machine , which you can access by opening http://localhost:8000/yoohoo/ in your browser .
Not too bad for a single file with 10 lines of code .
Look Ma , no project !
If you ’re familiar with Django , you might have noticed what ’s missing : we did n’t have to run the usual django - admin.py startproject someproject to create the initial Django project skeleton .
This means there is no manage .
py file , no settings.py , no urls.py , no views.py , and no Django app in sight .
Projects are really a superfluous convenience , as James Bennett argues in Practical Django Projects .
The file manage .py is simply a shallow wrapper around django - admin.py that adds its directory to PYTHONPATH and points the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to the settings .py in its directory .
By explicitly passing these two parameters to django - admin.py as we did in the above incantation , we eliminate the need for manage .py .
Actually settings.py has n’t disappeared , we ’re just calling it somefile .py or whatever you prefer .
The thing is , it probably does n’t look like a settings .py to you if you ’re used to Django .
What happened ?
It turns out that Django has sensible defaults for much of the stuff that usually goes into settings.py .
The absolute minimal settings.py only has to define the ROOT_URLCONF variable and point it to the urls .
py module that usually contains the URLs for you Django project .
In our single - file Django example , we ’re actually pointing the ROOT_URLCONF to the somefile .py file itself .
As for the urls .py file , it has n’t so much disappeared as merged with settings.py into somefile.py .
The same goes for what would usually be the views .
py file .
We have a single view merged into the somefile .py file .
The only restriction is that we must make sure our views are defined before we refer to them in our urlpatterns .
Look Ma , no django - admin.py !
The problem is , typing PYTHONPATH=/ some / path/to DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=somefile django - admin.py runserver seems too much of a mouthful to be typing all the time .
It almost makes you want to create a project just so you can type python manage .
py runserver .
Repent , O ye of shallow faith !
Copy this code into a file named django and give it execution permissions with chmod +x django :
#! /usr/bin/env sh USAGE =" Usage : `basename $ 0` path/to/module.py django_command [ arg1 arg2 ... ] " if [ " $ # " == " 0 " ] ; then echo " $ USAGE " exit 1 fi module=`basename $ 1 . py` dir=`dirname $ 1` if [ -n " $ { PYTHONPATH} " ] ; then NEWPATH=$ PYTHONPATH : $ dir else NEWPATH =$ dir fi shift echo PYTHONPATH=$ NEWPATH DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$module django-admin.py [ email protected ]
PYTHONPATH=$ NEWPATH
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$module django-admin.py [ email protected ]
Using this , you can now simply type ./django ./somefile.py runserver and run your projectless Django code as easily as within a project .
Django Templates
As so often happens with this kind of minimalistic example of microframework usage , our 12 - line example looks enticingly simple but is not very realistic .
In real life , the HttpResponse returned by the yoohoo view expects to be fed not a simple string such as " Yoohoo ! " but a long and complex string containing your HTML code .
Now , we could build that string incrementally inside the view function as people did in the good old ASP times , but by now we all should know that this leads to very brittle code and should never be taught to beginners , lest they stray from the righteous path .
Instead of embedding HTML into our Python code , we ’re going to embed a simplified kind of code into our HTML , using Django Templates .
Fortunately , adding templates to our minimal django example is easy :
import os from django.conf.urls .defaults import patterns from django.http import HttpResponse filepath , extension = os.path.splitext(__file__ ) ROOT_URLCONF = os.path.basename(filepath ) DEBUG=TEMPLATE_DEBUG=True TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( os.path.dirname( filepath ) , ) from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template def yoohoo ( request ) : return HttpResponse ( ' Yoohoo ! ') urlpatterns = patterns ('' , ( r ' ^hello / $ ' , yoohoo ) , ( r' ^howdy / $ ' , direct_to_template , dict ( template='howdy.html ' , extra_context=dict ( name= ' Stranger ' , ) , ) ) , )
In this extended example , we ’ve added the URL your.server.com / howdy / to our urlpatterns variable , but instead of pointing it to a previously defined view such as yoohoo , we ’re pointing it to a built - in Django view called direct_to_template .
This view accepts a few additional parameters such as the template file used to render the HTML page and a dictionary of variables that should be available inside the template , in our case name .
We ’ve also activated debugging , which makes Django display more user - friendly messages in the browser when an error occurrs .
The template could be something as simple as this or as complex as your wildest Dreamweaver fantasies :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < title >
Hi , {{ name }} ! </ title > </head > < body > < h1 >
Hi , {{ name }} ! </h1 > < p >
My time is < strong >{ % now " H:i:s " %}</strong > </ p> </body > </html >
This now looks less like a toy and more like something you could actually use to build something useful .
We could add decorators à la Bottle or Flask to decorate views with their URLs instead of writing them separately at the bottom , and we could define a nicer syntax to point URLs to templates , but the basics are there and can do much of what Flask does .
The difference is , the whole remaining paraphernalia of Django is hidden behind the curtains , ready for you to use it if or when you decide that you need to use an ORM to talk to a database , use Form helpers , build an administrative back - end , internationalize your webapp , etc .
( CNN ) --
A television station in Georgia triggered a panic when it broadcast a mock half - hour report about a Russian invasion of the country .
Emotions are still raw in many parts of Georgia after Russian tanks , troops and armored vehicles advanced into the former Soviet Republic in August 2008 .
That invasion was triggered after Georgian troops attacked pro-Russian separatists in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia .
In the fighting that ensued , each side offered conflicting figures on how many people died .
On Saturday night , the pro-government Imedi TV in Georgia broadcast what it called a " simulation " of what a fresh invasion would look like .
And the broadcast ended with a note that the events in it were not real .
However , the show did not run any on - screen notes during the half - hour broadcast to alert viewers that what they were watching was not real .
Consequently many were alarmed .
The show used archives sound bites from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , as well as footage of Georgians fleeing the 2008 conflict .
Throughout the show , the anchor provided " updates " that Russian forces had bombed the airport in the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , and a military base in the country .
It reported that four Georgians had been killed and six wounded near South Ossetia .
About two hours later , the station began scrolling a text , apologizing for spreading panic among viewers .
Manana Manjgaladze , the spokeswoman for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , also made an unexpected live appearance at Imedi's studio to apologize to viewers for the false alarm .
Patriarch Ilia II , the leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church , condemned the fake report .
" This kind of experiment is a crime to our people and to humanity , " he said in a sermon before thousands of worshippers at Sunday Mass in Tbilisi 's Holy Trinity Cathedral .
The controversial broadcast spread fear and panic among residents of Akhali Tserovani , a recently constructed colony of cottages for thousands of Georgians who fled their homes during the 2008 war .
" I was afraid .
It was n't right of them to do it , " said Tamuna Okhadze , a refugee who held her one - and - a - half - year - old son Lasha , who was born after the war .
" People were in panic , " she said .
" Some people started getting dressed to flee to Tbilisi .
People wondered where they should hide their children . "
Lali Tskitashvili , a mother of three , said she could n't see the broadcast because she did n't have a satellite dish that received Imedi TV .
But she says she received panicked phone calls from friends in Tbilisi , asking if she had seen Russian tanks .
" People here ran out into the street and asked each other ' what 's happening ? ' " she said .
" It was a provocation . "
President Saakashvili was " very concerned and alarmed of what he saw on TV , " said Manjgaladze , the spokeswoman .
" I understand the position of the journalists , " she said in a statement .
" I understand that it is possible to make such projects , but it must n't impact the population of the country .
No one must pour oil on the fire and cause alarm among the people .
This is a very sensitive topic . "
Raman devices work by shooting a laser beam at an object .
The laser light interacts with the object ’s electrons , making the atoms vibrate and shifting the energy of the laser photons up or down .
The shift creates a visual pattern — the Raman effect , named after C. V. Raman , the Indian scientist who discovered it in the 1920s .
Almost every material has its own unique Raman pattern , based on how strongly its atoms are bonded .
Raman , who won a Nobel Prize for his discovery , realized that this scattering of light offered an alternative to X - ray diffraction as a means of identifying compounds .
But not until the advent of more powerful , less expensive lasers in the 1970s and ’ 80s and advances in digital imaging in the 1990s , spurred by NASA and the telecommunications industry , did scientists begin researching applications for Raman spectroscopy .
At about the same time , Richard Van Duyne , a chemistry professor at Northwestern University , found that the intensity of the Raman signal was proportional to the electromagnetic field on the surface of an object , and that enhancing the electromagnetic field with gold or silver or copper would boost the Raman signal considerably .
In fact , a device using “ surface - enhanced Raman spectroscopy ” can detect traces of less than one part per billion .
As a result , it can be used to identify minute quantities of explosives in liquids or deadly bacteria on a table in a meatpacking plant .
Rick Cox , the head of business development at DeltaNu , estimates that while Raman technology is now a $ 150 million business , within five to 10 years , handheld Raman instruments selling for less than $ 5,000 will be available to everybody to identify just about anything .
The potential medical applications of Raman technology are perhaps the most exciting .
Researchers at Stanford University are experimenting with it as a non-invasive tool to diagnose breast , lung , and other cancers .
River Diagnostics , in Rotterdam , is marketing a bacteria - strain analyzer to identify pathogens in real time and combat hospital - acquired infections .
Diabetics may someday be able to monitor their glucose without poking themselves to get a drop of blood .
Allergy sufferers may be able to instantly detect which pesky pollens are in the air and respond accordingly .
But to identify materials , you need databases of Raman patterns .
“ We are in the midst of another tremendous era of reclassification — like the scientists of the 18th century , ” says Robert Downs , a mineralogist who with his University of Arizona colleague Bonner Denton , a chemist , has spearheaded the development of Raman technology .
Over the past five years , Downs and his team have identified the Raman patterns of about half the Earth ’s 4,000 minerals .
So far , other scientists have generally been willing to share their knowledge , but Downs is troubled by the prospect of companies ’ putting exorbitant user fees on their databases .
“ The Raman effect is part of the innate quality of matter — like DNA , ” he told me .
“ No one owns the song of a bird . ”
Morrissey Net Worth : Morrissey is an English musician who has a net worth of $ 50 million .
Morrissey first became famous by being the lead vocal singer to the rock band called The Smiths during the 1980s .
He then had a very successful solo career .
Born Steven Patrick Morrissey in 1959 in Lancashire .
While with the Smiths , their self - titled debut album climbed to number two in the U.K. despite several lukewarm single releases .
When the band broke up in 1987 , Morrissey embarked on a solo career with his first album , " Viva Hate " , in 1988 debuting at number one in the United Kingdom .
Morrissey would go on to release ten top ten singles over the course of his solo career .
He stopped recording music in 1998 and instead toured with Coachella and headlined his own world tour .
Upon his return to the studio , he released his seventh album in 2004 , which ranked at number two in the U.K .
Morrissey has worked on ten albums since going solo , with his most recent coming in 2014 .
He is an outspoken political activist who made headlines and become the subject of a police investigation for commenting that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher " can be destroyed " .
He also speaks out regularly in favor of animal rights , comparing the eating of animals with pedophilia .
Morrissey has been romantically linked to both men and women throughout his career .
" We have shot an amazing number of people , but to my knowledge , none has ever proven to be a threat , " says top American commander .
President Obama 's sneak visit to Afghanistan this weekend , although shrouded in secrecy , still received lots of prime press coverage .
At the same time , an astonishing open admission of possible US war crimes by Obama 's man on the ground in Kabul , senior American and NATO commander in Afghanistan General Stanley A. McChrystal , was reported by Richard A. Oppel Jr. in the New York Times ... and then promptly ignored by the rest of the mainstream media .
" We have shot an amazing number of people , but to my knowledge , none has ever proven to be a threat , " McChrystal said during a recent video - conference to answer questions from troops in the field about civilian casualties .
According to the military 's own figures , American and NATO troops firing from passing convoys and military checkpoints have killed 30 Afghans and wounded 80 others since last summer , but as McChrystal noted , none of the victims proved to be a danger to the troops .
Despite new rules put in place by McChrystal , aimed at reducing the killing of innocents , such shootings have not dropped off .
Although fewer in number than deaths from air strikes or Special Forces operations , their continuance , as the Times noted , " has led to growing resentment among Afghans fearful of Western troops and angry at what they see as the impunity with which the troops operate -- a friction that has turned villages firmly against the occupation . "
These persistent " escalation of force " episodes have " emerged as a major frustration for military commanders who believe that civilian casualties deeply undermine the American and NATO campaign in Afghanistan . "
A case in point : the murder of Mohammed Yonus , a 36 - year - old imam killed two months ago while commuting to a madrasa where he taught 150 students .
As Oppel noted , " a military convoy raked his car with bullets , ripping open his chest as his two sons sat in the car .
The shooting inflamed residents and turned his neighborhood against the occupation , elders there say . "
Although General McChrystal has reduced the number of civilians killed overall — deaths from aerial attacks , for example , fell by more than a third last year — shootings from convoys and checkpoints involving American , NATO and Afghan forces continue to plague the coalition .
Shooting deaths caused by convoys guarded by private security contractors - not part of the calculation — make the total number of " escalation of force deaths " far higher than just those decried by McChrystal .
As noted by blogger Allison Kilkenny - one media observer who wrote about McChystal 's statement — what the general admitted to may be a war crime :
“ Military brass and the warmongering elite usually skirt war crimes accusations by saying the Iraq and Afghanistan occupations are n't conventional warfare .
That is to say , the US is not at war with an official army , so anyone picked up on the battlefield ( which is the entire world in the War on Terror ) is n't a POW .
They 're an enemy combatant who does not have access to the protections afforded to enemy soldiers under the Geneva Convention .
This is a tricky way to circumvent accountability , but even this clever interpretation of international law can't cover the stink of McChrystal 's admission .
The US is occupying Afghanistan , and while there , they are killing innocent civilians , says the highest ranking military official in the country .
So , to recap : the President of the United States visits Afghanistan to deliver personally " pointed criticism to President Hamid Karzai in a face - to - face meeting , " after flying in " for an unannounced visit that reflected growing vexation with Mr. Karzai as America 's military commitment to defeat the Taliban insurgency has deepened . "
The president 's visit comes only days after his highest ranking military official confirms in the “ Paper of Record ” that his military forces have killed dozens of people , none of whom posed a threat -- and other media does n't see fit even to mention that fact ?

Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner signaled his support Tuesday for reforming beleaguered mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee , he said that would require some form of guarantees to keep the government - sponsored enterprises afloat .
“ Housing finance plays such a large role in our economy , and we are so vulnerable in it , ” Geithner said before the committee .
“ There is a good case for a design of a carefully applied guarantee at the right price . ”
The Treasury Department is n’t expected to release a detailed proposal for reform of Fannie and Freddie until later this year .

Geithner indicated that he opposed approaches that would either permanently nationalize the two groups or create new quasi - governmental corporations that would compete with each other .
“ Neither of those two options look like appealing options , ” Geithner said .
Instead , Geithner indicated that lawmakers should look at two approaches supported by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
One would privatize Fannie and Freddie but continue to have the government provide some form of guarantees .
Advertisement
The other would restructure them into public utilities , with the government regulating profits , setting fees and providing guarantees for their assets .
“ We need to preserve what was good and eliminate what was too risky , ” Geithner said .
Republican lawmakers have criticized congressional Democrats and the Obama administration for failing to include reform of the two mortgage giants as part of a proposed broad overhaul of bank rules .
Key GOP members of the House committee want to see the federal government move in the direction of privatizing the two entities .

However , Democrats have been hesitant to make changes while the housing market remains in flux .
“ I hope you follow the leadership of House Republicans and phase out federal credit privileges and taxpayer support and guarantee of Fannie and Freddie , ” said Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) .
“ It ’s unacceptable that , more than 18 months after [ they ] were placed in conservatorship , the Treasury Department still does not have a plan for Fannie and Freddie . ”

Florida State Attorney General Bill McCollum AP
Led by former Republican Congressman and current Florida AG Bill McCollum , 13 State Attorneys General filed suit in Pensacola , Florida this morning hoping to halt two aspects of Obama 's health care reform bill that was signed into law .
The complaint alleges that by requiring all Americans to get insurance or suffer tax penalties , Congress violated Article I of the Constitution and the 10th Amendment .
As well , the group alleges that the expansion of Medicaid violates the 10th Amendment by forcing states to participate in a program they can not afford .
Here 's a peek at two BigLaw lawyers who will represent the Sunshine State .

David Coulthard has added his voice to those expressing concern about the presence of three new Formula
One team on the grid this season , arguing it is the " standard " of Virgin , Lotus and HRT that is concerning him " greatly " .
" I have some sympathy with Ferrari 's point of view , " He told the Daily Telegraph .
" Formula
One is not a finishing school .
Either you come prepared , or prepare to fail .
This is the pinnacle of world motor sport .
" It 's no use them bleating about the fact that the goalposts moved after they joined under a budget cap .
The Formula One Teams Association never signed up to that cap . "
He then said the shambles surrounding the failed attempt by US F1 to enter a team , as well as the arguments surrounding Stefan GP had been " a poor advertisement for F1 " .
" Has the world gone mad ?
F1 is a dangerous sport at the best of times but asking teams to just turn up at practice on a Friday before a race is plain irresponsible .
Even if the new teams negotiate Bahrain without a hitch - and I hope they do - they will be miles off the pace . "
He said his advice to HRT 's rookies Bruno Senna and Karun Chandhok , who will be debuting the Spanish team 's unnamed car in Bahrain on Friday , is to " drive as quickly as possible … one of the most dangerous things you can do in F1 is to go slowly on the racing line " .
WASHINGTON , March 29 / PRNewswire / -- Teal Group Corp. announced today it has revised upward its Worldwide Mission Model of future space payloads .
According to the Teal survey , there are 2,229 space payloads proposed for launch to earth or lunar orbits or deep space trajectories from 2010 - 2029 .
" Our payload count for the next 20 years is nearly 10 percent higher than it was a year ago , " said Marco Caceres , lead analyst for Teal Group 's World Space Systems Briefing which features the Mission Model .
" In our previous study , we identified 2,033 payloads worldwide .
During the past year , we have included more than two dozen additional commercial geostationary communications satellites that have been ordered or planned by companies such as Intelsat and SES Global .
We have also added dozens of nanosatellites and picosatellites for commercial systems such as GeoOptics ' Cicero and for the US National Reconnaissance Office . "
The Mission Model , which serves as a gauge of the payloads that are being proposed to be built or may be required in order to replenish systems that are currently in orbit , provides a base from which to forecast those satellites , probes , capsules , and manned missions that are most likely to be completed and launched .
" There is a rationale method for forecasting the future of the market , and the first step is to be skeptical about any system proposed by any company or government , but to include everything in your analysis and then proceed to filter out what you think is real or fantasy , " said Caceres .
" At least half of the payloads that are announced never receive enough funding to be built and launched , but you still have to factor them into the equation as you develop a picture of what the future may look like , " added Caceres .
Civil and commercial payloads account nearly equally for 77 percent of the total payloads in the Mission Model , while military and university payloads account for 19 percent and 4 percent respectively .
Approximately one - quarter of the civil payloads are crew transfer and resupply capsules for the International Space Station ( ISS ) missions .
Additional ISS resupply capsules are included among commercial payloads , as companies like Space Exploration Technologies and Orbital Sciences move to establish a presence in this market with their Dragon and Cygnus capsules , " particularly now with the Obama administration 's cancellation of the Constellation program to develop a follow - on to the Space Shuttle and allow industry to pioneer the commercialization of human spaceflight , " noted Caceres .
Sixty - two percent of the payloads in the Model are destined for low earth orbit ( LEO ) and 23 percent for geostationary orbit ( GEO ) , with the remainder designated for medium earth orbit ( MEO ) , elliptical orbit , or deep space trajectories .
The high volume of LEO payloads can be attributed to a mix of ISS missions , nanosatellites and picosatellites , and replenishment satellites for mobile communications constellations such as Globalstar , Iridium , and Orbcomm .

The attack was a " surprise " and then it later turned out to have been forewarned .
The building was supposedly destroyed by a terrorist attack , but no one was able to account for other explosions that took place and the actual destruction of the building .
The FBI had an instant suspect .
The remains of the destroyed building were quickly removed from the scene before they could be seriously evaluated .
Hundreds of local people who were at the scene question the official version of events .
The FBI methodically visited and harassed witnesses who publicly challenged the official version of the story .
Investigators and other government officials made numerous statements about the time line and other facts related to the case were caught in countless lies and misstatements about what happened that day .
After the attack , Congress immediately passed a complex and previously un-passable " Anti-Terrorism " bill which severely curtailed civil liberties in the US .
Hardly anyone who voted on it actually read it .
The news media not only did n't cover the serious doubts raised about the official story , but also ridiculed anyone who asked questions .
Welcome to Oklahoma City - 1995 .
9/11 was a carbon copy of the Oklahoma City boming .
Just substitute Osama bin Laden and al Queda for Timothy McVeigh and " the militias " ; " hijacked " planes for a truck full of fertilizer , and the World Trade Center in NYC for the Murrah Building in Oklahioma City .
The one key difference was there was no Internet to speak of back in 1995 to get out the word and organize a truth broad based truth movement .
But some of us were on it back then :
The Oklahoma City Investigation : A Sick $ 89 million joke
Economic woes have got you thinking about whether you need that second or third vehicle at all ?
What about borrowing a car from the neighbor whose vehicle is parked nearly all the time ?
If only you knew when the neighbor 's car was available and has set some ground rules .
That 's what a few new specialized P2P ( person - to - person , or peer - to - peer ) car - sharing services aim to establish , while saving money for those who do n't need a car and making a little extra dough for those who do happen to own an extra one .
The concept of so - called P2P consumerism is n't entirely new — the term has been applied to sharing media like music and movies for years .
But the idea has recently been expanded to use our connectedness —
Internet , mobile devices , and all — to match people who own a desirable thing with people who want said thing , whenever it 's available .
Examples include Rent The Runway for fancy clothes , or HomeAway for vacation rentals .
Relay Rides , a Bay Area startup rolling out its services beginning next month , first in Boston , is one of a growing number of " collaborative consumption " services , enabled by technology , potentially allowing both car owners and renters to be able to defray or completely avoid some of the costs of ownership .
Almost like social media , with vehicles
Basically , after owners sign up , they tell the website or mobile application when there vehicle is available ; likewise , renters shop those vehicles , based on when they need one , where it is , and what they need .
Relay Rides covers the renter with comprehensive insurance and makes sure that he / she has a good driving record .
The company also puts a GPS device in the car ( looking something like a taxicab computer ) that can unlock the vehicle , immobilize the engine , and tracks its whereabouts ; if it 's not returned where and when anticipated , the company will help you locate the vehicle and will automatically assess a penalty .
RelayRides installation

Since so much of Relay Rides ' success rides on technology integration , the company certainly considers itself a tech firm , says director of marketing Boris Mordkovich .
Relay Rides has standardized rates based on the model year of the car and whether it fits into Economy , Full Size , or Specialty categories .
Given those variables , renting a Relay Ride could cost from $ 6 to $ 12 per hour , or $ 48 to $ 96 per day , with excess miles ( over 20 per hour or 160 per day ) costing 40 or 50 cents per mile .
Get money for loaning out your car , without the fuss
Would it be possible to play the system and become your own single - car - rental outfit ?
Sure .
Surprisingly , Relay Rides does pitch itself as a way to make extra cash .
" We 're like like a car matchmaker , bringing people who have cars , and those who need them , together , " it says , and according to the company a typical car owner could earn between $ 1,300 annually for a compact , offered ten hours a week , to $ 12,000 annually for a luxury model offered 30 hours per week .
A comparable service , called WhipCar , just launched in the UK and soon hopes to expand into other cities in Britain .
Is this the next big thing for car - sharing companies , which have been expanding at an astounding rate over the past decade ?
So far , " It 's a more advanced form of ' Hey buddy , can I borrow your car , ' " said John Williams , the spokesman for Zipcar , the world 's largest car - sharing company , and it wo n't work for everyone — especially those who need a consistent experience , with clean , well - prepared cars in the same place each time , when they need them .
To help assure some level of quality with Relay Rides , though , owners get to rate the renters , and renters get to rate the cars .
The service offers a fleet of pooled vehicles to members
Back in 2007 , Zipcar bought out chief U.S. rival Flexcar , and it 's continued its growth with various market expansions and conquests .
The company just announced this week that it was buying the UK - based firm Streetcar — adding about 1,100 locations , in eight British cities , and about 50,000 members , for a new combined total of more than 400,000 .
Streetcar locations will eventually be given the Zipcar name .
Although its most popular vehicles are smaller , city - friendly vehicles like the Toyota Prius and Scion xB , Zipcar typically offers a wide range of vehicles like the Honda Element , Subaru Impeza , Toyota Tacoma , or Toyota Sienna , among many others .
Rental - car companies getting into the business side of it
Some rental - car companies are starting to wise up to the advantages of car sharing , though it 's not all that different than short - term renting in some cases .
Hertz has a car - sharing " Connect by Hertz " service in some college towns , Enterprise has WeCar , and U Haul has a U Car Share operation in some markets .
And there are locally run car - sharing networks in a number of other U.S. cities as well as many Canadian and European ones .
Several automakers are also getting involved in the business of car sharing , including Daimler , with its Austin - based Car2go .
But even with all these possibilities , if you 're in a major metro area and looking to borrow a more unusual vehicle , like a Jeep Wrangler or perhaps a heavy - duty pickup , for a special task , you might have luck with a service like Relay Rides once it gets enough users .
P2P car sharing will come first to cities that already have existing car - sharing companies , because " people there are already familiar with this concept , " said Relay Rides ' Mordkovich .
" But you 'll find more availability and a lower price , " eventually , on a P2P market , he says .
P2P could work where Zipcar won't
Mordkovich reports that Relay Rides so far is seeing " a lot of people who are really enthusiastic . "
And , he points out , the company 's business model has the potential to be rolled out in areas where traditional car sharing simply would n't work ; he argues that Zipcar relies on its vehicles being used for as many as nine or ten hours a day to make a profit , whereas they make the same percentage whether the vehicle is used only an hour here and there .
So you could see car sharing start to make sense away from dense urban centers .
RelayRides
Owning a late - model vehicle , even for occasional use , is pricey .
As we reported a couple of weeks ago , the average driving cost for a sedan is nearly $ 8,500 per year — or , not counting fuel but counting insurance , depreciation , financing , and maintenance , more than $ 6,000 per year .
And many of those costs are fixed or nearly fixed whether you drive a lot or a little .
If P2P car - sharing services take off , they could be yet another alternative to owning a vehicle that might sit most of the time — and for city - dwellers accustomed to shuffling unused cars around from space to space , it could help a lot with neighborhood parking congestion .
And given today 's high rates of unemployment , we bet there are a lot of U.S. car owners looking for a better way of utilizing that vehicle in their driveway — especially if it puts some extra money in their bank account .

African Yammes Frites and the REAL Miracle Whip
Journey in the Bronx
On my way to a panel on “ Latinas and Politics ” , diligently organized by my roommate with The New Latino Movement , I took an unintentionally productive detour .
After getting off on the wrong 4 train stop in the Bronx , I was driven further off course by a disturbingly familiar smell .
I followed my nose down 167th street , and was led to an African Market serving hot fufu , a traditional West African dish composed of pounded , boiled yams ( or unripe plantains ) , accompanied with spicy groundnut ( or palm nut ) stew .
I grew very fond of fufu during my stay in Ghana , and gluttony nostalgia compelled me to take advantage of the unexpected opportunity .
Unfortunately , I did n’t have the time to enjoyably stuff my face .
And bringing the highly aromatic dish with me to an enclosed room full of prominent , political activists was out of the question .
In a state of panic , I made an impulse purchase .
I bought a 2 lb 12 x 4 fresh African yam to make my own fufu ; I carried it with me to the panel , which drew minimal suspicion ( among all options considered ) .
As I lugged the painfully heavy tuber back home , I reconsidered my ambitious idea .
What was I thinking ?
I had no idea how to make fufu .
I also dreaded carrying the big baby with me up and down the 8 flights of stairs to and from the subway .
But I sucked it up .
The yam was too expensive to abandon ( $ 8.60 ) .
And although I knew I would n’t be able to make the fufu ( at least until I get a personal cooking lesson from my Ghanaian buddy ’s Mama ) , I knew that I would be able to make my favorite snack in Ghana – yam fries !
Now Jenny , I know you used to have a little ( and now you have a f&#$ing lot ) , you always had access to the fufu .
So now , more than ever , I perceive the “ rocks that you got ” as an accurate representation of your privileged present and past .

Yam vs. Sweet Potato
When I refer to yam , I am referring to the true yam , which is completely unrelated to the sweet potato .
There is a huge confusion in this country between yams and sweet potatoes , so I ’ll explain the difference to you , once and for all .
Yam
The yam is the tuber of the tropical vines of genus Discorea .
There are over 600 species of yam , and over 95 % of them are native to Africa .
Tubers should not be confused with storage root vegetables .
A tuber is the swollen tip of the plant stem that stores nutrients , while a storage root is the swollen , tubular root of the plant that also stores nutrients , but also serves to provide structural support , and to absorb water and inorganic nutrients .
Potatoes are also tubers , but sweet potatoes are storage roots .
The yam tuber has a brownish black skin that resembles the bark of a tree , and an off white or purplish flesh , depending on the variety .
Yams have more natural sugar ( in the form of starch ) than sweet potatoes , despite sweet potatoes ’ sweeter taste .
In reality , the yam tastes very much like a potato ( not sweet potato ) , but slightly drier and denser .
Yams are much larger than potatoes and sweet potatoes on average , and can grow up to 8.2 feet and 154 lbs !
When I cut one open for the first time , I was very shocked by its natural smell .
A raw yam smells like mild bleach , which smells a lot like ….. well , if you do n’t already know , then forget about it .
But wow , the similarity is freakishly uncanny !
Sweet Potato
The sweet potato is the root of the plant Ipomoea batatas , which is also the producer of morning glory flowers .
Sweet potatoes are native to the tropical parts of South America , but are now cultivated in all warm temperate regions with sufficient water to support their growth , including the American South .
The sweet potato root is long and tapered , and has red , purple , brown or even white skin .
Its flesh can be yellow , orange , white , or purple .
Sweet potatoes are classified into two main categories – firm or soft .
When cooked , those in the firm category remain firm , while those in the soft category become soft .
The soft varieties are often mistakenly labeled as yams in the United States .
The confusion
The firm varieties of sweet potatoes were grown in the U.S. before the soft .
So when the soft varieties were produced , they had to be differentiated from the hard varieties .
African slaves in the south had already been calling the soft sweet potatoes “ yams ” because their dark brown exterior resembled the yams in Africa .
Thus , the soft sweet potatoes were referred to as yams to distinguish them from the firm sweet potatoes .
Next time you buy a can of “ yams ” to bake up with toasted marshmallows , brown sugar , and pecans , check the ingredient list .
I guarantee you there will be no yams !

Not - so - skinny dipping
I had yam fries at least once a day during my stay in Ghana .
Yam fries are actually very similar to the American potato based fries .
The differences are that they lack uniformity in shape ( always hand cut ) , are served with a fresh tomato based sauce ( more like salsa than ketchup ) , are fried in distinctly flavored palm oil , and have a slight natural bitterness .
My favorite yam fries throughout the entire trip were cut roughly into cubes and eaten with forks , because these particular yam fries were extra crispy ( maximum surface area exposure ) , and evenly cooked , with the utmost potatoey yammy interior .
So I decided to cut my yam fries in this square manner .
I did n’t actually like the fresh tomato based sauce that accompanied the Yam fries , because its high water content made the fries soggy .
So I decided to make two original , creamier and fattier , complimentary dips , inspired by a couple of great sources :
Ghanian Curry Dip
The yummy curry ketchup at Pommes Frites in NYC inspired me to make this dip .
But instead of using a ketchup base , I planned to use a homemade mayonnaise and sour - cream base , and the awesome curry I brought back with me from Ghana .
Gochujang Dip
The Sriracha mayonnaise in the Fish Chaca La Vong sandwich at Xie Xie in NYC inspired me to make this dip .
But instead of using spicy sweet Sriracha , I planned to use Gochujang , a savory , subtly sweet , and pungent Korean paste made with naturally fermented red peppers .

Overcoming Mayophobia
Jeffrey Steingarten discusses his food phobias in “ The Man Who Ate Everything ” , which I have been reading for the past few days with complete gratification .
Consequently , I ’ve been reflecting on my own food phobias , which are few in number .
But this should n’t come as a surprise to you considering my general lack of fear , and ghetto - refined palate .
One of my food phobias is actually relevant to today ’s recipe(s ) : mayonnaise .
But only in obviously processed form .
This is largely due to the fact that I thought Miracle Whip ( blech ) was mayonnaise for the majority of my life .
But with consideration to the fact that Americans eat 31 % more packaged food than fresh food , according to a recent article in the NY Times , I do n’t judge myself one bit for this misunderstanding .
Besides , I actually really like mayonnaise ( which explains how I love the Whopper ) , so long as I do not see the jar or squeeze bottle ( God have mercy ) it came from , during consumption .
In fact , I have made chicken and tuna salad a countless number of times using a jar of Hellman’s .
Of course , it helps that these particular dishes are great chilled , which gives me an opportunity to step away and forget about how I made it before eating it .
But my new solution is simply to not cook with non homemade mayonnaise , which I believe , is not the worst habit in the world .
So we will be making a homemade mayonnaise for both of the dips we will make today !
Lady Gaga is a shameless tool ( literally ) for Miracle Whip ( blech ) in her latest video Telephone , featuring Beyonce .
But the video is still hot !
Just a little scary .
Although it ’s gotten less scary each time …. this could very well be my supplementary solution …

Perfect Yam Fries
Since I could n’t find resources that provided information on frying the perfect yam fries , I had to rely on the fact that yams and potatoes are both tubers with similar cellular structures and compositions .
So I looked at resources that provided information on frying the perfect French fries .
I ’m also fairly certain that tips intended for frying potato based fries are actually more relevant to you anyway , since you might not regularly chill out at the African Market on the corner of 167th street and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx .
The best French fries are made with high - starch potatoes with low water content ( Russet ) , because they absorb less oil upon frying .
Minimal oil absorption is what gives the fry a light and fluffy interior , and crispy exterior .
Fortunately , yams have both a higher starch content and lower moisture content than all varieties of the potato , making them ideal for frying !
1. Soaking
Soaking the raw cut potatoes / yams in cold water for several hours before frying is one of the most important steps .
Soaking removes the excess starch on the surface of the potatoes / yams , which cause them to stick together during frying .
Removing the excess starch also allows the steam from the inside of the fry to escape for even cooking .
Finally , the starch converts to simple sugars in cold water .
Simple sugars brown more quickly than starch , which gives the fry a nice crispy exterior !
2. Oil
The best oils for deep frying have the highest smoking points .
The smoking point is the temperature at which the oil begins to smoke , which you never want to see .
Canola oil and peanut oil are great choices for frying fries , because their smoking points range from 420 º - 445 ºF , which are safely well above the ideal potato / yam frying temperature range ( 360º -375 ºF ) .
Also , peanut and canola oils both have relatively mild flavors that will not overpower the flavor of the potatoes / yams .
I thought about using palm oil , which has an even higher smoke point ( 455 ºF ) , but I could n’t find it in my local grocery store .
So I chose peanut .
3. Temperature
The oil for deep frying potato / yam fries needs to be between 360 º and 375 º F .
If the temperature is below this range , the potatoes / yams will absorb too much oil ; conversely , if the temperature is above this range , the outsides of the potatoes / yams will burn before the inside cooks through .
If you do n’t already have a cooking thermometer , it is absolutely necessary ( for good results and safety ) that you get one for making fries !
4. Pre Frying
Make sure that the potatoes are well drained and patted completely dry with paper towels before frying .
Mixing water and hot oil is dangerous .
5. Post Frying
I learned a great tip from the best fried chicken fryer I personally know : crumple paper towels into loose balls for draining oil .
This creates a larger surface area for oil absorption .
Three paper towels crumpled absorb much more than 3 paper towels stacked on top of each other .
Also , make sure to salt each batch of fries immediately after they come out of the fryer .
This is when the salt will stick best to the surface !
Make sure to save the bottle your oil came in .
Deep frying uses a lot of oil , so you should definitely reuse it .
Just strain your oil through a coffee filter or cheese cloth , and then refill the original bottle .
Just make sure to label it so that the yam fry oil does not end up in your boxed brownies .

Let ’s get REAL miracle whippin ’ and fryin’ !
HHC ’s Homemade Grapeseed Oil Mayonnaise
** if you are n’t bothered by jarred mayo , feel free to skip this step … although if you have never had homemade mayo , you NEED to give this a shot !
Ingredients
• 1 egg yolk ( grade A or AA , organic certified )
• ½ tsp salt
• ½ tsp sugar
• 2 tsp lemon juice ( freshly squeezed )
• 1 cup of grapeseed oil
Directions
1 . Whisk together the egg yolk , salt , and sugar in a small bowl .
2. Squeeze the lemon juice into a large bowl .
Whisk in half of the yolk mixture .
3 . With an electric blender , start whisking the mixture briskly , then start adding the oil a few drops at a time until the liquid thickens and lightens .
You are creating a beautiful emulsion !
4 . Increase the oil flow to a constant , thin stream .
Once half of the oil has been added , add the rest of the yolk mixture .
5 . Continue whisking until all of the oil is incorporated .
Leave at room temperature for 1 hour .
HHC ’s Ghanaian Curry Dip
Ingredients
• 1 tbs Ghanaian curry powder ( or other variety of curry powder , such as Madras )
• ¼ cup homemade mayonnaise
• ¼ cup sour cream
• 1/8 tsp onion powder
• 1/8 tsp garlic powder
• 1 tsp fresh lemon juice
• Salt and freshly ground black pepper ( according to taste )
Directions : Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and whip together until well combined , using an electric hand mixer .
x
HHC ’s Gochujang Dip
Ingredients
• 2 tbs Gochujang ( Korean fermented red pepper paste )
• ¼ cup homemade mayonnaise
• ¼ cup sour cream
• 1 tsp fresh lemon juice
• Salt and freshly ground black pepper ( according to taste )
Directions : Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and whip together until well combined , using an electric hand mixer .

HHC ’s African Yammes Frites
Ingredients ( serves 6 - 8 )
• 1 ~2 lb African yam ( or an equal weight of russet potatoes )
• Canola or peanut oil ( enough to be ~ 2 - 3 inches deep )
• Salt
Directions
1 . Skin the yam / potatoes and rinse them under cold running water .
If using an African Yam , wear gloves .
Raw African yams are actually mildly poisonous !
I sliced my yam into 4 cross sectional pieces ( since the yam was so big ) , and then skinned them using a paring knife ( since the skin is much thicker than potato skin ) .
2 . Chop the rinsed yam pieces / potatoes into ~ 1 - 2 inch cubes .
Place the pieces in a large bowl and fill the bowl with cold water until all of the pieces are completely submerged .
Allow it to soak in the fridge for at least 1 hour , and up to 8 hours .
As you can see , I had a very difficult time cutting the pieces into uniform cubes .
But I like the rustic , unrefined look , anyway .
3 . Drain the yams / potatoes well and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels .
4 . Pour the oil ~ 3 inches high in a deep pot .
Clip on your cooking thermometer .
Turn on the heat to high , and readjust the amount of heat until a stable temperature is reached between 360 º and 375 º F .
5 . Once the appropriate temperature has stabilized , fry the yams / potatoes in small batches .
To avoid splattering , place the pieces ( ~20 ) in a wire mesh sieve and slowly lower it into the oil .
Make sure not to place too many fries in one batch .
Otherwise the temperature of the oil will dip below the ideal frying temperature range , and your fries wo n’t be as crispy !
6 . Fry the yams / potatoes until they float to the surface of the oil ( ~3 - 5 minutes ) .
They should have a golden brown color .
Using the wire mesh sieve , pull out the yam / potato fries .
Gently shake off the excess oil ( in the sieve ) over the pot , and then transfer the fries to a plate with 3 - 5 crumpled paper towels for draining .
Immediately sprinkle with salt .
7 . Allow the fries to cool for 1 - 2 minutes .
Serve with the creamy Ghanaian curry and Gochujang dips !
Before we dig in , let me remind you – no double dipping please !
Ooooh wait a minute .
That ’s not an issue with these bite - size cuts !
Very nice .
This will come in handy when I expect gross guests .
Ok let ’s try ’em .
Mmmmmmm ….
so crunchy , yet so fluffy .
And the dips are so flavorful and creamy .
The left over curry dip will be great for my chicken , raisin , and walnut curry salad .
Hm … I wonder how the Gochujang dip would work into a salad ?
Perhaps with chicken , cashews , and crisp asian pear chunks ?
Time for some more experimentation .
Until next time …..

Nutrition ends the doctor shortage
America must decide : Sickness or health ?
The business of disease is booming !
Why America 's government needs you to die sooner
Help reverse the national debt ... die sooner !
Mainstream medicine is the real killer
( Natural News )
Now that health reform relying on monopolized pharmaceutical medicine has become the law of the land across America , the mainstream media is reporting on a sudden shortage of doctors .
The nearly one million doctors who already treat a sick , diseased population is no longer enough , it seems , and medical schools are ramping up to churn out more doctors to treat yet more disease .
There are never enough doctors to go around when everybody 's sick , it seems ... What we 're witnessing here iswhich already swallows 20 percent of the U.S. economy .
Over the next few years , that percentage will rise to 25 percent , then 30 percent , and this financial sinkhole called " mainstream medicine " may even hit one - third of the entire national economy .
That puts the U.S. in a dire financial situation .
If a third of the economic productivity is being spent on sickness and disease , and another third ( or so ) is being spent on war and imperialism , and another third is spent on debt interest and social security , then where do you get the money to actually build roads and schools , pay government employees or administer the business of government ?
The answer , of course , is that you simplyand keep on spending -- a sure path to currency hyperinflation .
But that 's another story .
The topic of today is how to solve the doctor shortage .
And the answer to that is quite simple : Unleash the power of nutrition to prevent and reverse disease .
We already know that vitamin D , all by itself , can prevent nearly 4 out of 5 cancers ( https://www.naturalnews.com/021892.html ) .
It also helps prevent heart disease , diabetes , depression , seasonal flu and kidney disease .
Distribute free vitamin D supplements across the entire population and you solve the doctor shortage problem in one year as the public gets healthier and reduces doctor visits .
It 's a simple , cost - effective solution that any intelligent nation would embrace without a second thought :
Invest a few pennies in the health of the population and save yourself manyin reduced health care costs .
Regular vitamin D supplementation has no negative side effects and requires no prescriptions , no injections and no visits to the doctor .
What 's not to like about that ?
Except the sick care industry does n't like it at all .
Drug companies , hospitals , conventional doctors , med schools , medical journals and now even the mainstream media all generate extreme profits from the ongoing business of sickness and disease .
Vitamin D would disrupt their profit agenda andinstead of bringing them back into the hospital sick and diseased .
America , you see , does not have aof doctors ... it has anof disease .
And that 's an excess that the sick - care system seems determined to continue .
Faced with such a situation , the nation can make one of two choices : Choice # 1 )
Invest inand expand the business of disease to ensnare the entire population in a cycle of pharmaceutical dependence , nutritional ignorance and accelerated disease .
Choice # 2 ) Invest inand shrink the sick - care industry by showing people how to stay healthy , fit and free of disease .
Downsize sick care , in other words , by unleashing health .
Which choice has America made ?
It 's obvious , is n't it ?
With the recent health care reform legislation , the country has invested heavily in choice # 1 : More sickness , more pharmaceuticals , more hospitals and more doctors .
I first wrote about this in a tale called https://www.naturalnews.com/008674.html ) , a fable that has been featured on Mercola 's website for several years now .
In that tale , I wrote about a society that believed it was experiencing economic abundance because it kept spending more and more money repairing car crashes and hospitalizing victims of automobile accidents .
The town removed all stop signs and traffic lights to make sure more traffic accidents occurred , thereby ensuring jobs for the local car repair shops , hospitals and doctors .
I also depicted a similar scenario in a CounterThink Cartoon published in 2006 called This cartoon shows a town mayor announcing " Business is booming " while , in the background , the cityscape features chemical companies , fast food restaurants , hospitals , cancer centers and funeral homes .
Sure , business is booming for all the companies that create disease and treat disease , but is the quality of life for that society getting any better ?
Not by a long shot .
What 's really interesting about all this is that today , just four years later , the " Business is Booming " cartoon has become reality in America ! is now the country of America .
This country has decided to expand the business of disease , and this is what has created an artificial " shortage of doctors .
" This shortage of doctors is an entirelyshortage .
America already has nearly one million doctors .
If anything , we havedoctors .
We 'd actually be better off with fardoctors combined with a Health Freedom Protection
Act that would allowto practice medicine alongside Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors , chiropractors and other holistic practitioners .
And if we could roll back the FDA censorship of nutritional supplements and superfoods , then we could finally start to educate people about how tousing supplements , herbal remedies and nutritional therapies .
All of a sudden we would find ourselves with far too many doctors -- and too many cancer centers , hospitals and clinics , too .
This should be the goal of any intelligent nation :
To protect and enhance the health of its people .
But America 's leaders ( if you can call them that ) have chosen a different path for the People : A lifetime of nutritional ignorance , medical enslavement , vaccinations , mammograms , chemotherapy , psychiatric drugs and an endless assortment of other dangerous medications .
It makes you wonder ... why ?
If you do the math on this , you 'll discover that .
If people live too many years past retirement , they keep collecting social security benefits .
But social security is broke .
It has no real money and only operates on a system of IOUs from the U.S. Treasury .
Social security is one of the largest outlays of cash from the U.S. government -- cash the country simply does n't have and therefore must borrow or print .
From a financial point of view , the U.S. government sees retired people as purely a financial burden :
They pay no taxes , they produce very little work , and they drain cash for every month they stay alive .
It sounds cruel , but it 's true :
The more quickly you die , the more money the government saves .
Kinda sick , huh ?
Now , imagine the financial burden on the Treasury if all of a sudden 70 million elderly Americans were taught the truth about vitamin D and nutritional therapies .
Imagine people living justthan they currently do .
The cost to the Treasury would be ineach year !
And yet the federal government does n't have hundreds of billions of extra dollars .
It 's already spending such a fortune on disease , war and debt that it do n't have a dime to spare .
See https://www.naturalnews.com/026686_America_na... ) .
And this bring us to the health care reform legislation which , depending on whom you ask , contains " death panel " provisions or " taxpayer - funded assisted suicide " support .
Whether such provisions actually exist under current reform legislation is hotly debated , of course , but the way they theoretically work is simple : Bureaucrats get to decide who lives and who dies based on how much money the state can afford to spend on them .
Well , I can tell you this right now :
If you 're retired , the state believes it can't afford you at all !
From a purely fiscal point of view , the state wants you dead , not alive and collecting money from social security while spending even more money via Medicare .
This is truly a case where if you 're retired , ( to the state , that is ) .
Could our sick - care system actually be designed to " expire the taxpayers " right around retirement age ?
Every few years , the government raises the age qualifications for collecting social security ( http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/agereduction.htm ) .
At the same time , they keep increasing the toxicity of mainstream medicine by pushing more chemicals and radiation onto more people .
The result is inescapable : Fewer and fewer people will ever live long enough to ever collect social security .
Do you think this is coincidence ?
America 's leaders , you see , are n't necessarily trying to reduce the population per se .
But they do n't want you to live a day beyond retirement because that 's when you stop paying taxes and start collecting money from the state .
That 's unaffordable , so the " perfect system " ( in their eyes ) is one that causes your death somewhere between the ages of 55 and 70 .
They do n't want medicine to kill you in your twenties or thirties because that 's when you 're working hard and paying taxes .
What they really want is a system of medicine the offersthat catches up with you in your late 50's and kills you before age 65 .
And is n't that exactly what mammograms , vaccines and pharmaceuticals do ?
CT scans catch up with you , too , and the combined toxicity of all these medications hit your liver and kidneys in your 50's , usually .
By age 67 when full social security benefits are supposed to kick in , most people are either pumped up full of medications or they 're dead .
Cancer does n't just happen overnight , you know .
It takes many years ( decades , usually ) for a tumor to grow to the size where it can be detected on a mammogram .
Meanwhile , doctors and medical staff are bombarding your breasts with radiation every year , practically guaranteeing that you 'll end up with breast cancer in your 60's if you do n't die from something else first .
Am I saying that government - run health care is out to kill you ?
Not exactly .
You know what the No. 1 killer in America is ?
It 's not cancer .
Not heart disease .
Not strokes , accidents or terrorism .
which kills anywhere from 250,000 to over 750,000 people a year , depending on whose statistics you believe .
These deaths are called , which means " deaths caused by doctors . "
You might just call it , though , given how little regard the mainstream medical system has for protecting human life .
So , getting back to the title of this article ... if doctors are already killing over half a million people a year in America , and if we now have a " shortage " of doctors that will result in hundreds of thousands more doctors practicing the same backward system of drugs - and - surgery medicine that 's killing people right now , can you guess what will happen to the iatrogenic death rate in America ?
You guessed it :
It 's heading skyward .
Expect to see overwithin the next decade .
And why will a million Americans needlessly die each year from a monopoly medical system run by a bankrupt government ?
Perhaps because
The game is rigged , folks .
And it 's even more severely rigged if you 're black , by the way .
The vitamin D deficiencies suffered by black Americans today practically guarantee most middle - aged African American men will never live to collect social security .
So you actually have a country full of hard - working black Americans paying taxes into a social security system that disproportionately pays out to white folks .
Check it out :
The average life expectancy of a black American male is about You collect social security , if you 're still alive , only after reaching -- guess what ? -- age 67 ( http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/agereduction.htm ) .
Meanwhile , the average life expectancy of a white American male isSo that means white males are collecting social security forthan black males .
So working black men are actuallyretired white men .
At the same time , the sick - care system seems to be trying to kill us all before we reach retirement age because that saves more money for a bankrupt government that 's bowing to the Chinese and Japanese governments to keep lending it more money .
How many dead Americans does it take to eliminate the national debt ?
I do n't know , but you can bet some pencil pusher in Washington has already done the math on that , and the answer is not one that prioritizes your personal health .
1903 : Harold Edgerton is born .
The electrical engineer and photographer will change the way we see the world : fast .
Edgerton invented stop-action , high - speed photography , helping push the obscure stroboscope from a laboratory instrument into a household item .
He used the technique to make a body of work that 's revered both for its scientific advancement and its aesthetic qualities .
Edgerton was using stroboscopes in the late 1920s to study synchronous motors for his Master of Science thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The stroboscope emitted short , repeating bursts of light .
Edgerton thought to aim it at everyday objects , like a milk drop .
He then took the technology one step further and started building flash tubes , with the help of Kenneth J. Germeshausen and Herbert E. Grier .
The first was filled with vaporized mercury , though later models used xenon gas .
( Edgerton , Germeshausen and Grier founded EG&G , a technology and management firm now part of URS Corp . )
Following the path of Eadweard Muybridge a half - century earlier , Edgerton photographed a variety of previously unseen details of athletes , animals and inanimate objects .
The duration of Edgerton 's flash was extremely short , about a millionth of a second .
His most famous photos include bullets penetrating an apple and a playing card , and a football being kicked .
Edgerton 's research also led him to develop side - scan sonar .
His underwater stroboscope technology helped his friend Jacques Cousteau discover the wreck of the ocean liner Britannic .
His work found its way into many forms of media .
A 1940 documentary film about Edgerton 's wizardry , Quicker ’n a Wink , won the Oscar for best short subject .
His photography work is featured in the collections of the art museums the world over .
Edgerton also designed a flash technique for aerial night reconnaissance for the Army .
Using his underwater stroboscope technology , he led a search for the Loch Ness monster in 1976 , but to no avail .
Edgerton continued to teach at MIT for more than 40 years and was a professor emeritus of electrical measurements there until his death in 1990 .

I have gotten bombarded by too many people asking me if the story headlined above is true .
It is n’t .
Not even close .
Science magazine , which published the supposedly “ major discovery ” by MIT ’s Daniel Nocera , headlined their story , “ New Catalyst Marks Major Step in the March Toward Hydrogen Fuel ” ( $ub. req ’d ) .
Doh !
But who needs a major step towards hydrogen ?
And Science seems to be having problems with the laws of physics , as we ’ll see .
I thought I had explained this to Scientific American , but given their puff piece — the findings “ help pave the way for a future hydrogen economy ” — I obviously failed .
Let me try again .
MIT had the sexier headline on unleashing the solar revolution .
Too bad that headline is n’t accurate for two mains reasons :
The solar revolution already has been unleashed , and if it had n’t been , this technology would n’t do the trick even if were near commercial , which it is n’t .
MIT reports :
In a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a marginal , boutique alternative [!] into a mainstream energy source , MIT researchers have overcome a major barrier to large - scale solar power : storing energy for use when the sun does n’t shine .
Until now , solar power has been a daytime - only energy source , because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient .
With today ’s announcement , MIT researchers have hit upon a simple , inexpensive , highly efficient process for storing solar energy .
As we ’ll see , they have not developed an efficient storage process — and we have no idea if it ’s cheap because they do n’t have anything near a commercial prototype ( indeed , they have not even solved all of the scientific challenges ) .
But in any case , we already have an inexpensive , highly efficient process for storing solar energy — it ’s called solar baseload .
Yes , solar PV would benefit from cheap storage , but PV ’s biggest problem is simply its high price , which is expected to drop rapidly in the coming years .
And , in any case , for industrialized countries , you ca n’t get too excited about storing daytime PV electricity — which avoids expensive peak power — and shifting it to the nighttime , where extra power is almost worthless .
But I digress .
It is the details of this “ major discovery ” that render it quite unexciting and unmajor :
Requiring nothing but abundant , non-toxic natural materials , this discovery could unlock the most potent , carbon - free energy source of all : the sun .
“ This is the nirvana of what we ’ve been talking about for years , ” said MIT ’s Daniel Nocera , the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and senior author of a paper describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science .
“ Solar power has always been a limited , far - off solution .
Now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon . ”
Note to Nocera : “ Nirvana ” ?
That takes the hype about hydrogen to a new level .
In any case , solar power is already unlimited and soon .
Solar baseload and solar PV are seeing explosive growth now and by 2015 , they will probably both be cheaper than new nuclear — and cheaper than new coal and new natural gas if we have a price for emitting carbon dioxide that comes anywhere near close the damage those emissions due to the climate .
Inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants , Nocera and Matthew Kanan , a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera ’s lab , have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the sun ’s energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases .
Later , the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel cell , creating carbon - free electricity to power your house or your electric car , day or night .
[ In the voice of Jon Stewart ]
Oh press release from my beloved alma mater , why do you mock me ?
Who exactly is going to buy this electrolyzer , plus a home hydrogen storage system , plus an expensive fuel cell — for the sole purpose of taking valuable zero - carbon peak electricity and throwing more than half of it away in the round trip , all for the luxury of having nighttime power which we can buy for virtually nothing on the grid .
Why not just run your friggin’ electric car on cheap wind power that blows mainly at night ?
And the coverage gets better — if by better I mean worse — courtesy of Science :
The catalyst is n’t perfect .
It still requires excess electricity to start the water - splitting reaction , energy that is n’t recovered and stored in the fuel .
Oh related story from a beloved science journal that published “ A Road Map for U.S. Carbon Reductions , ” why do you mock me ?
Did Science really think that even an illustrious MIT scientist could violate the laws of physics and split water into hydrogen and oxygen using less energy than is recoverd and stored in the fuel ( i. e. emitted when the oxygen and hydrogen are recombined ) ?
If you could do that , why bother with solar energy — just split the damn water and recombine it , extract the excess energy , and repeat over and over and over again .
You ’d have a terrific free - energy - generating perpetual motion machine and a Nobel prize and probably never grow old and get to date Uma Thurman .
And for now , the catalyst can accept only low levels of electrical current .
Nocera says he ’s hopeful that both problems can be solved , and because the catalysts are so easy to make , he expects progress will be swift .
No .
I ’m sure Nocera does not believe the first problem can be solved as it would require violating laws of thermodynamics , and he is a “ Professor or Energy ” at MIT .
Why are so many serious people confused on this point ?
Even Scientific American ran this absurd caption :
Water Refinery ? :
A new catalyst and polymer might prove key in delivering cost - effective — and plentiful — hydrogen from water .
Water refinery ?
Oh magazine that once published an article I wrote with Andy Frank on plug - in hybrids [ PDF ] , why do you mock me ?
You ca n’t “ refine ” water like you can refine petroleum .
You ca n’t extract energy when you split water .
You extract energy when you make water .
Water is the end state of generating energy by combining hydrogen and oxygen .
Water is a waste product , like carbon dioxide , though an especially useful waste product .
Back to Science magazine :
Further work is also needed to reduce the cost of cathodes and to link the electrodes to solar cells to provide clean electricity .
A final big push will be to see if the catalyst or others like it can operate in seawater .
If so , future societies could use sunlight to generate hydrogen from seawater and then pipe it to large banks of fuel cells on shore that could convert it into electricity and fresh water , thereby using the sun and oceans to fill two of the world ’s greatest needs .
So we would place large solar - energy - gathering systems on the turbulent ocean and build large hydrogen pipelines and large banks of fuel cells ?
No , no , and no .
Honestly , people , baseload solar can do all of that for far less cost .
Nobody is going to spend a gazillion dollars for a process that throws away more than half the original solar electricity , even if it were practical , which I doubt .
And solar baseload can also desalinate water , as can ocean thermal energy .
Back to the MIT release :
Nocera hopes that within 10 years , homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells , while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell .
Electricity - by - wire from a central source could be a thing of the past .
Why does professor of energy Nocera hope for something so unlikely and unuseful and expensive and inefficient ?
Most homes probably could n’t put enough PV panels on their house to generate excess solar energy anyway , even if anybody ever developed unaffordable household fuel cell .
I ’ll keep my PV panels for peak power and in a few years buy a plug - in ( and lease the battery ) and run it on nighttime wind and not have to waste money on a household fuel cell — which are currently wildly expensive — while trying to convince my neighbors and my local zoning board that generating and storing hydrogen in my home is not an unsafe , industrial activity that should require massive ventilation , blow - out walls , and a 50 - foot clearance between my house and any neighboring buildings .
Final note to science journalist and scientists :
Please stop using words like “ major discovery ” or “ nirvana ” or “ revolutionary ” or “ breakthrough ” or even “ cost - effective ” in the same sentence as “ hydrogen . ”

Fury as U.S. woman adopts Russian boy , 7 , then sends him back alone with note saying : ' I do n't want him anymore '
First picture of U.S. mother emerges
Russian foreign minister calls for adoption freeze
Bitter tug - of - war as Russia denies U.S. consul access to child
Russia reacted with horror today over the heartbreaking story of a seven - year - old Siberian boy adopted by an American family who was sent back to Moscow alone - because his U.S. mother did n't want him any more .
Little Artem Saveliev was last year taken from a grim orphanage and given a new life in Tennessee last year .
But his adoptive mother Torry - Ann Hansen , a 34 - year - old nurse , yesterday put him on a ten - hour flight as an unaccompanied minor with a note ' to whom it may concern ' saying : ' I no longer wish to parent this child ' .
In his rucksack , she had placed sweets , biscuits and colouring pens for the journey .
A mother 's rejection : Torry - Ann Hansen plays with her adoptive son Artem at the Vladivostok orphanage last year .
Yesterday he arrived back in Moscow alone , clutching a note from her saying she did not want him anymore
Unwanted : Artem Saveliev is led away by authorities after being rejected by his adoptive American mother
She did not tell him she was rejecting him .
Instead , she and a grandmother that he was going on an ' excursion ' to Moscow .
In the typed note , which the blond boy was clutching when Moscow police picked him up , she said she wanted the adoption annulled .
She accused the Vladivostok orphanage of misleading her about the child 's behavioural problems .
The Russians angrily denied this , saying he was stubborn but that his only disability was that he was ' flat - footed ' .
Officials said they have never witnessed such cruelty to a child after promising a ' new life ' .
Unwanted Artem , eight next week , looked confused and bewildered as he was taken into care by Moscow social services .
' Broke all rules and procedures ' :
The letter from the boy 's adoptive American mother , Torry Hansen , returning him to Russian authorities
The Kremlin 's children 's rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov lambasted the U.S. mother , who is understood to be a nurse and a single parent with a natural son .
Russia 's foreign minister is now demanding a freeze on adoptions between the U.S. and Russia .
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the ministry would recommend that the U.S. and Russia hammer out an agreement before any new adoptions are allowed .
' We have taken the decision ... to suggest a freeze on any adoptions to American families until Russia and the USA sign an international agreement ' on the conditions for adoptions and the obligations of host families , Lavrov was quoted as saying .
He also said he was ' indignant ' at the way the child was treated ' as a parcel ' .
HOW WAS HE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ALONE ?
Artem , just seven years old , travelled from Tennessee to Washington , and from Washington to Moscow , apparently unaccompanied .
United Airlines refused to discuss the case but stressed that its rules on unaccompanied minors were strictly adhered to .
However these rules state that children aged seven ' may not travel on connecting flights ' .
The airline said its ' unaccompanied minor service is available to ensure that your child is boarded onto the aircraft , introduced to the flight attendant , chaperoned during connections and turned over to the appropriate person upon arrival at their final destination . '
Having bought a ticket and put the child on the plane , it seems Hansen found a Russian tour guide on the internet who agreed to meet the child at the airport .
This man , called Artur , passed him to the authorities in central Moscow .
Hansen agreed to pay Artur $ 200 for meeting the child , said officials .
Lavrov said the U.S. had refused to negotiate such an accord in the past but ' the recent event was the last straw ' .
U.S. ambassador to Russia , John Beyrle , said he was ' deeply shocked by the news ' and 'very angry that any family would act so callously toward a child that they had legally adopted ' .
Russian officials also refused the U.S. consul access to the child saying : ' If his American parent kicked out him from the country on a plane like a sack of potatoes , then we will look after the boy .
' Our care system will take up the case .
After a full medical examination , he will be placed into one of our orphanages . '
Ashtakhov questioned how American immigration had let the child leave Washington , and why United Airlines had carried him alone to Moscow .
Normally , stringent checks are applied on minors travelling without parents .
It appears the child was also alone when he flew from Tennessee to Washington before boarding the flight to Moscow .
' The adoptive mother broke all the rules and procedures by sending an adopted child back , ' he said .
Ashtakhov , who said he played with the child and talked to him , said the mother had another son called Logan .
' Artem said he made good friends with Logan , ' he said .
' He was talking quite calmly about the family , but when he started to talk about his mother he began to cry , showing how she dragged him by the hair . '
In a shocking typed letter she gave to her seven - year - old ' son ' to take with him to Moscow , she revealed how she adopted the boy in September 2009 .
She claimed he is ' mentally unstable ' and that his problems were hidden from her by Russian orphanage officials before she adopted him .
' He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues / behaviour .
I was lied to and misled by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability , ' she wrote .
Experts fear the effects of the rejection will be traumatic for the boy
' They chose to grossly misrepresent those problems in order to get him out of their orphanage . '
The letter - addressed ' to whom it may concern ' at the Russian Ministry of Education in Moscow - said : ' After giving my best to this child I am sorry to say that for the sake of my family , friends and myself , I no longer wish to parent this child .
' As he is a Russian national , I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled . '
Adoption officials in Partizansk , near Vladivostok were stunned , saying that the U.S. woman had made a good impression on them when she went through adoption procedures last year .
She spent four full days with Artem watched by adoption workers before she was allowed to become his mother .
' It was clear that there was mutual affection , and it was good , ' said Vera Kuznetsova , chief adoption officer in the region .
' She seemed a nice , kind woman .
Artem immediately reached out to her .
She even learned a few Russian words to communicate with her future son , ' said one official .
U.S. social workers also submitted reports on Hansen for the court which granted the adoption .
' They did not doubt Hansen 's honesty and sense of responsibility , ' she said .
Recent follow - up reports from America on the boy did not detect any strains in the family , it is claimed .
Russian officals deny Hansen 's claims about Artem having severe behavioural problems and being mentally unstable .
BITTER CUSTODY TUG -OF WAR OVER ARTEM
American embassy officials in Moscow say the Artem is legally a U.S. citizen even though he flew to Moscow on a Russian passport he had used when he was first adopted , it was reported .
Kremlin children 's rights supremo Pavel Astakhov said that on Thursday night U.S. consular officials appeared at Moscow Hospital Number 21 where the child is being cared for and demanded to be allowed access to Artem and to take him with them .
' They had a conversation with the guards , threatening , and saying that they will make the hospital administration responsible for not letting them take an American citizen , ' he claimed .
Astakhov insisted the child is a Russian citizen , adding that the U.S. mother accepted this in her letter returning the boy .
The U.S. embassy refused to comment on the case today but it is understood America was making diplomatic enquiries about the child .
Normally , Russian children adopted abroad take up their citizenship of their new country .
Usually , in the case of joint citizenship , the U.S. would have no rights over the child if he is in Russia , just as Russia would have no rights if he was in America .
' Artem is normal for his age , ' said the official .
' He is a little stubborn child , but this is not a problem for loving parents .
' We are shocked by how the American family has treated our child .
Artem grew up as a completely normal , relatively advanced child for his age , and healthy .
Does she count being flatfooted as a disability ?
' No other medical abnormalities were found .
The child was completely ready for school ( Russian pupils start school at seven years of age ) and had learned to read when the American mother came to the orphanage . '
American psychotherapist Joe Soll told Russian media that the boy 's rejection from his adopted family would have a serious impact .
' When you remove a child from a family , no matter what the circumstances are , it 's a trauma , ' he said .
' We do n't look at children who have been adopted as tramuatised , but they are .
I do n't think people are educated at all to understand what adoption is really about . '
The child 's real mother Ekaterina was deprived of her parental rights because she was an alcoholic , officials said yesterday .
She gave birth to the child at 19 and cared for him until he was six .
He was adopted by Hansen on 18 September 2009 in Russia and eleven days later she formally changed his name to Artem Justin Hansen .
Astakhov said the boy told him that neither he nor Logan went to school , but played at home in America .
The boy spoke of a grandmother who shouted at him .
Russian officials believe it is this grandmother who actually organised the one - way trip to Moscow for Artem .
' Artem is a very nice kid .
We drew pictures together and had nice chat , ' said Astakhov .
Officials say they want action against the mother for child abuse .
The Moscow media angrily denounced the ' cruelty ' inflicted on the seven - year - old .
This shocking return of an unwanted child follows several appalling cases of Russian children being killed after being adopted to America .
In one case , a two - year - old boy died after his American father left him alone in a car in 30C temperatures .
The cases led to a public outcry and new curbs on adoption .
The case was highlighted on a day when U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev signed an historic nuclear arm reduction treaty in Prague .
Live television has frequently been more dramatic .
The moon landing .
OJ Simpson .
Diana 's funeral .
Have I Got News For
You , scheduled head - to - head by the BBC , probably posted record ratings .
As a broadcasting milestone , however , the party leaders ' election debate was up there with the Coronation and the Speaker 's first televised " Order , Order " from the House of Commons .
When , just after half past eight , Alastair Stewart announced " Tonight , history in the making " another defence of the old political order crumbled , never to be rebuilt .
The early exchanges were full of tension .
Nick Clegg will have savoured the chance to go first .
Gordon Brown soon showed a command of orderly detail .
David Cameron got his apology for the expenses scandal in first and was best at empathy .
Gerard Oliver 's opening question on immigration was hardly an easy place to start .
But British elections are in a new place now .
Better get used to it .
Televised debates are here to stay .
Three questions matter in judging tonight 's event .
The first , inevitably , is how each of the leaders did – who won and lost , if you must .
The second is whether the debate was good or bad for election turnout on May 6 .
The third is whether the format can be improved , either in the two remaining debates , which seems unlikely , or , more importantly , at future elections .
Clegg , treated fairly by the system for once and not barracked by backbench bullies from the other parties , had most to gain and duly gained it .
" We need to be clear with you and straight with you " may sound like political blah but voters like honesty .
This was a huge evening for the Liberal Democrats .
Clegg was helped merely by being there .
But he also had to prove he was worthy of his equality with Brown and Cameron .
There 's not much doubt that he succeeded .
No one event on its own is going provide the Liberal Democrats with the quantum boost they crave in order to be on level terms with the other parties .
You do n't become a credible prime minister overnight .
But Clegg , who has often been damned with faint praise as a rather disappointing party leader since he succeeded Menzies Campbell , rose to the big occasion .
His final pitch was significant .
Yes , he said , there is an alternative .
It 's not true that the parties are all the same .
There 's another option which Labour and the Tories will never give you .
Liberal Democrats always say that , of course .
But here was a Lib Dem leader saying it to a volatile electorate at a moment when , if he makes the sale , could change a lot of assumptions in the 2010 contest .
The initial polling looked good for the Lib Dems .
The party would be gutted if it was anything else .
But it will be some days before the dust – political as well as Icelandic – settles .
Even so , I think this performance by Clegg will change the campaign .
The other two parties know they have a dangerous enemy out there .
They are faced with a choice between ganging up against the Lib Dems or trying to be the Lib Dems ' best friend .
The Tories will certainly choose the former course because they are more at risk from a boost to Lib Dem fortunes than Labour is .
Labour will be tempted to cuddle up to Clegg a bit , partly because a lot of Labour people think it 's right to do so , partly because they think Clegg may be the key to keeping them in office .
In the end , though , Labour can't afford to be too friendly .
So stand by for the two large parties to take the gloves off on everything from tax to immigration to Trident .
Jo Grimond once asked the old Liberal party to march towards the sound of the gunfire .
Nick Clegg 's party can expect the gunfire to head their way .
Things will get rough for them now .
But a concerted turn against Clegg will play into his narrative of the way the other parties behave – making the same promises and breaking the same promises , as he put it .
It is hard to predict the impact .
But this could be exciting .
Cameron was the evening 's disappointment .
He also had the hardest hand to play .
He looked less at ease and some watchers thought he talked down to them .
Never underestimate the Conservative leader .
He may have been kicking himself after last night , but the Tory party is a formidable machine , well funded , with important media allies and ruthless .
Do n't underestimate , either , how issues like immigration and nuclear defence play to Tory strengths with the public , whatever the liberal consensus may be .
But expect to see the first " Panic at Tory HQ " and " Knives out for Cameron " stories this weekend .
Brown did OK .
His people had been good at massaging the expectations .
He went into the debate as the avowed underdog – it's the reason he agreed to take part in the first place – and he did solidly well .
The Labour leader will have surprised those who thought he was simply a grumpy old political boss .
Yes , he produced too many lists .
Yes , he has not been able to make good on his claim to be " in the future business " .
But Brown played to his strengths last night .
He sounded competent and experienced .
He was right , from a tactical point of view , to attack Cameron , who remains unquestionably the Labour party 's largest threat .
Even if the debate does not decisively shape the result on May 6 , it may nevertheless help to boost the number of people who vote .
This was both a large shared political event and most people 's first exposure to the 2010 campaign .
If today the debate turns into what Americans call a water - cooler moment – a subject that people discuss in the office – it could give turnout the single biggest kick up the backside it is likely to get in the coming weeks .
In this context , forget Twitter .
What matters , as researchers on both sides of the Atlantic have found , is old - fashioned local campaigning , talking face - to - face , in the home and on the doorstep .
The two things most likely to get people out of their homes and down to the polling station nowadays are a close race and the belief that there is a sharp divide between the main parties .
By those yardsticks , 2010 is doing its best to oblige and the debate last night undoubtedly helped .
The result on May 6 is more uncertain now than it was before and the argument over the role of the state and the role of society is a large one .
If nothing else , the debate did credit to our much maligned politics while confirming that our political parties also have something serious to argue about .
Roll on the next debate .
This election has come alive at last .

There are always a number of unusual items for sale on eBay , but it 's not every day that you see an entire town go up for auction .
The fetching price for tiny Wauconda , Washington , was a mere $ 360,000 , which sounds like a veritable bargain if one of your dreams in life is to own your own zip code .
Wauconda consists of only a restaurant , a small store , a gas pump , a four - bedroom house and that exclusive zip code .
Nevertheless , seller Daphne Fletcher claims to take in about $ 300,000 per year mostly thanks to the summer travel season with tourists passing through .
The new owners , Maddie and Neal Love , came in and sealed the deal after a protracted month - long bidding war , including a hopeful bid from a young boy who tried to " surprise his parents by buying a town . "
Amazingly , this is not the first time an entire town has sold on the auction site .
Bridgeville , California , sold for $ 1.78 million in 2003 and tiny Albert , Texas , went up for a $ 2.5 million reserve price in 2007 , among others .
What 's the strangest thing you 've ever seen sold on eBay ?

Lalit Modi set up the IPL , which became a multi-billion dollar industry Lalit Modi is the biggest sporting impresario India has ever produced - cricket 's answer to Don King of boxing or Bernie Ecclestone of Formula One .
More than a decade ago , Modi helped international sports channel ESPN win the rights to broadcast cricket matches in India , where state TV had until then had a monopoly .
Years later , he shaped the hugely successful and lucrative Indian Premier League ( IPL ) with all its colour and razzmatazz .
But today , the IPL guru is mired in allegations of money laundering , improperly awarding franchises for new teams and , worse , possible match - fixing .
' Trial by media ' Modi , 46 , maintains he has done nothing wrong .
IPL IN CRISIS 13 Apr : Junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor accuses Lalit Modi of trying to block the winning bid for new franchise Kochi 19 Apr : Mr Tharoor quits over role in Kochi bid after it is revealed a woman friend allegedly received a free stake 19 Apr : India orders an investigation into IPL financing amid allegations of corruption 21 Apr :
Tax officials widen their investigation , raiding at least four IPL teams hours before the first semi-final 23 Apr : Investigators question Mr Modi for hours over corruption allegations 25 Apr : Cricket board suspends Mr Modi , shortly after IPL final 26 Apr : Interim IPL head appointed .
Corruption accusations against Mr Modi outlined
IPL chief faces corruption probe " It is a trial by the media , nothing has been proved , " he told a jam - packed DY Patil stadium in Mumbai ( Bombay ) on Sunday night , seconds after Chennai Super Kings had won the third edition of the IPL .
The Indian government inquiry will take months , probably years - but that Modi is down and out from the Board for Control of Cricket in India ( BCCI ) , the world 's richest cricket board , is amply clear .
In just a few years Lalit Modi turned the IPL into a $ 4.13 bn commercial phenomenon that Forbes called the world 's fastest growing sporting event .
It attracted business tycoons and Bollywood stars , but cricket watchers say he rarely followed the rules .
He decided almost anything and everything that happened within the IPL .
Lalit Modi studied for a sports management degree at North Carolina 's Duke University Business School in the United States .
While a student there he was convicted of kidnapping and assault .
A spokeswoman for the North Carolina courts told the BBC that Modi received a two - year suspended jail sentence and a $ 10,000 fine in June 1985 after entering a plea bargain .
Armed with his degree , Modi later returned to India to introduce the magic of ESPN 's high - voltage cricket coverage .
He also handled global brands like Estee Lauder and Phillip Morris , and was instrumental in bringing Fashion TV to India .
A scion of the multi-millionaire family which owns Modi Enterprises , he is also a member of the board of Godfrey Philips , a top Indian tobacco company .
Modi - who owns a private jet and a yacht - always wanted to live life king size , a popular marketing tag for one of his cigarette brands .
Ever the showman , he arrived at the ground in Mumbai for the IPL final in a helicopter .
Some have called him the man with the Midas touch .
He flaunts his power by moving around with a phalanx of private bodyguards , the first sports official in India to do so .
His aides say there are threats to his life because of his high profile .
Lalit Modi likes the high life , combining cricket with entertainment .
Guests paid up to $ 1,000 to attend his after - match parties where they could mingle with cricketers , starlets and models .
' Arrogant '
He even built up a considerable fan following and was photographed being mobbed for autographs .
Modi brought Bollywood glamour to the IPL
As well as taking the IPL into the big league , Modi also helped the BCCI 's income cross the $ 1bn mark ( from $ 67 m ) with a television deal with Nimbus worth $ 612 m , team and shirt deals worth $ 641 m with Sahara and Nike and a television deal with Zee for India 's matches on neutral venues worth $ 219 m .
Last year he decided to move the IPL to South Africa after the Indian government said it could not guarantee security for the tournament because of elections .
" It was a bold , arrogant move , and angered many , " said one political observer .
Some people wanted the tournament to stay in India , even though there was no obvious slot in the cricketing calendar .
The recent controversy that led to Modi 's downfall was started by his tweeting the names of the stakeholders in a new IPL franchise .
Initial investigations by tax officials suggest illegal money from global tax havens may have found its way to the game in India .
Whether that is proved or not , many people are having serious doubts about whether it was right to blend cricket 's glamour with business in the way he did .
Modi should maybe have seen what was coming .
Cricket 's man in a hurry had so much going for him - if only he had been a little more circumspect .

The FIA has told Formula 1's teams that any self - levelling damper system used to regulate the ride height of a car between qualifying and the race during a grand prix weekend would be deemed illegal .
An FIA spokesman confirmed to AUTOSPORT that the sport 's governing body made its position on the matter clear by faxing the teams last Sunday night with a clarification on the use of suspension in Formula 1 .
" Any system device or procedure , the purpose and / or effect of which is to change the set - up of the suspension , while the car is under parc ferme conditions will be deemed to contravene art 34.5 * of the sporting regulations , " read the communication .
The move follows Red Bull Racing 's stringent denial during the Malaysian Grand Prix weekend that it was using a clever system that lowered its cars in order to maxmise their potential during qualifying - with team boss Christian Horner insisting that not only did Red Bull not have such a device , but that it would protest any team that ran one .
The FIA gave the RB6 the all - clear after a thorough inspection during the weekend , but rival teams have suggested that Red Bull may have found a way to achieve the affect without the use of a mechanical system .
But another line in the communication suggests that any such solution may also be outlawed : " Furthermore we believe that any self levelling damper system is likely to contravene 3.15 ** of the technical regulations . "
McLaren indicated last weekend that it intends to develop a system of its own that would allow it to exploit its car 's low - fuel potential , while Mercedes ' Ross Brawn has called for a clarification of the rules .
* Article 34.5 states :
If a competitor modifies any part on the car or makes changes to the set up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions the relevant driver must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures laid out in Article 38.2 .
** Article 3.15 states : Aerodynamic influence :
With the exception of the cover described in Article 6.5.2 ( when used in the pit lane ) , the driver adjustable bodywork described in Article 3.18 and the ducts described in Article 11.4 , any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance :
- must comply with the rules relating to bodywork
- must be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car ( rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom ) ;
- must remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car .
Any device or construction that is designed to bridge the gap between the sprung part of the car and the ground is prohibited under all circumstances .
No part having an aerodynamic influence and no part of the bodywork , with the exception of the skid block in 3.13 above , may under any circumstances be located below the reference plane .
A young mother has died after her hijab became tangled in a go - kart drive mechanism in a tragic accident yesterday .
The woman suffered severe neck and throat injuries after the hijab - a Muslim scarf that covers a woman 's head and neck - became entangled with the go - kart while she was driving at Port Stephens Go-Karts yesterday .
Paramedics tried to save the 26 - year - old , but she was pronounced dead shortly after she was flown to John Hunter Hospital by a Westpac rescue helicopter .
Detective Inspector Peter Fox of Port Stephens Local Area Command said today the longer part of the scarf was wedged down near one of the go - kart 's wheel axles .
US - Senat " grillt " Goldman Sachs Rainer Sommer
Das " Levin - Komitee " des Senats beschuldigte und verhörte mehr als zehn Stunden lang führende Manager und schwingt sich zum wichtigsten Kritiker der Finanzmärkte auf
Nachdem die Untersuchungen zur Lehman - Pleite und die Betrugsanklage der SEC gegen Goldman Sachs in den letzten Wochen tausende Emails mit schmutzigen Details ans Licht gebracht hatten ( Showdown für Investmentbanken und Hedge Fonds ) , lagen an der Wall Street schon am Montag die Nerven blank .
Denn obwohl die Lobbyisten der Wall Street die Flure von Kapitol und Weißem
Haus wie nie zuvor belagert und in diesem Jahr bereits mehr als 200 Millionen Dollar verteilt haben , wollen Präsident Obama und die demokratischen Parlamentarier einen regulativen Paukenschlag setzen , der an die historische Finanzmarktregulierung nach dem Börsencrash von 1929 herankommt .
Allerdings hatten die Republikaner noch am Montag die Eröffnung der Debatte der Bankenreform im Senat mit ihrer Sperrminorität blockiert .
Nur 57 Senatoren hatten dafür gestimmt , 41 dagegen , wobei 60 Stimmen für die Aufnahme des Verfahrens nötig gewesen wären und Harry Reid , der Fraktionschef der Demokraten , jedoch nur aus taktischen Gründen dagegen gestimmt hatte um es den Demokraten möglich zu machen , jederzeit eine neue Abstimmung anzusetzen .
So hat sich das Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations ( PSI ) des Senats , dem auch der republikanische Präsidentschaftskandidat John McCain angehört , inzwischen zum schärfsten Ankläger der Wall Street aufgeschwungen .
Geleitet von Carl Levin , einem demokratischen Senator aus Michigan , der seit 30 Jahren im Senat gegen die Wall Street auftritt und schon 2003 die Untersuchung zur Enron - Affäre erfolgreich geleitet hatte , hat der Ausschuss zuletzt bereits absolut vernichtende Urteile über Ratingagenturen und Regulierungsbehörden gefällt und auch die Praktiken der gescheiterte gigantische Hypothekenbank Washington Mutual ( " Wamu " ) öffentlich seziert .
In den 1930er Jahren hatte das nach dem New Yorker Untersuchungsrichters Ferdinand Pecora benannte " Pecora - Komitee " des Senats die Untersuchungen geführt und die mächtigsten Finanzmagnaten vom damals allmächtigen John Pierpont Morgan Jr. abwärts hochnotpeinlichen Verhören unterzogen und öffentlich diskreditiert .
Nachdem die Hearings monatelang die Schlagzeilen beherrscht hatten und Pecore es im Mai 1933 sogar auf des Cover von " Time " gebracht hatte , waren die USA dann reif für die schärfste Finanzmarktregulierung der Welt , dem " Securities Act " und dem " Securities Exchange Act " , die mit parteiübergreifender Mehrheit verabschiedet wurden und unter anderem eine rigide Trennung von Investment - und Geschäftsbanken und somit die Zerschlagung der mächtigsten Finanzkonglomerate umfassten .
Samt Einlagensicherung und der weltweit schärfsten Börsenaufsicht SEC sorgten diese Reformen dann tatsächlich gut 50 Jahre lang für halbwegs geordnete Verhältnisse an den Finanzmärkten .
Die Nobelpreis - Ökonomen Paul Krugman und Joseph Stieglitz sind heute überzeugt , dass die Aufweichung eben dieser strengen Regeln durch die unter Präsident Ronald Reagan angelaufene Liberalisierungswelle die wichtigste Voraussetzung für den Finanzmarktcrash von 2008 gewesen sei – wobei nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen ist , dass die bestehenden Regelungen womöglich ausgereicht hätten , wären sie rigide durchgesetzt worden , wie der Ökonomieprofessor und frühere Regulator William K. Black vor dem Senats - Komitee vergangene Woche in aller Deutlichkeit zu Protokoll gab .
Offenbar waren die bisherigen Befragungen nur die Aufwärmrunde für den großen Show - Down , bei dem es am Dienstag Goldman an den Kragen ging .
So mussten sich Chairman Loyd Blankfein , der ins Visier der Börsenaufsicht SEC geratene Fabrice „ Fabolous Fab “ Touree sowie fünf weitere Top - Manager unter Eid den scharfen Fragen des gut vorbereiteten Untersuchungsausschusses stellen .
In den Eröffnungsstatements warfen die Senatoren Goldman unverblümt vor , gegen die eigenen Kunden gewettet zu haben und ungezügelten Interessenskonflikten unterlegen zu sein , wobei sich die Senatoren stark an die SEC - Anklage anlehnten .
Insgesamt charakterisierten die Senatoren Goldmans Verhalten als " unethisch " und MacCain merkte an , dass Goldman sich nicht nur vor den Gerichten und dem Senat , sondern vor allem vor der Bevölkerung verantworten müsse .
Limonade aus einigen alten Zitronen machen
Blankfein und seine Mitarbeiter wichen indes nicht von der offiziellen Verteidigungslinie Goldmans ab und waren sichtlich bemüht , ihre Verachtung für die Untersuchungen nicht all zu deutlich zu zeigen .
So hätte es sich bei den betroffenen Kunden ausschließlich um hochprofessionelle Investoren gehandelt , die genau gewusst hätten , was sie gekauft hatten .
Goldmans Aufgabe sei es eben , den Kunden genau das zu verkaufen , was sie wollten , und das komme idealerweise von anderen Kunden , die genau das verkaufen möchten .
" Und wenn es in einem CDO - Deal niemanden gibt , der Risiken verkauft , gibt es keinen Deal " , wie beispielsweise Tourre anmerkte .
Da sich die Positionen von Goldman ständig änderten , sei es dabei schon technisch ganz unmöglich , die Kunden darüber auf dem Laufenden zu halten .
Dass Goldman dann gegen den Markt und die eigenen Kunden gewettet hatte , sei aus der Notwendigkeit entstanden , die eigenen Risiken zu reduzieren - was ja offenbar eine überlebenswichtige und sehr erfolgreiche Strategie gewesen ist .
Darüber hinaus leugneten sie jede Verfehlung , kamen dann aber doch ziemlich ins Schwitzen , als ihnen die Senatoren etliche interne Emails vorhielten , die an die Korrespondenz der Investmentbanker am Höhepunkt des Dot.com - Booms Ende der 1990er Jahre erinnerte .
So war bei dem CDO " Timberwolf " intern offen von einem " shitty deal " die Rede , der dennoch mit vollem Einsatz vermarktet wurden .
Als es geschafft war , meinte der zuständige Trader in semantischer Anlehnung an Roosevelts Kommentar zum japanischen Angriff auf Pearl Harbour , es sei " a day that will live in infamy " .
Besonders pikant dabei : Bei genau diesem Deal war Goldman anschließend eine Short - Position auf den Käufer eingegangen , bei dem es sich übrigens um die Wall Street Investmentbank Bear Sterns gehandelt hatte , die wenig später zum ersten Opfer der Subprimekrise wurde .
Jedenfalls zeigte sich schnell , dass die Manger über die offiziellen Statements hinaus offenbar nicht perfekt auf das Hearing vorbereitet waren – anscheinend war es das wichtigste Ziel , keinerlei Aussagen zu machen , die später von der SEC gegen Goldman verwendet werden könnten .
Und je mehr Details den Managern vorgehalten wurden , umso größer wurden das Gestammel und die Erinnerungslücken .
Die über die nichtssagenden Antworten zusehends verärgerten Senatoren ließen indes nicht locker .
Bezüglich des von der SEC angeklagten Abacus - Deals konnten sie Tourre immerhin dazu bringen zuzugeben , dass Goldman tatsächlich niemanden über die tatsächliche Rolle der Hedgefonds Paulson & Co informiert hatte .
Die Senatoren waren aber auch auf weitere Deals aufmerksam geworden , etwa dem Hudson CDO , einem synthetischen Deal , der offenbar vollständig auf Goldman - Inventar aufgebaut war .
Die Goldman - Manager , die sich immer als Market - maker und nicht als Investor darstellten , hatten also ganz alleine die Gegenposition zu den Investoren eingenommen , wobei die aus Goldmans eigenem Portfolio eingebrachten Assets zuvor intern als " Junk " bezeichnet worden waren .
Nachdem der 2 - Milliarden - Deal geschlossen war , hatte einer der vorgeladenen Manager seinem Team jedenfalls überschwänglich gratuliert , weil es " aus einigen großen alten Zitronen Limonade " gemacht habe – wobei wie bei dem von der SEC inkriminierten Abacus - Program im Verkaufsprospekt behauptet wurde , Goldman stehe auf der selben Seite wie die Investoren .
Es folgten die üblichen Erklärungen :
So wie bei allen anderen Deals sei dies nur auf Wunsch der Investoren geschehen .
Blankfein selbst verleugnete indes generell den Verkauf von " Junk " : Bei den Charakterisierungen in den Emails hätte es sich schlicht um Einzelmeinungen gehalten , die nicht repräsentativ wären .
Außerdem sei es im Nachhinein immer leicht , alles besser zu wissen .
Im Übrigen habe Goldman ja auch selbst sehr viel verloren .
Sobald die Senatoren aber wissen wollten , wie viel Goldman demgegenüber mit den " Shorts " gewonnen hatte , tauchten bei den Wall Street Direktoren stets umfangreiche Gedächtnislücken auf .
Jedenfalls sei alles absolut gesetzeskonform gelaufen und den Kunden und Ratingagenturen wären keinerlei Informationen vorenthalten worden , die diese benötigt hätten .
Main Street hat Wall Street satt
Blankfein wiederholte am Ende dann teilweise wörtlich , was zuvor schon seine Manager ausgesagt hatten .
Zu den Details habe er indes kaum tiefere Kenntnisse , abgesehen davon , dass Goldman die höchsten ethischen Standards einhalte und jedenfalls immer voll auf der Seite der Kunden stehe .
Was diese jedoch kauften , dass müssten die Kunden selbst entscheiden .
In Hinsicht auf die geplanten Reformen sei er zudem völlig in Übereinstimmung mit dem Präsidenten : Höhere Eigenkapital - und Liquiditätspolster wären nötig und es sei tatsächlich die Wall Street selbst , die am stärksten von schärferen Regulierungen profitieren würde .
Angesichts des medialen Widerhalls , der Goldman nun überwiegend als Krake und als Hauptverantwortlichen für die Krise darstellt , verwundert nicht dass die US - Börsenaufsicht die größte und mächtigste Investmentbank gerade am Freitag vor den Kongress - Anhörungen zur Lehman - Pleite unter Anklage gestellt hat - was laut Präsident Obama natürlich " rein zufällig " und laut SEC - Chefin Mary Schapiro " völlig unabhängig von politischen Motiven und Einfluss " genau zu diesem Zeitpunkt erfolgt sei .
Und obwohl viele Rechtsexperten bezweifeln , dass es angesichts der bisher vorgelegten Beweise tatsächlich zu Verurteilungen kommen werde , ist der Show - Effekt doch so enorm , dass kaum jemand an der Wall Street noch daran glaubt , die geplanten Regulierung noch lange verhindern zu können .
Immerhin stoßen die offenbar weit verbreiteten Betrugstatbestände auch den republikanischen Wählern höchst unangenehm auf und angesichts der im Herbst anstehenden Kongresswahlen steigt mit jeder weiteren Veröffentlichung die Chance , dass die Demokraten doch noch einen der 41 Republikaner im US - Senat tatsächlich auf ihre Seite ziehen können .
Klar ist , dass die " Main Street " die Wall Street satt hat .
So wünschen sich laut aktuellen Umfragen 82 Prozent der Bevölkerung einen " crackdown " , während mehr als die Hälfte der US - Finanzmanager Goldman Sachs für " schuldig " halten .
Goldman - Chef Lloyd Blankfein war bei seinen bisherigen Auftritten vor den US - Parlamentariern noch relativ ungeschoren davongekommen .
Nachdem Blankfein zuletzt aber noch fabuliert hatte , Goldman verrichte " Gottes Werk " , hat er bei den Hearings die Fassung bewahrt .
Nach der SEC - Anklage war der Eigentümer von einer halben Milliarde an Goldman - Aktien , der 2007 das Rekordeinkommen von 68 Millionen Dollar bezogen hat , jedenfalls " not amused " und hatte seine wichtigsten Kunden noch am Wochenende persönlich kontaktiert .
Er sei dabei extrem aggressiv aufgetreten und hätte die SEC - Anklage als " substanzlos " und " total politisch " zurückgewiesen .
Die Regierung " ist ausgezogen um Goldman zu töten " , jedenfalls schade die Klage den USA , womit er nicht ganz unrecht haben dürfte .
So strengte die britische Finanzaufsicht FSA bereits Ermittlungen gegen Goldmans Londoner Tochtergesellschaft an und auch die deutsche Finanzaufsicht Bafin will nach Sichtung der SEC - Unterlagen rechtliche Schritte prüfen .
Und während deutsche Banken eine weitere Zusammenarbeit mit Goldman öffentlich ausschließen reiben sich Politiker bereits die Hände und hoffen auf Revanche für die hohen Strafen , die etwa deutschen Paradeunternehmen wie BMW und Siemens von US - Gerichten aufgrund von Korruptionstatbeständen zuletzt aufgebrummt wurden .
Und trotz der guten Kontakte Goldmans in alle politischen Lager war Goldman vom Angriff der SEC offenbar kalt erwischt worden .
" Wir waren etwas überrascht " , musste etwa Finanzchef David Viniar in der Telefonkonferenz zu den jüngsten Quartalszahlen einräumen .
Für gewöhnlich werden derartige Aktionen von der SEC schon vorab nach Börsenschluss am Vortag bekanntgemacht damit die Börsianer Zeit haben , die Nachricht bis zur Eröffnungsglocke zu verdauen .
Nicht so im Fall Goldman .
Die sensationelle Meldung war mitten in den morgendlichen Börsenhandel geplatzt , woraufhin der Aktienkurs umgehend um zehn Prozent einbrach .
Als Goldman die Vorwürfe eine Stunde später in einer kargen Pressemitteilung zurückwies , lag der Kurs bereits 13 Prozent im Minus und erholte sich auch nicht , als Goldman eine Verdoppelung seines jüngsten Quartalsgewinns bekanntgab .
Der Auftritt vor dem Senat wurde von der Wall Street hingegen positiv aufgenommen .
Immerhin hielt sich die Goldman - Aktie trotz sehr schlechter Börsenstimmung zeitweise deutlich im Plus .
Allerdings trat Blankfein erst kurz vor Börsenschluss an und hatte sich dann aber auch keine offensichtliche Blöße gegeben .
In den wenigen Minuten bis Börsenschluss gewann Goldman dann immerhin noch ein halbes Prozent und schloss letztendlich um 0,66 Prozent stärker .

Succession planning is one of the most important aspects of life in the honeybee colony .
Since the hive cannot exist without a queen , the colony makes sure that they never go long without a productive leader in place .
In a recent profile of the Dean of the Villanova School of Business , James Danko ( in the March 1st issue of the Financial Times ) , Mr. Danko notes that the very advocates for sound succession planning , business schools , often search for years for new Deans .
The position often is placed under indefinite interim control and ultimately filled by an incumbent from outside the ranks versus the inside .
Apart from the irony of this situation and the extended periods in which business schools are sans , Mr. Danko imparts a message of caution to any outsider who is brought in to run things .
Do n't be heavy - handed .
When beekeepers need to change the genetic lineage of a hive because of poor selection ( often susceptibility to disease ) , they will re-queen a colony with an outsider .
But if they just plop a queen into the hive without a getting - acquainted period first ( e. . , by keeping the queen partitioned from workers for a brief period ) , the workers will " heat - ball " the newcomer about half the time : surround the queen , pressurize her , and heat her to death - giving literal meaning to " you 're toast . "
Why ?
Just because she is unproven outsider .
When taking over at Villanova , Mr. Danko assured faculty that he would use the first 100 days to listen to them .
Nice move .
And five years later , he 's still there .

March 19 , 2010  --
A Pennsylvania couple on a snorkeling vacation in Aruba believes they inadvertently photographed what may be the skeletal remains of Natalee Holloway , an Alabama high school student who went missing on the Caribbean island five years ago .
The underwater photograph of the sea floor depicts a rough outline the couple believes resemble a human skeleton , according to the Intelligencer Journal / Lancaster New Era , which first published the photo on Thursday .
Patti Muldowney , 62 , of Rapho Township , Pa. , took the photo while snorkeling off the Caribbean island but " only discovered it after we got the film developed , " she told the paper of the body - shaped image in the picture .
Patti and her husband John showed the photograph to local police and forwarded it to FBI , who told them they would investigate .
" It just seems so strange that that girl never showed up , and here we are right off the shoreline , right where she disappeared , and there 's a body lying there , " said John Muldowney .
" I hate to say I wish it was her , but it would give that family some closure , " he said .
Calls to the couple by ABC News were not immediately returned .
Aruban Authorities , however , have yet to receive formal notice from the FBI about the photo , according to Ann Angela , spokeswoman for the Aruban prosecutor 's office .
Angela said if the couple can provide " solid information , " about the location where the photo was taken , Aruban authorities could send a dive team to investigate .
Anything found would be sent to the Dutch Forensic Institute in The Hague .
Angela said it was not uncommon for human remains to be found off the cost and cautioned that even if a body was discovered it may not be Holloway .
Holloway went missing in May 2005 during a high school graduation trip to Aruba .
Her disappearance became an international cause célèbre .
Much of the speculation about Holloway 's disappearance has focused on Dutch national Joran van Der Sloot , who has twice in recent years seemingly admitted to reporters he knew how and where Holloway died but has never faced charges in her murder .
In February , van Der Sloot told a Dutch television station that Holloway fell to her death from a balcony following a night of drinking and drug use .
" We looked down and saw her lying there .
Yes , there was blood .
I think she fell on the ground with her head first , " van Der Sloot told Dutch television station RTL 5 .
" It 's a story that in and of itself does fit in terms of timing , " Peter Blanken , Aruba 's Chief Prosecutor told ABC News in February .
" But all the other things that could be investigated , and that means the story about the witnesses [… ] , the house , the height of the balcony , all those types of things do n't add up in Joran van der Sloot 's statement . "
This alleged confession came almost two years after undercover tapes were released by Dutch crime reporter Peter R. de Vries , in which van der Sloot appears to admit he was present when Holloway died and that he helped dump her body in the ocean .
A grant of £ 1,285,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund ( NHMF ) will keep the glittering treasures of the Staffordshire hoard , the most spectacular heap of Anglo - Saxon gold ever found , in the region where an amateur metal detector found it last summer after it spent 1,300 years buried in a nondescript field .
The grant goes to Birmingham and Stoke - on - Trent museums , which will share the treasure , having raised the £ 3.3 m necessary to pay Terry Herbert , who found the gold , and farmer Fred Johnson , the owner of the field where it was discovered .
Unusually for the fund , when the trustees met today there was no argument about the extraordinary quality of the hoard , or the merits of making the grant .
Dame Jenny Abramsky , chair of the NHMF , said : " The Staffordshire hoard is an extraordinary heritage treasure .
It is exactly the sort of thing the National Heritage Memorial Fund was set up to save , stepping in as the ' fund of last resort ' when our national heritage is at risk , as a fitting memorial to those who have given their lives in the service of our nation .
We 're delighted , in our 30th anniversary year , to be able to make sure it stays just where it belongs , providing rare insights into one of the more mysterious periods of our history . "
" Frankly they'd have been demented not to give the money , " David Starkey , the historian who led the £ 3.3 m appeal , said , welcoming the announcement .
He has labelled the 1,500 pieces of jewel - studded gold , which appear to have been wrenched violently off their original metal , leather and wooden mounts , " gangland bling " .
" This is by far the most important archaeological discovery in Britain since the second world war , and beyond that this is a find – of the most extraordinary beauty , brilliance and technical sophistication – which has really caught the imagination of the public . "
The culture minister , Margaret Hodge , said : " Thanks to this grant , these superb items will be able to stay – and be enjoyed – where they belong : in the Midlands where they were discovered . "
The British Museum , which would once inevitably have been seen as the natural home for a find of international importance , gave its blessing and practical support to the campaign .
The total includes thousands of small donations from members of the public , some sent from as far as Australia , and a £ 300,000 grant from the Art Fund charity , which launched the appeal .
The museums , backed by their local authorities , put in £ 100,000 each .
Stephen Deuchar , director of the Art Fund , said : " We have been absolutely bowled over by the enthusiasm and fascination the Staffordshire hoard has sparked amongst the British public , as well as visitors from abroad .
It is wonderful news that the NHMF has enabled the target of £ 3.285 m to be reached ahead of schedule , and I hope that this will give the West Midlands a head start with the next stage in fundraising for the conservation , research and display of the treasure . "
When the find ( pdf ) was announced in September the news went round the world .
The gold was found by Terry Herbert , a passionate amateur metal detector whose best previous find was a broken piece of medieval horse harness , on farmer Fred Johnson 's land near Lichfield in July .
When Herbert had covered his dining room table with gold , and was becoming thoroughly alarmed at the scale of his find , he called in the experts .
The archaeologists and forensic scientists who hit the field – under the cover story from the local police that they were investigating a murder – found most of the pieces just below the surface , and some tangled in clumps of grass which had grown up through the delicate filigree gold : eventually they retrieved 2.5 kg of silver and 5 kg of gold .
One gold - and - garnet Anglo - Saxon sword pommel would be regarded as a find of international importance : there were scores in the hoard , along with unique and enigmatic objects still baffling the archaeologists such as the wriggling gold serpents , and a biblical inscription on a strap of gold folded in half like a shirt collar .
Starkey said : " These are pieces from the period which we were brought up to call the dark ages , and they prove that it was no such thing .
When the Normans invaded in 1066 , they may have been better organised chaps – but it was n't that they were the civilised ones invading a primitive backwater , they came because they were desperate to get their hands on the wealth of Harold 's England . "
Local pride and interest in the treasure is intense .
The exhibitions at the Birmingham city museum , immediately after the find was announced in September , and at the Potteries museum in Stoke - on - Trent last month when the hoard returned for the first time to Staffordshire , broke records at both museums with crowds queueing for hours to see the treasures .
More than 52,000 people visited the Stoke museum in three weeks , donating more than £ 152,000 to the appeal , including a single anonymous donation of £ 50,000 on the eve of the exhibition .
Many of the pieces are still caked in mud , and some still tangled with blades of grass .
While careful conservation work continues , scholars will be poring over the treasures for decades to come .
" There could be blood on them as well .
These pieces still have a lot to tell us , " said Deb Klemperer , the archaeologist and curator at the Potteries , who was reduced to tears at their beauty when she first saw the gold last summer .
Starkey said the gold , and its new homes in Birmingham and the Potteries , will redraw the map of Anglo - Saxon England .
" These pieces change our understanding not just of history but of geography , swinging the axis away from Kent and Wessex and Northumbria , which we are fairly knowledgeable about , to the highly important but very little understood kingdom of Mercia , of which we know so little . "
And he added the collection would have a positive impact on the Midlands of today .
" They will put new heart and hope into a region which has suffered terribly through de-industrialisation , with the loss of thousands of metal working jobs , and literally the shattering of the Potteries . "
In Stoke Hazel Lyth , city council cabinet member for economic development and culture , said they were thrilled at the grant , " a fantastic gesture that will cap a phenomenal fundraising campaign " , but warned that the fundraising goes on .
" Acquiring these unparalleled treasures is essential , but it is just the beginning .
We still very much need the public 's support in helping us to unlock the secrets of this amazing collection .
It will cost a further £ 1.7 m to develop a Mercian trail which will take in Lichfield and Tamworth to link up the ancient Anglo - Saxon kingdom .
We need to interpret and research the hoard , so that we can discover where it came from , why it was put in Staffordshire soil , and find the answers to many other questions . "
Although the major exhibition has closed , some of the pieces remain on display at Stoke , Birmingham , and at the British Museum in London .
Professor Brian Cox visits Geneva to take a look around Cern's Large Hadron Collider before this vast , 27 km long machine is sealed off and a simulation experiment begins to try and create the conditions that existed just a billionth of a second after the Big Bang .
Cox joins the scientists who hope that the LHC will change our understanding of the early universe and solve some of its mysteries .
News :
Not to be thwarted by a few annoying speed bumps on the road to discovery , CERN scientists have successfully slammed accelerated protons together inside the giant Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) in order to re-create conditions within the universe just moments after the Big Bang .
With two streams of particles travelling at close to the speed of light and moving around the giant ring - shaped accelerator in opposite directions , attending scientists at the CERN facility just outside Geneva created the very first collision at a little after 1100 GMT – causing widespread celebration amongst those who witnessed it .
" This opens the door to a totally new era of discovery , ” enthused CERN 's director of research Sergio Bertolucci via a video relay from the LHC facility .
“ It is a step into the unknown where we will find things we thought were there and perhaps things we did n't know existed . "
As the march of events has lurched in unexpected directions over the past three decades , many a political thinker has been thrown off track and hurled into confusion , if rarely into silence .
But not John Gray .
He has usually been a little ahead of the zeitgeist , waxing contrarian about whatever consensus is about to form .
Gray has been called a chameleon .
If so , he belongs to a very peculiar species : one with precognition , able to change colors before landing on whatever patch of landscape lies just around the corner .
In the early 1980s , Gray , who teaches European thought at the London School of Economics , was the most capable defender of Friedrich von Hayek as a social philosopher rather than just a propagandist for free - market policy .
But he later became decidedly critical of any notion that the future belonged to liberal democracy .
In 1989 , as the Soviet Union was reforming itself out of existence , he wrote that this would not inaugurate “ a new era of post - historical harmony ” but rather “ a return to the classical terrain of history , a terrain of great - power rivalries , secret diplomacies , and irredentist claims and wars . ”
Over the following decade , he advanced a critique of globalization that sounded , at times , profoundly anticapitalist , if by no means Marxian .
Such an ideological itinerary seems like a calculated effort to lose friends .
But whatever its twists and turns , Gray ’s thought has in fact been remarkably consistent , with his journalistic writings simply framing , in the most provocative possible way , theses that have accumulated in more sedate works like “ Enlightenment ’s Wake ” ( 1995 ) and “ Two Faces of Liberalism ” ( 2000 ) .
His latest book , “ Black Mass : Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia , ” treats fundamentalist Islam and Western triumphalism as similar and related phenomena .
This argument revisits themes Gray developed in “ Straw Dogs , ” a volume of pensées originally published in 2002 and now reissued in paperback by Farrar , Straus & Giroux .
“ ‘ Humanity ’ does not exist , ” he announced in “ Straw Dogs . ”
“ There are only humans , driven by conflicting needs and illusions , and subject to every kind of infirmity of will and judgment . ”
This may be the key to all of Gray ’s thought , and it is no accident that he echoes Margaret Thatcher ’s famous statement that there is no such thing as society .
( As she put it , “ there are individual men and women , and there are families ” — but nothing else . )
The irreducible plurality of human “ needs and illusions , ” Gray argues , means it is utopian to imagine that any single kind of political or social order could ever be good for everyone .
“ If there is such a thing as spontaneous social evolution , ” he writes in “ Black Mass , ” “ it produces institutions of many kinds . ”
Police raided the house of an editor for Gizmodo on Friday and seized computers and other equipment .
The raid was part of an investigation into the leak of a prototype iPhone that the site obtained for a blockbuster story last week .
Now , a legal expert has raised questions about the legality of the warrant used in the raid .
On Friday , officers from California 's Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team in San Mateo , California , appeared at the home of Gizmodo editor Jason Chen while he was not there and broke open the front door .
Chen and his wife discovered the officers when they returned from dinner around 9:45 that evening .
According to an account he posted online , Chen noticed his garage door was partly open , and when he tried to open it completely , officers came out and told him they had a warrant to search the premises .
The warrant had been signed just hours earlier , at 7:00 p.m. , by a San Mateo County Superior Court judge .
It allowed the police to search Chen , his residence and any vehicle in his control .
The officers were in the process of cataloging the items they had already taken from the premises and told Chen they had been in his home a " few hours already . "
According to California law , a search warrant may be served between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. unless otherwise authorized .
The officers told Chen he could request reimbursement for the damage to his front door .
Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said Chen is protected from a warrant by both state and federal laws .
The federal Privacy Protection
Act prohibits the government from seizing materials from journalists and others who possess material for the purpose of communicating to the public .
The government cannot seize material from the journalist even if it 's investigating whether the person who possesses the material committed a crime by receiving or possessing the material , which seems to be the nature of the investigation involving Chen .
Instead , investigators need to obtain a subpoena , which would allow the reporter or media outlet to challenge the request and segregate information that is not relevant to the investigation .
" Congress was contemplating a situation where someone might claim that the journalist was committing a crime [ in order to seize materials from them ] , " Granick says .
California state law also provides protections to prevent journalists from being forced to disclose sources or unpublished information related to their work .
" California law is crystal clear that bloggers are journalists , too , " she says .
Apple is on the steering committee for the REACT task force that raided Chen 's house .
Formed in 1997 , REACT is a partnership of 17 local , state and federal agencies tasked with investigating computer - and internet - related crimes .
Among the items seized from Chen 's house were four computers and two servers , an iPhone , digital cameras , records from a Bank of America checking account and the printout of an e-mail sent to Chen from Gawker Media Managing Editor Gaby Darbyshire earlier that day .
The e-mail referred to California 's shield law and specifically stated that police cannot use a search warrant against a journalist to identify a confidential source , or obtain notes and other unpublished information from a news story .
Darbyshire and Chen would n't respond to requests for comment , but according to a letter Darbyshire sent to Detective Matthew Broad , of the San Mateo County Sheriff 's Department , when Chen encountered officers in his home Friday evening , he asked if they had seen a copy of Darbyshire 's e-mail , which he had printed out earlier in the day .
The officers said they had seen it and took it into evidence .
One officer told him that in 25 years of working such cases , he 'd never seen a letter like that .
The e-mail did little good , however .
The officers told Chen and his wife to stand aside while they finished sweeping the house .
Before they left , one of the officers told Chen " something about this possibly being a misunderstanding that could be cleared up if I answered some questions . "
Earlier this month , Gizmodo , which is published by Gawker Media , published a story about a new iPhone prototype that it had received from an anonymous source who had seized the device after an Apple engineer named Gray Powell reportedly left it on a barstool at the Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City , California .
According to Gizmodo , the source did n't initially know what he had until he removed a fake cover from the device and realized it was Apple 's next - generation iPhone .
The source offered the device for sale to several journalists .
Gawker Media paid $ 5,000 for it , but has subsequently returned it to Apple after the company requested it .
Chen is a fulltime journalist for Gawker Media and works from home .
He did not respond to a question from Threat Level asking if he encrypted his computers and servers .
Granick notes that the warrant involved in the search of Chen 's house was also overly broad since it allowed officers to seize entire computers instead of limiting the search to material directly related to the iPhone story in question .
" Certainly when you 're talking about a journalist 's computers , you 're talking about [ other ] sources and information and reporting , " she says .
" There 's nothing in the warrant that limits the search , once the computers are seized , to whatever it is that they 're investigating in this case . "

Fellow alumni of the United States attorney ’s office for the Southern District of New York have mixed views about Mr. McCarthy , who also writes on topics like abortion and overhauling health care .
“ His critics view him as a right - wing blogger , ” said Anthony S. Barkow , a former terrorism prosecutor in the office who now runs a center on criminal law at New York University .
Mr. Barkow said he had stopped reading Mr. McCarthy on topics other than national security .
“ I have to give him credit for being willing to reject his past a bit , ” he said , “ and be out there so vehemently against something he was so integrally a part of . ”
Through a spokesman , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. declined to comment about Mr. McCarthy .
When asked about him during an appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in November , Mr. Holder replied that he was there “ to talk about facts and evidence , real American values , and not the kinds of polemics that he seems prone to . ”
“ I ’m not worried about Mr. McCarthy , ” Mr. Holder said .
Mr. McCarthy now writes regularly for National Review .
He makes extensive public appearances , and he wrote a 2008 book on terrorism policy called “ Willful Blindness . ”
He said in interviews that the evolution of his views came during his stint as a prosecutor .
A graduate of Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx , Mr. McCarthy , the oldest of six children , was 13 when his father died .
After graduating from Columbia College , he attended New York Law School at night while working days as a deputy marshal in the witness protection program .
He later became a paralegal in the United States attorney ’s office .
Hired as a prosecutor in 1986 , he worked on the Pizza Connection heroin trial .

CHICAGO  Nashville 's Pekka Rinne and Chicago's Antti Niemi share a homeland .
On Friday night , the two Finnish goaltenders will have something else in common when they make their debuts in the Stanley Cup playoffs .
The 6 - foot - 5 Rinne went 32 - 16 - 5 this season and hopes to use his big frame to block the net for the seventh - seeded Predators .
Niemi , a 26 - year - old rookie , took over late in the season as the Blackhawks ' top goalie , starting the final nine games .
He had a six - game winning streak before Chicago lost in overtime to Detroit in the season finale Sunday , knocking the Blackhawks into the second slot in the Western Conference .
With goaltending one of the biggest questions for the talented Blackhawks this season , Niemi supplanted Cristobal Huet as the starter and finished the season 26 - 7 - 4 .
Niemi and Rinne each had seven shutouts .
" Both teams got young goalies and the comparisons are pretty accurate , very similar in a lot of ways , " Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said .
Chicago won the season series 4 - 2 but the teams have n't played since Dec. 27 .
The 27 - year - old Rinne was 1 - 2 against the Blackhawks in the regular season , though he posted a shutout Oct. 29 in Nashville .
Niemi , who is 6 - foot - 2 , was 1 - 0 against the Predators with a 5 - 4 win with Dan Ellis in goal for Nashville .
Niemi said he does n't know Rinne well but did face him a couple of times in Finnish league play .
Rinne is from Kempele , Finland , and Niemi is from Vantaa .
" I never really talked with him .
I played against him back home a couple of times a long time ago , " Niemi said .
" I do n't know him too much , but he 's a good goalie . "
Since the Olympic break , Rinne is 12 - 4 - 1 with a 2.03 GAA and .928 save percentage .
He also had four shutouts during that time .
The question about both Rinne and Niemi is how they handle the pressure of the postseason , where the crowd is louder , the lights brighter and the play much more physical .
Both teams will be trying to create traffic and congestion in front of the net to screen the opposing goalie and set up rebound chances .
" It 's the same thing .
It 's just trying to stop the puck and keep it simple , " Rinne said .
" I mean everybody 's always asking what I 'm going to change for the playoff .
I think there 's not too many things I want to change .
... I think I gained some confidence , I want to keep going and just kind of prepare the same way I 've been doing so far . "
Huet , who was a backup to Nikolai Khabibulin a year ago when the Blackhawks reached the Western Conference finals , could n't keep the No. 1 job this year and when Niemi got his chance , he seized it .
" I do n't know if there was a defining moment , " Quenneville said .
" We just kept alternating goaltenders for a stretch there and he took advantage of playing in consecutive games . "
Niemi 's teammates , many of whom got into the playoffs for the first time a year ago , are n't worried about his lack of postseason experience .
" He 's been great for us .
It 's not a concern at all , " said Chicago star Jonathan Toews .
" A lot of us were in that situation last year .
We enjoyed it and made the best of it .
It 's going to be new for him , but we got a lot of experience in this locker room . "
And , of course , the Predators feel the same way about their guy in net .
" The way he finished the season , just the mindset for the playoffs , we have no doubt about that .
We feel so confident in our goaltending situation .
We know Pekka is going to do the job , " said Nashville right wing J.P. Dumont .
Niemi appreciates his progress after signing a free agent contract with the Blackhawks less than two years ago .
He spent most of last season in the AHL .
Now he 's being counted on by a young , talented offensive team in search of the franchise 's first Stanley Cup title since 1961 .
The Blackhawks can't have a goaltender letdown against a team as solid as the Predators .
" Before the season I did n't see this coming , but for some time I 've known it is possible .
It has come real fast , " Niemi said .
" Overall the biggest thing is getting games and getting more confident .
I think that 's the biggest deal . "
Nerves right now are not so bad , Niemi said .
But as Friday 's opener nears ?
" I think I 'm going to be able to sleep , " he said .

From an American perspective , there was a clear winner of Britain 's first - ever prime ministerial TV debate : Nick Clegg .
He looked sharp , was consistently articulate , and was able to challenge the other two candidates pointedly and effectively .
By contrast , the other candidates gave unmemorable performances .
Just as advertised , the incumbent prime minister seemed to belong to a pre-television era .
Gordon Brown came across as old and leaden without seeming especially wise .
David Cameron was stiff and occasionally uncertain , with an upper - class manner that appeared high - handed at times .
Having said that , Clegg had it easy .
Almost no one thinks he 's the next prime minister , so the pressure was off .
Both Brown and Cameron were respectful and friendly because they covet his voters .
Both the Labour and Tory candidates occasionally used Clegg as a battering ram against the real opponent .
In an American context , the three party leaders were marvellously articulate , putting US politicians to shame , including Barack Obama – who can be stilted without his teleprompter .
This was a debate steeped in details and policy .
There were plenty of memorised soundbites , yet the format encouraged quick thinking and gave voters a sense of the mental agility of each candidate .
The subjects of the questions were familiar to anyone who watched the 2008 US presidential clashes : immigration , education , the healthcare system , and war casualties .
The answers were different , for sure .
Americans would n't necessarily have recognised the reasonable , constructive , multi-party approach to immigration , the informative commentary about educational reform , and the consensus about the worth of government - organised healthcare .
Only the sobering exchange about Afghanistan caused deja vu .
The debate was n't perfect .
The exchanges were too short , too often interrupted , and difficult for viewers to interpret .
The most vital question for the viewer : who was right and wrong on the facts of each subject ?
The post - debate fact - checkers have a big job to do , and voters need to pay attention .
If a candidate frequently misstated or invented arguments , he should be punished for it .
Exaggeration is a part of politics , but there is a difference between stretching the truth and breaking it .
As many US presidential debates have proven , a serious gaffe can cost a party millions of votes .
But the Internet by no means invented these things .
As it turns out , they 've been around way longer than that stain in your Honda .
Bizarre sexual fetishes are a staple of the human psyche -- most everyone has them , and with the arrival of Internet porn , all the walls came crumbling down .
Suddenly , everyone everywhere could share their sick , nasty fantasies with the entire world , safe under a veil of anonymity .
6 Tentacle Rape - Late 18th Century
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
We love to mock " tentacle porn , " and Japan for inventing it .
If this is your first day on the Internet , just know tentacle porn is one of the Internet 's most beloved methods of making young people terrified of sex , and it is precisely what it sounds like : women being raped by tentacles ( usually in cartoons ) .
The modern tentacle rape genre was created by Toshio Maeda , whose manga Urotsukidoji " created what might be called the modern paradigm of tentacle porn , " which we suppose in Japan is actually seen as an accomplishment rather than grounds for a sexual assault conviction .
According to Maeda , he started the practice in order to get around Japan 's strict censorship laws , which forbade the depiction of a penis but did not forbid penetration by anything else .
Bet they regret that .

For men , the fetish appeals to those who enjoy seeing women humiliated and subjugated by something that is n't even human .
For women , the fetish appeals to those who 've secretly always wanted to have sex with Squiddly Diddly .
While Maeda may have created the modern tentacle rape , he was n't the inventor - - not even close .
Maeda was preceded by Katsushika Hokusai , an artist from the late 18th and early 19th century .
Hokusai was the artist of the " Thirty - Six Views of Mount Fuji , " an internationally recognized series of prints that earned him fame both locally and globally .
Also : he liked him some tentacles .

Hokusai's " The Dream Of The Fisherman 's Wife " is speculated to be the first instance of tentacle erotica , so by all means do n't click that link if you 're at work , there are children present or you have a soul .
But before you go calling Japan a nation of psychotic fish diddlers , check out " Tentacles of Desire : The Man Who Loved Cephalopods . "
Contained within is the story of Joshua Handley , an English artist in the late 19th century whose travels to Japan resulted in an obsession with tentacle erotica .
New Jersey students punished for participating in school walkout
By Sandy English
30 April 2010
Many of the tens of thousands of students who walked out from their high schools on Tuesday to protest draconian cuts to education now face disciplinary action from school authorities .
The walkout , which was organized largely through Facebook , was called to protest the mass layoffs of teachers and steep budget cuts in school programs enacted by New Jersey ’s Republican Governor Chris Christie .
School districts will lose an average of 11 percent funding .
Christie responded to the walkout by trying to pit students against their teachers , saying that the protests made him wonder “ why the students are protesting only against what the governor is doing , and not against what their teachers are doing . ”
He insisted that teachers were to blame for the cuts because they “ have not stepped up to join the shared sacrifice . ”
Protests are continuing .
On Thursday , seventeen students who walked out of class from Eastside High School in Paterson were arrested for disorderly conduct , according to regional news site wpix.com .
Other students are planning another walkout on May 12 .
Officials at several schools responded to Tuesday ’s walkout by punishing students for seeking to defend their education and their teachers .
Forty - five students from Cresskill High School in Bergen County were suspended after they left school .
Administrators called parents and warned them of more suspensions if the protests continued .
The Gloucester County Times reported that in South Orange - Maplewood students from Columbia High School “ were charged with cutting class , which could affect their grades . ”
Also , “ Those who left the school property face Saturday detention . ”
According to postings on Facebook , students who walked out in Mt. Olive faced in - school suspensions .
At least one student at Cherry Hill High West has reportedly been suspended .
Students at Dickinson High in Jersey City told WSWS reporters that those who walked out would be denied permission to attend an annual cultural event .
Students at Williamstown
High were put under lockdown when the protest began , and those that left the school and now face disciplinary action .
Students at Millville Senior High School face disciplinary action for participation in the walkout as well .
“ If a student missed class they would be disciplined on a sliding scale based on previous violations that could result in a suspension , ” Superintendent Shelly Schneider told TheDailyJournal.com .
Some walkouts also took place on Wednesday and Thursday , and students who participated in these actions also face disciplinary action or arrest .
In Neptune Township High School , 100 students walked out .
One student , Jeff Allen , told the media , “ They say they are going to cut 19 to 24 teachers at the high school alone .
We do n’t have enough teachers as it is .
Our AP ( advanced proficiency ) classes are crowded as it is . ”
Allen and another student were suspended later in the morning .
“ We ’re being made examples , ’’ he said .
“ Our intentions were only good and for the pressing issue of the school budget . ”
The New Jersey Education Association , the statewide teachers ’ union , has played a shameful role in refusing to support the protests .
The union , which has worked systematically to impose concessions on its own membership , denounced the walkouts .
According to The Star - Ledger , on Wednesday the union “ urged districts to punish students based on existing rules on skipping class , with no exceptions : ‘ They ’re going to have to pay the piper , ’ NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer said . ”
New Jersey ’s students acted in a courageous and principled manner to defend public education .
Reprisals , including loss of privileges , demerits , suspensions , memos in computer databases or written reports must be rescinded .
Charges against those arrested must be immediately dropped .
Ubuntu Python : raise an exception , import 190 modules
Date : 25 February 2010 Tags : computing , python
Imagine my surprise , while writing my first PEP 302 compliant import hook this afternoon , to carefully watch sys.modules for the results of my import but see it suddenly grow by nearly two hundred modules !
What on earth had I done wrong ?
Some quick experiments revealed that my only sin was having the temerity to raise an exception .
Let 's try raising a simple NameError :
>>> import sys >>> len ( sys .
modules ) 35 >>> foo ... NameError : name ' foo ' is not defined >>> len ( sys .
modules ) 225
That 's 190 extra modules — merely importing them takes around 60 ms on my laptop !
Where are they all coming from ?
And how could an exception cause so many imports , including such illustrious modules as email , mimetools , and xml ?
After reading Ubuntu 's sitecustomize .py file and all of its consequences , the situation became clear .
Their apport crash - reporting subsystem instruments Python with an exception hook that , when invoked , discovers that my system says enabled=0 in my / etc / default / apport file and so it undertakes no special crash logging .
But , on the way to loading the routine that performs this simple check , it performs two quite flagrant and unnecessary imports , pulling in both apt ( that brings with it 83 packages ) and apport ( an additional 107 packages ) .
The solution ?
I have removed the python - apport package , along with the ubuntuone - client suite that depends on it .
After the uninstall , exceptions are — wonderfully enough — not causing a single import of a new module !
Now , finally , I can continue writing my import hook in peace .

Posted by John , April 4th , 2010 - under Tax .
This is a copy of a letter I sent to the Canberra Times about tax matters raised in its pages .
Dear Editor
Allow me as a tax teacher to comment on 2 tax issues raised in The Sunday Canberra Times of 4 April .
Mike Bannon in Tax Word refers to Yasser El - Ansary from the Institute of Chartered Accountants who ‘ noted the decline in Australia ’s competitiveness by having a company tax rate of 30 percent . ’
This is self - serving nonsense .
Australia was one of only two developed countries to avoid recession during the global financial crisis .
Perhaps the 30 percent company tax rate contributed in some small way to that success .
Australia is experiencing a minerals and energy boom .
Lowering the company tax rate would be a direct gift to our very profitable mining companies and their foreign purchasers .
There may be an argument to do that , but I have n’t yet heard it .
Further , despite all this talk of the 30 percent company tax rate impacting international competitiveness , 40 percent of large business paid no income tax at all in the 3 income years between 2006 and 2008 .
Not a penny .
And for those that did pay company tax most paid well below the headline rate of 30 percent .
The finance industry for example has an effective tax rate of 20 percent .
When big business start contributing the appropriate amount to Australia ’s revenue then , and only then , will I even begin to listen to their complaints about international competitiveness .
Second , in another example of self - serving comments Stuart Collins from the Housing Industry Association in his article ‘ Negative gearing is under siege ’ brings out the old furphy that attempts to curtail the rort in 1985 ‘ put property investment into reverse . ‘
It did no such thing .
In fact both investors and owner occupiers fled the market .
Why ?
Because home loans and investment loans were 15.5 and 17.5 percent .
In any event construction of new homes by investors during that period was higher as a percentage of GDP than in 2009 .
It is true rents rose 22 % in the two years negative gearing was curtailed .
In the two years after that restriction was removed they rose 23 % .
My thanks to Tim Colebatch from The Age for these figures .
His articles Housing at these prices will leave us all a heavy debt to bear and Caught in the cogs of the tax regime are both worth reading , although I disagree about a tax on all family home gains .
I ’d be more selective and limit it to homes worth more than say $ 2 m .
We as a community subsidise investors who have negatively geared rental properties to the tune of about $ 5 billion a year .
On top of that , the capital gains tax concession means these tax subsidised people pay only half the CGT on any gain on the property when they sell it .
As Tim Colebatch points out ‘ in the 13 years to 2006 - 07 , landlords as a group went from declaring net profits of $ 399 million to net losses of $ 6.4 billion .
Those reporting profits grew by 36,000 .
Those reporting losses grew by 594,000 . ’
Those figures tell me people are in it for the losses and the big lightly taxed capital gain , not for earning rental income .
I teach my students that there has to be a link between any expenditure incurred and the production of assessable income for the expenditure to be deductible .
It appears to me that the purposes of those who negatively gear are to get the losses , not to produce income and hence the loss should not be allowable .
The Commissioner of Taxation could ( and in my view should ) be testing this in the courts now .
But ultimately the negative gearing rort must be attacked legislatively , perhaps by allowing the losses made to only be offset against future rental income and by abolishing the 50 percent CGT concession .
Throw down some change , because I ’m about to pick that shit up !
Many , including myself , have attempted to marry chiptunes with the aesthetics of heavy metal , but I ’ve yet to hear anyone fully master those untamably unholy sounds quite like Norrin Radd .
No , not the Silver Surfer .
The other guy .
The product of four years of hard labor in the depths of some presumably warped trans - dimensional intergalactic hell , Anomaly is a dark and brooding concept album of chiptune metal that slams down the hammer of Thor like nobody ’s business .
I ’ve been to hundreds of metal shows over the years – witnessing everything from the blackest , darkest , most twistedly evil shit to some of the goofiest spoof grind bands ever – and Norrin Radd manages to nail every style in the broad spectrum of heavy metal in classic NES style almost effortlessly on this album .
Blast beats , ultra heavy breakdowns , epic wailing solos , demonic growling vocals run through the DPCM channel , crazy technical tempo and rhythm shifts : it ’s all there …and it ’s brilliant .
Excuse me while I form a circle pit and kick stuff around my office .
Experience this amazing work of metal epicness by downloading it here .
Cheers and Jeers for Friday , March 19 , 2010

CHEERS to Spring !
As soon as the sun crosses over the equator at 1:32 pm tomorrow , I shall put on my tutu , strap on my fairy wings , run outside and skip barefoot through the barley fields with the wee village folk .
If history repeats itself , I 'll end up squishing several of them ( they 're really wee ) , but their screams will fall on deaf ears because , really , this is supposed to be a happy time and they 're not going to ruin it for me again .
Memo to daffodils : start poinking !
P.S. Once Customs officials give 'em their full - body - cavity searches ( check that underwear ! ) , the swallows will be returning to the San Juan Capistrano Mission in California .
The annual event is popular with budding young lovers who are on a budget .
It 's a cheep date .
CHEERS to civil disobedience in uniform .
In an act of bravery , patriotism , pride and just a hint of the kinky , Lieutenant Dan Choi and Captain Jim Pietrangelo , decked out in their Army fatigues , handcuffed themselves to the White House fence yesterday to protest the military 's ' Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell ' policy .
Pushing the envelope further , today they went to court and said , " Fine ?
We ain't payin ' no stinkin ' fine .
We 're goin ' to trial . "
Then they shouted " Huah ! " together and gave the judge windburn .
Meanwhile , the new poster child for those opposed to DADT is a retired general --- I believe his name is Ninny McDramaqueen --- who claims that gay soldiers are genocide enablers .
Now I know why his grandkids have to take a double dose of Zoloft before he reads 'em a bedtime story .
CHEERS to the final push .
If all goes according to plan ( Ha Ha Ha Ha ! ) , the House will get the 216 votes it needs to pack the healthcare sausage into its casing 43 hours from now and send it to the Senate , which will fry it up and serve it to the President next week .
In the meantime , the right - wingers in and out of Washington are doing themselves no favors by ratcheting up their vitriol to the point of hooliganism .
( Savaging an 11 year - old kid and a 60 year - old guy with Parkinson 's disease ?
Really ????? )
This is the campaign ad I want to see airing across the country this fall :
[ Footage of the worst of the teabagger / Limbaugh / Malkin / Beck behavior interspersed with the worst rhetoric of GOP congressmembers ]
Narrator : While Democrats were working day and night on historic healthcare reform ... to give 30 million uninsured Americans coverage ... to eliminate denial of benefits because of pre-existing conditions ... and to reduce the deficit by over a trillion dollars , this is what the Republicans were contributing : [ More obnoxious footage ]
Narrator :
When you vote this November , remember : Republicans got us into this mess by sitting on their hands when they were in power ... and then , when they lost , turned into a do - nothing peanut gallery while Democrats were left to clean it up .
This November , vote Democrat .
Because the alternative is these guys ....[ More rabid footage ] ... and we 've seen what they do : nothing .
But , of course , we wo n't .
We 're just too nice .
JEERS to the 7 - year ditch .
Today marks 2,557 days since the invasion of a country that over half of Americans still can't point to on a map and , in many ways , America 's descent into outright madness .
Yesterday I re-hung the words of the neocon architects around their necks , and today Noweasels posted a this poignant reminder .
This evening I want to single out a particularly odious individual for scorn , ridicule and ( in our dreams ) a long jail sentence : Paul Wolfowitz , who was Don Rumsfeld 's Deputy Orc. Behold his amazing grasp of Iraq War bamboozlement and cluelessness :
On WMDs : " They 've worked at hiding them very , very deliberately .
There 's no question in my mind that there was something there .
There are just too many pieces of evidence , and we 'll get to the bottom of it . "
On troop strength : " The notion that it would take several hundred thousand American troops just seems outlandish . "
On American casualties : " [ As of May 2 , 2004 ]
It 's approximately 500 of which --- I can get the exact numbers --- approximately 350 are combat deaths . "
[ Actual figure at the time of his statement to a congressional committee : 738 deaths , of which 524 had been killed in combat ]
On paying for the war : " There 's a lot of money to pay for this .
It does n't have to be U.S. taxpayer money .
We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon . "
As we count down the days until August , when our combat troops will FINALLY leave Iraq , we 'll continue to pray every day for the headline we'd love to see : Wolfowitz chokes on comb .
Nothing fatal , of course .
Just enough to make him crap his pants .
CHEERS to strategic cutting and running .
In a move that would 've gotten him court - martialed by ex-president Bush for " not finishing the job , " on tomorrow 's date in 1942 , General Douglas MacArthur pulled out of the Philippines during World War II so his forces could live to fight another day .
His words made history : " I shall return . "
Not so historic were the words that followed : " Accelerator 's on the right !
Go Go Go Go Go !!!! "
CHEERS to home vegetation .
Here in Maine the mercury plans on zooming up to 65 degrees tomorrow , so we 'll be playin ' out in the yard most of the day .
But fear not , my beloved TV , there 'll be time for you , too , especially Sunday around 1 for the House healthcare vote .
Meanwhile on HBO 's Real Time , Bill Maher gets in some face time with Dennis Kucinich , Gavin Newsom , and [ swoon ! ] actor Emile Hirsch .
They 'll all gang up on Ayn Rand BFF Stephen Moore , but only because he 's wrong about everything !
New DVD releases include Disney 's Oscar - nominated , 2D - animated The Princess and the Frog , plus Mystery Science Theatre XVII , Ninja Assassin and " Did You Hear About the Morgans ? "
( SPOILER ALERT : " No . " )
College basketball games will help dudes pass the time as Vasectomy Madness swings ( heh ) into high gear .
And here 's your Sunday morning lineup ... the good , the bad , and the ugly .
Meet the Press : Steny Hoyer cleans John Boehner 's clock --- that 's good .
Ed Gillespie on the roundtable --- that 's bad .
Tim Kaine 's caterpillar eyebrows clash with Michael Steele 's caterpillar mustache --- that 's ugly .

CHEERS to fixing Social Security .
Bush said this at his press conference yesterday re : private accounts : " You get to decide whether you want to set some of your money aside in an account that will earn a better rate of return than that which will be earned in the Social Security system . "
C&J 's question :
If there 's a way to earn a higher rate of return , why is n’t the government doing that with Social Security now ?
Cue the crickets .
JEERS to America's achin ' 401 ( k ) s .
The Dow fell a whopping 112 points yesterday because of rising oil prices .
And fears that GM 's earnings will be 80 % below expectations .
And worries about interest rates .
And dread over the ballooning deficit .
And rumors that Stefano might be up to something on ' Days of Our Lives . '
Those Wall Street types ... they do n't miss a thing .

And just one more ...
CHEERS to the fountain of Ruth .
My partner Michael 's grandmother turns 97 today .
Ninety seven !
She finally moved to an assisted - living facility late last year , but she still has her marbles , and plays squash twice a day .
It 's mind - boggling to revisit where our country was when she was born ... in 1913 :
The National Woman 's Party formed
The 16th Amendment establishing the income tax was ratified
Woodrow Wilson succeeded William Howard Taft
The first U.S. paved coast - to - coast highway opened
The Shubert Theatre opened in New York
Henry Ford started using a moving assembly line
Gandhi was arrested for leading a miners march in South Africa
The first modern elastic bra was patented
The Panama Canal opened ... and so did the first drive - up gas station
Charlie Chaplin started his film career
and ...
President Wilson said America would never attack another country .
It 's been awfully quiet ever since .
Happy Birthday , Gram ... and 97 great big blessings on your camels .
Have a lovely spring weekend .
Stay classy .
Floor 's open ... What are you cheering and jeering about today ?

The monkey studies , it is hoped , will add to the effort to discern which aspects of brain function are involved in adolescent depression .
In monkeys , depression is difficult to diagnose because , obviously , the animals cannot talk about feelings .
Anxiety , though , is fairly easy to measure by observing behavior .
The kinds of anxious behavior the monkeys demonstrate -- not only inhibition when facing a stranger but also increased fearfulness and vigilance -- are like the actions of children with anxiety , Dr. Cameron said .
In children , anxiety and depression are closely related and are thought to arise from the same biological mechanisms .
'' Now , we can do all sorts of studies with the anxious monkeys that are harder to do in humans , '' Dr. Cameron said .
'' We can observe their behavior every day .
We can take blood samples and look at their hormones .
We can assess how they respond to stress .
We can ask what 's different about their brains .
And ultimately , we can search for genes that underlie their anxiety . ''
Dr. Cameron and her colleagues are careful to say they do not believe adolescent depression is strictly a biological disorder .
'' It may begin with a genetic liability , but when the early episodes of depression happen , it probably has to do with psychosocial stressors , '' said Dr. Neal D. Ryan , a psychiatrist and a leader of a 20 - year study of adolescent depression at the University of Pittsburgh .
The kinds of stress that can bring about depression in adolescence , psychiatrists have found , can include both negative experiences and the lack of positive experiences -- the death of a family member , for example , and perhaps a dearth of love , warmth or support from others .
'' We 'd like to understand the biological piece not because we think it 's all of the story or even most of the story , '' said Dr. Ronald E. Dahl , a psychiatrist and an investigator for the Pittsburgh study .
'' It 's because there probably is this interaction between biological systems and stress ; we 'd like to get insights into the brain systems involved . ''
The ultimate goal is to find ways to nip depression in the bud .
I saw the earth explode :
How a photographer shooting outdoor clothing camped on Iceland ’s volcano – and witnessed the eruption that closed Europe ...
It was a ferocious volcanic eruption that belched out tons of white - hot molten rock , sent a billowing plume of ash miles into the sky – and would lead to chaos in the airports of northern Europe .
And these astonishing pictures , taken by British freelance photographer John Beatty , record the spectacular events which took place at the now - infamous Eyjafjallajoekull ( Island - Mountain - Glacier ) volcano in Iceland , and which have had such a dramatic aftermath .
Mr Beatty , 58 , happened to be in Iceland ’s glacier fields on an assignment to take pictures for an outdoor clothing company when he found himself at the centre of the awe - inspiring natural phenomenon .
The big bang : A breathtaking view of the Icelandic volcano in full flow
Close encounter :
The lights inside the tent used by John Beatty and guide Jon Magnussen on the glacier are no match for the dramatic display from the smouldering volcano that is just half a mile away
Lava fountain : Sprays of white - hot molten rock are hurled hundreds of feet into the air from the two - mile - wide crater , where the temperature is 1,000C .
This picture was taken from 500ft away
‘ Being that close was frightening but an incredible experience , ’ he said .
‘ I specialise in photographing wild , natural places .
But an active volcano is one of the rarest and finest sights in the natural world .
There were scarlet , yellow and pink pools with pulsating lava being hurled 500ft into the air and the volcano was showering rock across the surrounding ash and ice .
‘ When I was close to the lava I got a sharp , foul taste at the back of my mouth , which told me the air was poisonous .
We stayed close for only ten minutes at a time ; any longer and we could have collapsed from lack of oxygen . ’
Mr Beatty stayed 500ft from the fissures while the lava was flowing .
But at one point he was able to get within 10ft of the lava when it cooled after a small earthquake temporarily closed the fissures .
' Frightening but incredible ' : John Beatty on the glacier
The volcano first erupted on March 20 .
Mr Beatty , who was in Iceland with glacier guide Jon Magnussen , took his amazing pictures between April 4 and 12 .
He left Iceland last Wednesday– on what would turn out to be oneof the very last flights out .
Just 24 hours later the volcano sent up a 20,000 ft - high cloud of ash , which drifted south and has now forced all British and many European airports to close .
Hot as Hades : A spectacular and terrifying view of the volcano in action with magma bubbling and boiling as it breaks through the Earth 's crust
Fire and ice :
As the lava cools on the ice plain , Mr Beatty , shrouded in smoke and steam , picks his way through the rock and ash .
He could n't spend very long there but the heat was still enough to melt his boots
Scientists believe the volcano may erupt again in the coming months .
Gardner killed a man during an escape attempt in 1985
A convicted murderer in the US state of Utah has chosen to be executed by firing squad .
When given a choice between lethal injection or being shot , Ronnie Lee Gardner told the judge : " I would like the firing squad , please . "
Of the 35 US states that have the death penalty , Utah is the only one to give firing squads as an option .
Critics say the method is a relic from the state 's Wild West past and should be abolished .
The judge in Salt Lake City set Gardner 's execution date for 18 June , but Gardner 's lawyer said he would appeal .
Correspondents say he may still petition the state parole board to commute his sentence to life imprisonment .
Famous last words
The 49 - year - old convict killed a lawyer in a shootout while trying to escape from a courthouse in 1985 .
He would be only the third man to be killed by firing squad since the Supreme Court allowed states to have the death penalty in 1976 .
The first man to be executed after capital punishment was re-instated was Utah murderer Gary Gilmore .
He famously said " Let 's do it " before facing the bullets in 1977 .
The second - John Albert Taylor - attracted huge media attention for his execution in 1996 .
Should Gardner 's scheduled death go ahead , it is likely to garner a similar media storm , the BBC's Madeleine Morris in Washington says .
Death row convicts in Utah were for decades allowed to choose their method of execution .
State legislators removed that choice in 2004 and made lethal injection the standard method - but inmates sentenced before then still have a choice .
I used to go camping in a serious way , with nothing more than a backpack and freeze - dried meals to sustain me .
Now , however ( I 'm not sure whether it is because I 'm wiser , or just older ) , I like a little more comfort , and I want my food to have flavour .
Some of the old campfire favourites – bacon , eggs , sausages , beans – are fine , but you do n't want them every day , and they tend to be heavy with fat and salt .
To get more variety , the key is to go for different flavours and , while you are at it , why not try some dishes that are not that practical to make at home ?
Cooking on an open fire is the ideal opportunity for messy cooking : charred jacket potatoes , fish cooked in clay , or an American - style rack of ribs with a dry , spicy rub .
This is the sort of cooking that , if attempted in suburbia , would have the neighbours complaining about the smoke or phoning the fire brigade .
When you are camping , you do n't take your kitchen scales ; you do everything by eye and instinct .
All you need is some basic equipment ( a good knife , a grater , strong plastic bags that seal , and , if you 're not backpacking , a heavy casserole dish ) , essential flavours ( salt , pepper , powdered chilli , allspice , garlic , sugar , ginger , thyme , lemongrass , fresh limes , soy sauce ) and some sunflower oil .
Here are some of my favourite ideas for meals ; use them as a starting point for your own dishes .
Kebabs
Put some prawns in a plastic bag with chilli , oil and lemon .
Shake it about , leave for an hour or so , then skewer the prawns and cook them over the fire .
If you prefer meat , mix up some peanut butter with oil and chilli to make a satay sauce .
Chop pork , beef or lamb into small cubes and place in a bag with the sauce .
To marinate the meat more deeply , add a teaspoon of plain yoghurt if you have some , shake and leave for a couple of hours before cooking .
Wild salads
If you put salad leaves in a sealed plastic bag with a dribble of water , they will keep for a few days .
Supplement with foraged wild garlic , dandelions and primrose flowers ( assuming you can find these in a dog- and - pesticide - free area ) .
Drain the excess water from the salad leaves .
Chuck some oil , a little lemon juice , a few drops of vinegar ( if you have it ) and a pinch of salt into a new bag .
Shake , then add your salad leaves and wild leaves .
Shake again and serve .
Charred jacket potatoes
Wrap the potatoes in foil and chuck them in the ashes for at least half an hour .
They should end up black on the outside .
Hold them in a thick cloth to prise them open and scoop out the middle .
They will be steamy , and delicious with butter .
Clay - baked fish
There are two schools of thought on cooking fish in a fire : you wrap it in either damp newspaper or clay .
I lean towards clay as it is easier to handle , and feels more natural .
To find clay , you need to look along the edges of a creek or stream .
Roll out a pencil - sized piece , and if you can wrap it around your finger without it breaking , then you 've got good clay .
Roll - out a 1 cm thick sheet
of this clay and place on it a gutted fish stuffed with a few interesting flavourings ( wild garlic , a lime , ginger , lemongrass ) .
Wrap the fish in the clay , ensuring there are no air gaps , and carefully place it in the hot ashes , covering with more glowing , hot ashes .
Leave it to cook for 40 minutes to an hour .
Spatchcock chicken or ribs
Cooking meat skewered on some branches is great fun and impresses the kids like nothing else , except perhaps cooking fish in clay .
Spatchcock a chicken – its easy !
– or get your butcher to do it ; or use a rack of ribs instead .
Make a dry rub using roughly equal quantities of allspice , crushed garlic , grated ginger , sugar , chilli powder and salt .
Then rub thoroughly over the chicken or ribs .
Skewer your chicken with crossed branches poked through the legs on opposite sides , in an X shape .
Prop the meat above the fire – if the heat is right , the meat should start charring after about five minutes ; cook for 15 minutes in total .
Check the juices run clear by poking the thickest part of the meat before serving .
Bonfire puddings
Simple banana halves fried in butter never fails .
There is no need to add sugar , although leftover Easter egg works well with this .
If you 're feeling more ambitious , try this " bonfire clafouti " : cover the bottom of a cast - iron casserole dish with a layer of pear or apple halves , make a thick batter using a packet sponge cake or muffin mix , and pour over the fruit .
Place the lid on the casserole dish and balance it above the hot ashes ( there needs to be an air gap under the dish to stop it from burning ) .
This is a fantastic way to finish your bonfire dinner .
These are my favourites , tried and tested , but I 'm always keen to hear new ideas .
So what inspired campfire dishes have you come up with and which have ended in disaster ?
Also , what 's good to drink with a charred dinner ?
I 'm a bit biased - I like a certain well - known stout with most things , but a bottle of wine is also guaranteed to taste better drunk in the fresh air around a fire .
Q : How did Wall Street manage to convince the rating agencies to slap investment grade ratings on Junk ?
A : They had cheat codes !
Here is Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story in today ’s NYT :
“ One of the mysteries of the financial crisis is how mortgage investments that turned out to be so bad earned credit ratings that made them look so good .
One answer is that Wall Street was given access to the formulas behind those magic ratings — and hired away some of the very people who had devised them .
In essence , banks started with the answers and worked backward , reverse - engineering top - flight ratings for investments that were , in some cases , riskier than ratings suggested , according to former agency employees . . .
But while the agencies have come under fire before , the extent to which they collaborated with Wall Street banks has drawn less notice .
The rating agencies made public computer models that were used to devise ratings to make the process less secretive .
That way , banks and others issuing bonds — companies and states , for instance — would n’t be surprised by a weak rating that could make it harder to sell the bonds or that would require them to offer a higher interest rate .
But by routinely sharing their models , the agencies in effect gave bankers the tools to tinker with their complicated mortgage deals until the models produced the desired ratings . ”
This is something that only a few people have long suspected :
That the Agencies were complicit — active participants — in the gaming of their own ratings .
Its one thing to poach an employee to figure out some of the secret to how sausages are made ;
But from a business perspective , I did n’t imagine the Agencies themselves were so foolish as to allow their secret sauce to become widely known amongst underwriters .

Review of the Constellation Program�s Request to Discontinue Using the Metric System of Measurement
Status Report From : NASA Office of Inspector General
Posted : Monday , March 29 , 2010
The Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) examined the Constellation Program 's draft request to reverse its 2 - year - old decision to implement the metric system ( also known as the International System of Units or SI ) as its standard system of measurement and instead use the U.S. customary system ( e.g. , feet , pounds , ounces ) .
Our objective was to assess the basis for the Constellation Program 's request to NASA 's Chief Engineer for an exception to NASA 's policy that requires use of the metric system in Agency programs .
In addition to examining this specific request , we considered the possible long - term impact on other NASA projects and the Agency 's efforts to expand use of the metric system if the exception was granted , which appears likely .
Details of the review 's scope and methodology are in Appendix A .
Results
We concluded that the Constellation Program 's request for an exception to using the metric system as its standard system of measurement does not clearly meet NASA criteria for granting such an exception .
In addition , the request does not adequately consider the long - term impact of the decision on future NASA projects .
Specifically , we found that the Program 's draft request for an exception to using the metric system does not meet the criteria for exceptions under NASA Policy Directive ( NPD ) 8010.2E
" Use of the SI ( Metric ) System of Measurement in NASA Programs , " March 4 , 2007 ( see Appendix B ) .
The request from Constellation Program officials suggests that implementing the metric system is impractical and its use could increase risk and threaten mission success .
However , we found conflicting documentation attesting to the practicality of implementing the metric system as the primary system of measurement in the Constellation Program .
In addition , other Constellation Program documentation we reviewed refutes the suggestion that implementing the metric system would increase risk in this Program .
We also found that neither the Constellation Program nor the NASA Chief Engineer has fully assessed the long - term impact on the Agency of moving away from use of the metric system .
We also found that NASA 's written policy directing use of the metric system in Agency programs is deficient in several respects .
First , NPD 8010.2E does not define the term " adds unacceptable risk , " which leads to differing interpretations of the risks that programs can cite when seeking an exception to using the metric system .
Second , the NPD does not provide a mechanism for exceptions to be reevaluated in the event new projects are added to an exempt program or improvements are made in the availability of metric - measured parts .
A previous OIG report recommended that approved exceptions should not be " open- ended , " but rather reviewed approximately every 5 years to see if conditions underlying the rationale for the exception had changed .
Although NASA management agreed with this recommendation and stated that the pertinent NPD would be modified to " require reassessment of opportunities and rejustification of program - wide waivers where still required , at least once every 5 years , " the current version of the NPD does not contain this requirement .
During our fieldwork , NASA 's Chief Engineer told the OIG that he planned to approve the Constellation Program 's request for an exception based on the additional costs required to implement the metric system , which Constellation Program officials estimated at $ 368 million .
These implementation costs arise mainly from the reuse of hardware and software from previous NASA programs , including the Space Shuttle , that did not use the metric system , thus requiring revisions to engineering documents , test plans , test equipment , facilities , training , and operations .
According to the Chief Engineer and Constellation Program management , the estimated $ 368 million for metric system implementation would be better spent on mitigating higher priority Program risks .
We found that because the Department of Defense ( DoD ) has not fully embraced the metric system as the manufacturing standard in its projects , and because of the size of its contracts , DoD exerts an overriding influence on the U.S. aerospace industry .
NASA officials stated that until DoD begins converting its major programs to the metric system , NASA will not be able to easily transition to the metric system due to a lack of aerospace parts designed in metric units .

Those who study the ways of child abuse , like the pyschologist Alice Miller , tell us that adults who abuse children were themselves usually abused as children .
Abuse is a self - perpetuating noxious cycle .
As you were mistreated , so will you pass that along .
So I wonder : were all these pedophile Catholic priests abused , then , when they were young ?
And by whom ?...
Is a long history playing itself out , that we 're just beginning to grasp -- and should be looking at even closer ?

I develop strong attachments to certain plants — not love exactly , but fascination .
I watch them change through the seasons , and they surprise me .
Every year they look different , growing and maturing like children — each one precious , each unique .
One of my favorites is Hamamelis x intermedia ‘ Pallida ’ .
It has been in full bloom at least since March 1 .
That may not be news for you , since witch hazels typically bloom in winter , some time between January and March .
But this is special for me .
It ’s my first ‘ Pallida ’ and the first time this young plant , which has lived with us for about two years , has fully bloomed .
It ’s luminous .
‘ Pallida ’ enchanted me years ago on a January trip with friends to England .
Wandering around the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley , Surrey , we came upon a stand of witch hazels .
‘ Pallida ’ glowed , making other witch hazels look coarse in comparison .
My shrub is about 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide , but it may eventually grow to 10 or 12 feet high and wide .
Hardy in Zones 5 - 8 , it has an elegant , open , vase - shaped , spreading form .
‘ Pallida ’s lightly fragrant , lemon - hued flowers cluster on naked branches .
Each delicate bloom has four long , skinny , wrinkly petals surrounded by purplish red sepals .
Witch hazel petals react to weather , curling up to protect themselves from frost and unfurling on milder days .
In fall , the soft leaves turn a fine yellow before dropping .
‘ Pallida ’ thrives in a partly shaded border with mulched moist , acidic soil .
If I had space , I ’d grow it as an informal hedge .
While ‘ Pallida ’ is my good witch hazel child , Hamamelis x intermedia ‘ Arnold Promise ’ is my challenge .
Our shrub is about 10 years old and measures roughly 5 feet by 5 feet with a lovely rounded habit .
The trouble is , for the first eight years , we never saw a flower because the shrub never once dropped its big coarse leaves .
They remained attached to the plant even as the flowers , if there were any , bloomed .
It ’s not uncommon for witch hazels to hold onto dead foliage , but when it happened to us , we felt frustrated at not seeing this shrub – so famous for its big fragrant winter blooms – achieve its potential .
The Royal Horticultural Society says that this phenomenon is most common with yellow - flowered varieties , and that weather and age may be factors in this behavior : A warm autumn followed by sudden frost may be all it takes for more leaves to stay on the branches .
At Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania , an instructor suggested removing the leaves one by one , using an up and out motion .
It worked , but we did n’t have the patience to pull more than one - quarter of them on a freezing , snowy New England winter day .
Bob , my husband , wanted to ditch ‘ Arnold Promise ’ , but its handsome rounded to vase - shaped habit and yellow fall color made me insist that it stay .
We compromised , and moved the shrub from the border near ‘ Pallida ’ to the sunny , exposed edge of a roadside culvert , where winter salt would drench it and sand would beat it .
That did the trick .
Although I suggest that you site your witch hazel in a more protected , hospitable spot , ‘ Arnold Promise ’ is oddly flourishing with the added stress ( though it may not live as long ) .
It grows well , drops its leaves in fall , and this year we ’ve been enjoying its bronzy buds and big golden yellow flowers .
Mind you , we ’re seeing hundreds of half - open buds with just a quarter or so in full bloom , but we appreciate what we ’ve got .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy , right , takes leave of Armenia President Serge Sarkissian , following their working lunch at the Elysee Palace in Paris , Wednesday March 10 , 2010 .
( AP Photo / Remy de la Mauviniere )
( AP ) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy will open a daylong conference Thursday of some 40 nations to start turning plans into action to save the world 's forests and help rein in the noxious gases blamed for climate change .
Ministers from countries of the Amazon and Congo river basins and Indonesia - whose massive forests , most at risk , are at the heart of efforts to end deforestation - were among those attending the one - day conference .
A follow - up meeting is scheduled for May in Oslo , Norway .
" The forest in danger .
Massive planet - wide destruction continues , " France 's influential environment minister Jean - Louis Borloo said to reporters Wednesday ahead of the conference .
The conference , with closed - door working groups , is looking to translate measures adopted at the U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen in December into concrete mechanisms - and funds .
World Bank representatives and lending nations were also attending the meeting .
To simply inventory the forests - counting the fauna and flora - is a necessary but hugely expensive " mammoth project , " said Henri Djombo , the Republic of Congo 's sustainable development and environment minister .
Deforestation , which involves the burning of trees to clear land and the natural rotting of trees , is thought to account for up to 20 percent of carbon dioxide sent into the atmosphere - as much as that emitted by all the world 's cars , trucks , trains , planes and ships combined .
Reducing deforestation is one of the most effective ways to reduce the emissions responsible for climate change .
Indonesia and Brazil are the world 's third - and fourth - largest carbon emitters , after China and the United States .
Deforestation for logging , growing crops or making room for cattle grazing , are the prime causes .
A plan to help protect tropical forests by having rich nations pay the countries concerned fell apart in Copenhagen , though the forest program , known as REDD - for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation - survived .
A portion of the $ 30 billion that world leaders agreed to spend over the next three years to help poor nations could go toward the forest program .
World leaders agreed to spend a total of $ 100 billion by 2020 .
Finding mechanisms to disburse those funds quickly and fairly is among the tasks at the conference .
Djombo and two other African ministers present with Borloo on Wednesday were unanimous that not enough money has been committed to the fight against deforestation - and they said the money earmarked so far should be funneled quickly to the relevant countries .
They emphasized that the task at hand is enormous , and long - term .
Forest management must become participative , putting people who live off the forest at the heart of the program , the ministers said .
Gabon 's environment minister , Martin Mabala , said the world and indigenous populations need to view the forest differently .
For example , he said the term " wood cutter " should be replaced by the term " forest manager . "
" Forests are a planetary asset and no longer the concern of individual countries , " Mabala said .
" This is the business of all humanity . "

A convicted killer in Utah today chose to be executed by firing squad , a method only rarely used in that state and banned almost everywhere else in the US .
Ronnie Lee Gardner , 49 , murdered a lawyer and has been on death row for 25 years .
He faces execution by five volunteers ( who would be police officers ) on June 18 , having been given the choice of the firing squad or a lethal injection .
Utah joined the rest of the US in banning firing squads in 2004 , mainly owing to embarrassment at the hordes of media which descended for earlier executions and portrayed the state 's justice system as a relic of the wild west .
But Gardner is one of about 10 prisoners who were sentenced to death before the ban and so have to be offered the choice .
Some of the others have also said they will opt for the firing squad .
The last person to be executed in this way in Utah was John Taylor in 1996 .
He said he had chosen it " to make a statement that Utah was sanctioning murder " .
The only other state where firing squads are still permitted is Oklahoma , where the method is only for use in the event of failure of other means .
Gardner told the court : " I would like the firing squad , please . "
He made his choice after the judge , Robin Reese , told him that he had exhausted the appeals process and was unlikely to be given any further postponements .
But Gardner 's lawyer , Andrew Parnes , said he would appeal .
There is a commonly held belief that only one member of a firing squad has a live round and the others are given blanks , to help ease consciences at having fired a fatal shot .
But in 1977 Mikal Gilmore claimed his executed brother Gary 's shirt had four bullet holes in it .
• This article was amended on 27 April 2010 .
The original referred to Gary Gilmore 's shirt having five bullet holes in it .
This has been corrected .
Microsoft had finally pull the plug on ‘ Halo 2 ’ on Xbox Live and gamers had to say their goodbyes on April 15th .
However , a bunch of gamers found a loophole through this by not turning off their Xbox and disconnecting from their games , which means until they either drop from the game or be forced off the server .
Joe Campbell posted this on the Bungie forums :
Throughout the past week , a small group of dedicated Halo 2 players kept their Xbox ’s on so that they could enjoy the game for a while longer .
( As long as we do n’t turn off our Xbox ’s , or lose connection , we can stay online .
Our Xbox ’s have been on for nearly 12 days straight )
Each day the amount of people decreased , at a rapid rate .
A lot of us became really good friends , and it ’s almost like we ’re family now .
For a while , we had ‘ T0 Be Continued ’
Live streaming all of our games , until her Xbox regrettably froze while playing custom games .
Then , ‘ Mr7ankjump ’ did a live stream , but he lagged out only 4 hours later .
As of now the numbers of players are at fourteen because most of the gamers in the small group are having problems staying in the game .
I say using your Xbox 360 and staying on Xbox Live for 12 days is a feat itself , but hey they doing this not for glory or recognition , but for the love of the game .
Joe Campbell will keep updating the list of players still inside the game until it goes down to 0 .
I can see Disney making a buck out of this with a movie .
With more than 500,000 units sold in its first week , Apple 's iPad has tracked as high as 0.04 percent of total daily Web browsing , a number equal to March averages for the Android and BlackBerry platforms , according to a Web analysis firm .
Net Applications has been tracking the presence of the iPad online since the device was released on April 3 .
On its launch day , the iPad took an estimated 0.01 percent of all Web browser traffic , and continued to climb to its peak of 0.04 percent on April 10 and 11 .
As noted by Gregg Keizer of Computerworld , the iPad 's share is nearly as great as usage of BlackBerry or Google Android on the Web .
In the month of March , Net Applications found that BlackBerry had an average 0.04 percent share , while Android , split between versions 1.5 and 1.6 , had the exact same figure .
While the iPad achieved 0.04 percent for a couple of days , it has not yet sustained those numbers .
The statistics also show that iPhone and iPod touch devices are responsible for 0.6 percent of total Web browsing , an online presence about 20 times larger than the iPad managed to achieve in its first week .
Apple this week revealed that it sold more than 500,000 iPads in the device 's first week of availability .
While the overall market presence of Android and BlackBerry phones dwarfs the number of iPads in the wild , the new statistics suggest that early adopters of the iPad have been far more likely to browse the Web on their new device than owners of BlackBerries or Android handsets .
Also coming in with a 0.04 percent share , like the iPad , BlackBerry and Android , was Windows ME , Microsoft 's much maligned operating system released in the year 2000 .
For comparison , Windows XP is a whopping 64.46 percent of all Web browsing .
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is represented by 2.13 percent of all computers on the Web , while its predecessor , Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard , takes up a slightly larger 2.26 percent .
Net Applications also found that Google is the dominant search engine on Apple 's iPad , responsible for 97.43 percent of all searches conducted from the device .
The iPad operating system , iPhone OS 3.2 , has Google as the default search engine in its Mobile Safari Web browser .
Users can go into the system settings and change the default to Yahoo , which carries 1.98 percent of iPad searches .
Microsoft 's Bing , which has been rumored for months to potentially become the default search engine of the iPhone , was third with 0.27 percent of all iPad searches .
Ask took fourth with 0.13 percent , and AOL fifth with 0.8 percent .
Search for : Enter as many words as you like ; separate them with a space .

Tablets are all the rage this year and now with the launch of the iPad , Apple rival Google ca n’t resist getting into the game .
A user interface designer at Google , Glen Murphy , has posted mock - ups of a tablet running Google ’s Chrome operating system along with a video demo of how users could potentially interact with the machine .
Google introduced Chrome OS two months ago as a lightweight , browser - based operating system that would boot up in seven seconds or less .
The first Chrome OS netbooks are expected to be available in late 2010 through hardware from manufacturers Google has partnered with .
Already , Acer has said , this year , it plans to offer a million netbooks running Chrome OS .
The latest mock - ups hint at Google ’s ambitions for Chrome OS .
Though the operating system was initially positioned for netbooks , a fast growing tablet market could make for a better fit .
ABI Research estimates four million tablets will be shipped this year and , by 2015 , annual shipments could touch 15 million tablets .
ABI Research defines media tablets as having a touch - screen interface , 5 - 11 inches in size , with Wi -Fi Internet connectivity and video and gaming capabilities .
In terms of hardware design , Google ’s mock - up feels similar to the iPad .
But a different user interface hopes to set it apart .
The tablet has a virtual keyboard at the bottom of the screen , which can also float as a separate window .
There are icons for quick access to Facebook , Gmail , Pandora , calendar and other apps .
It also seems to support multi-touch and the familiar pinch to zoom and scrolling gesture .
Murphy has more photos of the concept Google Chrome OS tablet and even a video that shows this concept tablet in action .

Apple introduced some new terms to its developers contract on Thursday .
Buried away in the 21,000 - odd words of the agreement is this interesting clause :
3.3.1 Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
It 's that last bit which is the real kicker .
The stuff about private APIs - basically , calls to programming hooks that Apple reserves for its own applications on the iPhone and iPod Touch ( the iPad uses a slightly different version of the OS ) - is n't new .
But that last bit is a shot not just across the bows of Adobe - it 's a broadside aimed right into its new Creative Suite .
Because CS5 , which is being readied on the slipway right now and is due to be introduced next week ( I was to have had a prebriefing on it yesterday but - ah , cruel fate - had to put that to write about the Digital Economy bill , now Act ) - allows you to write apps in Flash but then to cross - compile them to run on devices like , ooh , iPhones or iPod Touches .
See , it 's even been touting it on its blogs :
" Adobe® Flash ® Professional CS5 will include a Packager for iPhone that will let you publish ActionScript 3 projects to run as native applications for iPhone .
These applications can be delivered to iPhone users through the Apple App Store . * "
Oh yeah , the asterisk in that sentence ?
You scroll wayyyy down and you get to the caveat : "* Delivery through the App Store requires participation in the iPhone Developer Program and approval of the application by Apple . "
And now Apple is saying : no way .
You write it in something that 's one of our favoured languages - particularly Cocoa Touch - or you do n't get it on our device .
Perhaps the asterisk ought to have a BLINK marquee around it and a giant pulsing arrow .
We 've already seen that Apple wants to keep Flash off the iPhone OS devices ( which covers iPhones , iPod Touches and iPads ) .
Its reasoning : that Flash programs suck up CPU and cause more crashes than it wants ( basically , that they spoil the user experience ) .
The absence of Flash on the iPad is really quite annoying , not just for users but also for news organisations and publishers which want to be able to serve video and ads : Apple 's refusal , tied to the fact that it 's selling a lot of these devices , and that they 're a growing proportion of the mobile access of news websites , means that it would be easier all around if Apple would just let them serve Flash .
OK , so Apple wo n't .
But what 's the reason for this change to the developer agreement ?
After all , what is there to complain about in a process that lets developers produce programs that run in Flash but then cross -compile to run on the iPhone OS devices without Flash ?
Adobe seems discomfited .
In a statement to the New York Times , it said : " We are aware of Apple 's new SDK language and are looking into it .
We continue to develop our Packager for iPhone OS technology , which we plan to debut in Flash CS5 . "
( And : " Apple did not respond to a request for comment . "
Did you guess that would happen ? )
John Gruber , who first pointed out the changed clause , interpreted that statement thusly .
And he 's been analysing why Apple would have made the change :
" what Apple does not want is for some other company to establish a de facto standard software platform on top of Cocoa Touch .
Not Adobe 's Flash .
Not .NET ( through MonoTouch ) .
If that were to happen , there 's no lock - in advantage .
If , say , a mobile Flash software platform — which encompassed multiple lower - level platforms , running on iPhone , Android , Windows Phone 7 , and BlackBerry — were established , that app market would not give people a reason to prefer the iPhone .
" And , obviously , such a meta - platform would be out of Apple 's control . "
Yes , control .
It 's all about control .
Gruber again :
" I 'm not saying you have to like this .
I 'm not arguing that it 's anything other than ruthless competitiveness .
I 'm not arguing ( up to this point ) that it benefits anyone other than Apple itself .
I 'm just arguing that it makes sense from Apple 's perspective — and it was Apple 's decision to make . "
And what do developers think ?
There 's a lot of jaws dropped .
Here 's one from Dominique Jodoin , president and CEO of Bluestreak Technology , which describes itself as " the second largest provider of embedded Flash solutions in the world ( after Adobe ) " :
" with Apple leaving Flash off the iPad and iPhone , [ plus ]
Microsoft 's announcement of no Flash support in the new Windows Phone , and the emergence of HTML5 as a new standard to compete with Flash this situation presents a serious challenge for Adobe going forward . "
He goes on to point out some facts we probably already knew :
" Steve Jobs and some frenzied analysts may enjoy positioning Flash as a dying technology [ actually , nobody says it 's dying ; Jobs and his engineers just dislike the crashes and the CPU use - CA ] but let 's just look at the facts as they stand today :
" 1.2 Billion mobile phones are Flash - capable ; 70 % of online gaming sites run Flash ; 98 % percent of internet - enabled desktops use it ; 85 % of top 100 websites use Flash ; it 's the # 1 platform for video on the Web – 75 % of all videos use Flash ( including Hulu , Disney and YouTube ) ; 2 - 3 million person Flash developers community ; 90 % of creative professionals have Adobe software on their desktops .
" With numbers and penetration rates like that , the better question is why would n't I choose to support this technology ?
None of the facts indicate that Adobe Flash is disappearing anytime soon . "
The trouble with this analysis is that it does n't tell us much about the future .
It may be that 85 % of the top 100 websites use Flash , but is that because they 're using it to run ads or video ( as the Guardian , where you should be right now , does ) ?
And the bit about 1.2bn Flash - capable phones is interesting , but does n't tell you if those phones are actually using it .
I mean , my phone is email - capable - but there 's not a chance in hell of my trying to set it up , because its interface is horrendous .
Certainly , Flash is n't going to vanish .
Well , not overnight .
( It might be superseded by something - also from Adobe . )
The real question is , what sort of meeting did Apple staff have where they determined that it was a good idea - and a necessary idea - to block cross-compilation ?
" Hey , Adobe 's doing a cross- compiler that will generate iPhone OS programs .
Do we like that ? "
In code terms , they should be indistinguishable from a native app ( although they might look a bit horrendous : Gruber points to the Kindle app , cross - compiled using Qt , as an example ) .
It 's just possible that Apple is trying to enforce some sort of user interface guidelines here , having seen the horrors of the Kindle app and yelped ; on the Mac , programs created with RealBasic and Java have a similar ability to look like something lovingly built with a knife and fork .
The timing , though , speaks of a snub - although at least those developers will be happy that Apple did it now rather than after CS5 was released .
Power games ?
You bet .
And Apple is again demonstrating that if you control the hardware and control the gates , you control the whole of the experience .
The odd thing is , people - as in users - seem to like it , judging by Apple 's financial results .
WORLD CUP 2010 : England 's unfinished South Africa HQ will be ready in time , insist FIFA executives after visit
By Sportsmail Reporter
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke is confident the Royal Bafokeng Sports Campus will be ready on time , although it has still not been confirmed England will stay there during the World Cup .
The site at Phokeng , near Rustenburg in the north - west of South Africa , is still under construction and England boss Fabio Capello has previously raised concerns about the condition of the training pitches .
Capello and Valcke both visited the site on their arrival in the country for the coaches summit in Sun City but the final list of training bases for the 32 countries is still to be announced , despite FIFA hoping to publish it today .
Concern : Fabio Capello went on an inspection of the facilities yesterday
' I was invited by the King of Bafokeng to see this centre because they are looking for FIFA support in the future , after the World Cup , about potential use of international teams who want to train out of their continent , ' said Valcke .
' The rooms are there - there is a welcome desk where you can pay , a breakfast area where you can eat .
There was a television and internet in the room .
' Beside it there is the 3,000 square metres for the King 's Suite ; this is under construction but this will not be used during the World Cup .
Building site : Recent pictures show workers preparing a pitch ( above ) at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Campus in South Africa and construction work ( below )
' At the time of the World Cup , the FA ( Football Association ) need the 68 rooms , the medical centre and pitches .
There are two which are being worked on by an Irish company who are experts in grass .
We have been told the medical centre will be built on time . '
It is understood Algeria , one of England 's Group C opponents , have made a late switch in their training camp .
Danny Jordaan , chief executive of the 2010 Organising Committee , insists the feedback from officials during the meetings in Sun City has been positive .
' We 've met with the teams and coaches and overall they are very happy , ' he said .
Jordaan , following his visit to the Royal Bafokeng Sports Campus , added : ' I went with Jerome Valcke and we had dinner and lunch there .
It is fully operational and I have asked to go back there so we can see the reality .
' The hotel is complete .
The development adjacent is intended for a local team called Platinum Stars . '

Scientists stop the ageing process
Scientists have stopped the ageing process in an entire organ for the first time , a study released today says .
Published in today 's online edition of Nature Medicine , researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in New York City also say the older organs function as well as they did when the host animal was younger .
The researchers , led by Associate Professor Ana Maria Cuervo , blocked the ageing process in mice livers by stopping the build - up of harmful proteins inside the organ 's cells .
As people age their cells become less efficient at getting rid of damaged protein resulting in a build - up of toxic material that is especially pronounced in Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and other neurodegenerative disorders .
The researchers say the findings suggest that therapies for boosting protein clearance might help stave off some of the declines in function that accompanies old age .
In experiments , livers in genetically modified mice 22 to 26 months old , the equivalent of octogenarians in human years , cleaned blood as efficiently as those in animals a quarter their age .
By contrast , the livers of normal mice in a control group began to fail .
The benefits of restoring the cleaning mechanisms found inside all cells could extend far beyond a single organ , says Cuervo .
" Our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's , " she says .
' Misbehaving proteins '
" Many of these diseases are due to ' misbehaving ' or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons .
By preventing this decline in protein clearance , we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time . "
If the body 's ability to dispose of cell debris within the cell were enhanced across a wider range of tissues , she says , it could extend life as well .
In healthy organisms , a surveillance system inside cells called chaperone - mediated autophagy ( CMA ) locates , digests and destroys damaged proteins .
Specialised molecules , the " chaperones " , ferry the harmful material to membrane - bound sacs of enzymes within the cells known as lysosomes .
Once the cargo has been " docked " , a receptor molecule transfers the protein into the sac , where it is rapidly digested .
With age , these receptors stop working as well , resulting in a dangerous build - up of faulty proteins that has been linked , in the liver , to insulin resistance as well as the inability to metabolise sugar , fats or alcohol .
The same breakdown of the cell 's cleaning machinery can also impair the liver 's ability to remove the toxic build - up of drugs at a stage in life when medication is often part of daily diet .
In genetically modified mice , Cuervo compensated for the loss of the receptors in the animals by adding extra copies .
" That was enough to maintain a clean liver and to prove that if you keep your cells clean they work better , " she says .
Settles debate
The study goes a long way towards settling a sharp debate in the field of ageing research .
Leading Australian ageing researcher David le Couteur , Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Sydney , says the paper is a major breakthrough .
" She has single - handedly shown that lysosome function is a crucial part of the ageing process , " he says .
Cuervo has also shown , he says , the critical role the lysosomal receptor molecules play in keeping the liver clean of damaged proteins .
While her paper does not show increased survival rates among the mice , le Couteur , who has advised her recently on the research , says Cuervo does have data on improved survival rates which she intends to publish .
He also says she is now working with pharmaceutical companies to identify drugs that will turn the receptors on , or make them more active .
Cuervo believes maintaining efficient protein clearance may improve longevity and function in all the body 's tissues .
It is also possible that the same kind of " cellular clearance " can be achieved through diet , she says .
Research over the past decade has shown that restricted calorie intake in animals , including mammals , significantly enhances longevity .
" My ideal intervention in the future would be a better diet rather than a pill , " she says .
The revised Silverstone Arena Circuit , which will hold the 2010 British Grand Prix , was formally opened today by the Duke of York in a ceremony at the track .
BRDC President Damon
Hill drove the Duke around the circuit .
Current and past F1 drivers were on hand for the unveiling of the track including Mark Webber and David Coulthard .
Webber praised the new circuit and said he expects it to play to the strengths of his Red Bull RB6 :
I think the track will suit our car .
We ’re competitive at all circuits at the moment , and the new section has high - speed and low - speed corners .
It ’s also got some undulation which is hard to see we ’ll definitely notice it in the F1 cars .
Mark Webber
Red Bull estimate F1 cars will hit 185 mph through the two fast corners which direct them off the old track .
The right - hander keeps the name Abbey , and the left - hander it feeds into is called Farm .
They are now followed by a sharp right at Village , then a pair of left - handers called The Loop .
From there the cars re-join the existing track via the Wellington Straight , which could surpass the Hangar Straight as the fastest point on the Silverstone circuit when the F1 cars race there in July .
The revised track is expected to have a similar average speed to the previous track , with a slightly longer lap time .
David Coulthard became the first person to drive an F1 car around the new circuit after its official opening , piloting the Red Bull running showcar .
His first impressions of the new section were positive and he feels the track has retained its high - speed character :
It ’s very fast on the way into Abbey .
But we still have all the hallmarks of the original circuit .
The corners are very high speed and some of the entries are blind because it ’s built on an airfield .
David Coulthard
Damon
Hill praised the construction work done to prepare the new circuit – with one access road only being completed the day before the opening .
A harsh winter with weeks of heavy snow delayed the building work .
Hill said :
The team have done a fantastic job under very difficult circumstances .
Damon Hill
He also declared his relief that after years of dispute Silverstone finally has a long - term contract to hold the British Grand Prix :
We ’re very happy we ’ve beaten down Mr Ecclestone as far as possible to get as good a deal we can on this ten year contract , with a potential extension for 17 years .
We are now the only private enterprise running a Grand Prix .
Now we have a new circuit for a new generation of people to enjoy motor sport the way we think they should .
Damon Hill
The circuit extension was formally opened by the Duke of York who said :
High performance engineering is very important to the UK economy .
Motor sport is at the pinnacle of this industry and it ’s through events like Formula 1 and bikes that we can demonstrate our expertise .
I hope the future will be bright for Formula 1 and high performance engineering in the UK .
He was later taken around the track in a two - seater racing car by Hill .
“ He has n’t been around the circuit yet ” said the Duke .
“ I ’m not sure what I ’m letting myself in for . ”
Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips explained that the need to re-configure the track came from the desire to accommodate Moto GP , which has moved its British round from Donington to Silverstone :
The old bike circuit with the chicane in front of the pits was n’t very well - liked .
This whole section was needed so that we could avoid Bridge .
More work will be done before the Grand Prix .
The grandstand in front of Village will be ten times larger and raised higher to improve the sight lines for the spectators .
It ’s been inspected by FIA and has grade one licence for the next three years .
Bernie Ecclestone has said he likes the track but he has n’t been to see it yet .
It would have been nice to see him here today , but he does n’t like large gatherings .
Richard Phillips
The Silverstone Arena track will hold its first major international race meeting this weekend – the GT1 series – ahead of the British Grand Prix in July .

On April 21 , 2010 , NASA released the first - light images from its newest sun-monitoring mission , the Solar Dynamics Observatory .
The mission ’s high - speed , IMAX - quality photography will improve predictions of solar activity that can disrupt everything from GPS satellites to high - voltage power lines .
This image was captured by the new observatory ’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on March 30 , 2010 .
The sensor views the lower atmosphere of the Sun in ultraviolet wavelengths , and it captured this view as a massive plume of dense , cool ( only compared to the rest of the solar atmosphere ) plasma erupted on the Sun ’s surface .
The plasma flows in a loop along a magnetic field line .
When these ribbons of plasma appear against the black backdrop of space , as in this image , they appear bright , and they are called solar prominences .
Compared to the size and mass of the Sun , the prominence seems insubstantial .
But a small white circle at the lower left corner of the image dispels the misperception : ten Earths could be stacked in a line between the Sun and the top of the loop .
The movie shows the prominence erupting .
The same sequence of images is replayed several times , with a final “ zoom out ” to show the whole disk of the Sun .
At the start of the movie , an arc of plasma arises close to the surface and balloons outward into space .
Near the end of the expansion phase , the ring of plasma breaks open , and some of the plasma appears to escape the pull of the magnetic field loop .
( When significant amounts of plasma escape the Sun , the event is called a coronal mass ejection . )
At the end of the sequence of images , the two halves of the split prominence appear to be sucked back into deeper layers of the Sun like water pulled down a drain .
The new data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory wo n’t just help scientists trying to predict solar “ weather , ” like flares and coronal mass ejections , it should also help them better understand solar “ climate , ” including what causes the solar cycle to vary in length and intensity — and at times , to apparently stop altogether .
Better understanding of what causes the variability in the Sun ’s energy output will help scientists make better predictions about how much of a role the Sun will play in future climate change .

Reported Program Is Illegal And Unconstitutional
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union today sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to reject his administration 's reported authorization of a program under which suspects , including American citizens , can be targeted , hunted and killed far away from any battlefield .
According to the letter , signed by ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero , the use of lethal force outside of armed conflict zones is strictly limited by international law , and at least in some circumstances , the Constitution , which permit lethal force to be used only as a last resort and only to prevent imminent attacks that are likely to cause death or serious physical injury .
The program is reportedly based on " kill lists " to which the names of U.S. citizens and others are added after a secret internal process .
" A program of long - premeditated and bureaucratized killing is plainly not limited to targeting genuinely imminent threats .
Any such program is far more sweeping than the law allows and raises grave constitutional and human rights concerns , " wrote Romero .
In addition to spelling out the reasons the targeted killing program is illegal , the letter points out that such a program risks the death of innocent people : " Over the last eight years , we have seen the government over and over again detain men as ' terrorists , ' only to discover later that the evidence was weak , wrong , or non-existent …
This experience should lead you to reject out of hand a program that would invest the CIA or the U.S. military with the unchecked authority to impose an extrajudicial death sentence on U.S. citizens and others found far from any actual battlefield . "
The full text of the letter is below and online at : www.aclu.org/human-rights-national-security/letter-president-obama-regarding-targeted-killings
President Barack Obama
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. President :
On behalf of the ACLU and its 500,000 members , I am writing to express our profound concern about recent reports indicating that you have authorized a program that contemplates the killing of suspected terrorists – including U.S. citizens – located far away from zones of actual armed conflict .
If accurately described , this program violates international law and , at least insofar as it affects U.S. citizens , it is also unconstitutional .
The U.S. is engaged in non-international armed conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq and the lawfulness of its actions must be judged in that context .
The program that you have reportedly authorized appears to envision the use of lethal force not just on the battlefield in Iraq , Afghanistan , or even the Pakistani border regions , but anywhere in the world , including against individuals who may not constitute lawful targets .
The entire world is not a war zone , and wartime tactics that may be permitted on the battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq cannot be deployed anywhere in the world where a terrorism suspect happens to be located .
Your administration has eschewed the rhetoric of the " Global War on Terror . "
You should now disavow the sweeping legal theory that underlies that slogan .
Even in an armed conflict zone , individuals may be targeted only if they take a direct part in hostilities , for such time as they do so , or if they have taken up a continuous combat function .
Propagandists , financiers , and other non-combat " supporters " of hostile groups cannot lawfully be targeted with lethal force .
Applicable international humanitarian law also prohibits targeted killing except in order to prevent an individual 's future participation in hostilities ; fighters cannot be targeted solely as retribution for past actions .
Furthermore , basic law - of - armed - conflict principles require that in such operations , civilians who are not taking direct part in hostilities must not be targeted , precautions must always be taken to spare the civilian population , anticipated civilian casualties must never be disproportionate to the expected concrete military advantage , and strikes must only occur when required by military necessity .
Outside armed conflict zones , the use of lethal force by the United States is strictly limited by international law and , at least in some circumstances , the Constitution .
These laws permit lethal force to be used only as a last resort , and only to prevent imminent attacks that are likely to cause death or serious physical injury .
According to news reports , the program you have authorized is based on " kill lists " to which names are added , sometimes for months at a time , after a secret internal process .
Such a program of long - premeditated and bureaucratized killing is plainly not limited to targeting genuinely imminent threats .
Any such program is far more sweeping than the law allows and raises grave constitutional and human rights concerns .
In a series of cases involving prisoners currently held by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay , your administration has taken the position that the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force permits the detention of individuals captured anywhere in the world , even individuals who have no connection to the battlefield .
For example , your administration has advanced that argument in the case of one of our clients – Mohammedou Salahi – who was detained in Mauritania .
We do not think the AUMF can be read so broadly .
In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court interpreted the AUMF consistently with international law , permitting the detention of a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan only because the detention of battlefield combatants was " so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the ' necessary and appropriate force ' Congress has authorized the President to use . "
542 U.S. 507 , 518 ( 2004 ) .
But even if the AUMF could be read to authorize the detention of suspected terrorists apprehended far from any zone of actual combat , it is a far more radical thing to propose that the AUMF authorizes the extrajudicial execution of those people .
Outside of armed conflict zones , human rights law and the Constitution prescribe strict limits on the use of lethal force , limits that are narrower than those applicable in armed conflicts , and narrower than the standards governing detention .
Targeted killing of suspects away from the battlefield is not a " fundamental and accepted . . . incident to war . "
Based on the available information , neither does your targeted killing program appear to be an exercise of " necessary and appropriate force " used only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats .
The AUMF may be broad , but the authority it granted was not limitless , and it cannot now be construed to have silently overridden the limits prescribed by international law .
The program you have reportedly endorsed is not simply illegal but also unwise , because how our country responds to the threat of terrorism will in large measure determine the rules that govern every nation 's conduct in similar contexts .
If the United States claims the authority to use lethal force against suspected enemies of the U.S. anywhere in the world – using unmanned drones or other means – then other countries will regard that conduct as justified .
The prospect of foreign governments hunting and killing their enemies within our borders or those of our allies is abhorrent .
The program you have endorsed also risks the deaths of innocent people .
Over the last eight years , we have seen the government over and over again detain men as " terrorists , " only to discover later that the evidence was weak , wrong , or non-existent .
Of the many hundreds of individuals previously detained at Guantánamo , the vast majority have been released or are awaiting release .
Furthermore , the government has failed to prove the lawfulness of imprisoning individual Guantánamo detainees in 34 of the 48 cases that have been reviewed by the federal courts thus far , even though the government had years to gather and analyze evidence for those cases and had itself determined that those prisoners were detainable .
This experience should lead you to reject out of hand a program that would invest the CIA or the U.S. military with the unchecked authority to impose an extrajudicial death sentence on U.S. citizens and others found far from any actual battlefield .
Sincerely ,
Anthony D. Romero
Executive Director

The Revolutions of 1848 are suppressed across Europe and many of the revolutionary leaders and those that took part flee their countries .
Thousands from Germany that took part in the 1848 revolution there are granted refuge in the United States , amongst them one by the name of Theodore Poesche ( 1824-1899 ) , a student revolutionary from the University at Halle .
Poesche , in cooperation with a person of German ancestry in the US by the name of Charles Goepp , would write a book in 1852 and entitle it The New Rome ; or , the United States of the World , which is free and on - line at the linked title , and it would be published in 1853 ( seven years before the election of Abraham Lincoln
) by the major US book publisher G P Putnam with its offices located in New York City and London .
This book in its opening pages claims to be a ‘ a horoscope ’ , ‘ a map of the future of mankind ’ , and ‘ what must be ’ .
The book emphasizes five primary points which are as follows and in this order …
1 ) The separation of the United States and the British Empire is intended to be but ‘ temporary ’ so as to allow the order of things being established in the New World time to experience its ‘ realization ’ ... ie the United States needs time to gain strength .
In the future the United States and the British empire will re-unite .
( bottom of pg.87 and top of page 88 )
2 ) At the time that the US and UK re-unite , thus forming ‘ the Anglo - Saxon Empire ’ , the center of power of the British Empire will move from England to the United States , ‘ its real center ’ , and the US will ‘ take the lead ’ .
( bottom of pg 87 and top of pg 88 )
3 ) The US and UK ( ‘ the Anglo - Saxon empire ’ ) , ‘ having received its legitimate organization ’ , will co-jointly conquer and gain control of Germany , and lay hold an ‘ unyielding grasp upon the countries of the Germanic confederation ’ .
( bottom of pg 95 and bottom of pg105 )
4 ) Immediately following the conquest of Germany by the US and UK , a struggle will ensue centered upon Europe ( in time encompassing the entire globe ) between specifically the United States and Russia .
The United States will prevail in this struggle with Russia .
( pgs 105 , 107 , & 109 )
5 ) The United States will ultimately acquire ‘ the empire of the world ’ economically by way of Capitalism .

One of astronomy 's most heavily used tools for measuring distances may be less reliable than researchers have assumed , according to a pair of astrophysicists .
Their conclusion , which will be published in Thursday ’s issue of the journal Nature , does n't appear to cast doubt on decades of discoveries about the structure and evolution of the universe that relied on the tool – a form of exploding star called a Type 1A supernova .
These events " are the most important explosions in cosmology , " says Marat Gilfanov , one of the two researchers involved in the Nature study .
In principle the new result " muddies the waters " for such stunning discoveries as the existence of dark energy , says astrophysicist Mario Livio , with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore .
At the least , the result – if it holds up – represents " an embarrassment for all astrophysicists , " he says .
" For decades we 've been studying these types of explosions , and we still do n't know " which of two broad mechanisms are involved in triggering them .
That implies that there may be differences in the amount of light they produce , even though they 've been lumped into the same class of supernovae , he said during a press briefing Wednesday .
Supernovae briefly outshine the galaxies that contain them .
Using observations of nearby supernovae and the types of stars that exploded , astronomers concluded that Type 1A supernovae tended to reach the same intrinsic peak brightness .
And they had a telltale signature – their light faded over time in a characteristic pattern different from other types of supernovae .
Because light dims at a predictable rate with distance , researchers use the light from Type 1A supernovae as a kind of standard candle that allows them to calculate the distances to galaxies in which the explosions occur .
But over time , some researchers suggested that the process for generating a Type 1A supernova could vary .
Type 1As are thought to occur in a binary star system in which one member is a white dwarf – an end - of - life phase for a star like the sun – and the other a star still in its prime .
Gravity from the white dwarf , which packs our sun 's mass into an Earth - sized volume , draws matter from its companion .
When the white dwarf 's mass exceeds 1.4 times the sun 's mass , the dwarf explodes as a supernova .
Yet researchers also have suggested that a merger of two white dwarfs could trigger a Type 1A supernova .
One way to tell the difference : Look at their X - ray emissions ; the dwarf - on - dwarf merger should display weaker X - ray emissions than an explosion resulting from accretion , when a white dwarf pirates material from a normal companion .
Dr. Gilfanov and Akos Bogdan , with the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching , Germany , looked at the X-ray , visible , and infrared emissions from six elliptical galaxies relatively close to the Milky Way .
The X - ray data came from NASA 's Chandra X - Ray Observatory .
Based on estimates of the number of stellar explosions one would typically expect to find in a galaxy , the X - ray emissions were 30 to 50 times weaker in the galaxies they studied than one would expect if the Type 1A supernovae were triggered by accretion , rather than by mergers .
In complementing the work , Dr. Livios cautions that " the conclusion is weakened by the fact we 're talking about a nondetection , " likening it to the Sherlock Holmes tale in which the sleuth cracked the case based in large part on a dog that did n't bark .
More work needs to be done , the researchers acknowledge , to see if the same relative dearth of X - rays is present in spiral galaxies , which have far higher rates of star formation – and explosive star deaths – as ellipticals .
However , Livios adds , these results and recent observational evidence that Type 1A supernovae display slightly different light output , depending on the type of galaxy they inhabit , " emphasize the need to really finally try to understand what the progenitor [ star ] systems really are . "
WASHINGTON —
In a move that may derail a comprehensive climate change and energy bill in the Senate , one of the measure ’s central architects , Senator Lindsey Graham , has issued an angry protest over what he says are Democratic plans to give priority to a debate over immigration policy .
Mr. Graham , Republican of South Carolina , said in a sharply worded letter on Saturday that he would no longer participate in negotiations on the energy bill , throwing its already cloudy prospects deeper into doubt .
He had been working for months with Senators John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , on the a legislation , which they were scheduled to announce with considerable fanfare on Monday morning .
That announcement has been indefinitely postponed .
In his letter to his two colleagues , Mr. Graham said that he was troubled by reports that the Senate Democratic leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , and the White House were planning to take up an immigration measure before the energy bill .
Mr. Graham has worked with Democrats in the past on immigration matters and was expected to be an important bridge to Republicans on that issue , as well as on energy .
Mr. Graham said that any Senate debate on the highly charged subject of illegal immigration would make it impossible to deal with the difficult issues involved in national energy and global warming policy .

No one can seriously doubt that the huge amounts of borrowed federal dollars poured into the economy since Barack Obama became president has prevented even more jobs from being lost than might otherwise have been the case in the current devastating recession .
It ’s impossible , however , to come up with a “ real ” number , because no economist has a good enough handle on matters to sort out all the variables at play , including readjustments due to the fall of housing prices , low interest rates , a slightly improved export environment , rebounding of depleted inventories , new highway construction resulting from stimulus spending , etc .
Still , let ’s look at some facts about the current so - called “ recovery ” :
- Un- and under - employment remains high–officially over 17 percent , not including people who have given up looking for work .
- The cost to create ( or save ) jobs has been ludicrously high .
Estimates of what it has cost the federal government –meaning the taxpayer –to create a single job range from $ 70,000 to $ 500,000 , depending on whether bailouts lavished on the failed banking system are included .
- While Wall Street rakes in record profits and the stock market creeps back with the DJIA now approaching 11,000 , the rest of the economy is sputtering .
Public service jobs at the state and local level , including teacher positions , are disappearing like shredded newspaper in a blast furnace .
The best the Obama administration can come up with for the next phase is some extremely convoluted encouragement for more bank lending to small businesses , even though these businesses are operating in an environment of crippled consumer demand that may last for years to come .
- The two economic sectors that are reasonably “ strong ” –the military and health care–are essentially non-productive .
The military uses Keynesian deficit - spending to support its gargantuan job base , while the health care industry feasts at the public trough through the ever - increasing cost of Medicare and other spending programs .
But like the bailouts and stimulus , it ’s being done by both sectors with borrowed or printed money through marketing of Treasury bonds whose value becomes more precarious by the day .
- What stimulus there is has been is coming to an end as the Federal Reserve reduces “ quantitative easing ” and the Obama administration launches its bipartisan deficit reduction commission .
Many commentators have said , as a joke , that it would have been cheaper if the government had just printed the money and given it away .
But such an approach would not be a joke at all .
It would be enlightened public policy .
The real joke is that in a technological age job - creation is a completely wrong approach to distributing consumer purchasing power , because the world does not need everyone to have a job in order to produce what is needed for the population to live a decent , comfortable life .
This is the great fallacy of Keynesian economics , which aims at full employment and endless economic growth .
Not only does the fruitless quest for a full - employment economy put the entire population under the most brutal forms of financial and psychological stress , it also erodes the value of a constantly inflating currency and puts entirely too much money in the hands of the big banking and government institutions which spend it for their own aggrandizement on financial bubbles and wars .
America is the most wasteful , bloated , materialistic , and violent culture on the planet precisely because the economic treadmill we are racing along moves constantly faster all the time .
This treadmill has been created on purpose by the only people who benefit from it –the ones at the very top of the heap .
The solution is simple though paradoxical : sufficient numbers of adult persons should be given enough money to purchase the necessities of life without having to work at all .
This is so because the benefits of technology have brought us to the point where distribution of purchasing power without reference to labor is the most efficient and least wasteful economic model available .
The borrowed or printed federal dollars currently lavished on the banks , the armed forces , and the government bureaucracies that implement stimulus programs would be much more efficiently spent if simply given away .
Call it a basic income guarantee or a national dividend or whatever you like and pay for however much of it you want to through fair taxation of the obscenely wealthy–it really does n’t matter .
You could even establish an optional retirement age of 40 or 45 .
The important thing is that such a program would recognize that with productivity as high as it is today , too many workers get in each other ’s way .
Those who do n’t have to work should n’t be required to do so .
Instead , they can create , do volunteer service , or work at low - paying jobs that are still socially desirable such as teaching or the arts .
An adjunct to such a program would be to provide local producers ’ cooperatives the legal authority to create credit on their own either by utilizing the national currency or by use of trading credits that not only would circulate locally but could also be used to pay taxes .
Such legislation at the national level would free small business from bank usury much more effectively than current government proposals and create more jobs .
Today ’s economic crisis is actually the mismanagement of nature ’s bounty in an age where technology has solved the problem of scarcity if it is properly viewed as the heritage of all mankind , not the cartel of financiers , corporate oligarchs , military strongmen , and politicians who have the world at the throat in order to safeguard their own wealth and power .
Instead they should relax their grip and realize that they too would benefit from a world where all could breathe freely in an economic environment of peace , dignity , and sharing .
Believe me , it could happen and someday probably will .

ECB President tells insiders that secretive group of international bankers – responsible to no nation state – will become primary engine of world government

In a speech before the elitist Council On Foreign Relations organization in New York earlier this week , President of the European Central Bank Jean - Claude Trichet called for the imposition of global governance to be bossed by the G20 and the corrupt Bank of International Settlements in the name of safeguarding the global economy .
In an address entitled “ Global Governance Today , ” Trichet proclaims how the elite need to impose “ A set of rules , institutions , informal groupings and cooperation mechanisms that we call “ global governance ” .
During the course of the speech , Trichet uses the term “ global governance ” well over a dozen times , outlining how “ global governance is of the essence ” to avoid another financial crisis .
Section one of Trichet ’s speech is entitled , “ Why we need global governance , ” and from then on he constantly invokes the economic downturn as a justification for empowering secretive , undemocratic and corrupt global institutions with the power to rule the world .
Highlights of Trichet ’s speech can be viewed below via the official Council on Foreign Relations You Tube channel .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A full transcript of the speech was also carried by the Bank for International Settlements , an international organization of central banks that has constantly lobbied for a centralized global currency to replace that of nation states .
Trichet praises the BIS as being “ ahead of the curve ” in dealing with the financial crisis during the speech .
The primary outfit that will boss the institutions of global governance , according to Trichet , is the Global Economy Meeting ( GEM ) , which regularly meets at the BIS headquarters in Basel .
This group , states Trichet , “ has become the prime group for global governance among central banks ” .
The GEM is basically a policy steering committee under the umbrella of the Bank for International Settlements .
The BIS is a branch of the of the Bretton - Woods International Financial architecture and closely allied with the Bilderberg Group .
It is controlled by an inner elite that represents all the world ’s major central banking institutions .
John Maynard Keynes , perhaps the most influential economist of all time , wanted it closed down as it was used to launder money for the Nazis during World War II .
Financial website Investors Insight describe the BIS as “ the most powerful bank you ’ve never heard of , ” labeling it “ the most powerful financial institution on earth ” .
The bank wields power through its control of vast amounts of global currencies .
The BIS controls no less than 7 % of the world ’s available foreign exchange funds , as well as owning 712 tons of gold bullion .
“ By controlling foreign exchange currency , plus gold , the BIS can go a long way toward determining the economic conditions in any given country , ” writes Doug Casey .
“ Remember that the next time Ben Bernanke or European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet announces an interest rate hike .
You can bet it did n’t happen without the concurrence of the BIS Board . ”
The BIS is basically a huge slush fund for global government through which secret transfers of wealth from citizens are surreptitiously handed to the IMF .
“ For example , U.S. taxpayer monies can be passed through BIS to the IMF and from there anywhere .
In essence , the BIS launders the money , since there is no specific accounting of where particular deposits came from and where they went , ” writes Casey .
“ The bank was a major player promoting the adoption of the euro as Europe ’s common currency .
There are rumors that its next project is persuading the U.S. , Canada and Mexico to switch to a similar regional money , perhaps to be called the “ amero , ” and it ’s logical to assume the bank ’s ultimate goal is a single world currency .
That would simplify transactions and really solidify the bank ’s control of the planetary economy , ” adds Casey .
The Bank of International Settlements is responsible to no national government whatsoever .
Trichet ’s acknowledgment that an offshoot of the corrupt BIS will boss the main engine global government is a startling revelation , and emphasizes once again that world government is inherently undemocratic and dictatorial in nature .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The fact that Trichet unveiled this new approach in the march towards global governance before an audience of CFR insiders is fully appropriate .
The Council On Foreign Relations comprises of influential elitists and powerbrokers from all sectors of government , business , academia and the media .
It is the public face of the more secretive Bilderberg Group .
The CFR only recruits members sympathetic to its agenda for global government and the elimination of U.S. sovereignty .
The scope of the CFR ’s mission was best encapsulated by former Deputy Secretary of State under Clinton and CFR luminary Strobe Talbott , who told Time Magazine in July 1992 , “ In the next century , nations as we know it will be obsolete ; all states will recognize a single , global authority .
National sovereignty was n’t such a great idea after all . ”
As we have emphasized , the global elite have already announced the birth of world government and who will run it .
People expecting the UN to be at the helm have been distracted as the G20 , alongside the BIS , was being empowered with the tools through which global governance is being coordinated .
In his speech , Trichet acknowledges the role of the G20 in using the financial crisis to mandate developing countries ’ “ full integration into the institutions of global governance . ”
“ The G20 has been effective in addressing the global crisis .
We are now at the stage where this forum is making the transition from acting in a crisis resolution mode to contributing to crisis prevention , ” said Trichet .
In other words , the elite exploited the financial crisis in order to allow the G20 to pose as saviors and consequently empower itself to impose global governance regulations on nation states in the name of avoiding another economic crisis .
As EU President Herman Van Rompuy stated during his speech in Brussels , 2009 marked the first official year of world government powers being directly exercised to control the economies of nation states .
“ 2009 is also the first year of global governance , with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis .
The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet , ” said Van Rompuy .

Formula 1's ruling body will re-open the selection process for a potential 13th team to join the sport in 2011 , the FIA said on Thursday .
The governing body has taken the decision after US F1 , which had the 13th slot for the 2010 season , failed to be ready to compete in this year 's championship .
The American team had requested that the FIA delayed its entry for next year .
However , the FIA has decided to re-open the selection process for the final slot , meaning there is likely to be a significant number of candidates hoping to race next season .
Lola , Epsilon Euskadi , Prodrive and N.Technology were among the teams to have applied for an entry for this year .
The governing body also said US F1 could face sanctions for its absence .
" With regard to the USF1 team 's non-participation in the 2010 championship , the world council mandated the FIA president , in full compliance with the new code of practice for disciplinary matters , to take forward the most appropriate action , " it said in a statement .
The FIA also confirmed that rookie Karun Chandhok had been granted his superlicence to competed with the HRT team at this weekend 's Bahrain Grand Prix .
An aide in Prince Charles 's campaign for wider use of complementary medicine in the NHS was arrested at dawn today on suspicion of fraud and money - laundering at the prince 's health charity .
A 49 - year old man , understood to be a former senior official at the Prince 's Foundation for Integrated Health , was taken into custody at a police station in north London .
He was arrested alongside a 54 - year - old woman , who was being held at the same address .
The arrests follow a police investigation into £ 300,000 unaccounted for in the books of the charity , of which the Prince is president .
The foundation promotes homeopathy , herbal remedies and other complementary medicines , in line with the prince 's advocacy of their wholesale application in the public health sector .
" Officers from the Metropolitan police service 's economic and specialist crime command arrested two people this morning on suspicion of fraud and money - laundering at an address in north - west London , " said a spokeswoman for Scotland Yard .
" They were arrested at around 7 am and taken to a north London police station , where they remain in custody .
The arrests are in relation to a complaint alleging fraud by the foundation for integrated health . "
Prince Charles established the charity in 1993 to explore " how safe , proven complementary therapies can work in conjunction with mainstream medicine " .
But since then his ventures in complementary medicine have been attacked in some quarters as unscientific .
Edzard Ernst , professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University , last year described a detox tincture made by the prince 's Duchy Originals company as " outright quackery " .
Profits from Duchy Originals have helped to fund the foundation .
It has also received more than £ 1 m in public funds , mainly from the Department of Health since its launch in 1993 , and almost £ 3 m from the Prince 's Charities Foundation , which handles his personal giving .
Clarence House declined to comment on the arrests , saying : " It is a matter for the police . "
A spokeswoman for the foundation said : " We can't comment on this matter at this time . "
The charity has faced controversy in recent months .
Regulators have been asked to investigate a complaint the prince broke charity rules by using it as a mouthpiece for his opinions on healthcare ; they are also examining whether its staff pursued a public " vendetta " against Ernst .
The prince 's private secretary , Sir Michael Peat , filed an official complaint to Exeter University about the professor after he publicly attacked the foundation 's draft guide to complementary medicines as " outrageous and deeply flawed " .
In February , the Commons science and technology select committee concluded that there is no evidence that homeopathy has anything other than a placebo effect , and said manufacturers should no longer be allowed to make therapeutic claims .
The foundation has attracted donations from the alternative health industry , including Solgar Vitamin and Herb , and A Nelson and Co , a UK manufacturer of complementary medicines .
The foundation 's accounts for 2008 are overdue at Companies House and it risks a £ 1,500 fine .

Since yesterday we are seeing a large number of WordPress blogs ( running the latest version 2.9.2 ) getting infected with malware .
None of them are using the same plugins or the same themes .
Some of them even have wp - admin access blocked to only a few IPs and via htpasswd password .
The only similarity between them is that they are all shared hosts at Network Solutions .
Some of our clients spoke with Network Solutions and they confirmed that all their WordPress sites are having issues , but their servers are clean ( are they ? ) .
What is interesting about this attack is that it does not create or modify any files , so the average security advice does not apply here .
The only thing is does is to modify your “ siteurl ” inside the “ wp- option ” table to point to http://networkads.net/grep/, breaking the site layout completely .
That ’s how it looks like in the database :
( 2 , 0 , ‘ siteurl ’ , ‘ ‘ , ‘ yes ’ ) ,
The only way for the database to be modified like that is via SQL injection or a bigger problem inside Network Solutions databases .
Anyone else having this issue ?
If you are , let us know about it .
* To fix this issue , just revert your siteurl back to the previous value .
Log in to your control panel , go to manage database , and edit the siteurl value on the wp-option table .
** If you need help cleaning this up , send us an email dd@sucuri.net
Update 1 : More Network solution users affected :
Same thing — some HTML inserted into the siteurl field in the wp_options table , and I ca n’t get to my login page .
I had n’t upgraded to 2.9.2 yet , and the site ’s not using Simple Press forum .
So it ’s not just 2.9.2 that is affected , if that helps at all .
And here :
My site njnnetwork.com got hacked yesterday morning .
After a series of non-productive tasks all day , Network Solutions admitted they have been hacked on many WordPress sites .
Here as well :
They changed my wp-options siteurl to be an iframe pointing to networkads .
net / grep
The site was not loading correctly so I was able to find this in phpmyadmin .
I have had a rash of hacks lately and talked to Network Solutions ( my host )
They tell me all of their wordpress sites are getting banged up , but their servers are clean .
And many more at the WordPress forums .

The life of 87 - year - old former secretary of the North Korean Workers ’ Party , who fled 13 years ago , is in constant danger .
His would - be assassins were supposed to cut his throat .
Sources tell AsiaNews that after the sinking of the Cheonan , this incident gives North Korea an excuse to stay away from the six -nation talks .
Seoul ( AsiaNews ) – South Korea announced that it has uncovered a plot to assassinate Hwang Jang - yop , 87 , a former secretary of the North Korean Workers ' Party and the most senior official ever to have defected from Communist North Korea .
After fleeing North Korea 13 years ago , he has been thorn in the side of the Stalinist regime .
According to a spokesperson for the South Korean presidency , two North Koreans were arrested on suspicion of being on a mission to kill Hwang .
The plot to eliminate North Korea ’s highest - ranking defector was discovered during a routine debriefing of the two men , namely simply Kim and Tong .
Although their identity remains secret , they are known to have travelled to South Korea from Thailand earlier this year , posing as defectors .
The agents were supposed to find Hwang , follow him and wait for orders to kill him , which was supposed to occur in late March .
The orders were to “ slit the traitor ’s throat ” .
North Korea ’s Stalinist regime never concealed its hatred for Hwang .
Just two weeks ago , its official website called him “ human scum ” .
Its ire was set off by an interview the defector gave Japan ’s Asahi Shimbun , in which he said that North Korea would never give up its nuclear programme , but that it would also not use the atomic bomb , which was only a tool to blackmail the world .
Mr Hwang lives under heavy police protection .
In his speeches against the North , he does not dare a glass of water for fear of poisoning .
After his escape , due to Kim Jong - Il ’s ill - fated economic policies , which amount to a death sentence for the people of the North , many members of his family were reportedly sent to labour camps .
However , as far as he is concerned , he did not betray his country , Kim did .
Sources in Korea told AsiaNews that , “ the arrest comes a time in which relations between the two states are extremely tense .
On the one hand , there is the sinking of the Cheonan , which left scores of sailors dead last month , possibly by a torpedo launched by a North Korean sub .
On the other , there are the six-nation talks on North Korea ’s nuclear programme , which Kim would like to avoid fearing he might be cornered .
The latest incident will give him a good excuse to stay away from the negotiating table . ”
We noticed a trend going on these days : offices in the backyard !
The convenience of just walking rather than driving to work is too good to pass up .
Check out these backyard offices that allow people to get away from the house without really getting away and save the hassles of dealing with traffic , commuting costs , or space rentals .
WorkPod by Ecospace is a gorgeous , contemporary backyard office would definitely appeal to design addicts .
Other than its great looks , the space is built - in the office technology you need to get your work done .
There ’s something about the round shape of the Archipod ( which we ’ve written about before ) that makes me want to wrap my arms around it when I see it .
It looks small , but it ’s actually bigger inside than you think and it fits in with the backyard landscape very nicely .
dmvA ’s Blob VB3 is an egg - shaped unit that can be used for an office or even a living space .
It definitely reminds me of a giant marshmallow jelly bean .
The OfficePOD creates an environment that supports productivity and provides the user with an efficient use of space .

America plans to withdraw its troops but leave behind a toxic mess
Kabul Press , April 25 , 2010
The American military presence in Afghanistan consists of fleets of aircraft , helicopters , armored vehicles , weapons , equipment , troops and facilities .
Since 2001 , they have generated millions of kilograms of hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes .
The Kabul Press asks the simple question : " What have the Americans done with all that waste ? "
The answer is chilling in that virtually all of it appears to have been buried , burned or secretly disposed of into the air , soil , groundwater and surface waters of Afghanistan .
While the Americans may begin to withdraw next year , the toxic chemicals they leave behind will continue to pollute for centuries .
Any abandoned radioactive waste may stain the Afghan countryside for thousands of years .
Afghanistan has been described in the past as the graveyard of foreign armies .
Today , Afghanistan has a different title : " Afghanistan is the toxic dumping ground for foreign armies . "
The ( U.S. ) Air Force Times ran an editorial on March 1 , 2010 , that read : " Stamp Out Burn Pits "
We reprint here the first half of that editorial : " A growing number of military medical professionals believe burn pits are causing a wave of respiratory and other illnesses among troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Found on almost all U.S. bases in the war zones , these open - air trash sites operate 24 hours a day , incinerating trash of all forms � including plastic bottles , paint , petroleum products , unexploded ordinance , hazardous materials , even amputated limbs and medical waste .
Their smoke plumes belch dioxin , carbon monoxide and other toxins skyward , producing a toxic fog that hangs over living and working areas .
Yet while the Air Force fact sheet flatly states that burn pits " can be harmful to human health and environment and should only be used until more suitable disposal capabilities are established , " the Pentagon line is that burn pits have " no known long - term health effects . "
On April 12 , 2010 , the Richmond Times - Dispatch carried an article by David Zucchino who investigated the American burn pits in Iraq .
He interviewed Army Sgt. 1st Class Francis Jaeger who hauled military waste to the Balad burn pit which was being operated by a civilian contractor for the Pentagon .
Jaeger told Zucchino : " We were told to burn everything - electronics , bloody gauze , the medics � biohazard bags , surgical gloves , cardboard .
It all went up in smoke . "
The Pentagon now admits to operating 84 " official " burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The number of unofficial burn pits is not known .
The Pentagon claims that it is phasing out its burn pits in favor of incinerators and that 27 incinerators are currently operating in Iraq and Afghanistan with 82 more to be added in the near future .
According to a website called the " Burn Pits Action Center , " hundreds of American veterans who came in contact with burn pit smoke have been diagnosed with cancer , neurological diseases , cardiovascular disease , breathing and sleeping problems and various skin rashes .
In 2009 , they filed more than 30 lawsuits in Federal courts across the United States , naming Kellogg Brown and Root ( KBR ) , and its former parent company Halliburton .
These companies were named because of their involvement in the LOGCAP ( Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ) contracts for Iraq and Afghanistan .
Several KBR entities either managed or assisted in the management of the American military�s waste in both countries and allegedly operated some or all of the burn pits .
Additional lawsuits were filed in 2010 , including one in Federal District Court in New Jersey .
The lawsuits reveal that the Pentagon has ignored American and international environmental laws and the results appear to be the widespread release of hazardous pollutants into the air , soil , surface water and groundwater across Afghanistan .
This is a persistent problem that continues today .
Unlike Saudi Arabia which insisted that American forces cleanup their pollution after the war to oust Iraq from Kuwait in 1991 , or the Government of Canada which likewise insisted on a strict cleanup of American bases on its soil , the Government of Afghanistan has been unable to force the Americans and their allies to repair all the environmental damage that they have caused and continue to cause .
Afghanistan does not want to wind up like Vietnam .
While American ground combat units withdrew from South Vietnam in 1972 , neither Vietnam nor its people have recovered from the long term environmental damage and mutagenic effects that American military operations and their exotic chemicals caused .
This article summarizes the problem of America�s military wastes and examines the types of hazardous wastes that are likely to have been released into Afghanistan .
Part 2 of this series will address the contradictory responses by the Pentagon to this problem and it will explore one of the remedies that the Pentagon is currently implementing , which is to phase out the burn pits , replacing them with incinerators .
The article examines the flaws in that strategy and why Afghanistan should carefully consider whether to permit the continued use of military incinerators .
Part 3 of this series will set out the recommendations of the author to the Government of Afghanistan on how to investigate and clean up the pollution of Afghanistan�s countryside caused by the burn pits , landfills and other disposal facilities used by American forces .
THE SOURCES OR MEANS BY WHICH THE VARIOUS WASTES ARE BEING RELEASED
The American military hazardous wastes that are believed to have entered the air , soil , groundwater and surface water of Afghanistan did so through the following methods ( this list is partial only ) : Burn pits
Incinerators
Burying / landfilling of the waste and ash
Intentional dumping
Accidental spills
Surface runoff
Leaking storage tanks , sumps and basins
Latrines CATEGORIES
OF AMERICAN MILITARY WASTE
The American military�s waste , at this time , cannot be completely characterized .
The volume and variety of waste ( i.e. , thousands of different chemicals ) are not known and there are certain to be classified items and materials which have been brought into Afghanistan for which there may be no documentation .
Regardless of that , much is known about the materials and chemicals that the military routinely uses and about the waste that it routinely generates .
Most American military wastes will falls into one of the following twelve ( 12 ) categories : The Dirty Dozen : 1 . Fuel leaks and spills .
These include releases of aviation fuel , gasoline and diesel fuel .
These releases would range from large releases at American airbases of hundreds or even thousands of liters , to minor spills at Forward Operating Bases and combat outposts as soldiers seek to refill diesel generators .
Petroleum residues have the ability to leach rapidly into underground drinking water aquifers and create plumes that will permanently contaminate local wells .
There is no known way to completely remediate a groundwater source after it has been contaminated with hydrocarbons .
2 . Paints , asbestos , solvents , grease , cleaning solutions ( such as perchloethylene ) and building materials that contain formaldehyde , copper , arsenic and hydrogen cyanide .
3 . Hydraulic fluids , aircraft de-icing fluids , antifreeze and used oil .
Used oil is carcinogenic , anti-freeze is poisonous , de-icing fluids can contain hazardous ethylene and propylene glycol , along with toxic additives such as benzotriazoce ( which is a corrosion and flame inhibitor ) .
Hydraulic fluids can contain TPP ( triphenyl phosphate ) .
4 . Pesticide / poison leaks and spills : Afghanistan apparently has no list of the pesticides , fungicides , termiticides and other poisons that the Americans brought into Afghanistan and used , spilled and released into the countryside in order to control flies , mosquitos , ants , fleas and rodents .
The military refers to such practices as " vector control . "
It is expected that the list of such neuro - toxins and the quantity sprayed or spilled throughout Afghanistan is staggering .
5 . Lead , nickel , zinc and cadmium battery waste and acids ( which are toxic and / or corrosive ) .
6 . Electronic waste ( or E - waste ) .
This includes computers , printers , faxes , screens , televisions , radios , refrigerators , communications gear , test equipment .
They contain cancer - causing chemicals such as the flame retardant PBDE ( polybrominated diphenyl ethers ) , PCDD ( polychlorinated dioxins ) , barium , copper , lead , zinc , cadmium oxides and cadmium sulphides and trivalent antimony , which is eco-toxic .
7 . Light bulbs .
This may not seem important but many military light bulbs are fluorescent and therefore contain toxic levels of mercury .
Disposal of these light bulbs in ordinary landfills is prohibited in the United States .
8 . Plastics .
The U.S. military uses thousands of different types and formulations of plastic .
While most are harmless in their present state , such as plastic water bottles and Polyvinyl Chloride ( PVC ) piping , the military has been burning its plastic waste in Afghanistan .
When burned , many plastics release a deadly mix of chemicals including dioxins , furans , benzene , di 2 - ethylhexyl phthalates ( DEHP ) , hydrochloric acid , benzo ( a ) pyrene ( BAP ) and various acids and chlorine gas ( which is a neurotoxin ) .
Breathing a few seconds of this mixture in a concentrated form would likely be fatal .
9 . Medical Waste .
Infectious disease waste and biohazard materials , including used syringes , bloody bandages , sheets , gloves , expired drugs , amputated limbs and animal carcasses .
10 . Ammunition waste .
Lead , brass and other metals from ammunition along with all the constituents of the propellants , including trininitrotoluene , picric acid , diphenylamine , nitrocellulose , nitroglycerin , potassium nitrate , barium nitrate , tetracene , diazodintrophenol , phosphorus , peroxides , thiocarbamate , potassium chlorate , vinyl fluoride , vinyl chloride , sodium fluoride and sodium sulfate .
11 . Radioactive waste .
When one thinks of radioactive waste , usually one thinks only of atomic weapons , but that is not the case .
The American military routinely uses a variety of devices and equipment that contain radioactive elements or radioluminescent elements .
These materials are referred to as " Radioactive Commodities " by the American military .
The primary radioactive materials are : Uranium , Tritium , Radium 226 , Americium 241 , Thorium , Cesium 137 and Plutonium 239 .
Some of the equipment containing radioactive elements : Night Vision Devices
M - 16 Front Sight Post Assemblies
M72 Light Antitank Weapons
T - 55 Aircraft Engine components
M58 and M59 Light Aiming Posts
M4 Front Sight Post Assemblies
RADIAC Calibrator Sets and Check Sources
Radium Compasses
L4A1 Quadrant Fire Control Devices
Fire Control Azimuths
Level Gauges
M - 1 Collimators
M - 1 Muzzle Reference Sensors
Soil Moisture Density Testers
TACOM Vehicle Dials and Gauges
Radios , including VRC - 46/ GRC-106/GRC-19
Chemical Agent Monitors
Testing Instruments
Vehicle Depleted Uranium Plates
Depleted Uranium Ammunition , including 20 millimeter ammunition
Electron Tubes for Communications Equipment
Various types of Laboratory and Hospital Analysis and Testing Machines .
Note :
The American military will likely insist that it strictly controls the disposal of radioactive waste , but such assertions are not credible .
While there are strict regulations , the time and cost of complying with them in a war zone are such that base commanders in Afghanistan most likely ignored them , opting instead for throwing the waste into burn pits .
The evidence for this is contained in Part 3 of this Report , which cites to a Pentagon - funded study of what American field commanders think of the Pentagon�s environmental regulations .
If the American military continues to insist that it did not release radioactive materials in Afghanistan it should document such assertions by releasing its records .
The Pentagon should publicly release all data on every radioactive commodity brought into Afghanistan .
They should all be listed in HMIRS ( the Hazardous Materials Information System ) .
The Pentagon should then detail where each commodity is today .
12 . Grey and Black Water .
The American military and its contractors in Afghanistan operate human waste facilities .
The military refers to these as LSS ( Latrine , Shower and Shave ) facilities .
They generate what is known as grey and black waste - water .
Grey water from sinks and showers has as its primary pollutant soap residue ( i.e. , phosphates and other chemicals that generate what is known as BOD - biological oxygen demand , which means they can absorb all the available oxygen in streams and rivers so fish cannot breathe ) .
Some American soaps contain additives such as MIT ( methylisothiazolinone ) , which is under investigation as a toxin .
Latrines generate black water pollution .
While the American military has to adhere to strict rules regarding the discharge of such waste in the United States , it faces no restrictions in Afghanistan .
Latrines can be dug near ground water and even upgradient from surface water ( so that discharges can flow into them ) .
There are no known maps of all the American latrines .
After a latrine pit is filled , it is apparently covered over with dirt and forgotten .
While environmental releases involving categories 1 and 12 above are a certainty , it is feared that millions of kilograms and millions of liters of wastes set out in categories 2 through 11 were all thrown into the hundreds of American burn pits in Afghanistan or dumped into secret landfills .
If true , the American legacy to Afghanistan is not freedom , but pollution .
In February 2010 , the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs began an 18 - month study of the burn pits in Afghanistan and their effect on human health .
Afghanistan cannot wait eighteen months for the results of this study , it has to act now .
The author is a former U.S. Air Force Captain .
He advised on environmental cleanups at Logistics Command regarding the Air Force�s most contaminated bases and depots .
He then worked for Bechtel Environmental and was involved in Superfund cleanups across the United States and radiological cleanups at U.S. Department of Energy sites .
He later served as a consultant to a group of environmental remediation companies , smelters and waste recyclers .

Tactics in California to shore up its municipal bond rating are quite humorous .
Supposedly , by delaying payments to schools , California can boost confidence in its bonds .
Please consider this sure - fire confidence booster : California Passes Bill to Guard Cash as Bond Delayed .
California ’s Assembly passed a bill allowing it to delay payments to programs including schools to avoid running out of cash , a move aimed at boosting confidence in bonds sold by the most - populous U.S. state .
The passage comes a day after Treasurer Bill Lockyer told lawmakers the bill was needed to send a signal to investors that California is taking steps to adequately manage its cash as it faces budget deficits through June 2011 .
Lockyer postponed a $ 2 billion sale that was initially scheduled for next week .
Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , the Democrat who chairs the budget committee , said the bill was needed so the state can return to the bond market to finance public projects that provide a jolt to the economy .
Controller John Chiang said last month that California may be forced to issue IOUs for the second year in a row because it ’s spending more than it collects in revenue .
The bill is aimed at preventing cash shortages projected as soon as next month by empowering officials to delay certain payments , including those to schools , universities and local governments , to conserve money for debt service and other key expenses .
California Demands Income Tax Payments In Advance
Hi Mish
I just picked up tax documents from my CPA .
California require me to pay 30 % of my estimated tax for the year on 04/15/10 and another 50 % by 06 - 15 - 10 .
The balance of 20 % is due on 01 - 15 - 11 .
They want 80 % of my annual estimate after 6 months , taxing me on money I have yet to earn for the year .

Zoning laws are a violation of property rights .
They destroy the sense of community in neighborhoods , increase crime , increase traffic congestion , contribute to urban and suburban air pollution , contribute to poverty , contribute to reliance in government — and , thus , reduce self - reliance — and contribute to the ruin of our schools .
Most of our urban and suburban problems arose with zoning and other antiproperty laws , to which welfare programs and public housing projects have contributed .
Each of these policies came out of the idea that society could and should be engineered from the top down to give rise to efficiency , community , and prosperity .
What in fact resulted was the opposite outcome .
I. Neighborhoods and Communities
With zoning laws , commercial , industrial , and residential areas are separated from each other .
The result is blocks of houses , industrial parks , and strips of stores and restaurants .
People have to drive miles to go to the store , to work , or even to the park .
It is rare to go to the store and see anyone you know .
But imagine a neighborhood without zoning laws .
It would then be possible to have , say , a small grocery store on the corner where you could buy fresh fruits and vegetables , bread , and meat .
That store would likely be within walking distance , be owned by one of your neighbors , and be designed to serve the neighborhood .
I encountered such a store when I lived in Athens , Greece for a month .
It was less than a minute 's walk away from where I was living .
I could get most of what I needed on any given day , and if I was in the mood for some fresh fruit or vegetables , I could walk right over and buy some .
I have little doubt that I ate more fruits and vegetables there than I do here in Richardson , Texas .
If I 'm in the mood for something — say , some strawberries — then I have to get in my car and drive a mile to the store .
More likely than not , I 'm just going to decide it 's not worth the effort .
Thus , a sale is not made , and I 'm not eating my strawberries , meaning I 'm less happy and less healthy .
The large grocery store a few blocks away from where I lived in Athens provided a wider variety of goods , of course , which is why I would do my weekly shopping there to get paper products , canned good , dry goods , etc .
For major shopping trips , the large stores servicing the larger community are best — but the small family - owned store on the corner contributes to the local community .
If I go to the small store on the corner in my neighborhood to get one or two things every other day or so , and so does everyone else in the community , we are going to be more likely to recognize each other , then to talk to each other , then to befriend each other .
If everyone is going to the large stores , one goes less often , and one only sees one 's neighbors on the rare occasion you are both leaving your houses at the same time to get into your respective cars .
You may wave , but you may also not even know their names .
If you know your neighbors within a block or two , a stronger neighborhood is created because community is created .
Crime will go down because people will be more likely to look out for each other — and one is less likely to commit a crime against someone one knows :
" Your money or your life ! " " Bob ?
Is that you ? "
" Sorry , Charlie .
I did n't recognize you in the dark . "
That 's simply not going to happen .
As people get to know each other , there will be more respect for the neighborhood community .
It is one thing to spray graffiti on the front of a grocery store , but it 's another thing to spray graffiti on Chuck Johnson 's store , where you went growing up and where Johnson used to give you a piece of candy when you were little .
Sure , this sounds like a romantic dream of the 1950s , but that era was more that way precisely because neighborhoods were communities .
Zoning laws and other anticommunity government policies were not yet in place to atomize people , making them less dependent on each other and , thus , more dependent on more distant government bureaucrats .
It 's amazing what you can do by simply preventing someone from opening up a store in a " residential area . "
II .
Zoning Laws Favor Big Business Over Small Businesses
Zoning laws force you to have your business only in certain locations .
This drives up the price of property for businesses , making it harder to start a new business .
If I wanted to sell cookies ( and I do make some good cookies ) , I would have to either buy some expensive commercial property or rent a place in a shopping center , get the proper permits and licenses ( another barrier to entry into the marketplace ) , buy stoves and mixers , etc .
" But imagine a neighborhood without zoning laws .
It would then be possible to have , say , a small grocery store on the corner where you could buy fresh fruits and vegetables , bread , and meat . "
By the time I did all this , I would n't be able to afford the ingredients to make the cookies .
I would either have to save up a small fortune or go in debt .
But if the local government would leave me alone , I could bake cookies in my home , using the mixer and stove I have , and sell the cookies in front of my house to my neighbors .
As I began to make money from selling cookies , I could buy a bigger mixer and a better stove to make more cookies .
I could hire a neighbor kid to sell the cookies for me so I could bake more , and I could maybe start selling my cookies to local stores .
As I started making more money with higher demand , I could put an addition onto my house for the cookie store , or buy or rent another place and make the cookies there .
I could thus start my own business with little initial cost and without going into debt while providing a service to my community and to my neighbors .
And people used to do this .
My wife 's grandfather sold fruit trees from his yard until the city passed an ordinance prohibiting people from selling anything on residential properties .
They made an exception that you could hold two yard sales a year — but only if you got a permit .
The result is that big business is favored over upstarts .
Walmart and Home Depot can afford to buy as much commercial land as they need to build a store .
And they do n't have to worry about a bunch of people selling similar items locally .
Most Americans are like me , and we cannot afford to buy property like large corporations can , so we are prohibited from participating in the marketplace as anything other than employees to others .
With as many barriers to starting a new business as there are , it 's surprising how many do get started .
It 's typically done by going into debt .
This makes it even more difficult for the poor to get out of their poverty .
Barred from starting a business at home by zoning and other prohibitory laws , they also cannot get loans due to their poverty and bad credit .
Those who do manage to figure out how to make money spend the money frivolously for fear that if they save or invest the money , the government will punish them with fines and audits .
Thus , these laws contribute to poor spending habits among the poor .
The government can take away your property , but they can never take away the party you threw and had a good time at .
III .
Zoning Laws , Traffic , and Pollution
When our jobs and stores are several miles away , we have to drive .
Americans like their independence , so public transportation is an option only if one cannot afford a car .
As a result , traffic in most cities and suburbs is a nightmare between 5 and 7 PM .
Not only are people trying to get home from work but once they are home , they need to head right out to go to the store .
A fifteen - minute drive becomes an hour or more .
All that time driving creates large amounts of air pollution , contributing to lung problems and stress .
Thus our physical and mental healths are harmed by heavy traffic , making us less happy and less productive workers .
The way my city is zoned , I can walk to a dentist ( whose office is across the back alley from my house ) , but I have to drive to the grocery store .
Typically , I need to go shopping more often than I need to see the dentist .
I must drive to go to any store , to go to the coffee house , or even to go to the park .
I walk less and drive more , contributing to health problems due to less exercise and to my contribution to air pollution .
With local stores integrated into neighborhoods , there would be less traffic on the roads , meaning less traffic congestion and less pollution .
IV . Neighborhoods and Schools
American schools have gotten worse and neighborhoods have deteriorated and communities have been dissolved .
In places where there is still a strong sense of local community , the schools do a much better job of educating students .
These places are typically rural and have few if any zoning laws artificially separating peoples ' lives into sections unconnected to each other .
People who live in strong communities are aware they have a vested interest in the health of that community .
Schools are one of the main centers of any community , and those concerned with their communities are concerned with their schools .
When parents are involved in the schools , the schools do a better job of educating students .
The schools in turn become more community oriented and work to contribute more to the community .
A good example of this ( and its collapse ) was the elementary school I went to in rural Kentucky .
This school was always holding festivals and events the town could participate in .
Parents would contribute food for the school to sell at the festivals .
Between that and people paying for various games , our school actually ran a profit , meaning it could do more things for the students .
" Zoning laws and other anticommunity government policies were not yet in place to atomize people , making them less dependent on each other and , thus , more dependent on more distant government bureaucrats . "
Over time , laws destroyed what our school was doing .
First , there was a law passed that prohibited the use of anything canned that was not bought at a store .
So people stopped contributing as much , because if you are canning your own green beans , you 're not going to buy beans in a can — and few if any would go to the store just to buy a can of beans for the school event .
Next came prohibitions on home - baked goods , making for even fewer contributions .
This made the events less personal — and less profitable .
But in the end , it did n't matter .
My elementary school no longer exists because the county school board decided to ignore all the evidence that indicates that smaller schools educate students better than larger schools : they consolidated it with three other local schools to make one large school that is now five miles away from the town I grew up in .
White Plains is still a town , but it is no longer a community .
There is also far less local interest in the new school .
V. Zoning Laws Violate Property - Rights Protection
So far I have addressed direct psychological , social , and economic aspects of the harm done by zoning laws .
But such laws also violate our rights regarding property ownership .
Property taxes make local governments see property owners as tenants on property the government is renting to them .
If you do not pay your property taxes , the local government will treat you like a renter and throw you out , so the analogy is more than apt : it 's precise .
A tenant has to abide by the rules of the property owner , which is why local governments have adopted this attitude toward other people 's property .
If local government really owns the property , they can tell you what you can and cannot do with it .
Without ownership rights , we cannot really express ourselves as we wish , organize with whomever we wish , or prosper as we wish .
We always have to get permission first .
Property - rights protection is a necessary element for the creation of prosperity .
People need to feel secure to want to take risks .
This can be seen in small children : a toddler will giggle if her father throws her in the air , but scream if a stranger does .
She has to feel secure to take the risk .
When we live under threat of government taking away our property for failure to pay rent to them , for violating some zoning ordinance , or for not paying off the right government employee , people are less inclined to take the risks necessary to become independent and prosperous .
People need to feel like their property is secure and protected from both criminals and government if they are going to take economic risks with it .
VI . Zoning Laws are Unnatural and Disruptive
A community is a complex system .
In nature , complex systems self - organize from the bottom up , from less complex elements .
Structures develop that affect but do not force the elements that make up the system to do what they are doing naturally .
No system in nature is created from the top down .
Let me put it this way .
A biological cell is a bottom - up structure ; an engine is a top - down structure .
Cells are complex , efficient , and generate order ; engines are simple , inefficient , and generate disorder .
Cells run up ; engines run down .
Communities are like cells .
They are made up of different elements — people and families — that , working together , create a more complex entity known as a community .
Quite large communities can be created by many subcommunities integrating .
I can belong to a school community , a church community , a work community , and to various clubs and organizations .
We know that humans are most comfortable in groups of 150 people .
We can and often do expand the community we live in by being members of many different communities containing 150 members .
But that number — 150 — must be maintained if we are to remain psychologically comfortable .
Where there is overlap — the same people belonging to the same subcommunities — the larger community is strengthened .
Though a Christian , I have become friends with several Muslims because we are all part of the same " Starbucks community . "
Communities are not like engines .
When we try to engineer communities , the results are disastrous .
Forced bussing to integrate schools did nothing to create a community of blacks and whites .
Instead , it destroyed the community schools , breaking down the neighborhoods where the schools existed and creating resentment among those who were bussed .
It did not improve education for anyone , but instead contributed to the worsening of education for everyone .
And the students still self - segregated in the lunchrooms .
The same kind of thing happened when public - housing projects were built .
Artificially throwing people together into ugly apartments of bare concrete was dehumanizing and thus destructive for the community as well .
This is why all urban - renewal plans have been miserable failures , resulting in increased poverty and worse crime .
Community is destroyed by top - down processes precisely because top - down processes are simplifying , unnatural , and create disorder .
Conclusion
Zoning laws and other laws that restrict what people can do with their property do more harm than good .
People argue that " I do n't want someone building a factory in my neighborhood , " but the fact is that nobody wants to build a factory in your neighborhood .
They want to build a factory where it is easy to get supplies in and products out , and where there 's plenty of room for employees to park .
That 's not your neighborhood .
And in an increasingly post - industrial economy , that argument is mostly irrelevant .
I am arguing for allowing natural organization of communities and neighborhoods .
I am arguing for healthier neighborhoods and communities .
The elimination of such anti-property - rights laws will allow this .
It will make people more self - reliant and thus less dependent on government , meaning there will be more people contributing to the economy , to society , and to their neighborhoods and communities .
People will also be healthier , happier , and less stressed .
Social engineering only works to destroy communities and make people more reliant on government programs .
In August 2008 , Mozilla introduced TraceMonkey .
The new engine , which we shipped in Firefox 3.5 , heralded a new era of performance to build the next generation of web browsers and web applications .
Just after the introduction of our new engine Google introduced V8 with Chrome .
Apple also introduced their own engine to use in Safari , and even Opera has a new engine that they ’ve introduced with their latest browser beta .
As a direct result of these new engines we ’ve started to see new types of applications start to emerge .
People experimenting with bringing Processing to the web , people experimenting with real - time audio manipulation , games and many other things .
( For some good examples have a look at our list of Canvas demos . )
We ’ve learned two things at Mozilla about how our JavaScript engine interacts with these new applications :
That the approach that we ’ve taken with tracing tends to interact poorly with certain styles of code .
( That NES game example above , for example , tends to perform very badly in our engine – it ’s essentially a giant switch statement . )
That when we ’re able to “ stay on trace ” ( more on this later ) Trace Monkey wins against every other engine .
Mozilla ’s engine is fundamentally different than every other engine : everyone else uses what ’s called a “ method - based JIT ” .
That is , they take all incoming JS code , compile it to machine code and then execute it .
Firefox uses a “ tracing JIT . ”
We interpret all incoming JS code and record as we ’re interpreting it .
When we detect a hot path , we turn that into machine code and then execute that inner part .
( For more background on tracing , see this post on hacks from last year . )
The downside of the tracing JIT is that we have to switch back and forth between the interpreter and the machine code whenever we reach certain conditions .
When we have to jump back from machine code to the interpreter this is what we call being “ knocked off trace . ”
The interpreter is , of course , much slower than running native machine code .
And it turns out that happens a lot – more than anyone expected .
So what we ’re doing in our 2nd generation engine is to combine the best elements of both approaches :
We ’re using some chunks of the WebKit JS engine and building a full - method JIT to execute JavaScript code .
This should get us fast baseline JS performance like the other engines .
And most important , it will be consistent – no more jumping on and off trace and spending a huge amount of time in interpreted code .
We ’ll be bolting our tracing engine into the back of that machine code to generate super - fast code for inner loops .
This means that we ’ll be able to still have the advantages of a tracing engine with the consistency of the method - based JIT .
This work is still in the super - early stages , to the point where it ’s not even worth demoing , but we thought it would be worth posting about so people understand the basics of what ’s going on .
You can find more information about this on David Mandelin‘s and David Anderson ‘s weblogs as well as the project page for the the new engine .

30 to 50 million Americans fear they are lactose intolerant .
But are they ?
According to a new report , many people who think they 're lactose intolerant may not be
Most people have some degree of difficulty digesting dairy , experts believe .
One recent report suggested that the symptom trigger was not simply consuming dairy , but specifically the amount and the form .
The symptoms of lactose intolerance - diarrhea , abdominal pain , gas and / or bloating - occur after drinking or eating milk products .
While most babies are born with enough of a specific enzyme in the small intestine to digest milk , this decreases and levels off as we mature into adults .
You should n't have more symptoms at 60 than at 15 , assuming your diet stays the same , says Dr. Marshall A. Wolf , a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School .
A 14 - member panel , organized by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program , looked at more than 35 studies .
The experts were surprised to learn that many people avoid drinking milk in fear of getting sick when their stomachs could most likely handle more than they think .
People are self - diagnosing based on previous symptoms or their family and ethnic backgrounds without actually getting a diagnosis from a doctor , the panel concluded .
The bottom line : People who think they are lactose intolerant need to consider whether they are getting enough nutrients before cutting milk from their diet .
The panel also found that limiting consumption of dairy foods containing lactose can leave many people without the necessary amount of calcium and vitamin D important for bone growth , and can lead to osteoporosis and other adverse health outcomes .
" Many people , having observed symptoms of lactose intolerance , assume they are allergic to milk and therefore avoid it completely , ” said Wolf , a member of the panel .
“ But it turns out , it 's not an allergy , it 's a quantitative problem .
Even those without the necessary enzyme can digest small amounts ” of dairy .
However he does say that there is still a lot to learn on this topic .
" Theoretically , if you replace the nutrients you get in milk with other food sources , you probably would end up neutral but we do n't know that . "
The report suggests that lactose intolerant consumers should not be afraid to start incorporating more dairy into their diet .
One tip , the experts say , is to drink milk at different times throughout the day rather than all at once .
Also , eat or drink dairy products with other foods .
The report also recommends yogurt and cheese as a better alternative to milk .

The Middle East is conservative .
But could increased “ polyamory ” open people up to practices that could save the environment ?
At first glance , sex and the environment do n’t make obvious bedfellows .
How can the answer to our environmental problems – global warming , access to fresh water , ecological sustainability , and the use of fossil fuels – possibly be found between the satin sheets of lovers ?
According to a growing number of greenies , free love may just save the world .
In her newest book , Gaia : The New Politics of Love , author Serena Anderlini - D’Onofrio attempts to lay the groundwork for this premise .
And if you can get past any initial squeamishness , there is value in her message : Specifically , some behaviors typical between lovers in open - relationships , also known as polyamory , may indeed be the secret to protecting Mother Earth from her errant , environmentally challenged children .
That would be many of us .
Living where we do , in the rugged climate that is the Middle East , many are personally invested in finding ways to better understand , reach and communicate with our neighbors who worship and celebrate differently .
Some even suggest that the answer to the Middle East peace process wo n’t come from obvious , political efforts , but through grass roots activities and outreach from environmentalists .
Every time environmentalists talk about common concerns – because let ’s face it , nature knows no boundaries – opportunities open up for dialogue on other challenges .
Until we heard about this book , however , it never occurred to us that peace might come from shifting our views on sexuality as well , from lying in green pastures together , if you will .
Do n’t believe that we did n’t protest at the idea , our skeptical brains presuming that some sex conspiracy was at play by those in favor of open - relationships who were on a mission to convert as many ‘ happily married , committed for life , no sex with any others till death do us part ’ to their freer pastures .
It ’s easy to scoff at shocking ideas , and just as important to consider them before passing judgement .
Here ’s what we learned from a brief exploration into the concepts of this book : sharing is caring .
If we approach life with an attitude of fear – for example , there ’s a lack of resources , amorous or otherwise – then we engage in hoarding behaviors .
That ’s my wife !
That ’s my water !
That ’s my land , my pastures and clean air !
In other words , the concept of scarcity takes precedence over negotiation and trust , and power struggles ensue between partners .
Whether those partners are man and woman , husband and wife , Jew vs. non-Jew , Muslim vs non-Muslim , conservative vs. progressive , the end result is the same .
Conflict .
Polyamory , on the other hand , advocates that partners relax their anxieties about not getting the love they deserve ( which in turns causes all sorts of harmful behaviors such as adultery , infidelity , husband stealing , etc ) .
The unexpected result , according to the author of this book , is that lovers are then free to embrace the love they have without feeling compelled to horde it all for themselves .
Are you with us on this ?
Love is not the crime : criminalizing the many manifestations of love is the crime .
As long as we believe the myth of scarcity , we hoard .
As soon as we recognize there is actually abundance , we share .
Apply this paradigm – inherent to open - relationships – to the earth ( which she refers to as Gaia , implying that our planet is actually a living biota , a whole being made up of interconnected ecosystems of which humans play a part ) and you can see the dots the author attempts to connect .
Free love = sharing = less hoarding = more for everyone to go around .
In other words , making love is actually good for Mother Earth .
Our planet , by the way , does n’t really need us to save it , it will continue its orbit , lifeless or not , regardless of how successfully humans steward our resources and relationships , regardless of the outcome of the current attempts to make peace , not war , in the Middle East .
That is why the ultimate beneficiary of all that sex and sharing really is humankind .
And for those of us living on the frontlines in the Middle East , with our various experiences – sexual and otherwise – informing our beliefs about the solutions to the crises we all face – environmental and otherwise – the idea that sex may hold the answer to many questions is both the oldest , and newest , idea of them all .

The Arizona Attorney General has launched a probe of the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office over bank accounts kept separate from normal county accounts and over the money from these accounts getting spent without approval from an outside agency , a television station reports .
The money in question : the Sheriff 's Office 's RICO fund , which includes confiscated drug money and funds taken from other criminal activities , and its Jail Enhancement Fund , which is supposed to be used to keep the jails in good condition so they hold their value .
State law mandates that money in the Jail Enhancement Fund be deposited with the county Treasurer 's Office , but the station says its recent review found that this was n't happening .
CBS 5 says it got a hold of some transaction records from the two accounts , which show that withdrawals ranging from a few dollars to several thousand dollars were made and paid to individuals , companies , a church , and to Joe Arpaio himself .
While in the process of conducting its own investigation , CBS 5 discovered that the AG's Office was probing the same information .
We tried to contact the Sheriff 's Office to find out how this money was spent , but nobody has gotten back to us .
Critics say these types of special bank accounts limit transparency because they are not overseen by anyone outside the MCSO -- which , in the past , has led to some over - the - top spending : a pricey jail bus comes to mind .
The Sheriff 's Office purchased a $ 500,000 bus without following normal procurement procedures or getting permission from the county board of supervisors .
It turns out they used Jail Enhancement Funds to pay the tab .
When the board of supervisors refused to license the unauthorized bus , Arpaio said " I had the authority to use the funds the way I see fit . "
We placed a call to the AG's Office to see what else its investigation has uncovered , but nobody has gotten back to us .
DR Ergun Caner , the President of Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary , has been a rising star on the religious right , entertaining audiences at major fundie gatherings with his hip , irreverent stories about his upbringing as a radical Muslim and his conversion to Christianity .
Just this week , according Right Wing Watch , his story was featured on Focus on the Family ’s broadcast , From Jihad to Jesus .
I never thought I would see the day when alleged â€ ˜Christians ’ join with Muslims to attack converts .
But it turns out , according to a growing chorus of critics – many of them Southern Baptists and other Christians – that Caner has apparently been lying for years about his childhood and his life story .
It ’s hard to even summarise the extent of the deceptions being described by his critics , but they include his claims to have grown up in Turkey and to have personally involved in Islamic Jihad , when court records from his parents ’ divorce place him in Columbus , Ohio when he was just a few years old .
Check some of the critical websites for voluminous debunking of Caner ’s colorful ( and apparently fanciful ) stories about Â learning about America through TV broadcasts in Turkey and more .
Some charges are even more directly related to his ministry , such as his claims to have debated top Muslim scholars around the world .
Â
Caner ’s critics say there ’s no evidence of those debates .
These are no vague or reckless charges , but carefully documented exposes that draw from Caner ’s sermons , speeches , and online videos , and other public records .
Â Liberty does n’t seem to have responded publicly , but recently posted a revised version of Caner ’s bio with disputed claims removed .
Some of Caner ’s critics are willing to forgive him , but only if he owns up to his massive deceptions .
Â Â Meanwhile , Caner and his supporters have been trying to get his critics to shut up .
Â
Caner himself has pulled the religious right ’s favored religious persecution card , reportedly saying in a memo to his Liberty colleagues
Meanwhile , others are starting to raise questions about the extent to which Ergun ’s brother Emir , who heads a Baptist college in Georgia , may have assisted in Ergun ’s deceptions , whether actively or by passively allowing false claims to go unchallenged .
In this 2006 report of the North Alabama Bible Conference , Caner – recruited to the Liberty Seminary by the ghastly homophobe Jerry Falwell ( now dead from over - eating ) – jokingly called himself a one - time “ towel - head ” – and told the crowd at Decatur Baptist Church that he had moved three times and has changed his phone number eight times due to threats from Muslim extremists .
But :
What can they do to me ?
If they destroy my body , I ’ll be in heaven .

Keith Olbermann ’s best segments lately have been only tangentially related to politics : his chat with the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , his new weekly James Thurber readings , and now this : an interview with Kids in the Hall ’s Dave Foley , star of a 1994 sketch that resembles
The Glenn Beck Program so much that , in light of its existence , it ceases to be funny .
The sketch , dated 1994 , of a wild - eyed political commentator warning of the “ cancer ” of communism threatening to overtake the post - Cold War West while Americans were distracted started to make the YouTube rounds last summer , when a real wild - eyed political commentator began warning that the “ cancer ” of communism war threatening to overtake the post - Cold War West .
Olbermann acknowledges he only became aware of it recently through Twitter , and in a segment that could be considered a celebration of Glenn Beck ‘s appearance on this year ’s Time 100 list , Olbermann welcomed Foley to discuss his opinion of Beck .
Needless to say , he had very few nice things to say , and the resulting segment was full of comments that , even for a show that routinely names him the “ worst person in the world , ” were scathingly personal .
The barbs at Beck escalated from the mildly immature ( “ I do n’t want to contribute to his happiness in any way ” ) to the classlessly inappropriate ( “ we have to be very careful who we let into rehab ” ) – it ’s a miracle Foley chose not to gloat about Beck ’s mother ’s suicide .
Through all the nasty personal attacks , however , there is a very interesting observation : as Rush Limbaugh rose to prominence in the mid-1990s , a group of satirists saw the potential for a bolder , more vivid , more charismatic voice to take that message and make it accessible to a much broader audience .
Watch the segment below :

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) issued a warning to Republicans Tuesday : " Stand up and vote . "
In response to the GOP slamming Democrats for " ignoring the wishes of their constituents " by passing health care reform -- as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated both on the floor Tuesday morning and later after policy lunch -- Reid challenged opponents to health care by implying they stop talking and just vote their minds .
He also tried to preemptively go after Republicans who are saying that by moving forward with the health care bill via reconciliation Democrats are effectively ending their chance at passing regulatory , immigration and climate change legislation .
" As I told the Republican leader last week , If you want to vote against health care and health insurance reform , that 's your privilege to do so , but do n't shut down the Senate .
Stand up and vote .
Do n't threaten to stand in the way next time , just because you did n't get your way the last time .
And when you make political calculations , do n't forget the American people , " Reid said .
" You 're for making sure people can afford to live a healthy life — or you 're not .
You 're for reining in Wall Street abuses — or you 're not .
You 're for strengthening our economy and our borders — or you 're not .
There 's no in between . "
Meanwhile , Republicans still were in full - throttle attack mode Tuesday in addressing reconciliation and the ever - increasing likelihood that the House of Representatives will try to approve the Senate health care reform legislation by " deeming " it passed if the reconciliation fix bill carries .
The GOP leadership again emphasized that they believe the health care bill goes against the will of the American people while trying to paint the House 's proposed tactics as unconstitutional .
" I know we 're all struggling with words to describe what seems like breathtaking cynicism and arrogance in trying to move a health care bill without voting on it .
I guess what I would call it is Nancy Pelosi is trying to come up with an ' immaculate conception , ' " Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) said .
" Somehow she 's going to try to claim that they did n't vote on the Senate bill , when in fact , that 's necessary under the Constitution , before it can be signed into law . "

NHL Star Georges Laraque Goes From Vegetarian To Full - Fledged Vegan
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Earlier this year we reported that powerhouse NHL star Georges Laraque had gone vegetarian after watching one of our favorite documentaries , Earthlings .
In May , Georges said :
“ I ’m also proud to announce that I have officially become a vegetarian and will slowly work towards becoming totally vegan . ”
Well the deed is done folks !
Since June 1st of this year , Georges has been sans meat , dairy , eggs , leather and all other animal products .
He claims the decision was made primarily for political rather than nutritional reasons and says that , “ It ’s important to break the stereotype that all vegans are skinny people with long hair . ”
Standing six - foot three and weighing 245 lbs , Georges is definitely redefining the stereotypical vegan .
“ People still think it ’s kind of funny , but I ’m not doing this to be funny , ” he said .
“ There are more puppy mills in Quebec than anywhere else in Canada , and no laws to shut them down .
People get slapped with a fine and six months later they reopen .
Do you think that ’s funny ? ”
We certainly do n’t , Georges .
We certainly do n’t !

OLDER TOURISTS will enjoy free rail travel around the State following the introduction of a new scheme yesterday .
All overseas visitors aged 66 or over , from anywhere in the world , will be able to benefit from unlimited travel on mainline , Dart and commuter trains in the scheme , developed by Fáilte Ireland in conjunction with Iarnród Éireann .
The scheme was announced by the Government as part of the budget in December , in a bid to increase overseas visitor numbers .
It is similar to the free travel scheme for Irish people aged 66 and over , but does not include free bus or Luas travel .
It also differs from the scheme for Irish residents when it comes to cross -Border travel .
Irish senior citizens travelling from Dublin to Belfast are entitled to free rail travel for the entire journey , but overseas visitors will only be entitled to free travel for the portion of their journey in this State .
They will have to purchase a ticket for the remainder of their trip , from Dundalk onwards .
The scheme is initially for a one - year period , but will be subject to review and is expected to continue indefinitely if the demand is there .
Tourists can access the scheme by visiting the Fáilte Ireland website , www.discoverireland.com, to arrange for a “ Golden Trekker ” reservation .
They will be asked for details such as their date of birth and passport or national identity card number .
Their Golden Trekker reservation can then be used to book their free Golden Trekker tickets when they arrive .
Tickets can be purchased in blocks of four days , depending on the length of stay .
A four - day unlimited ticket is normally worth € 100 .
Visitors who do not pre-book the reservation can also avail of the scheme when they arrive by calling to a Fáilte Ireland tourist information office .
Fáilte Ireland ’s Redmond O’Donoghue said the initiative was a very encouraging and constructive development .
“ It will help strengthen the appeal of Ireland among some visitors , and Fáilte Ireland believes it will pay dividends to Irish tourism longer term . ”
Iarnród Éireann chief executive Dick Fearn said the scheme would give Irish tourism a boost in a difficult time .
“ As well as providing tourists with rail travel facilities , they will also benefit from the unique perspective our network gives of the beautiful Irish countryside . ”
The Times of Indiahas already highlighted the scheme , following Taoiseach Brian Cowen ’s remarks on it earlier this month .

The ruling means the register will need amending
Two convicted sex offenders have won the right to challenge their inclusion on the UK 's sex offenders register .
The UK Supreme Court ruling paves the way for other offenders to seek to have their details removed .
The two offenders are a teenager convicted of rape and a 59 - year - old man guilty of indecent assault .
The teenage boy , known only as F , was jailed for 30 months in October 2005 , aged 11 , for raping a six - year - old boy .
The second case involved a man named Angus Aubrey Thompson who was jailed in 1996 for five years .
Offenders are placed on the register for life if they are sentenced to 30 months or more in jail .
There are some 32,000 registered sex offenders in England and Wales and approximately half of them received sentences leading to lifelong monitoring .
' Unjustified '
But both the offenders said permanent inclusion on the sex offenders register with no chance of a review was a disproportionate interference in their family lives .
SEX OFFENDER MONITORING 32,336 registered offenders in England and Wales Monitoring for life if jailed for 30 months or more Exact nature of monitoring depends on risk the individual poses
No single database - but information shared by police forces and probation services Similar systems operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In the case of F , the requirement to be monitored had prevented him from taking a family holiday abroad and also stopped him from playing rugby league .
Five supreme court justices upheld a decision by the Court of Appeal that the lack of a review was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights , the strongest judgement they can give against a piece of legislation .
Lord Phillips , president of the Supreme Court , said : " It is obvious that there must be some circumstances in which an appropriate tribunal could reliably conclude that the risk of an individual carrying out a further sexual offence can be discounted to the extent that continuance of notification requirements is unjustified . "
The court did not say that the register itself was illegal , underlining the judgement of the lower courts that it was entirely lawful to monitor someone for life if they were a danger to society .
' Labelled for life '
The judgement means that an incoming government will need to look again at the law and introduce a review mechanism .
Legislation : Challenged in the Supreme Court Policy officials are looking at the options but will need to wait for the return of ministers after the general election .
Mike Pemberton , solicitor for F , said his client wanted a fair chance to prove he had reformed .
" This case is important because it considers the rights of a child to mature and develop , " said Mr Pemberton .
" At present , any child who commits an offence of this type is labelled for life with no consideration being given to the effect of growing older and learning important lessons from previous mistakes . "
" The case does not argue that offenders should automatically be removed from the register but merely provides an opportunity for the risk they pose to be reviewed . "
The judges said there was no evidence that showed it was impossible to identify which paedophiles had reformed .
Other countries had introduced a method of reviewing sex offenders subject to monitoring , they said .
To keep people needlessly on a register was also a waste of taxpayers ' money .
The sex offenders register also applies in Scotland , but the precise position there may be affected by a related case which is still to be decided .

Over the course of tracking scoring chances for this series , I poked a bit of fun at the Avalanche .
A number of Avs fans responded by emailing me and calling me a variety of names , most of which were fit for only Ben to print .
A couple of the emails asked the same question : " Why do you hate the Avs ? " Hate the Avs ?
I do n't hate the Avs at all .
The jokes I made at the expense of the Avs were mostly born out of exasperation at watching them play .
Yes , I know the Avs were a nice story , surprising the hockey world with their amazing start .
But , when I was forced to watch them night in and night out , I realized that this was really a lottery team disguised by the play of a goalie in the midst of a fantastic year .
How Scott was able to do this for every game is something I 'll never know .
Watching the Avs is like watching the Oilers , only the puck does n't go in the net so much .
If you 've watched the Oilers for any amount of time , you know how excruciating that can be .
If you 're a regular reader , you know how much fun I 've had at the expense of the Oilers , and you know how many jokes I 've made concerning the Oilers play .
To expect anything less when I write about a team that 's just as bad is unreasonable .
And yes , the Avs are a bad hockey team .
I suspect that when Scott is done with the Avs scoring chance project for the full season that we 'll find a team that is not all that far away from the Oilers when it comes to even strength play .
Yes , the Colorado Avalanche are Edmonton Oilers bad .
Colorado goes home to the adoration of their fans .
They were " fast " , " plucky " , " too young to know what they were playing for " , " selfless " , and " motivated " , and it their goaltending just could n't hold them in the series at the end .
San Jose moves on , thanks to " luck " even though Joe Thornton , Patrick Marleau and Dany Heatley " underperformed " , Joe Pavelski " stepped up " and is now " clutch " .
It 's not surprising that the numbers tell a different story than those in the print and broadcast media have been pushing , it is surprising how much different the two stories really are .
For those of you who are new to the concept of tracking scoring chances , a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
Vic Ferrari makes this all possible with his tools to evaluate Corsi , head - to - head ice time and scoring chances .
* For a primer on the other stats mentioned here , please visit the always - lively Behind The Net Hockey .
Scoring Chances

The first table are the totals for the series by period .
For each game state , the first column represents the Avs ' numbers , the second column represents the Sharks ' chances .

The Avalanche were outchanced by 2 - 1 overall and just short of 2 - 1 at even strength .
The Avs best play at even strength came in the first period and they got progressively worse after that .
For the entire series , the Avs were outchanced 36 - 79 at even strength in the second and third periods .

As I noted during each recap , this series was a strict power - versus - power matchup as both coaches chose to match Paul Stastny against Joe Thornton and Matt Duchene against Joe Pavelski .
Neither Duchene nor Stastny could handle this .
Whether this was related to the play of their wingers is another story .
Look at the scoring chance numbers and consider the reverse .
If Stastny was matched against Thornton at even strength , then Thornton outchanced his opponents by something in the range of 2 - 1 , or ten chances per sixty .
Yet , according to the scribes who write and stick to the narrative , Thornton was darned lucky that Pavelski was there to pick up the slack .
Another constant in my game reviews was the brutal play of Brandon Yip .
By the chances numbers Yip was the worst forward on the team and it was n't close .
In the comments of one of Gabe Desjardins ' posts on the subject , an Avs fan mentioned that Yip was pressed into service in the top six because of injuries .
There had to be better options on the team .
The other thing that sticks out is the terrible play of Darcy Tucker .
Tucker spent 71 % of his even strength time playing against San Jose 's third and fourth lines and did not do well , a - 12.55 chance differential per sixty is essentially a - 22 at even strength over the course of a season -- against third and fourth level minutes .
The bright spot for the Avs , if you can call it that , was the play of Scott Hannan and Kyle Quincey .
The pair spent 60 % of their even strength time in this series matched against Joe Thornton and another 25 % matched against Joe Pavelski .
Even though 85 % of their even strength time came against the Sharks ' top two lines , they posted the best chances differential among all Colorado defenders .
This is a real indictment of Colorado 's other defenders , and the other two pairings had the luxury of taking on lesser minutes and were absolutely drilled in doing so , especially Adam Foote and Kyle Cumiskey .
There are some that take issue with the use of Corsi or advanced stats , and for them this series should be instructive .
First the full team even strength stats :
Chances Corsi Fenwick Series - 49 - 133 - 85 Series/60 - 9.52 - 25.84 - 16.52
Compare the chances differential per sixty to the Corsi per sixty or Fenwick per sixty .
When someone says " Corsi is irrelevant " as many of Gabe Desjardins ' commenters have done recently , they really have no idea what they 're talking about .
Corsi is a close estimation of zone time , or as everyone likes to say " puck possession " .
Scoring chances are generated through zone time , and goals come from scoring chances .
In other words , when Corsi is spoken of as a measure of a player or team 's effectiveness , there is math to back it up .
Of course we have to look at those numbers in context , and when we do n't we might say foolish things , but most people that use Corsi as a measuring stick use context .
As we saw in this series , crazy things can happen in the short run -- goalies can get hot , bad teams can shoot 22 % .
But over time , the events that are mostly luck - driven , goals , regress .
The events that are n't luck driven , also known as zone time and shot quantities , are more predictable and predictive .
Even a single playoff series is much too small of a sample size to determine the above relationships , unless of course there is total domination , as we witnessed in this series .
Now look at the individual stats comparisons :
# Player CD /60 Corsi/60 Fenwick /60 29 R. STOA 0.00 - 45.38 - 15.13 32 K. PORTER 0.00 - 17.02 - 3.40 45 C. DURNO 0.00 19.51 39.02 44 R. WILSON - 3.24 - 16.18 - 7.55 15 M.

Ryan Stoa , Kevin Porter , Brett Clark , Marek Svatos , Milan Hejduk and Chris Durno did n't play nearly enough minutes for any of their ratios to be relevant .
Even though the sample size is still small the rest of the team 's numbers begin to converge .
Hannan and Quincey have the best Fenwick and Corsi to match the best chances differential .
Cumiskey and Yip are the worst by all measures .
Editor 's note : Astronomer Jill Tarter is director of the Center for SETI Research at the SETI Institute .
She was awarded the TED Prize in 2009 .
TED , a nonprofit organization devoted to " Ideas Worth Spreading , " hosts talks on many subjects and makes them available through its Web site .
Mountain View , California ( CNN ) --
At this moment we have reached a major turning point for both science and the public at large .
The SETI Institute is now offering the world the first taste of raw SETI ( Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ) data collected by the Allen Telescope Array in California .
With this we move closer to fulfilling the institute 's mission , which is to search for our beginnings and our place among the stars
Throughout the institute 's 25 - year history ( we are a private , nonprofit organization dedicated to scientific research , education and public outreach ) , we have analyzed these raw data with custom algorithms operating on semi-custom hardware .
Now we are transitioning to readily available hardware and servers because technology has caught up to us -- hooray !
In the future , we hope that a global army of open - source code developers , students and other experts in digital signal processing , as well as citizen scientists willing to lend their intelligence to our exploration , will have access to the same technology and join our quest .
As I look at my team at the SETI Institute in Mountain View , and at a handful of other SETI teams around the globe , I see very clever individuals who have been willing to forgo the traditional challenges and rewards of academic research to work on a program of immense potential -- to do work that can literally change the world .
Many see SETI as a fascinating avocation , but few indeed are willing to make it their vocation .
Read more about Jill Tarter at TED.com
In 2009 , when TED awarded me its TED prize and the opportunity to make a wish to change the world - - a wish they would help me fulfil l -- I thought of a mirror .
It is the mirror that we hold up to the planet in our scientific search for the answer to the ancient question , ' Are we alone ? '
It is the mirror in which all humans can see themselves as the same , when compared to the extraterrestrial other .
It 's the mirror that allows us to alter our daily perspectives and see ourselves in a more cosmic setting .
It is the mirror that reminds us of our common origins in stardust .
TED and technology are helping me and my team hold up that mirror to all inhabitants of this planet so that we can see our reflection as Earthlings .
I told TED that " I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company . "
Soon it will be time for you to get involved by participating at setiQuest.org , a website that will make available the results that we get from our telescopes .
Right now the site is geared to those knowledgable about digital signal processing , but in the coming months , anyone -- from a child playing a setiQuest game to an interested adult -- can join the search for intelligent life in the cosmos .
It 's been 50 years since Philip Morrison and Guiseppe Cocconi published their seminal scientific paper on SETI in the journal Nature , and since Frank Drake first used the Tatel telescope in Green Bank , West Virginia , to attempt to detect any radio signals from technologies he thought could be orbiting the nearby stars of Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani .
Since then , only those of us privileged enough to use the marvelous tools of the astronomer have been able to shape this pursuit of cosmic company .
For the past decade , you and any other person around the globe have been able to leave your computer turned on and search through data recorded at large radio telescopes with the SETI@home screen saver .
But you could n't change or improve the search your computer was enabling , you could n't get involved creatively .
You did n't have to see your reflection in the cosmic mirror .
Now that computing has gotten fast enough , now that Amazon Web Services , Dell , Intel , Google and others have donated resources to the SETI Institute , my team and I can benefit from your skills and your energy .
You can help us with our search .
Access the raw data we have published at setiQuest and show us how to process it in new ways , find signals that our current signal detection algorithms are missing .
This summer , when we openly publish our software detection code , you can take what you find useful for your own work , and then help us make it better for our SETI search .
As I wished , I 'd like to get all Earthlings spending a bit of their day looking at data from the Allen Telescope Array to see if they can find patterns that all of the signal detection algorithms may still be missing , and while they are doing that , get them thinking about their place in the cosmos .
That 's the way we can change the world !
We do n't yet know how to get our data out of the observatory and presented to willing citizen scientists in real - time -- but if you are technically savvy , that 's where you come in , that 's where you can help us make the search better .
The SETI Institute can begin to count anyone in the world as a member of our team .
All of the SETI searching over the past 50 years is equivalent to examining one 8 - ounce glass of water from the Earth 's oceans -- a lot of human effort , but not a lot of exploration .
As our technologies improve exponentially , and as the world joins our searches , we may finally have the right tools for exploring the cosmic ocean .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jill Tarter
Noted Evangelical author Rick Warren said , in a recent article in The Christian Post :
Use Easter to Break a Growth Barrier Every church hits a wall in growth , that attendance barrier your church can’t seem to get past .
Maybe it ’s 50 , 100 , 1,000 , or 10,000 .
It does n’t matter .
One of the best chances you ’ll have all year to pass that barrier is at Easter .
. . .
Leverage the day .
Make sure you ’re putting your best foot forward that weekend .
Promote Easter as much as possible and then make sure you ’re ready for the people when they come .
Also , give people something for their heart , for their head , and for their hand .
Give them inspiring music for their heart .
Give them a practical message for their head .
And you put something in their hand they can take home .
Finally , start a series at Easter .
This will encourage your Easter guests to come back the next week because they want to hear what ’s next in the series .
Pick something that connects with your community .
You know what they ’re dealing with .
Tell them what the Bible says about it and provide practical help .
This Easter can be huge for your church .
It can be just what you need to take your church to the next level .
Are you ready ?
If you read the entire article , you will find that the words , “ Christmas , anniversaries , and other celebrations , ” are used .
Here are some words that are never used in the article : Jesus , Resurrection , Father , Holy Spirit , birth , Incarnation , etc .
I could at least understand the recommendation to start a series on Pascha .
After all Pascha–called Easter in the West–begins the 50 days that leads to the Ascension and the coming of the promised Holy Spirit .
Priests have known for centuries that certain days draw large crowds to the church .
They will try to craft special sermons that will reveal the importance of that day and will call the people to be followers of Christ .
One only needs to think of Saint John Chrysostom ’s short and pithy Pascha sermon to see this type of masterful special sermon .
A series that led to Pentecost might be appropriate , although the danger is that you forget to celebrate the day for its own sake .
Nevertheless , what is clearly missing in Rick Warren ’s article is any mention of celebrating the day for the sake of the day .
There is no thought in the article to remembering the great day in which Christ arose and confirmed our salvation .
The day is not for itself , it is only to be “ leveraged ” and forced to fit into a different structure than its natural day of celebration .
It makes me wonder what he would do with Our Lord ’s request about the Lord ’s Supper that we “ do this in memory of me . ”
I suspect that he also leverages the Lord ’s Supper so that rather than pointing to Jesus , it points to another opportunity to become a member of Saddleback Church .
Rick Warren has done many good things .
He has fought abortion .
He has been fully pro-life in that he has also made sure to support programs in Africa that help the needy with social services in the name of Christ .
He has been involved in trying to break cultural and racial barriers so that there can be an united Christian witness in this country and around the world .
His pro-life stance is one of the most balanced and full ones in this country .
It does not simply focus on abortion , but on all the facets of what it means to be pro-life .
But , every so often , he seems to get so focused on church growth that he forgets his Christology altogether .
This appears to be one of those times .
Meanwhile , the Church Fathers clearly celebrated Pascha for the sake of what happened on that day and not as lever to something else .
I hope that Rick Warren can get that distinction straight .
In the meantime , let me quote to you from the Paschal Liturgy .
It is the day of Resurrection , let us be radiant , O ye peoples : Pascha , the Lord ’s Pascha ; for Christ God hath brought us from death to life , and from earth unto Heaven as we sing the triumphal hymn .
. . .
It is the day of Resurrection ; let us be radiant for the festival , and let us embrace one another .
Let us say , O brethren , even to those that hate us :
Let us forgive all things on the Resurrection ; and thus let us cry : Christ is risen from the dead , by death
He has trampled down death , and on those in the tombs
He has bestowed life .
Christ is risen from the dead , by death
He has trampled down death , and on those in the tombs
He has bestowed life .
Christ is risen from the dead , by death
He has trampled down death , and on those in the tombs
He has bestowed life .

The Pentagon 's far - out research agency has unveiled more details of their plan to create a shape - shifting , multipurpose car .
Flying cars have been tried before , dozens of times .
And a few of the efforts have even succeeded .
But the Pentagon concept is several steps ahead of existing vehicles , like the Terrafugia Transition , which is more like a lightweight plane that can , by folding up its wings , operate on land .
The Transition also needs runways for takeoff and landing , and can't fly in harsh weather .
And , in what could either mean revolutionary progress or massive failure , this initiative has out - there military agency Darpa behind it .
In January , the agency , who has been toying with the flying car idea since at least 2008 , hosted a proposer 's day workshop for their new Transformer ( TX ) project .
At the time , details were sketchy : Darpa wanted a " morphing vehicle body " that could operate largely autonomously , reducing the chance of human piloting error in high - risk war zones .
Plus , the agency 's initial documents noted , a hovering car would be able to cruise over obstacles and avoid areas rife with IEDs .
Now , Darpa 's released a solicitation calling for prototypes , which they want to be testing in the air by 2015 .
The vehicles , which will have the all - terrain abilities of SUVs , should also boast a 1,000 - pound capacity , and carry four fully suited troops or a stretcher and a medic – suggesting the agency hopes for a fleet of flying ambulances , too .
Darpa also wants a vehicle that can perform vertical takeoffs and landings ( no runway required ) , and attain an altitude of 10,000 feet – and do it all while traveling 250 miles on a single tank of gas .
That means less Humvee , more Prius :
The agency suggests that proposals would be wise to include ideas like " hybrid electric drive , advanced batteries , adaptive wing structures , ducted - fan propulsion systems [ and ] advanced lightweight heavy fuel engines . "
All that , and no pilot :
Any troop able to drive a military road vehicle could operate a Transformer , because the vehicles will include " automated takeoff and landing , " and be " fully autonomous " in the air and on the ground .
It 's a lofty plan , albeit one with a relatively small budget : Darpa 's allotting around $ 55 million to the development and testing of prototypes .

A solidarity caravan travelling to the autonomous municipality of San Juan Copala in the Triqui Region of Oaxaca has been attacked by UBISORT paramilitaries .

Oaxaca : Paramilitary attack leaves two dead and three disappeared
Oaxaca de Juárez , Oaxaca
April 27 , 2010
To the media
To the people of Mexico
To the people of the world
To the people of Oaxaca
Armed attack against the Caravan of Support and Solidarity with the Autonomous Municipality of San Juan Copala , Oaxaca
CONTEXT :
Yesterday the realization of this caravan to the Triqui region , inside of our state of Oaxaca , was announced to the media .
In this caravan there are comrades from the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca ( APPO ) , Section 22 of the teachers ' union , Oaxacan Voices Constructing Autonomy and Freedom ( VOCAL ) , CACTUS , members of MULTI ( Independent Triqui Movement of Unification and Struggle ) , as well as international observer comrades .
As was already announced , the caravan left today , April 27 , 2010 , at approximately 11 AM from the city of Huajuapan de Leon , Oaxaca , with the goal of breaking the siege that the Autonomous Triqui Community finds itself in as a result of state and paramilitary repression against the process of autonomy which it is building inside this community .
Violent paramilitary attacks have occurred at different moments during the autonomous process of San Juan Copala and have been directed by the paramilitary organization called UBISORT ( Union for Social Well - Being in the Triqui Region ) which in reality is presided over by Rufino Juárez Hernández and the MULT ( Triqui Movement of Unification and Struggle Movement . )
Before the departure of the caravan , the autonomous president of San Juan Copala , Jesús Martínez Flores , placed responsibility for any attack on Evencio Nicolás Martínez , Oaxaca State Attorney General , Jorge Franco Vargas " El Chucky " , State Interior Minister , and Carlos Martínez , local PRI candidate for the state congress .
Also , he urged UBISORT and MULT to behave responsibly and with earnestness towards the peace negotiations for the Triqui people .
EVENTS :
Approximately 100 kilometers before reaching La Sabana , the road was blocked with rocks , and that is where the cowardly armed attack began , by about 15 paramilitaries in the service of the murderer Ulises Ruiz Ortiz 's government ( the type of weapon is unknown ) , leaving vehicles destroyed , wounding a comrade , and leaving two people dead .
During the attack , some comrades escaped , hiding in the hill , and of those who do n't know their way we are worried that they have been captured by the paramilitaries .
Those comrades who as of now are disappeared are NOE BAUTISTA JIMENEZ , DAVID VENEGAS REYES , and DANIEL ARELLANO CHAVEZ , all of them members of VOCAL .
Regrettably , as information is coming in we know that two comrades lost their lives in this paramilitary attack ; they are BEATRÍZ ALBERTA CARIÑO TRUJILLO , a member of CACTUS , and TYRI ANTERO JAAKKOLA , an international observer comrade from Finland .
Both died as a result of gunshots .
During the events , comrade MONICA CITLALI SANTIAGO ORTIZ was wounded in the back by a gunshot and was attended to by medics in Juxtlahuaca .
Those who stayed in the area of the shooting were taken from the vehicles and brought to the hill to be interrogated ; some were threatened with death and later were released on the highway .
Comrade RUBÉN VALENCIA NUÑEZ , a member of VOCAL , was detained by paramilitaries who took his I.D. , his cell phone , and threatened him with death , then let him go .
An ambulance came to the site of the events to attend to the wounded , but was also cowardly shot at by the paramilitaries , which forced it to leave .
While they were leaving , they found a wounded comrade who they attended to , and to whom they confirmed the death of the comrades previously mentioned .
As a result of the confusion and uncertainty of the events , the location of the previously mentioned comrades is unknown , as is their physical and psychological condition .
WE ENERGETICALLY DENOUNCE :
That this armed attack is a product of the conditions of institutional violence and impunity that paramilitary groups enjoy in this region of our state .
Institutional violence directed at the different manifestations of social struggle in Oaxaca , and specifically against the construction of autonomous processes .
This attack occurred in the context of the isolation and state of siege that the municipality of San Juan Copala lives under , where since January the children have not had classes , where the community does not have electricity , potable water , doctors , and lives under permanent paramilitary harassment as a result of the blockade they have established there .
WE DEMAND :
That the murderer Ulises Ruiz 's government end the paramilitary attacks in the Triqui region .
As well , that he end the financing , arming and impunity that these paramilitary groups enjoy in our state .
The immediate return of our disappeared comrades .
WE CALL :
To the people of Oaxaca , of Mexico , to the international community and the different social organizations , collectives , and groups , to visibly show your solidarity and support with the demand for the return , alive , of our disappeared brothers and for the punishing of those responsible .
Also , we fraternally call on you to demand an end to the violent conditions facing the Autonomous Municipality of San Juan Copala .
The live return of the disappeared comrades !
Punishment for the murderers of our comrades !
End the attacks on the autonomous municipality of San Juan Copala !
End the paramilitary blockade that encircles this autonomous Triqui community !

( Continued from Part 1 )
Everytime I watch a Christian channel in Uganda I regularly see programmes where people are getting thrown off their feet while all manner of ‘ evil spirits ’ are supposedly cast out of them .
All of these people then claim they have been ‘ healed ’ miraculously .
They give testimonies as to how they were sick before attending that miracle crusade ( or prayer service ) , but that now they are miraculously healed .
The crowd predictably gives glory to ‘ God ’ , as the pastor triumphantly parades the ‘ healed ’ individuals around the stage .
On the face of it , it all does seem very convincing – and everytime a crusade is announced , tens of thousands of believers flock to attend them , and stories will always be told afterwards of how many were healed .
I just do n’t buy it .
My skepticism towards miracle healing is informed by my understanding of modern medical science , and my knowledge about the psychology of human beings .
All of the purported claims of miracle healing , when looked into , invariably have natural explanations that can adequately account for their occurrence , without the need to invoke the ‘ supernatural ’ .
Specifically , diseases that people often claim to have been miraculously healed from tend to be either self - limiting or psychosomatic , both varieties of which have sound medical reasons that can explain their sudden disappearance from a patient .
Self Limiting Diseases
A self - limiting disease is a disease that runs a definite limited course and resolves itself without medical intervention .
What is not often appreciated is that by the time symptoms of an illness become noticeable to a person , the disease is at already at an advanced stage .
For most people it is at this point that they seek treatment .
Many believers , upon the onset of noticeable symptoms , might try and pray to receive a divine healing .
By then , however , the disease has already run its natural course and is on its way out .
When the symptoms predictably disappear , suddenly or after a short while ( depending on the stage the disease had reached in its cycle ) , a believer who prayed might feel compelled to claim that a divine miracle has taken place – when in fact no such thing has happened .
Psychosomatic Diseases
Then there are Psychosomatic Diseases , which are diseases whose symptoms are often caused by mental processes of the sufferer rather than immediate physiological causes .
In other words , the mind influences the body to create or exacerbate illness .
Examples of recognized stress - related psychosomatic illnesses include : Hypertension , Stroke , Coronary Heart Disease , Ulcers , Migraine , Headaches , Cancer , Allergies , Asthma , Hay Fever , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Backache , Sinusitis , Arthritis , Constipation , Impotence , Infertility , Eczema , Psoriasis , High blood pressure , Muscle Pain , and Multiple Sclerosis .
Research has demonstrated that the mind can increase the body ’s susceptibility to disease by reducing the effectiveness of the immune system , and also increase the healing of the body by increasing the effectiveness of the immune system .
In cases where symptoms of the above listed illnesses have seemed chronic , usually certain changes in lifestyle , changing diet , exercise and stress management have been effective in causing the symptoms to diminish , or dissipate completely .
It might be useful to point out that a lot of people that claim faith healing are people who are usually already undergoing some form of medical treatment for that disease or illness .
Response to treatment varies from person to person , and research shows that stress can impede the body ’s response to medication .
Sick people undergoing deep religious experiences are unknowingly reducing their stress levels , thereby allowing the body to better respond to the treatment they have been receiving .
The believer of course will attribute this sudden response to medication to a miracle , yet what is most likely is that it was stress alleviation that triggered it .
The Placebo Effect
A placebo is a substance with no medicinal properties which causes a patient to improve because of his belief in its efficacy .
In medical circles , in cases where the disease is psychosomatic in nature , administering a placebo has been known to sometimes yield a complete recovery for a patient .
Miraculous faith - healing episodes can thus also be the result of the PLACEBO EFFECT – where in this case the placebo is the belief that ‘ God ’ can cure you .
Pain Perception
One might ask at this stage , “ but how about all those people we ’ve seen throwing away their crutches , and begin running around on stage totally impervious to the pain they say they were feeling before ?
Certainly , you ca n’t say they have not been healed ! ”
This brings us to the subject of pain .
According to the Stanford School of Medicine ’s Pain Management Center , pain is : “ the way your brain interprets information about a particular sensation that your body is experiencing .
Information ( or signals ) about this painful sensation are sent via nerve pathways to your brain .
The way in which your brain interprets these signals as ‘ pain ’ can be affected by many outside factors , some of which can be controlled by special techniques . ” ( from What is Pain ? – Stanford School of Medicine )
Our state of mind at a given moment heavily influences the degree to which we perceive pain .
When a person is an excited state , for example , endorphins are released :
Endorphins are endogenous opioid polypeptide compounds .
They are produced by the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus in vertebrates during exercise , excitement , pain , consumption of spicy food and orgasm , and they resemble the opiates in their abilities to produce analgesia and a feeling of well - being .
Endorphins work as " natural pain relievers . " ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin
In addition to decreased feelings of pain , secretion of endorphins leads to feelings of euphoria , modulation of appetite , release of sex hormones , and enhancement of the immune response .
With high endorphin levels , we feel less pain and fewer negative effects of stress .
from ( from Endorphins : Natural Pain and Stress Fighters – MedicineNet.com )
Endorphins act to alter pain appreciation at many levels within the central nervous system including spinal cord , midbrain , thalamus , and cortex .
The activity of this pain - suppressing system may play a role in individual differences in the experience of pain .
( from Endorphins and Pain – Davis GC , Pub Med )
Believers at crusades who are typically seen throwing away their crutches and running around the stage are already in a euphoric state from the intense praying and singing they have been engaged in , and as a result their perception of pain has been significantly diminished .
There are several documented cases of patients afterwards experiencing excruciating pain as a consequence of the physical exertion they subjected themselves to while on the stage with the pastor , believing themselves to have been healed at the time , yet in reality – they were not .
Such believers seldom admit the recurrence of the pain after the euphoria wears off .
This is because they fear that doing so would demonstrate a lack of faith on their part and thus compromise their ‘ healing ’ which they still believe is ‘ on the way ’ .
Some of them , out of solidarity are reluctant to embarrass their church or pastor with a failed faith healing .
For this reason , many will shun medical treatment when the pain , predictably , returns .
Such patients end up going back to hospital for treatment and therapy , with great reluctance , and often at the insistence of concerned family members .
Other reasons for being doubtful of miracle healing claims include :
Lack of good evidence .
Most claims of miraculous healing come from believers themselves .
It is essentially hearsay , and therefore not very reliable evidence .
This anecdotal evidence is further compromised by the fact that these claimants have a vested interest in promoting this claim , and presenting it as a fact .
They therefore cannot be relied upon to give an objective account of events pertaining to the healing .
There is usually never an unbiased , independent observer to corroborate these healing claims .
Who is to say the claimants are not mistaken ?
Or exaggerating ?
Or worse still , making it up ?
There are many reasons to think that any one of these three is highly possible , given what is at stake for those that claim it .
Finally , given the extraordinary nature of what is being claimed , word of mouth even from a professed skeptic cannot be sufficient to establish that a faith healing took place .
The evidence would have to be empirically verifiable , to be worthy of consideration .
Matters are not helped by recurring stories of fraud ( quack pastors , of which Uganda has no shortage ) , which further adds to the skepticism towards faith - healing many of us have .
It is no secret that in many churches , these healings are stage - managed in order to impress existing members of the congregation , and also to serve as a marketing gimmick to lure more people to join their church .
Different people seem to set different standards for what they will consider normal , and what they will consider unusual or miraculous .
In the context of this article , the basis for determining these distinctions seems to depend on one ’s familiarity , or lack thereof , with what has been discovered and established by modern medical science .
Skeptics of faith healing have put these factors into consideration , and have determined that claims of miracles are unwarranted , given the variety of plausible naturalistic explanations that can account for seemingly sudden disappearance of symptoms of illness , or the illness itself .
WHAT WOULD BE CONVINCING EVIDENCE ?
So , are skeptics of miracle - healing just a bunch of cynical people who wo n’t believe anything no matter what ?
Actually , no .
James Randi ( world renowned debunker of paranormal claims ) outlines certain criteria that must be met for any claim of faith healing to be taken seriously , and in order for it to warrant further inquiry :
The disease must not be a self - limiting disease
The recovery must be complete
The recovery must take place in the absence of any medical treatment that might normally be expected to affect the disease
There must be adequate medical opinion that the disease was present before the application of whatever means were used to bring about the miracle .
There must be adequate medical opinion that the disease was present after the application of whatever means were used to bring about the miracle .
The above criteria set forth by Randi is a very basic control that seeks to eliminate natural or medical explanations that could account for the ‘ miracle ’ in question .
There is no claim of miracle / faith - healing on record that has ever successfully met these criteria , which is why Randi and most in the scientific community doubt the validity and efficacy of miracle / faith - healing .
An example of a miracle , if one were to ever take place , that would be convincing to a critical mind would be IF AN AMPUTEE GOT HEALED .
This is because there is no known natural mechanism that can plausibly explain the sudden restoration of a missing human limb .
If such a miracle was to take place at the moment of the invocation of a specific prayer intended to bring about that effect , it would be compelling evidence that supernatural miracle healing has taken place .
( Actually , it could also be evidence for a myriad of other logical possibilities such as space aliens with advanced technology , but anyway .. )
The oft - touted miracle faith - healing claims suffer the problem of being too ambiguous in nature , because there are numerous natural explanations ( such as those discussed above ) that can adequately account for them .
The healing of an amputee , however , leaves little room for doubt .
Only a ‘ miracle ’ could make a missing limb grow back into its original form .
To date , there has been no medically verified case of a person having a missing limb restored .
So why do n’t amputees get healed ?
The same question would apply also for restoring the skin of 3rd degree burn victims and acid attack victims .
Why do n’t these types of patients ever get healed at miracle crusades , or even at private prayer sessions ?
Why do n’t acid attack victims , whose faces have been disfigured beyond recognition , ever get their old faces back – through prayer ?
The answer to this question seems pretty obvious .
In response to this question , some believers say such people do n’t get healed because they simply do n’t have enough faith .
BULLSHIT .
Others have responded that such a ‘ miracle ’ would be too obvious and would compromise our free will ( or something along those lines ) .
Ken Miller – Brown University biology professor renowned for his efforts to keep Creationism out of science classrooms in the US , and his public , nation - wide efforts in defending the theory of evolution by natural selection ( he is a Roman Catholic ) – in a recent interview with the The Boston Phoenix said , in response to the same question :
“ Suppose that it was common knowledge that if you were a righteous person and of great faith and prayed deeply , all of a sudden , your limb would grow back , ” he says .
“ That would reduce God to a kind of supernatural force . . . and by pushing the button labelled ‘ prayer , ’ you could accomplish anything you wanted .
What would that do to moral independence ? ”
But this is a bizarre response .
There are Christians today going around claiming they are resurrecting dead people in mortuaries .
There are others who testify that ‘ God ’ brought them back to life through intercessory prayer .
There are many more claims of recovery from blindness and deafness .
Every Sunday believers share testimonies about how they prayed for a house and got it , how they prayed to pass exams and passed them , how they prayed to find missing keys and found them , etc .
To believers all these claims are considered to be irrefutable evidence of ‘ God ’ .
( Of course , those who think critically would disagree ) .
Ken Miller has also probably never heard of Prosperity Theology which holds that when you pray for things ‘ God ’ gives it to you .
Indeed , his response is bizarre given what Christians are claiming ‘ God ’ is doing for them everyday .
If what Miller is saying is true , then ‘ moral independence ’ is being thwarted by ‘ God ’ everytime ‘ He ’ answers a prayer – which believers are certain ‘ He ’ does ( answer prayer ) .
It is unlikely any believers would agree with Miller on this .
Jerry Coyne , in his wonderful blog Why Evolution Is True , does n’t mince words in his assessment of Miller ’s response :
So let me get this straight .
Some miracles are ok ( Miller apparently believes in the Resurrection and the divinity of Jesus ) , but they ca n’t be too numerous ?
Or too obvious ?
It ’s ok for Jesus to heal the lame , or get rid of Parkinson ’s disease ( see here ) , but growing back a limb ?
No , no , that ’s WAY too obvious .
Unlike healing the lame , regrowing a limb would completely ruin moral independence ?
How , exactly , is that supposed to happen ?
And what about the alternative explanation for why prayer can apparently cure paralysis , deafness and cancer but not excised limbs ( no , it ’s not that God hates amputees ) ?
Could Miller ’s ideas about amputation be making a virtue out of necessity ?
Only a theologian could buy Miller ’s argument .
Any smart twelve - year old could see right through it .
Indeed , many of us have ‘ seen right through ’ such excuses for why ‘ God ’ cannot heal amputees or perform empirically verifiable miracle healings .
‘ God ’ simply does not exist .
After a decade of declining drug use among US teens , dependence on alcohol , marijuana , and Ecstasy is reported to be on the rise .
The reversal in the trend line is startling to drug- prevention advocates , who say high - profile media campaigns and parental involvement helped to curb all categories of teen drug use between 1998 and 2008 .
In 2008 , for example , use of alcohol and marijuana decreased 30 percent among ninth and 12th graders from the year before ; methamphetamine abuse was down 60 percent .
These findings , published last week by the Partnership for a Drug Free America and the MetLife Foundation , show that teen usage swung back up last year for the first time since 1998 .
Another study released late last year , by the federal government , also showed rising use of marijuana among certain teen subsets .
Among the findings released this week regarding teens between the ninth and 12th grades :
• Yearly and monthly marijuana use increased to 38 and 25 percent , respectively .
• Teen alcohol use grew to 39 percent from the previous year , an 11 percent rise .
• Thirteen percent of teens say they tried Ecstasy last year , a 30 percent increase from 2008 .
• Seventy - five percent of teenagers say they have friends who get high at parties , a 9 percent increase from 2008 .
Partnership Strategy director Sean Clarkin cites several reasons for the dramatic reversal : a continuing decrease in federal funding for drug- prevention programs in schools and the media , the public conversation about the legalization of marijuana , and “ the growing proliferation of pro-drug cues in popular culture , ” particularly online .
“ You can go on YouTube and there are a zillion videos of kids getting high , ” says Mr. Clarkin .
“ We see that borne out in some of the data around kids ’ attitudes about drugs .
They find it more normal to use because they say their friends use more frequently , so they expect to use in more social situations . ”
Inhalants , such as glues , nail polish remover , spray paints , and cleaning fluids , pose a growing risk among teens , the use of which peaks in eighth grade , Clarkin says .
A report this week by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported that from 2006 to 2008 , 7 percent of 12 - year - olds sniffed inhalants – usage that is particularly steep compared with the 1.4 percent who say they used marijuana or the 0.1 percent who used cocaine .
Inhalants are considered particularly dangerous because they are cheap , readily available , and public awareness among parents is relatively muted .
Unlike some other drugs , inhalants can cause death even among first - time users .
In recent years , reports have shown that teen access to drugs , especially prescription medicines , is easier than ever .
More permissive attitudes among teens toward drug use can be combated through education campaigns in schools and through the media , both of which have atrophied , Clarkin says .
School and the home “ are the two areas kids are going to spend a bulk of their time , ” he says .
“ So to basically have pro-drug cues picked up from their peers and the media , uncontested by any kind of antidrug messaging , is problematic . ”
Getting out of a plunging Navy jet is simple :
Pull the eject lever .
Escaping from a disabled nuclear sub ?
A bit trickier .
You first have to climb into a full - body buoyancy suit ( which later transforms into a one - man life raft ) , then scramble into an escape chamber , seal the door , inflate the suit , and hold on tight as the lock is flooded with icy water .
Then open the hatch and try not to panic during that long float to the surface .
Luckily , the US Naval School in New London , Connecticut , now has a facility that lets sailors perform not - so - dry runs .
The 37 - foot - deep , 84,000 - gallon tank — the first of its kind in the US — offers exact replicas of the escape chambers in Virginia — and Los Angeles - class submarines .
Perfect for teaching sailors how to rise to the top .
Four Steps to Avoiding a Watery Grave
1 . Below the tank , a trainee zips into a buoyancy suit , then clambers up into the escape chamber .
2.Inside , the sailor plugs into an air valve to start inflating the suit while an instructor attaches a safety tether .
The trainee then grabs onto handles as the water pours in .
3 . Once the compartment is flooded , a hatch is opened overhead .
The tether is released , and the buoyancy of the suit carries the sailor to the surface , where additional instructors wait .
4 . Upon surfacing , which in a real emergency would be in the middle of the ocean , a raft deploys from a hip pouch on the suit , puffing out like a blowfish .
It may be a little undignified , but it beats sitting in a steel casket on the seafloor .
Two dumb teenagers take too many drugs and drink too much alcohol and die .
The deaths of Louis Wainwright , 18 , and Nicholas Smith , 19 , both from Scunthorpe are very sad .
I ’m very sorry for the parents but they gave birth to a pair who should win the Darwin awards .
You do not combine a drug you do not know with alcohol .
Even drugs sold over the counter say that , official advice can be found here .
Life however goes on , new people die , new people get born .
Shit happens .
They did not just combine their drugs they went way overboard .
Toxicology reports will not be available for two weeks , but police believe they may have consumed alcohol , mephedrone and the heroin - substitute methadone .
I ’m going to admit that I have had meow - meow , I did it last weekend ( not in Scunthorpe ) .
It is a very pleasurable drug .
If you are old enough to remember the early rave scene , think of the pills you got back then .
Meow - meow , M - Cat , Bubble , whatever you want to call mephedrone is highly pleasurable .
It is very cheap and you do not need to buy it or involve yourself with some mad drug dealer .
Not that dealers in real life are scary , this of course is yet another government myth .
As a high , it is exactly the same as MDMA powder .
You will however be very unlikely to buy MDMA powder .
If you try to buy MDMA powder you will end up with crushed up pills that have been mixed with all kinds of crap as well as a sore and possibly bloody nose .
It is perfectly legal to buy – but it as sold all over the internet as plant fertiliser .
I ’m not really sure how good at being a plant fertiliser it would be but never mind .
Packages clearly say on it not fit for human consumption .
The purchaser can then decide whether sprinkle it over their magnolias or snort it up like a line of coke .
Small quantities are between £ 5 to £ 15 a gram ( including delivery – sometimes to the door on the same day ) .
Large quantities , ( wholesale amounts ) which are imported from China come in at way below that price .
I shared a gram with a friend , it cost him £ 10 .
The reported short term side effects of people pulling their gonads off , etc etc are just that bollocks .
I just do not believe the stories .
It is relatively light to snort so nose - bleeds are not really a problem either , unless it is impure , but because you can buy it legally – online , it is not likely to be impure .
Long term side effects from taking mephedrone are not known but one would suggest that is why you have the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
A tip – do small lines , it takes a while to kick in but it will and then you can keep the level topped up .
It is more - ish in the same way a pack of pringles is but it is not addictive .
You are not stressing if you do not have it .
Again , like a pack of Pringles .
This advice on the packaging ( not the Pringles bit ) - if it could have been sold for its real intended purpose – may have saved the lives of the two boys from Scunthorpe .
The problem is politicians refuse to listen to reasoned scientific consideration and prefer to make knee jerk reactions to newspaper headlines .
With an election only months away this will only get worse .
So of course in steps Lord Mandleson of Darkness .
Never one to shy away from a knee jerk reaction to win the support of the Daily Mail , a newspaper that hates him .
Mandleson is reported to have said ,
Now it ’s been associated very tragically with the deaths of these two young people , the government will be looking at this very , very speedily , very carefully and we will take any action that is needed . ”
Other than the fact that you can not have both very carefuly and very speedily , it is worth pointing out that had politicians not have sacked Professor David Nutt for doing his job , a careful and non -knee jerk recommendation would have been available by now because he was reviewing the legal highs that are currently available .
Lord Peter Mandleson , voices his concern for the two young people , but not of course the thousands of alcohol related deaths that occur each year .
Of course , his lobbyist chums would get upset .
There is a complete hypocrisy in UK drugs laws .
Everyone knows that they do not work Everyone knows that prohibition does n’t work .
The public know it .
Politicians know it , but think of the children .
If it is in any way fun , but has a risk – ban it .
This hypocrisy is made worse because there are a large number of politicians who have taken drugs ( and some still do ) .
This Nanny State approach does not work .
Rather than continually ban every new substance that comes on to the market why not properly regulate drugs , so as with prescription drugs , purity can be assured and dosage instructions can be offered ?
If people can no longer believe Government stories about the dangers of things like mushrooms and cannabis , why would they believe politicians about heroin ?
The more the Government lies about drugs and the effects they have on people , the greater the problem they create in trying to deal with opiate based drugs .
The “ war on drugs ” is fake .
It is not working and people do not believe the Government when they tell them all drugs are bad .
The war on drugs is also seriously hampering the real war going on in Afghanistan .
It seems completely stupid that we are out in Afghanistan dropping bombs on poppy fields so Afghan farmers can not make money ( and therefore may have a somewhat begrudging attitude towards us as a result ) when there is a World shortage of legal opiates .
Worse this policy is continued because of someone with a name like Koolaid .
I ’m not calling for the complete uncontrolled legalisation of drugs , however a properly regulated , taxed and quality controlled market would be a lot better than this continuing high cost failure of a policy known as the War on Drugs , or otherwise called prohibition .
It would remove the armed gangs from the market and would ensure that young people do not need to buy questionable drugs of questionable quality from questionable people .
So rather than the usual knee jerk reactions and calls for bans within days , is n’t it time for a sensible debate on drugs ?

France 's national football team was further drawn into the sex scandal involving Franck Ribéry yesterday after two more players ' names were cited in connection with an investigation into underage prostitution .
Unnamed judicial sources told the French media that Karim Benzema , the Real Madrid forward , and Hatem Ben Arfa , a striker for Marseille , are expected to be questioned in coming days as " witnesses " in the inquiry .
The scandal engulfing Les Bleus , which began when Ribéry was questioned by police in connection with a prostitution ring , also deepened after judicial sources said the 27 - year - old had admitted having sex with a 17 - year - old prostitute but denied having known she was underage .
In France it is illegal to buy sex from someone under 18 .
The Bayern Munich forward 's lawyer , Sophie Bottai , has insisted that , while the footballer did provide witness testimony to French investigators looking into a ring allegedly run out of a Paris nightclub , he was being heard simply as a witness and not as a suspect .
No charges were filed against him , said Bottai , and he was not held in police custody .
However , the rumours swirling around the team have not ceased since reports surfaced at the weekend that Ribéry and his fellow player Sidney Govou had been questioned by French investigators .
On 12 April police had searched the Zaman Café , a restaurant and nightclub on the Champs Elyseés , and arrested a dozen people , among them prostitutes and a man suspected of being their pimp .
Refusing to say whether or not his client had been questioned by police , Govou 's lawyer , Thierry Braillard , said the 30 - year - old had " never set foot " in the Zaman .
But the player 's name has been cited repeatedly in connection with the investigation being led by the investigating judge André Dando .
A judicial source said that , while his married team - mate Ribéry remained a witness in the affair , " it is up to the judge to decided whether to formally investigate him [ Ribéry ] or not " .
In France , prostitution is legal but several activities surrounding it are against the law .
If found guilty of paying an underage sex worker , a client could go to prison for three years and be fined up to € 45,000 ( £ 39,000 ) .
Yesterday the two other players drawn into the scandal vehemently denied involvement in alleged activities at the Zaman , which has now been shut down .
" It 's absolutely not me , " Ben Arfa told L'Equipe TV .
Even if his client were summoned by the police tomorrow , added his lawyer , " that would change nothing " .
Benzema 's agent , Karim Djaziri , also spoke out in defence of his client .
" Karim has not been questioned .
He has nothing to do with this affair , " he told LePost. fr .
As speculation mounted in Paris , the French football federation ( FFF ) issued a terse statement saying it was aware of the investigation and certain players ' involvement " as mere witnesses " .
But it said it would " refrain from all comment " until the police had done their job .
Cosplay Gen( eration ) , a project brought by the Otaku Magazine ( www.otakumag.com) team , is an independent magazine ( no ADS ) focused on the worldwide promoting of cosplayers and of various Japanese fashion trends .
The 72 pages of the magazine will include profiles featuring cosplayers from around the world and their amazing work ; extended interviews ; reviews from various cosplay events ; articles centered on cosplay photography , cosplay trends , and Japanese fashion ; tutorials ; and also a beginner 's corner .
It 's a project born out of our love for cosplay and for Japanese contemporary fashion culture , and from the continuous need to bring these in the spotlight .
We consider that a good project is always a useful one , regardless the many other existing similar means , and from this point of view there 's no such thing as “ enough ” .
Therefore , in our attempt , we tried to collaborate with the best contributors and bring forth materials that would address to a very heterogeneous public interested in cosplay and Japanese fashion .
The first issue of Cosplay Gen is going to be released in May 2010 .

This project has German people , lasers , and dentists who use lasers on German people in it .
German people in the pre-cursor to the project , if you will .
The designer of this project , Muna Sawas , found 50 % of Deutsch citizens to be totally afraid to visit their dentist .
So what ’s to be done ?
Make a practically pain - free , totally awesome laser therapy method .
With lasers !
On the teeth !
Made to be an entry - level tool for dentists who plan on using laser therapy in the future .
The “ Dio - Lase ” uses a 7 - watt diode laser and covers the main treatments of soft tissue .
No wires , the laser is completely self - contained in this little handheld device .
Adjustable laser head , perfect for fitting in the mouth , 180 degrees of laser lovliness .
I ’m not sure HOW it works , but it does seem pretty fab , does n’t it ?

Colorized micrograph of superconducting circuit used in NIST quantum computing research .
The chip combines a quantum bit ( pink ) for storing quantum information , a quantum bus ( green ) for transporting information , and a switch ( purple ) that “ tunes ” interactions between the other two components .
Credit : M.S. Allman / NIST
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have developed the first “ dimmer switch ” for a superconducting circuit linking a quantum bit ( qubit ) and a quantum bus — promising technologies for storing and transporting information in future quantum computers .
The NIST switch is a new type of control device that can “ tune ” interactions between these components and potentially could speed up the development of a practical quantum computer .
Quantum computers , if they can be built , would use the curious rules of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems that are now intractable , such as breaking today ’s most widely used data encryption codes , or running simulations of quantum systems that could unlock the secrets of high - temperature superconductors .
Unlike many competing systems that store and transport information using the quantum properties of individual atoms , superconducting qubits use a “ super flow ” of oscillating electrical current to store information in the form of microwave energy .
Superconducting quantum devices are fabricated like today ’s silicon processor chips and may be easy to manufacture at the large scales needed for computation .
As described in a forthcoming paper in Physical Review Letters , * the new NIST switch can reliably tune the interaction strength or rate between the two types of circuits — a qubit and a bus — from 100 megahertz to nearly zero .
The advance could enable researchers to flexibly control the interactions between many circuit elements in an intricate network as would be needed in a quantum computer of a practical size .
Other research groups have demonstrated switches for two or three superconducting qubits coupled together , but the NIST switch is the first to produce predictable quantum behavior over time with the controllable exchange of an individual microwave photon ( particle of light ) between a qubit and a resonant cavity .
The resonant cavity serves as what engineers call a “ bus ” — a channel for moving information from one section of the computer to another .
“ We have three different elements all working together , coherently ( in concert with each other ) and without losing a lot of energy , ” says the CU - Boulder graduate student Michael ( Shane ) Allman who performed the experiments with NIST physicist Ray Simmonds , the principal investigator .
All three components ( qubit , switch , and cavity ) were made of aluminum in an overlapping pattern on a sapphire chip ( see image ) .
The switch is a radio - frequency SQUID ( superconducting quantum interference device ) , a magnetic field sensor that acts like a tunable transformer .
The circuit is created with a voltage pulse that places one unit of energy — a single microwave photon — in the qubit .
By tuning a magnetic field applied to the SQUID , scientists can alter the coupling energy or transfer rate of the single photon between the qubit and cavity .
The researchers watch this photon slosh back and forth at a rate they can now adjust with a knob .
The switch research was supported in part by the Army Research Office .
Simmonds ’s group previously demonstrated the first superconducting quantum bus between qubits ( see “ NIST Debuts Superconducting Quantum Computing Cable , ” which also describes how the superconducting qubits operate ) .

Ein verstörendes Video zeigt ein Massaker , das US - Hubschrauberbesatzungen 2007 im Irak anrichteten .
Zwei der Opfer waren Reuters - Mitarbeiter .
Ansonsten wäre die Aktion wahrscheinlich nicht ans Licht gekommen .
" Nice "
" Good shoot ' n "
" Haha "
Das sind Gesprächsfetzen aus " Collateral Murder , einem Video - Dokument , das derzeit bei WikiLeaks veröffentlicht ist .
Es führt die totale moralische Verwahrlosung des Menschen in der Alltäglichkeit des Krieges vor Augen : Hubschrauberpiloten , möglicherweise privat echte " nice guys " , feuern unbarmherzig auf eine Gruppe Menschen in einem Vorort Bagdads , weil sie die Männer für eine Versammlung bewaffneter Widerständler halten .
Sie handeln nach der Kriegslogik " Ich töte , weil ihr mich umgebracht hättet , wenn ich euch nicht töte " und kommentieren die Tötung , als ob es sich um ein Spiel oder ein Sportereignis handeln würde .
Screenshot
Dem kameradschaftlichen Einverständnis , das sich im Funkverkehr oben zwischen den Hubschrauberbesatzungen zeigt , stehen verstörende Bilder vom Boden entgegen : ein Schwerverwundeter , der sich mühsam auf der Straße dahinschleppt , in der Hoffnung auf irgendeine Zuflucht oder Hilfe , das Eintreffen eines Kleinbusses , mit zu Hilfe eilenden Männern , eine weitere Schusssalve , Staub , Tote .
Und später Bilder von Soldaten , die mit verwundeten Kindern im Arm auf Fahrzeuge zu laufen .
Zuvor hatte die Kamera eine Zoom - Aufnahme des Kleinbusses gezeigt , in der die Kinder im Bus sitzend zu erkennen sind .
Im Funkverkehr wurde zunächst der Treffer in der Windschutzscheibe bejubelt und dann , das Signal eines " schlechten Gefühls " zur Seite räumend , moniert , dass man doch keine Kinder ins Schlachtfeld mitbringen sollte - " selbst schuld " .
Das Video , das den " Kollateralmord " amerikanischer Hubschrauberbesatzungen in einem Vorort Bagdas im Jahr 2007 dokumentieren soll , ist nach Angaben von Wikileaks.com durch die Mithilfe mehrerer " Whistleblowers " innerhalb des amerikanischen Militärs auf die Site gelangt .
Die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters habe über Freedom of Information Act - Anfragen schon seit August 2007 versucht , an das Material zu kommen , erfolglos .
Man habe die Authentizität der Dokumente sorgfältig geprüft , heißt es auf WikiLeaks .
Wären zwei der Toten , der Fahrer Sameed Chamagh und der Fotograf Namir Noor - Eldee , nicht Mitarbeiter der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters gewesen , so wäre die militärisch sanktionierte Mordaktion wohl niemals ans Licht der Öffentlichkeit gekommen - doch ist das nur einer von mehreren Skandalen , die mit dem bislang geheimgehaltenen Video verknüpft sind .
Screenshot
Über den Einzelfall hinaus zeigt das Video das Grundübel des Krieges im Irak : die vermeintliche Bedrohung , auf die mit aller Waffengewalt , die zur Verfügung steht , reagiert wird , gnadenlos .
Dass die Gruppe von Männern , die , wie auf den ersten Bildern zu sehen ist , in Zivil und in lockerer Gangart eine Straße queren , eine Bedrohung darstellen , erschließt sich nämlich nicht so eindeutig , wie es der Funkverkehr der Hubschrauberbesatzung ohne jeden Anflug von Zweifel konstatiert und eine tödlichen Abfolge in Gang setzt : " Individuals with Weapons " ... " Request permission to engage " ...
" Lets shoot " - die vermeintliche Schusswaffe , die der " fucking prick " , der Reutersfotograf , an der Schulter hängen hat , ist eine Kamera , wie sich später herausstellt .
Hätte man dies früher erkennen können ?
Und hätte das den Ablauf verändert ?
( Einzufügen wäre an dieser Stelle , dass bei den Männern , die weiter hinten auftauchen , ebenso nicht klar ersichtlich ist , was sie in den Händen halten , der Verdacht , dass es Waffen sein könnten , ist aber gegeben . )

Schockierend ist in jedem Falle die Reaktion der amerikanischen Militärführung , die nach einer durch Reuters Nachfragen initiierten Untersuchung des " Vorfalls " offiziell bekundet , dass die Handlungen der Soldaten nach den Regeln des bewaffneten Konflikts und in Übereinstimmung mit den Einsatzregeln des US - Militärs , " Rules of Engagement " , verlaufen seien - schuld sind die anderen .
Auch hier erhebt ein Monster des " gerechten Irakkrieges " sein gräßliches Haupt : die Vertuschung wahrer Umstände , der Wille mit aller Macht am offiziellen Zerrbild festzuhalten .
Was sich schon in der Vorbereitung auf den Waffengang im Irak zeigte , wird hier in Details noch einmal durchdekliniert .
Etwa an der Art , wie amerikanische Geheimdienste in diesem Fall versuchten , mit massiven Drohungen gegenüber WikiLeaks die Veröffentlichung des brisanten Dokuments zu verhindern .

The first letter I got from J.D. Salinger was very short .
It was 1988 , and I had written to him with a proposal : I wanted my tiny publishing house , Orchises Press , to publish his novella Hapworth 16 , 1924 .
And Salinger himself had improbably replied , saying that he would consider it .
Hapworth is Salinger ’s great mystical not - quite - lost work .
It takes the form of a digressive 26,000 - word letter sent home from summer camp by the breathtakingly precocious 7 - year - old Seymour Glass .
The novella took up more than 50 pages of The New Yorker in the issue of June 19 , 1965 ; I was 18 then , and I still have my copy .
It ’s the last writing that Salinger released to the world , apart from court documents blocking assaults on his privacy , and it never appeared again .
I had the idea that Salinger might find my company attractive for its smallness .
( Orchises is based in Alexandria , Virginia , and at the time had about 50 titles in print , mostly poetry and reprints of classics . )
I had addressed my pitch to “ J. D. Salinger , Cornish , NH , ” figuring that the post office would know what to do .
They did .
Two weeks later , a short note arrived , signed “ J D S , ” and saying that he ’d consider my proposal .
I was ecstatic , even if I doubted that he ’d proceed .
And then , silence .
Eight years went by .
In 1996 , Harold Ober Associates , which represented Salinger , asked for a catalogue and some sample books .
It had been so long , I did n’t make any connection , but I now see that I was being vetted .
That May , I came home from vacation to find a letter from Phyllis Westberg , Harold Ober ’s president .
She began , “ It might be wiser to sit down before reading the rest of this … ”
She summarized my communication with Mr. Salinger and said that he would soon write to me .
I phoned her , in shock , just to be sure .
Westberg warned me that the book would have to be made to exacting standards .
( I remember thinking , That means F cloth — the highest grade of buckram bookbinding fabric . )
Why had he said yes ?
I think he chose me because I did n’t chase him .
I had left him alone for eight years after receiving his letter ; I was n’t pushy in the commercial way he found offensive .
Two weeks later , a large envelope arrived .
It had been addressed on a Royal manual typewriter , the same as the 1988 note .
Inside was a full - page letter , and it took my breath away .
Chatty , personal , with that rare sweet and endearing tone that characterizes the story I wanted to publish , it expressed Salinger ’s high pleasure in finding a way to put out Hapworth .
He proposed a meeting .
Just by chance ( could this be true ? ) , he would soon be close to Washington , D.C. Might we have lunch ?
Later that week , I was in my office and the phone rang .
“ Mr. Lathbury , please . ”
“ That ’s me . ”
“ This is Salinger . ” I swallowed .
“ I , um , am glad you called .
Thank you for your letter . ”
Then J. D. Salinger pitched me his story , like an unknown , saying that he thought it was a high point of his writing .
“ I do n’t know how I managed to finish it . ”
Some instinct told me not to offer praise , which would have been superfluous .
( Had n’t I wanted to publish the story ? )
He proposed a lunch at the National Gallery of Art. Shaking with astonishment , I set up a time the following Wednesday .
That week , I typed out the text of “ Hapworth 16 , 1924 ” from my old New Yorker , and designed a dummy that I thought would meet Salinger ’s demands .
I gave the story plenty of leading ( the space between lines of type ) so that , as Salinger had put it , “ Seymour could breathe . ”
That bulked up the book , solving another problem .
Salinger had told me that he strongly preferred type on a book ’s spine to read horizontally rather than vertically , and the volume had been too slim for that .
As I worked out the specifications , I tried deliberately not to make the book “ elegant . ”
He had been quick to object to my use of the word , which to him connoted narcissism and preciousness .
The buckram he asked me to use is the functional , unpretty material that libraries use to rebind worn - out books .
Hapworth , the book , was to start out this way : straightforward and pure .
When I arrived at the National Gallery , Salinger — tall , in good shape at 77 , with silver hair and a blue kerchief around his neck — was waiting .
We shook hands , proceeded through the cafeteria lines , and found a table in the middle of the room .
Just two guys discussing papers pulled from an old briefcase .
He was losing his hearing and was slightly embarrassed about it , but if I leaned in and spoke a little louder than normal , he could manage .
Salinger disconcertingly asked me to call him “ Jerry . ” I was nervous , though small talk came easily enough .
Surprisingly , he touched on matters about which I would never have dared inquire , such as his resentment over the lawyers ’ fees in his suit against biographer Ian Hamilton .
He also made the disparaging remark that he found Little , Brown , his publisher since 1951 , completely unsympathetic .
I resolved that he would n’t find Orchises so .
Still , when I said , “ Shall we get down to business ? ” he too relaxed perceptibly .

I had prepared two typographical treatments for the text , and he chose the one I thought he would .
We went over small details of bookmaking .
( Running heads at the top of the page ?
No .
The fabric headband at the ends of the spine ?
Plain navy blue .
“ Ca n’t go wrong with that ! ” Salinger said , with an explosive laugh . )
The cover would carry just the title and , below it , his name .
There would be no dust jacket .
I showed him a mock - up of the spine , and when he saw the horizontal type , he said , warmly , “ Oh good . ”
I confessed that my distribution was n’t great .
He told me , “ Nothing would make me happier than not to see my book in the Dartmouth Bookstore . ”
Distributed but not distributed !
Of all the writers I have published , only one has ever asked that his book be kept out of stores .
I had spotted a few inconsistencies within the text , and I brought them up , fearing the wrath of the lion .
Yet he said , mildly enough , “ No , no .
I want it left as it is . ”
He reminisced about reading The New Yorker page proofs in the car of his editor , William Shawn , while Shawn attended an event at his son ’s prep school .
What would be the publication date ?
This I had ready : “ January 1 , 1997 . ” Six months off .
“ That ’s my birthday . ”
“ I think I knew that . ”
In fact , I had chosen it for that reason .
We wrapped up a few details , and bussed our trays .
I stopped to stare at the waterfall outside the cafeteria , which flows over a set of stone steps right up against a glass wall .
Suddenly , Salinger wheeled around .
“ What are you looking at ?
Answer quick , without thinking ! ”
Taken aback , I stammered , “ I like that waterfall . ”
He seemed mollified .
In a moment I understood : Had I paused so he could be secretly photographed ?
A friend later told me that such pictures can be sold for large sums .
Money , though , was not on my mind , nor on his .
There was never talk of an advance , and although he did not want the book aggressively priced , he had told his agent , generously , to let me make some money on it .
I worked out that I could sell the book for $ 15.95 .
After refusing my offer of a ride , J. D. Salinger walked energetically across the Mall .
I was both relieved and sad to see him go , and wondered if this would be the only time we would meet .
A series of letters followed .
They were remarkably open , even garrulous , with notes on family life , social observations , gripes about train travel , little jokes about himself .
He mentioned working on Glass - family stories , but told me nothing about what he ’d written after Hapworth .
I certainly did n’t ask .
Around this time , I unwittingly made the first move that would unravel the whole deal .
I applied for Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication data .
It sounds innocent .
It is certainly boring .
CIP data are the information printed on the copyright page .
The filings are public information , but I did n’t imagine that anyone would notice one among thousands .
It would be like reading a list of register codes at the grocery : apples 30 , bananas 45 , oranges 61 .
As we worked on the book , the publication date slipped from January to February .
An agreement was drawn up , saying that Hapworth had to appear by June 1 , or the deal would expire .
There was also an unusual provision :
All copies were to be sold at the retail price , whether to individuals or distributors or bookstores .
Salinger would get his wish of limited distribution .
What store would sell a book on which it could make nothing ?
One thing Salinger did tell me was that he ’d grown unhappy about seeing his name on the front cover , and we removed it .
This was going to be a most austere book .
We also learned that the type on the spine was too small to be stamped cleanly into the fabric .
Salinger offered a new design , with the letters strung out diagonally .
It was awful : ugly , difficult to read , ostentatiously weird .
When I said so to Phyllis Westberg , she was succinct : “ Bite the bullet , Roger ! ”
I bit .
I ordered two sample cases — the covers of the book , its shell .
In November , I sent one to Cornish , and kept the other .
We would have Hapworth in stores in just a few weeks .
Then I made another , bigger mistake .
What I know now , but did not then , was that CIP listings are not only public but also appear on Amazon.com , even for books not yet published .
Someone spotted Hapworth there , and his sister was a reporter for a local paper in Arlington , the Washington Business Journal .
One day , after I arrived home from my job teaching at George Mason University , she telephoned .
It seems clear now how everything happened .
Hindsight is always clear .
I remember that the reporter told me this would be an article about Orchises Press as well as Salinger .
She asked me basic questions , about how I ’d got Salinger to say yes , about the size of the press run .
Foolishly — if reasonably — I answered most of them .
I compared our press run to those of Salinger ’s earlier books , mentioning them by name .
I thought I could control myself , but my ego came into play .
Anyway , what harm could it do ?
This was a tiny paper .
Then someone at the Washington Post saw it .
A writer , David Streitfeld , called .
I refused to speak at first , then answered a few questions , nervously , about what I liked about Hapworth and when it would appear .
He asked if I ’d met Salinger , and that , at least , I kept to myself .
The story appeared in the Post in January 1997 .
My phone nearly exploded .
Newspapers , magazines , television stations , book distributors , strangers , foreign publishers , movie people .
South Africa , Catalonia , Australia .
The fax machine ran through reams of paper .
People wanting review copies .
( There were to be none . )
People wanting interviews .
I held as closely as I could to “ no comment , ” but when asked for a publication date , I gave one — at first March 1997 , then later .
I held to the $ 15.95 price for everybody : bookstore , distributor , chain store , fruit stand , anyone who wanted Hapworth .
The only one who did n’t call me was Salinger .
I asked his agent , and repeatedly got the same answer :
No news .
I could n’t proceed without him , because we still had too many details unsettled .
Meanwhile , bookstore chains — frustrated by the no-discount rule — had decided to simply mark the book up to $ 22.95 .
I inferred ( from Westberg ’s questions ) that Salinger thought I had jacked up the price , to capitalize on the publicity and gouge everyone .
I had n’t , but I ’ll never know for sure what he believed .
By February 1997 , I had heard nothing for three months , but I had not yet given up hope .
On February 20 , Michiko Kakutani , working from the original text in The New Yorker , published a punishing review of Hapworth in the New York Times .
I have no way of knowing , but this may have been the last straw .
It was as rough as anything that Mary McCarthy or any other critic had ever said about Salinger ’s work .
I yearned to write to Salinger , but I knew that it would do no good .
He must have been furious with me , for betraying him by leaking news to the press , or even confirming it .
I could no longer be trusted .
I had proven myself part of the crass , opportunistic world that Salinger ’s heroes disdain .
We were at a standoff , and soon enough , the contract ’s time limit passed .
I lost the book on June 1 .
Westberg ’s office told me then that any subsequent moves would be up to Salinger , and that was that .
Some people , when they hear this story , blame Salinger for backing down after going this far , but I find this unfair .
Such people want J. D. Salinger to be someone other than J. D. Salinger .
Nor is the problem the Washington Post .
I know where the blame lies .
After thinking I could do right by a man I admired , I let him down .
In the end , I ’m left with a box .
It contains the buckram sample case and the die used to stamp the cockeyed spine printing .
It also contains a stack of wonderful , kind letters from a man who has meant as much to readers as any writer ever can .
I have not looked at those letters in years ; to reread them would be too painful .
Nor will I sell them .
That , at least , I can do .
A friend of mine on Facebook was recently laid off by her employer .
The only reason I know of this is through her countless Facebook status updates regarding it .
Her status messages and posts were at first positive and reassuring that her future looked bright .
But a few weeks into her unemployment , she became restless and anxious about finding another job .
The confident remarks changed to ones desperation .
Once I checked out her profile , it was clear what the problem was .

The iconic Christ the Redeemer statue has towered over Rio de Janeiro for the past eight decades
Rio de Janeiro 's towering Christ the Redeemer statue has been closed to the public after landslides that hit Brazil , killing some 250 people .
Access to the statue was cut off for the first time in its 80 - year history as roads were blocked by debris .
More bodies have been uncovered as rescue workers search through the wreckage of shanty towns buried after torrential rain caused the mudslides .
The death toll may rise as 200 people are still missing , officials say .
They have also warned that further landslides are possible , given the saturated soil .
Analysts say ramshackle shanty towns built on steep hills are most at risk .
Most of the landslide victims were residents of shanty towns , where about a fifth of Rio de Janeiro 's population live .
On Tuesday , search crews found more bodies buried in homes by a massive landslide that hit a shanty town outside Rio de Janeiro city .
Indefinite closure
Towering over Rio de Janeiro , the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue was named one of the new wonders of the world in 2007 , and is visited by two million tourists a year .
It was cut off when Tijuca National Park 's Corcovado mountain on which it sits was hit by severe mudslides , park officials said .
Park director Bernard Issa said he hoped it would reopen " within one or two months " .
The landslides in and around Brazil 's second biggest city were set off by downpours that began last Monday - the area 's heaviest rainfall for decades .
Work is under way to clear the debris and mend roads , and Rio de Janeiro state 's governor said as many as 150 bodies could still be underneath the mud in the Morro do Bumba shanty town .
Set in the municipality of Niteroi , across the bay from the city of Rio , Morro do Bumba was built on top of a disused landfill , making it prone to landslides .
Rio de Janeiro's Mayor , Eduardo Paes , said families were being evacuated from high - risk areas .
He said 4,000 families had been made homeless and 10,000 houses remained at risk .
Mr Paes estimated the total cost of repair work would be at least $ 113 m ( £ 73 m ) .

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has dismissed the idea that US - Israeli relations are in crisis amid a row over Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem .
She said the two nations had a " close , unshakeable bond " but made clear the US wanted both Israel and the Palestinians to prove their commitment to peace .
Earlier , US envoy George Mitchell postponed a planned visit to Israel .
Heightened tensions in Jerusalem have led to violent clashes between hundreds of Palestinians and Israeli police .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed what he called Mrs Clinton 's " warm remarks " , and said Israel had already proved its " commitment to peace in both word and deed " .
On Wednesday Jerusalem was quiet after Tuesday 's sporadic outbreaks of violence .
Israeli police said about 60 Palestinians had been arrested and medical officials said a number of people had been injured .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon urged restraint from both sides , the AFP news agency reports , and again stressed that Jerusalem 's final status should be decided by negotiation .
' Dismay and disappointment ' Israel angered Washington by announcing its plans for 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem as US Vice - President Joe Biden visited the region last week to try to kick - start stalled peace talks .
We do n't agree with any of our international partners on everything
Hillary Clinton
US Secretary of State
Views from the US media Israel - US : A bruised friendship Israel 's ambassador to the US , Michael Oren , was quoted by Israeli media on Monday as saying that ties between the US and Israel were at their lowest point since 1975 .
Asked if that was the case , Mrs Clinton said : " I do n't buy that . "
She said Washington had an " absolute commitment to Israel 's security " .
But , she added , the US did not always agree with its international allies on everything , and it had expressed its " dismay and disappointment " to Israel over last week 's incident .
Last week , Mrs Clinton called the settlements announcement " insulting " to the US and , in a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , demanded Israel take steps to show its commitment to peace .
The US says it is still awaiting a " formal " response from Israel to those concerns .

Advertisement Mr Mitchell had been due to meet Israeli President Shimon Peres on Tuesday but the trip has been put off to an as yet undetermined time , officials said .
State department spokesman Philip Crowley said Mr Mitchell would not meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders before a Middle East Quartet meeting in Moscow on Friday but talks would be scheduled at some point .
BBC state department correspondent Kim Ghattas , in Washington , says the pressure is piling up on Israel but the question being asked is whether the US can get anything from Israel at this stage .
It is possible the Israeli prime minister cannot deliver what Washington wants without paying too heavy a price at home , our correspondent says .
Although he has apologised for the timing of the settlement announcement , Mr Netanyahu has stood by Israel 's policy , telling parliament on Monday there can be " no curbs " on Jewish building in Jerusalem .
The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says there seems to be an impasse - if Mr Netanyahu caves in and cancels the new settlements , the stability of his government may be in doubt ; if he does not , it is hard to see how the peace talks can take place .
' Day of rage ' Tensions in East Jerusalem have risen in recent days with the settlements issue and the rededication of a synagogue in Jerusalem 's Old City , which Palestinians have condemned as provocative .
The synagogue was destroyed by Jordanian forces during the war that began in 1948 after the creation of Israel .
This synagogue will be a prelude to violence and religious fanaticism and extremism
Hatem Abdel Qader ,
Fatah Jerusalem spokesman
In pictures : Jerusalem clashes Jerusalem 's tinder - box Send us your comments Hundreds of Palestinian protesters burned tyres and threw rocks , while police fired stun grenades and tear gas , as rioting broke out in a number of areas - including the Shu'fat refugee camp , al - Eisaweyah and the Qalandia checkpoint between a Palestinian controlled section of the West Bank and a occupied East Jerusalem .
Israeli police said they had deployed 3,000 officers across the city .
The reopening of the twice - destroyed Hurva synagogue , in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City , which Palestinians seek as part of a future capital , triggered a wide backlash .
Hatem Abdel Qader , Jerusalem affairs spokesman for the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , said : " This synagogue will be a prelude to violence and religious fanaticism and extremism . "
Militant group Hamas had declared Tuesday a " day of rage " against the move .
Thousands of people turned out in Gaza to protest against the rededication of the Jerusalem synagogue , which is not far from the al - Aqsa mosque , Islam 's third - holiest site , although demonstrations there remained relatively peaceful .
Our correspondent says the call by some Palestinian officials for people to defend the Haram al - Sharif or Temple Mount , site of the al - Aqsa mosque , comes amid rumours of plans by Jewish extremists to take control of the area .
He says that although the clashes so far are small - scale , no - one has forgotten how the last Palestinian intifada - or uprising - began over the holy sites in Jerusalem .

Sir John Houghton , an ex-boss of the IPCC , and the hockey stick graph , visually demonstrating that the flawed hockey stick graph has " never " played any important role for the IPCC statements .
Picture via AP and BBC
John Houghton wrote an article for the U.K .
Times :
If the IPCC has a fault , it is that its reports have been too cautious , not alarmist .
In the UK only about 26 per cent of the population believe the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is man-made .
Many feel they are being steamrollered into believing something false or flakey that will make them poorer or stop them flying .
Given this dangerous mood of scepticism , it is no surprise that the IPCC — the body that represents the integrity of climate - change scientists across the world — is being attacked .
Let ’s be honest , sometimes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does get it wrong .
It was an error to include a poorly sourced claim in its 2007 report about the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are melting ; but this mistake was marginal — it did not influence any of the IPCC ’s main conclusions or appear in the summaries of the report .
The great body of the IPCC ’s work represents science at its best — and it needs defending from its detractors .
The IPCC is not a self - selected group of scientists with a political agenda .
It was founded in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Environment Programme with a mandate to produce accurate , balanced assessments about human - induced climate change .
I was chairman or co-chairman of the Science Working Group from 1988 –2002 , through the first three IPCC reports .
About 70 scientists from around the world attended the first meeting of the group near Oxford early in 1989 .
We had no preconceived agenda regarding our conclusions .
In fact , a number of attendees argued that not enough was known about human - induced climate change to produce any significant report .
However , we agreed that we would identify carefully what we knew with reasonable certainty , estimate the uncertainties and distinguish it from what we were much more uncertain about .
This does n’t exactly mark us out as a bunch of ecofanatics .
The IPCC is too big an organisation to ...
The IPCC is too big an organisation to be captured by an ideological cabal or fall foul of group - think .
It draws in scientists from every discipline from many different nations .
Climatologists from Benin rub shoulders with scientists from the West , and from Saudi Arabia and other petrol - states for whom belief in global warming is against their immediate interests .
The IPCC process also makes it impossible for green propaganda to be slipped in .
The IPCC has published four reports — in 1990 , 1995 , 2001 and 2007 .
Each contains three volumes covering science , impacts and mitigation ; in 2007 each volume was about 1,000 pages long .
Their main content is a detailed review of thousands of peer - reviewed scientific papers .
But a report from Greenpeace or any other campaigning body would not be included because the science would not be considered robust enough .
Each chapter of an IPCC report goes through three reviews .
The first is by expert scientists .
The second involves a wider international community of climate scientists and others with an interest ( including industrial and green NGOs ) and the third is by national governments .
Report summaries are scrutinised sentence by sentence at an IPCC plenary meeting over three or four days .
These scientific meetings can become intense .
I recall one that got bogged down over whether the words “ appreciable human impact ” were justified by the evidence .
We clapped with relief when we agreed on “ discernible human impact ” .
A further myth is that the IPCC is alarmist .
In truth , it ’s far easier to find what now looks like excessive caution in IPCC reports .
For instance , the 1990 report stated that increases in greenhouse gases were causing global warming but added that , because of natural climate variability , this warming could not be clearly detected in the observed record .
As warming has continued at about the rate projected by the reports , each subsequent report has in general shown increasing confidence in its conclusions .
Let me give you another example : the 2007 report declined to estimate the possible effect of accelerated melting of ice caps , as it considered no reliable estimates were available at that time .
A third myth is that the IPCC has refused to recognise that there has been no significant increase in global average temperature in the past decade or so .
Sceptics cite this as evidence against human - induced global warming .
But the level of natural year - to - year variability in the temperature record shows that a decade is too short a time to establish a change in the long - term trend .
It is also known that a substantial part of the recent variability is down to the El Niño - Southern Oscillation , a massive climate pattern in the Pacific .
The Pacific sector has certainly been cooler than elsewhere during the past decade .
Perhaps there is a criticism that can be made of IPCC scientists : they have been too slow publicly to defend their integrity .
They have not been willing or able to hit the airwaves or make their case in newspapers .
But scientists are now faced by powerful lobbies who are working to distort and discredit the science behind climate change .
We scientists have facts on our sides — we must not be afraid to deploy them .
Sir John Houghton is former chief executive at the Met Office .
The subtitle says : Sure . ;-)
I will briefly comment on this amazing assertion later in the text .
People worry that they would have to stop flying even though the IPCC itself and its allies - especially the likes of Al Gore - are a living proof that despite the AGW panic , these folks fly more often than ever .
Note that Houghton considers skepticism " dangerous " .
This very sentence makes his reasoning fundamentally incompatible with the scientific method .
The mood of skepticism is not dangerous : it is a basic pre-requisite for science .
The IPCC may represent the global climatological community but 90 % of it is corrupt - it 's bought to produce fake evidence in favor of AGW .
It 's easy to see where this number comes from .
When climatology was a decent yet modest scientific discipline , the funding was 10 times lower than it is today .
So 10 % of the current funding goes to the science as it used to exist while 90 % of the current funding was linked to the threat of AGW .
In other words , 90 % of the salary of an average climate scientist in the world is paid for him or her to say things that support the basic thesis that multiplied the funding by ten - namely the statement that there is a man-made climate change worth talking about or even a dangerous one .
In yet another different counting , you may say that 90 % of the current climatological community is not a part of it because of their desire to find the scientific truth but because of their intent to search for evidence supporting the pre-determined conclusion that there 's a dangerous man-made climate change .
The funding shows so .
The only way for climatology to regain its scientific status is to subtract those 90 % of the funding and fire those 90 % of the people who should n't be there .
It 's a necessary condition , not a sufficient one .
Houghton only mentions GlacierGate because it 's the only one for which the IPCC has apologized - kind of .
It has n't apologized for the other scandals even though they 're inherently more serious than the GlacierGate .
The IPCC has n't apologized again , and switched backed to the mode of denial , because it had previously " promised " itself that the GlacierGate was the only mistake in the 2007 IPCC report .
This statement of theirs is , however , completely absurd .
Virtually every single statement in the IPCC report that looks worrisome is based on ideology , science that suffers from childish mistakes and deliberate mistakes , and is only supported by gray literature .
That includes the statements about the glaciers , about the destruction of rain forests by climate change , about the dropping agricultural yields in Africa because of climate change , about the majority of the Netherlands being under the sea level , about the rising inherent damages caused by natural disasters , and everything else that makes the IPCC relevant in the political discourse and the media .
The IPCC is not " science at its best " : it is a shame that discredits all of science and is dragging all other scientific disciplines under the water .
It does n't deserve to be defended : it deserves to be eliminated .
People should pray that the damage caused by the IPCC to the institutionalized science in the whole world may be corrected in a foreseeable future .
Indeed , the IPCC was n't a self - selected group .
It was a group cherry - picked by the politicians .
The UN Environment Program is a political institution originally meant to influence environmental politics in the third world .
All these people have always looked for new ways to increase their perceived importance .
The right assessment about man-made climate change is that it is not worth a special discussion beyond the conferences of a few specialists who may look for various unusual effects that may influence the climate .
But this conclusion , while honestly summarizing the existing science , goes against the existential interests of the IPCC itself .
From the beginning , the IPCC had to be looking for a balance between the truth and their interest to survive .
Recently , the survival got much more important than the truth .
Well , this was 21 years ago .
While it 's surely not accurate to say that the IPCC did n't have a preconceived agenda at the beginning , the situation was probably not as bad as it is today .
Today , the agenda is completely manifest .
Houghton himself even considers skepticism " dangerous " .
He a priori rejects the possibility that he 's wrong .
Concerning the distinguished levels of certainty , where do the GlacierGate and dozens of other scandals belong ?
Was the IPCC certain about the glaciers ' demise by 2035 ?
How can we see Houghton 's principles in action when it comes to any particular statements ?
The answer is , of course , that we can't .
The statements that really matter - namely the statements that something dangerous is going on - are deliberately not assigned any meaningful odds .
And there 's a good reason for this fact .
While the actual scientific support for such scenarios is close to 0 % , they 're deliberately presented as something that science implies with the probabilities close to 100 % .
This confusion is the whole point of these speculations .
So Houghton may have agreed that they would be doing things correctly and honestly .
But it is much more important to notice that they have simply not done it .
They may have done it with " small technical questions " whose answers " do n't matter " .
But whenever it comes to any pillar of the orthodoxy , i.e. the statement that the mankind is doing something dangerous to the climate , all the standards of scientific integrity were always thrown under the bus .
And for the survival of the IPCC , they had to be thrown under the bus .
It 's too big to fail , is n't it ? ;-)
It 's a complete misunderstanding to believe that a bigger organization is immune against group - think or the influence of ideological cabals .
Quite on the contrary , the bigger organization we have , the more influential group - think may become .
Lysenkoism , Aryan Physics , and the anti-continental - drift hysteria are just three examples in which pretty much the whole communities in dominant nations were misled by group - think .
The only reason why we do n't find too many " international " examples of group - think of this kind is that the United Nations were only created in 1945 and until very recently , the desires and tools to coordinate ideologies internationally remained limited .
The people from Benin were sent to the IPCC by their government because the government believed that man-made climate change is a good gadget for the poor countries to get some extra money from the rich .
Houghton must know as well as I do that the climatologists from Benin have never played any important role in the creation of the IPCC reports - or climatology in general , for that matter .
Saudi Arabia has the same pro-AGW attitudes because it believes that the oil consumers will pay compensation to the Saudi Arabia for the falling profits that result from the " fight against climate change " .
At any rate , this is not primarily about the whole nations .
The climatologists in any nation have a vested interest in the AGW panic because it gives them 90 % of their funding .
They do n't directly depend on the oil money .
That 's very interesting because most of the preposterous statements about the glaciers and other things were directly imported from documents of The World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) .
Do I need to say more ?
Is Sir Houghton living in another galaxy ?
Or does he rely on the assumption that everyone will forget that all these bogus statements were justified by promotional WWF booklets , undergraduate theses , and mountaineering magazines ?
Why is it so easy for various people to lie in such a flagrant way ?
This procedure is itself unscientific .
The final word always belongs to the political groups .
Scientists do the early work at the beginning so that the report looks scientific .
The later corrections and censorship is done by the NGOs - and the final word belongs to the government .
The more important stage of the process you consider , the more political people have the power to dictate what happens .
But even if these manifest problems with the procedure were fixed and the NGOs and governments would be sent home , this idealized system of multiple reviews could only work if the people were rewarded for their search for the right answers .
In reality , they 're rewarded for producing the AGW panic : not only the politicians and NGOs are encouraged to create this panic but the scientists are encouraged as well .
They 're corrupt , so whatever the rules say on paper , is simply not reflected in the actual work .
This is the real thing that matters .
Once again , the first reports may have been somewhat more honest .
But the newer ones were getting increasingly dishonest .
There 's been no statistically significant warming in the last 15 years so it is physically impossible for the " continued warming " to justify the increasing amount of dishonesty and claimed certainty in the IPCC report .
The real explanation is that the climatological community has gotten significantly more corrupt since 1990 and the importance of the alarming statements about the AGW relatively to the scientific truth has substantially increased .
But even Houghton 's story in the previous paragraph shows the real political character of the formulations adopted by the IPCC reports .
They would always vote about adjectives - " appreciable " vs " discernible " was his example .
And each of the voters had to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest , in words of Stephen Schneider .
The actual evidence says that the man -made impact is " barely discernible " but because that would make the IPCC ineffective , and threaten its raison d'être , most people in the IPCC choose to be effective and replaced " barely discernible " not only by " appreciable " but sometimes even " dangerous " .
That 's how it works .
So even John Houghton sometimes tries to act as an honest person - but only when almost no one is listening to him and when he only tries to question the observations that he was previously dishonest .
When it really matters , his assertions are lies supported by no scientific evidence .
The statement that the IPCC has usually been " too cautious " is completely absurd .
Pretty much every inaccuracy or lie that has ever been found in the IPCC report and acknowledged by the panel showed that the IPCC presented the climate in a more hysterical , more CO2 - sensitive , more dangerous way .
In fact , I do n't know a single example when it was the other way around .
Houghton 's proposition is simply a lie .
A ludicrous one .
So the IPCC did n't refuse to recognize that there 's been no statistically significant warming for 15 years ... Another lie .
In this very article , John Houghton himself attempted to deny the fact that there 's been no statistically significant increase in global mean temperature since 1995 .
If you forgot about the point , let me recall that one sentence in this very article by Houghton says " As warming has continued at about the rate projected by the reports , each subsequent report has in general shown increasing confidence in its conclusions .
" However , there 's been no statistically significant warming since 1995 which was the year of the second IPCC report ( the years were 1990 , 1995 , 2001 , 2007 ) .
So there was no empirical basis for the reports after the second one - namely the third and the fourth one - to get " shriller " or more " certain " than the second one .
The very sentence " as warming has continued ... " is a denial of the lack of a statistical warming in the last 15 years .
Houghton contradicts himself .
By the way , if you want to see how brutal the denial by the AGW advocates about the lack of a statistically significant warming since 1995 continues to be , look e.g. at Deltoid .
These people are completely devastated by the fact that Phil Jones had to admit that there was no statistically significant warming for 15 years .
It 's not just an inconvenient truth : it 's a complete shock , a gigantic blasphemy that attacks the deepest religious instincts of these people .
The denial of the lack of recent warming has always been one of the main pillars of the AGW cult .
They 're doing everything they can - permutations of words , hiding their heads into the sand , and so on - to regain their belief that Phil Jones could have never admitted that .
John Houghton is doing the same thing .
While he has to admit that there 's been no statistically significant warming since 1995 whenever the discussion focuses on this point , as soon as no one is watching him , he returns back to the lies about a " continued warming " that justifies the " increasing certainty " and hysteria of the IPCC reports .
Because it 's important for the likes of Houghton to say the truth about the important questions and because they are clearly unwilling to say the truth unless they 're under pressure , it 's extremely important to keep dishonest people such as John Houghton under constant pressure .
They 're not defending their integrity because it does n't exist and one can't defend something that does n't exist .
To say it concisely , " nothing " is indefensible .
Comments about powerful lobbies have been debunked hundreds of times .
The funding for the groups that are defined by their support for the AGW alarm beats the funding for the AGW skeptics by a factor of more than 3,000 .
The discrimination of the sane and honest people by the insane and dishonest ones is so huge that it allows a crappy railway engineer and porn writer to stay at the top of the U.N. climate panel even now - when everyone knows that he helped to make his panel more fraudulent than ever before .
This railway engineer is politically more powerful within climatology than the likes of Richard Lindzen .
The situation in the climate science continues to be completely insane .
The only reason why these stunning imbalances of the power and funding are n't able to convince the scientists and the public about the threat coming from the AGW is that the arguments in favor of such a threat are so preposterous that billions of dollars are simply not enough to pay the people to believe in them .
Sir John Houghton may call himself and his ilk " we scientists " but that wo n't change that they 're crooks who have nothing whatsoever to do with the scientific integrity .
I suspect that no one reading this website is foolish enough to fall for this scam , but I thought I 'd share my experience with it anyway .
It starts with an email from someone you know : Hello , I 'm sorry for this odd request because it might get to you too urgent but it 's due to the situation of things right now .
I 'm stuck in London , England right now , I came down here for a short vacation then i was robbed , worse of it is that bags , cash and cards and my cell phone were stolen at GUN POINT , it 's such a crazy experience for me , I need help flying back home , the authorities are not being 100 % supportive but the good thing is i still have my passport and return ticket but currently having troubles paying off the hotel bills and also getting a cab to take me to the airport .
Please i need you to loan me some money , will refund you as soon as i'm back home , i promise .
All i need is ( $ 900 USD ) but dont know how much you would be able to spare .. we will be waiting to hear back from you on how you can get the fund to me please Thank You

When newly elected Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts attacked the Democrats ’ healthcare plan during the Republican address two weeks ago , Senior White House Adviser David Axelrod said on ABC’s This Week : “ Let me note that Sen .
Brown comes from a state that has a healthcare format in his state that is similar to the one we ’re trying to enact here .
He voted for it and said he would n’t repeal it .
So we ’re just trying to give the people in America the same opportunities that the people in Massachusetts have . ”
Visibly agitated when appearing on the same program , Sen. Lindsey Graham said of Axelrod ’s comments : “ The American people are getting tired of this crap .
No way in the world is what they did in Massachusetts like what we ’re about to do in Washington .
To suggest that Scott Brown is basically campaigning against the bill in Washington that is like the one in Massachusetts is complete spin . ”
Americans are indeed tired of lying politicians , but the only crap being put forth here is by Graham .
And it ’s not just Axelrod who is pointing out the similarities between the Democrats ’ healthcare plan and Mitt Romney ’s Republican model — everyone is .
Let ’s start with the liberals .
The popular blog Think Progress notes : “ Both plans require people to purchase coverage , and both provide affordability credits to those who ca n’t afford insurance .
Both create insurance exchanges , both establish minimum creditable coverage standards for insurers , and both require employers to contribute towards reform . ”
Making similar observations from a conservative perspective , The American Spectator ‘s Philip Klein writes : “ If Obamacare passes , Romney will be left telling angry primary voters that the only real difference between the two plans is that he implemented his policies at the state level , while Obama did it through the federal government .
It ’s sort of like saying , ‘ As governor , I raised state income taxes , but the thought of raising federal income taxes — that ’s an outrage ! ' ”
Hell , even neoconservatives can see the similarities , or as the headline read at former Bush speechwriter David Frum ’s blog , FrumForum.com : “ Romneycare Sure Looks Like Obamacare . ”
So how can Graham claim that Romneycare is not anything like Obamacare , while so many from across the political spectrum are claiming just the opposite ?
Graham ’s display of anger and ignorance on this issue says more about the Republican Party than healthcare .
A GOP that assails Obama ’s foreign policy when it ’s not much different from Bush ’s , or criticizes Obama ’s growth of government while pretending Bush did n’t do the same , or attacks the Democrats ’ healthcare plan while defending a similar Republican plan , reveals a party that revels in partisanship but lacks serious , conservative principles .
Consider this :
One of the greatest fears of conservatives continues to be the government takeover of healthcare .
On the surface , Graham ’s anger is even being perceived as an example of the deep partisan divide in the healthcare debate .
Yet notes The Boston Globe of the supposedly conservative Romney , whose healthcare plan Graham defends : “ Romney demonstrates a greater confidence than many prominent Republicans in government ’s ability to solve big problems .
Even though he is critical of the Democrats ’ healthcare plan , he says his experience adjusting the Massachusetts system has led him to share their goal of universal coverage and the belief that only government can expand the number of Americans who are insured . ”
While today Republicans rightly oppose Obama ’s version of government healthcare , who ’s to say that a President John McCain would not be reaching across the aisle to implement his own version , an idea the allegedly more conservative Romney has already embraced ?
When Graham said that Americans are “ tired of this crap , ” he was bitterly defending the integrity of state - run healthcare in Massachusetts , a big government program that Tea Party hero Scott Brown and talk radio favorite Mitt Romney also proudly defend as their own .
If the Tea Partiers are to be believed , conservatives are hungry for a budget - cutting , government - slashing , Constitution - enforcing leader in the mold of Barry Goldwater .
But where are such leaders ?
When you look beneath their thin , partisan veneers , most of today ’s Republican leadership is n’t substantially different from that of the Democratic Party , whether in the mold of “ moderates ” like Lindsey Graham or “ conservatives ” like Scott Brown and Mitt Romney .
Would anyone really be surprised if a future President Romney teamed up with GOP Sens.
Graham and Brown to implement their own national healthcare plan ?
And when Republicans eventually regain power , will anyone be surprised when they offer up the same old big government crap they pretend to oppose today ?

In the muck of the deep Mediterranean seafloor , scientists have found the first multicellular animals capable of surviving in an entirely oxygen - free environment .
Some types of bacteria and other single - celled organisms can live without oxygen , but nothing as complex had been found as these three species of Loricifera , a group of marine - sediment dwellers who inhabit one of Earth 's most extreme and little - known environments .
" The discovery of these life forms opens new perspectives for the study of metazoan life in habitats lacking molecular oxygen , " wrote researchers led by Roberto Danovaro , a marine biologist at Italy 's Polytechnic University of Marche , in a study published April 6 in BMC Biology .
Like other Loricifera , the new species are sub- millimeter–long , Lovecraftian tangles of tentacle and shell , with their closest taxonomical relatives found among mud dragons and penis worms .
The new species , however , do n't have the mitochondria found in almost every other animal cell , converting oxygen and nutrients into chemical energy .
Even the few parasite species once thought to be mitochondria - free seem to have had them at some point in history , and possess mitochondrial remnants that perform the same essential functions .
Instead the new Loricifera species have structures called hydrogenosomes , which are found in some single - celled organisms and require no oxygen to produce chemical energy .
The evolutionary history of these creatures is not known , but they live in an environment reminiscent of Earth 's oceans some 600 million years ago , before the deep seas were oxygenated and large animals evolved , wrote Comenius University ( Slovakia ) biochemist Marek Mentel and Düsseldorf University ( Germany ) biologist William Martin in an accompanying commentary .
These " fascinating animals " provide a " glimpse of what a good part of Earth 's past ecology might have been like , " they wrote .

Scarcely a day goes by anymore without some cocksure Israeli cabinet member or loudmouthed American " diplomat " sounding the alarm that Iran is covertly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
We hear ominous warnings that the Western world will suddenly be at risk of complete annihilation by those crazy Ayatollahs , should they succeed in their quest to develop the bomb .
" No one will be safe ! " they cry , " Because , in addition to being hell - bent on incinerating Israel in a nuclear holocaust , those lunatic Iranians might even launch nuclear strikes against other Western countries !
We have to crush and kill the Iranians right now , before they finish building their bombs — even if that means making the United States the single most despised country in the world . "
What is extremely interesting , however , is that none of the pundits , Knesset members , presidents , congressman , or foreign lobbyists ever bother to tell us how they know that Iran is trying to build a bomb in the first place .
They do n’t bother to do this , quite frankly , because there is absolutely no evidence that the Iranians are trying to build nuclear weapons .
The International Atomic Energy Commission , which is charged with monitoring Iran ’s nuclear activities ( and to which the Iranians voluntarily submit , unlike the Israelis ) , has adduced not one shred of evidence that Iran has diverted any uranium for any non-civilian purposes .
Not one of the 16 American intelligence agencies has adduced any evidence whatsoever that the Iranians have restarted their nuclear weapon program after having voluntarily halted it in 2003 .
Not a single person in the whole world has adduced any evidence that the Iranians have acquired the technological know - how to be able to build a nuclear weapon , and some prominent people even doubt that they could ever acquire the know - how , even if they wanted to .
The Road to 9/11 : Weal ...
Scott , Peter Dale Best Price : $ 4.42 Buy New $ 19.52 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
In other words , the members of the political class in the United States and Israel once again feel free to make fantastic and terrifying claims about a Middle Eastern government in order to convince us of the need to invade and kill more people who have not attacked us .
This time , however , the political class has n’t even given us the courtesy of manufacturing a false trail of evidence in order to convince us of their claims .
The political classes ’ contempt for the American and Israeli citizenry is apparently so overweening this time around that they have n’t even deigned to cook up a few juicy lies about , say , aluminum tubes , to substantiate their allegations of Iran ’s intention to develop and use nuclear weapons .
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
The political class in America has apparently learned its lesson from the reign of George II when it comes to fabricating evidence to induce needless wars .
Serving up false evidence can get a politician into trouble if it looks like he is intentionally trying to mislead the public into dying and killing for pointless or idiotic reasons .
Given this , why risk fabricating evidence if you do n’t have to ?
If your electorate is stupid or gullible enough to believe anything you , a lying politician , say , why not simply omit evidence altogether ?
Far better is to simply make fantastic and unsubstantiated claims today , and , when those claims inevitably get exposed as utterly false at some point in the future , simply assert that " everyone " thought they were true .
The American public is not asking for any evidence of Iranian ambitions to produce nuclear weapons , so why go out of your way to supply it to them ?
Without a trail of traceable lies and false evidence there is no way to indict any specific politician .
In fact , the politicians involved in this sort of underhanded manipulation can use the exposure of the truth to their advantage as well .
For , once exposed , they can wring their hands and publicly lament that " everyone " was misled so badly .
" Woe is us ! " they will cry out , " We were all misled !
This just proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we need to spend more tax money on intelligence gathering to avoid this kind of mistake in the future "
However , do n’t expect them to explain how " everyone " got the erroneous idea into their heads in the first place , and do n’t expect them to use the opportunity to end the pointless and murderous war they have already started .
Most of all , do n’t expect them to apologize for all the dead American soldiers and foreign civilians that their war will produce .
The emergence of this form of evidence - free war rationalization is an ominous sign , because politicians only pull this chicanery if they think they can get away with it .
In any sane and reasonable nation , politicians know that there must be compelling and explicit reasons for people to send their children abroad in order to kill and die .
Politicians in reasonable nations who are contemplating blowing up lives , fortunes and foreign people feel obligated to provide evidence to their own people that they must sacrifice and suffer for some good reason .
That the current gaggle of politicians in Washington is providing no such evidence while still threatening to attack Iran , means that politicians believe that the American people are gullible , stupid or indifferent almost to the point of insanity .
And it looks as though they are right .
To not demand evidence of grave , imminent and real harm before going off to kill and die means that American soldiers are blindingly obedient to the point of being without conscience and without brains .
To have no moral objection in invading a foreign nation that has never attacked you and has no intention of attacking you , on the basis of no evidence whatsoever , is not only morally reprehensible beyond comprehension , but a sign that the most Americans are in fact just as stupid and gullible as the politicians are hoping .
I would n’t hold my breath for any evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons in order to justify a new war in the Middle East .
The lesson ’s been learned : faked evidence will only get you into trouble , and real evidence …well , there is n’t any .

" I do n't understand how something like this could have happened , " said an inconsolable Vanessa Paulson , mother of the young college freshman who was found naked , severely hung over , and a member of Delta Tau Theta early Tuesday morning .
" Steven had such a bright future ahead of him .
He did n't deserve this .
Nobody deserves this . "
While 12 freshman suffered the same unspeakable fate , some , like Brian Hinkle , who drowned to death during the late - night hazing , managed to escape with their dignity intact .

A hacker named Kirllos has a rare deal for anyone who wants to spam , steal or scam on Facebook : an unprecedented number of user accounts offered at rock - bottom prices .
Researchers at VeriSign 's iDefense group recently spotted Kirllos selling Facebook user names and passwords in an underground hacker forum , but what really caught their attention was the volume of credentials he had for sale : 1.5 million accounts .
IDefense does n't know if Kirllos ' accounts are legitimate , and Facebook did n't respond to messages Thursday seeking comment .
If they are legitimate , he has the account information of about one in every 300 Facebook users .
His asking price varies from US $ 25 to $ 45 per 1,000 accounts , depending on the number of contacts each user has .
To date , Kirllos seems to have sold close to 700,000 accounts , according to VeriSign Director of Cyber Intelligence Rick Howard .
Hackers have been selling stolen social - networking credentials for a while -- VeriSign has seen a brisk trade in names and passwords for Russia 's VKontakte , for example .
But now the trend is to go after global targets such as Facebook , Howard said .
Facebook has more than 400 million users worldwide , many of whom fall victim to scams each day .
In one such scam , criminals send out messages from a compromised account , telling friends that the account 's owner is trapped in a foreign country and needs money to get home .
In another , they send Web links that lead to malicious software , telling friends that it's a hilarious or sensationalistic video .
" People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link , " said Randy Abrams , director of technical education with security vendor Eset .
Once the malware gets installed , criminals can steal more passwords , break into bank accounts , or simply use the computers to send spam or launch distributed denial of service attacks .
" There 's just a plethora of things that people can do if they can trick people into installing their software , " he said .
Kirllos ' Facebook prices are extremely cheap compared to what others are charging .
In its most recent Internet Security Threat Report , Symantec found that e-mail usernames and passwords typically went for between $ 1 to $ 20 per account -- Kirllos wants as little as $ 0.025 per Facebook account .
More coveted credit card or bank account details can go for much more , ranging between $ 0.85 to $ 30 for credit card numbers to $ 15 to $ 850 for top - quality online bank accounts .
I ’ll keep writing about the case against Tyler Sanchez until someone in Douglas County speaks out about People ’s Exhibit # 1 .
Sanchez , 19 , will face trial for a break - in and sexual assault that common sense and a motherlode of evidence suggest he did n’t commit .
The system failed him when Parker police hauled him in last summer , ostensibly related to a string of burglaries in the Stonegate neighborhood .
It failed him again when — ignoring signs that he is hearing - impaired and mentally disabled — sheriff ’s deputies turned the questioning into a 17 - hour interrogation about the unsolved assault .
An 8 - year - old reported being fondled by an intruder who climbed through a second - story window of her family ’s home in the housing tract a week earlier .
It kept failing him when prosecutors continued pressing charges despite serious holes in the case described by Judge Susanna Meissner - Cutler as “ contradictions , ” “ inconsistencies ” and “ speculations . ”
Among those is the fact that the thin redhead looks nothing like the older , bigger , brown - haired intruder described by the victim .
Oh , and that DA Carol Chambers asserts that nothing is proved by the fact that DNA analysis of the girl ’s panties — the key physical evidence — shows the profiles of two men , neither of them Sanchez .
She also disputes that he is cognitively delayed .
The system further failed him Wednesday , when the judge ruled he must face trial based solely on a single piece of highly questionable evidence .
People ’s Exhibit # 1 is an 11 - sentence statement Sanchez wrote after detectives broke him down 37 hours after his arrest .
Sentence by sentence , it parrots the detectives , echoing verbatim details they admit they repeatedly fed him during their interrogation .
“ First when I got off work from a bad night I decide to go chill out and drive around in my car for a little while , ” it starts .
“ Then as I was driving I see this house where that I can get to the second story window , ” the statement continues .
“ Once I got into the window of the house I could barely see cause it was dark and all .
So I was looking around trying to find stuff then all of a sudden when I was feeling things all over the room trying to feel for stuff I felt something move ( and ) all of a sudden it was a little girl that started screaming so I quickly ran ( and ) jumped out of the window , ” it reads .
“ Last , I went to my car ( and ) quickly went home .
And I want to say that I am sorry for everything ( and ) it will never happen again . ”
It ’s hard to imagine why a man would admit to something he did n’t do .
Unless , of course , he ’s disabled , confused and exhausted .
“ I ’m tired , ” “ I ’m too tired , ” Sanchez — who was alone without his parents or a lawyer — told his interrogators .
“ I ca n’t speak . ” “ I ca n’t even speak right now . ” “ I ca n’t think . ”
It ’s also tough to believe that police would coerce a confession .
Unless you were sitting in Douglas County ’s Courtroom B this week , listening to detectives describe how they lie to suspects during interrogations and use all kinds of “ tools ” to coerce them .
“ It ’s not the end of the world , ” Detective Mike Dixon assured Sanchez when trying to prod a so - called confession .
Chambers ’ 18th Judicial District prosecutors argue that the case is simple .
Sanchez ’s statement placed him in the girl ’s room that night .
After all , the detectives testified , confessions do n’t lie .
The judge is sending the case to trial , bound by a law that she must consider evidence presented at a preliminary hearing in the light most favorable for the People .
In the months before his trial , let it be said that we are the people and that , in our names , the light that DAs are pointing at Sanchez seems all too artificial and dim .

Study examines domestic violence
UH doctoral candidate Venus Tsui , under the supervision of Monit Cheung , the doctoral dissertation chair at the Graduate School of Social Work , is conducting a survey of male victims of domestic violence in order to better understand the issue .
“ It is definitely a challenging and tough topic , ” Tsui said .
“ Although underreported and less common , male victims of domestic violence suffer negative physical and psychological consequences which are similar to their female counterparts . ”
Tsui said the underreporting of domestic violence toward men is due to two main inhibitors : society and men themselves .
“ Related literature and extant studies reveal that men are often discriminated against by domestic violence service providers and law enforcement systems in the help - seeking process , ” Tsui said .
This and other forms of exclusion breed a stigma in men that causes them embarrassment and is often the ultimate provocation to keep the abuse to themselves , Tsui said .
“ They face the challenge of masculine identity when reporting the abuse , ” she said .
“ Socialization affects how men behave , and seeking help is often thought ( of ) as a sign of weakness . ”
Cheung ’s interest in the subject dates back to 2006 when she was a radio talk host for the Houston - Hong Kong Radio , AM 1050 and AM 1180 , during a live phone - in program .
“ In this 25 - week program , I found that very few men called in , but for those who called , eight of them expressed that they were abused – physically and / or emotionally – by their partners / wives , ” Cheung wrote in an e-mail interview .
“ I started to research more about male victims / survivors of domestic violence . ”
Similarly , Tsui ’s personal interest in the subject developed when she was living in Hong Kong and witnessed men as victims of domestic violence .
The two researchers ’ shared curiosities eventually led them to co-creating this survey .
“ With my research , I hope to identify the barriers and facilitators to help - seeking among male victims of partner abuse as well as to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies that are gender - sensitive and responsive to the unique needs of male victims , ” she said .
Both researchers recognize that the sheer secretiveness behind this issue is the very root of the problem .
“ To help male victims in need , it is important to not only encourage them to ask for help , but also dispel the myth and acknowledge their need for services in the society , ” Tsui said .
The survey , which is completely anonymous , is available both online and in paper format .
It can be found online at www.surveymonkey.com/s/KS9WG96.

On ABC 's Q&A program this month , US ambassador Jeffrey Bleich said the same goals set out by the government on cyber safety could be achieved without censorship .
Bleich said the US was willing to " share our efforts " with Australia .

On top of everything Lehman Brothers did before it collapsed in 2008 , nearly toppling the financial system , it now seems that it was aggressively massaging its books .
Of course , many colossal bankruptcies involve bad accounting .
But a new report on the Lehman collapse , released last week and described in an article in Friday ’s Times , would leave anyone dumbstruck by the firm ’s audacity  and reminded of the crying need for adult supervision of Wall Street .
The 2,200 - page report was written by Anton R. Valukas , a former federal prosecutor who was appointed by the Justice Department as an examiner for the Lehman bankruptcy case .
According to the report , Lehman engaged in transactions that let it temporarily shift assets off its books and in so doing , hide its reliance on borrowed money .
The maneuvers , which Mr. Valukas said were “ materially misleading , ” made the firm appear healthier than it was .
He wrote that Richard S. Fuld Jr. , Lehman ’s former chief executive , was “ at least grossly negligent , ” and that Lehman executives engaged in “ actionable balance sheet manipulation . ”
( Newser ) – Insurance companies say there ’s a loophole in the health care reform legislation that will allow them to keep denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions for years .
President Obama had promised that such denials would be “ banned forever ” this year .
But “ the fine print differs from the larger political message , ” one insurance lawyer tells the New York Times .
While insurers must cover preexisting conditions for any children they insure , they do n’t actually have to insure them in the first place .
Companies can also still jack up premiums for kids they deem risky .
That ’s not exactly what Democrats had in mind when they wrote the law .
“ This is outrageous , ” fumed Jay Rockefeller , calling the insurers “ deplorable . ”
The loophole will close in 2014 , when insurers will have to sell policies to anyone , but until then , “ if you have a sick kid , the individual insurance market will continue to be a scary place , ” says one health policy researcher .

Louisiana shrimpers file lawsuit over US oil spill
by Staff Writers
New Orleans , Louisiana ( AFP ) April 29 , 2010
Two Louisiana shrimpers have filed a lawsuit accusing the operators of the rig behind a Gulf of Mexico oil spill of negligence , seeking millions of dollars in damages .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court late Wednesday , alleges that " the fire , explosion and resulting oil spill was caused by the joint negligence and fault " of the defendants , a copy of the document read .
The shrimpers are seeking class - action status on behalf of " all Louisiana residents who live or work in , or derive income from , " the Louisiana coastal zone , and who have sustained losses as a result of the oil spill .
Defendants in the suit include British energy giant BP , which leased the Deepwater Horizon platform which sank last week causing the spill , rig owner Transocean , and Cameron International , the company which manufactured a key safety valve that failed to fully shut off the oil .
The plaintiffs are seeking " economic and compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial , but not less than five million dollars , " the legal minimum , the document said .
A BP executive on Thursday agreed with a US government estimate that the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico could be pumping up to 5,000 barrels a day of crude into the ocean , far more than previously thought .
The Deepwater Horizon platform sank April 22 , two days after a huge explosion that killed 11 workers , and a giant oil slick from the site threatens to pollute Louisiana 's fragile wetlands .
Among other things , the lawsuit claims that the defendants failed to operate the oil rig properly ; failed to properly inspect the rig " to assure that its equipment and personnel were fit for the intended purpose " ; acted " in a careless and negligent manner without due regard for the safety of others " ; failed to " react to danger signs " ; and employed " untrained or poorly trained employees . "
Furthermore , " the fire , explosion , sinking and resulting oil spill were caused by defective equipment , " and the defendants " knew or should have known of these defects and ... are therefore liable for them . "
Daniel Becnel , a Louisiana - based trial lawyer who filed the suit , saying that the plaintiffs " have a whistleblower on an adjoining rig saying 85 percent of the drilling pipe was not properly inspected " by the US Minerals Management Service .
" We knew that BP and Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon were n't telling the truth , " said Becnel .
According to Becnel , the suit was filed " on behalf of all class members who have been adversely affected in Louisiana -- fishers , shrimpers , oystermen and others like ... guides into the marshes . "
Becnel also alleged that the oil slick could wreak havoc on US shipping entering and leaving the Mississippi River .
Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry , who is leading the government 's response to the disaster , warned that if the well is not secured the spill could end up being one of the worst in US history .

It seems a lot of discussions have been going on lately , both in the Anarchosphere and in reddit , on the subject of voting in state elections .
Surprisingly a lot of anarchists have come out in favour of voting with various arguments on the issue .
Since I keep getting caught in these discussions , I ’ll try to explain my own reasoning on why I refuse to participate in elections , why this is not bad and counter some of the arguments for voting commonly thrown around by anarchists .
Why I refuse to vote
I used to vote black / white and I used to vote for third / small parties .
Then I wisened up .
I realized that no matter who one votes for , they end up voting for the system as a whole as well .
Our choice between the few bad options we ’re presented within a rigged game only serve to reinforce the lie that the government is simply following “ the will of the people ” .
To give a more extreme example to make the point :
If some random people suddenly asked your society to vote on whether you ’d prefer to become chattel slaves , work in a sweatshop , or become sex slave , it ’s obvious that some choice might be better than the others for you .
Some of those would be the “ lesser evil ” .
However , as a whole , all those options are worse than many other alternatives which involves neither of these three .
If you society nevertheless voted on one of these three and the majority decided that they ’d prefer to become sweatshop workers , you have just granted legitimacy to those random people to decide the options by which you ’d have to live .
The healthy option would have been to wonder why these crazy people are asking you to vote on crazy options and ignore them while you continue with your lives .
Now imagine that those random people forcefully conquered your society anyway and made you all chattel slaves .
After a while , when the people in your society have increased their power and outright military control is not enough , the conquerors get “ enlightened ” , declare a democracy and ask you to choose from one of the three options above .
Only a fool would not notice that this is a desperate ploy to defuse the situation before a revolt .
Only a fool would not notice that the choices given are not as good as what preceded the military conquest .
The difference between this theoretical example and the situation we are now is only that we ’ve already been forced into one of the worst choices by historical precedence ( i.e. the state violence that preceded and support capitalism ) and instead of outright discarding all the bad choices and laughing at the crazy people who ask us to make them , we instead vote on the slightly better choice that will naturally retain the power of those random people .
The difference is that we do not see the alternatives as clearly as would those theoretical people who started out free .
The difference is that the conquerors left a few generations pass so that we now consider our situation normal and voting an improvement .
In short , voting serves to masquerade the violent acts which preceded it and make the bad choices we ’re presented seem as better than they truly are .
The reason we should not vote is because we need to expose the farce that is representative democracy and point out that we ’re not bound by the options set by conquerors .
The more people that do this , the shakier the propaganda the state has to legitimize itself .
Once the percentage of people voting drops below 25 % , then the government starts looking a lot less like “ the will of the people ” and much more than the usurpers of power and the gendarme of the ruling elite that they truly are .
Once less than 25 % percent of people vote , I can easily argue that a government that is ignored by 3/4ths of the population has no legitimacy to govern over me and agitate that any use of force by the police or the army is an act of aggression by an external party .
But I cannot argue this as easily when the majority of people around me continue to vote and continue to think that the government , while not exactly representing themselves , represents the collective will .
And this is why it ’s especially counter - productive for anarchists to vote .
We ’re the ones who should be setting the example for fuck ’s sake .
If even we ca n’t refrain from participating in the farce , how do we expect that non-anarchists would even consider that there ’s anything horribly wrong about it ?
How does one then answer the question “ If you think elections do n’t work , then why do you participate ? ” by a non-anarchist ?
Do you tell them that they work a little instead ?
But if they “ work a little ” for an anarchist , certainly they would work a lot for a non-anarchist .
If for someone who is aiming for a stateless society , elections can be useful at times , then for someone who still believes in the state , proper participation in electioneering campaigns and putting one ’s efforts in that area , would be a worthwhile prospect .
Is Non-Voting Bad ?
Not if one considers that “ democratic ” governments do n’t work for us .
Not voting for the bad choices that I ’m presented with will not change anything about my situation .
Oh we hear talk about the greater and lesser evil and rampart fear - mongering from both sides of the puppet show , but the truth of the matter is that no matter how evil the other side is to us , they end up acting very similar in actual practise .
There ’s very very little substantial differences between parties in power at the moment , no matter their rhetoric .
And yet it seems people still listen to their rhetoric and believe it .
They still believe that labour governments will be better than “ Right - wing ” ones , or that conservative governments will be more responsible than liberal ones .
But in the end , they end up doing practically the same and often even worse .
“ Labour ” governments usually assault workers with harsher measures than their predecessors .
Conservative governments end up spending more .
Liberal democracies end up restricting more .
Communist parties end up increasing the rates of exploitation .
And yet , some anarchists still believe that voting for Labour over Tory or Barack over McCain is somehow going to make things be less bad .
But this is based on faith and nothing else .
The basic argument after the fact is always something like :
Well , so - and - so is worse than I expected but certainly he ’s not as bad as the other guy would have been .
But this is based on nothing more than personal delusions .
Both would have been just as bad as they serve primarily the same interests .
Anarchists then engage in the same self - delusion that the rest of the “ moderate left ” is , by simply bloating the failing of those they consider the greater evil and trivializing the ones from the lesser evil .
For example , all Clinton , Bush and Obama initiated wars of aggression and intensified already existing ones , covertly committed atrocities , sold their economies , destroyed labour orgs etc etc .
The idea that Gore would not have done what Bush did is silly when we see what Clinton did .
The idea that Bush would have been worse than Obama is silly when we see what Obama is doing ( i.e. look past his promises and to his actual acts ) .
So how exactly is non-voting making things worse ?
Only a personal delusion of what - might - have - been gives the conviction that it did .
But for someone like me , who stays away from the voting process altogether , they ’re all as bad as each other and I do n’t expect that any of them would have done anything less than the other if the ruling elite commanded it of them .
By far , the most common argument of this sort of course is that if we do n’t vote , we allow the Fascists to gain power .
However I ’ll counter this point in another post as I ’m already getting a bit long - winded .
Until then , just remember : Voting is bad , m’kay ?

‘ ciliwung recovery program ’ by indonesian rezza rahdian , edwin setiawan , ayu diah shanti , leonardus chrisnantyo
continuing our coverage of the 2010 skyscraper competition here is indonesian rezza rahdian , edwin setiawan , ayu diah shanti , leonardus chrisnantyo second place winning entry .
jakarta , the capital city of indonesia , was originally designed as a water city where thirteen rivers that crossed the city utilized completely as source of livelihood by the citizens .
ciliwung river as the largest river that cuts right along the center of the city is the main river that supports the citizens ’ life .
unfortunately , today the river had become disaster for the citizens , because surge of water flooded the city , and the number of slums along the riverbanks adds a new problem , namely the pollution of watershed ’s surrounding .
ciliwung recovery program ( CRP ) , a project aims to purify the ciliwung river ’s environment to its original form .
through the new system in the building , CRP is expected to be able to repair and become the sustainability generator for jakarta .
there are three main lines in the process of purifying the ciliwung river , first line is the flow of the polluted river water into the building through pipes by utilizing capillary vessel systems , into the filtrating section .
at this stage , the river water is separated from garbage , the organic garbage then used as raw materials to fertilize the soil around the river basin , while garbage - free water proceeded to the next stage or channeled back into the river .
the second line is the phase of river water purification through elimination of dangerous contaminants , and addition of various good minerals to the water , so it is safe for daily needs of CRP building occupants , which is people who previously lived in the slums along ciliwung river .
removal of riverbank dwellers into the CRP building aims to open and expand ciliwung watersheds that will be prepared to be the new open spaces for more ‘ green ’ jakarta and to secure the flood plane .
the third line is the re-processing of household waste products into water which is safe to be returned to the ciliwung river .
some of processed water are being distributed to lands around ciliwung river in two ways .
first , through capillary pipes under the ground that not only bring water , but also fertilizer produced in the first line .
capillary tubings are connected to generator towers around the damaged lands , and create a new environment that ’s usable for agriculture .
second , by spraying processed water through the skin of the building .
spraying water from height raises the humidity in the lower part of the building that triggers the growth of pioneer plants that will contribute to the creation of a new ecosystem .

Sean Hannity latest teabagging event has come to a violent halt when he pulled out at the last minute .
WLWT reported that there were some technical issues and then it would seem that Hannity blamed it on personal reasons .
Fox News commentator Sean Hannity has cancelled his appearance and broadcast at a Tea Party rally at Fifth Third Arena .
Hannity planned to tape his television show from the event , which starts at 6 p.m. at the University of Cincinnati .
Organizers of the rally said there were technical issues , but that the overriding factor for the cancellation was a personal matter that Hannity needed to attend to in New York .
WLWT was the first to report that there were issues when Hannity failed to appear at a book signing at 4:30 p.m.
Minutes later , Hannity 's bus was seen leaving the campus .
Hannity 's newscast will broadcast from New York with a guest host .
However that story is n't holding water .
The LA Times is reporting that Sean took a scolding from FOX News execs and they are making him do his show tonight from his studio .
Angry Fox News executives ordered host Sean Hannity to abandon plans to broadcast his nightly show as part of a Tea Party rally in Cincinnati on Thursday after top executives learned that he was set to headline the event , proceeds from which would benefit the local Tea Party organization .
Rally organizers had listed Hannity , who is on a book tour , as the headliner of the four - hour Tax Day event at the University of Cincinnati .
The rally , expected to draw as many as 13,000 people , was set feature speakers such as “ Liberal Facism ” author Jonah Goldberg and local Tea Party leaders .
Participants were being charged a minimum of $ 5 , with seats near Hannity ’s set going for $ 20 , according to the Cincinnati Enquirer , which reported that any profits would go to future Tea Party events .
Media Matters for America noted that Hannity ’s personal website directed supporters to a link to buy tickets for the Cincinnati rally .
But senior Fox News executives said they were not aware Hannity was being billed as the centerpiece of the event or that Tea Party organizers were charging for admission to Hannity ’s show as part of the rally .
They first learned of it Thursday morning from John Finley , Hannity 's executive producer , who was in Cincinnati to produce Hannity 's show .
Furious , top officials recalled Hannity back to New York to do his show in his regular studio .
The network plans to do an extensive post - mortem about the incident with Finley and Hannity 's staff .
“ Fox News never agreed to allow the Cincinnati Tea Party organizers to use Sean Hannity ’s television program to profit from broadcasting his show from the event , " said Bill Shine , the network ’s executive vice president of programming .
" When senior executives in New York were made aware of this , we changed our plans for tonight ’s show . ”
Before the tea party movement got going , FOX News was very excited to use their entire network to promote them because a Democratic politician was elected to the White House .
Now , they are trying to make believe that never happened .
I wonder if their legal department got involved when money was changing hands with the teabaggers ?
UPDATE : More News from FOX 19 :
A statement was released by the Vice president of Programming of FOX News , Bill Shine .
" FOX News never agreed to allow the Cincinnati Tea Party Organizers to use Sean Hannity 's television program to profit from broadcasting his show from the event .
When senior executives in New York were made aware , we changed our plans for tonight 's show . "
FOX News has confirmed that Sean Hannity 's broadcast of tonight 's show from New York City .
Yep , it 's all about the cash .
Well they still have Joe the Plumber and Bill Cunningham to entertain them ...
Poor Glenn Reynolds of Pajamas Media has been there waiting for Hannity to arrive and now can be counted as the people who were surely disappointed by Hannity 's sudden departure .

Business Week ’s Mike Dorning thinks the economy is on the mend :
While no one would claim that all the pain is past or the danger gone , the economy is growing again , jumping to a 5.6 % annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 as businesses finally restocked their inventories .
The consensus view now calls for 3 % growth this year , significantly higher than the 2.1 % estimate for 2010 that economists surveyed by Bloomberg News saw coming when Obama first moved into the Oval Office .
The U.S. manufacturing sector has expanded for eight straight months , the Business Roundtable ’s measure of CEO optimism reached its highest level since early 2006 , and in March the economy added 162,000 jobs — more than it had during any month in the past three years .
Floyd Norris of the New York Times agrees that a lot of people are being too pessimistic :
“ Go back and read what people were saying in 1982 or 1975 , ” said Robert Barbera , the chief economist of ITG .
“ Nobody was saying , ‘ Deep recession , big recovery . ’
It is quite normal to expect an abnormally weak recovery .
It is also normal for that expectation to be wrong . ” ….
In 1982 , Democrats scoffed at a surging stock market and thought a severe recession would last for a very long time ….
Change a few words ( Reagan to Obama , Democrats to Republicans , 1984 to 2012 ) and you have an accurate description of the current political climate .
Could the Republicans be as wrong now as the Democrats were then ?
There ’s a lot to this .
But just off the top of my head , here are the things that gnaw at me when I hear stuff like this :
This is a balance sheet recession , not a Fed - induced recession .
Paul Volcker caused the 1981 recession by jacking up interest rates and he ended it by lowering them .
That ’s not going to happen this time .
In fact , there wo n’t be any further stimulus from lower interest rates .
They ’re already at zero , and Ben Bernanke has made it clear that he does n’t plan to effectively lower them further by setting a higher inflation target .
Consumer debt is still way too high .
There ’s more deleveraging on the horizon , and that ’s going to make consumer - led growth difficult .
The financial sector remains fragile and there could still be another serious shock somewhere in the world .
There are strong political pressures to reduce the budget deficit .
That makes further fiscal stimulus unlikely .
Housing prices are still too high .
They ’re bound to fall further , especially given rising interest rates combined with the end of government support programs .
Our current account balance remains pretty far out of whack .
Fixing this in the short term will hinder growth , while leaving it to the long term just kicks the can down the road .
The Fed still has to unwind its balance sheet .
That has the potential to stall growth .
Oil prices are rising .
This not only causes problems of its own , but also makes # 7 worse .
Unemployment and long - term unemployment continue to look terrible .
Yes , these are lagging indicators , but still .
I do n’t expect all of this stuff to be as dire as it sounds , and overall I suspect that we are indeed going to see steady if unspectacular growth over the next few years .
But I ’m not entirely sure of that , and these are the reasons why .
Just thought I ’d share .

Media contrived “ monkey see , monkey do ” hive mentality leads Stepford Wives to cheerlead for their own enslavement
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , January 6 , 2010
In the aftermath of the aborted Christmas Day bombing , the corporate media has been busy hyping the necessity of naked body scanners , and the propaganda is habitually accompanied by a raft of quotes from obedient slaves who are prepared to undergo whatever humiliation it takes to provide them with some imaginary sense of “ security , ” but a recent Guardian poll suggests that this may be nothing more than a giant public relations hoax to hoodwink the masses into cheerleading for their own enslavement .
We see them everywhere , on every TV network , saying exactly the same thing .
Every time there is a major terrorist incident , the media endlessly replays footage of obedient Stepford Wife slaves in airports and on the streets calling for more police state measures to protect them from whatever invented boogeyman is being dangled in front of them this time around .
If we were to go by this measure , 99 per cent of people support whatever the government wants to do in the name of the war on terror .
This is of course complete baloney – the last few years have seen a massive resurgence in opposition and skepticism towards government policy on almost every political front .
However , every time you pick up a newspaper , turn on the television , or log on to the Internet , the perception being contrived is that the vast majority overwhelmingly support stifling “ security ” measures in the name of stopping terrorism , with many even lamenting that such intrusions do not go far enough .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A prime example of this can be read in today ’s Toronto Star in an article entitled Scanners a necessary evil , say travellers .
“ Travellers seem happy to be electronically disrobed if it makes flying safer , ” we are told .
The article then quotes a series of happy - clapping morons who tell the Star what it wants to hear , that people should not resist the implementation of naked body scanners in airports .
“ I ’d do anything for safety , ” said Pari Paramasivam , while waiting for a flight to India at Pearson airport ’s Terminal 1 .
“ For me , if it ’s privacy versus safety , it ’s always safety . ”
According to the Star , all six people they interviewed “ accept the need for airport full - body scanners ” .
However , the notion that the vast majority of people support airports becoming the primary peddlers of child porn is completely contradicted by a London Guardian poll which found that over 70 % opposed the body scanners , labeling them “ a pointless invasion of privacy ” .
Indeed , full body scanners would not even have stopped the Christmas Day bomber from boarding Flight 253 , according to a British MP who helped design the machines .
“ I must advise the Prime Minister – and the British public – that the scanners are not a “ silver bullet , ” said Ben Wallace , who worked on the scanners at defense research organization QinetiQ .
“ You would be mistaken to think that they would counter the new threat . ”
“ The millimetre wave technology is harmless , quick and can be deployed overtly or covertly .
But it can not detect chemicals or light plastics . ”
And yet the fact that the scanners are next to useless only leads to calls to increase our humiliation and fealty , by submitting to scanners that see inside our bodies .
The controllers routinely roll out this mass hoax in the interests of maintaining a “ monkey see , monkey do ” hive mentality , where people who would ordinarily be opposed having their naked children perved over by some fat greasy TSA agent in a back room are actually brainwashed into thinking this is normal because the other proles they see jabbering on TV say it is .
While this kind of crude propaganda works on a significant number of people , probably nearly as many still have two brain cells to rub together and are rightly repulsed at such a gross violation of privacy , but you wo n’t see them being interviewed on the evening news because the corporate media , which is owned by the same military - industrial complex making a killing as a result of the implementation of body scanners , does n’t want the rest of the zombies to awake from their Stockholm syndrome and tear down the walls of the prison planet being built around them .

VATICAN CITY ( AP ) 
The clerical sex abuse scandal is causing Pope Benedict XVI great pain , the Vatican 's No. 2 official said Thursday .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican 's secretary of state , said that like all pastors the pope has suffered greatly for the cases of sex abuse of minors by priests .
The comments were reported by the ANSA news agency during Bertone 's trip to Chile .
Bertone insisted the church has the " inner strength " necessary to keep up its mission , according to the report .
Meanwhile , the former Vatican No. 2 , Cardinal Angelo Sodano , has assumed the lead role in praising the pope for his handling of clerical sex abuse and defending him against " unjust attacks " in the media .
But the retired Vatican secretary of state is an unlikely front man in Rome 's battle for public opinion given his reported support for the Rev. Marciel Maciel , the discredited founder of the Legionaries of Christ .
Vatican investigators last month completed an investigation into the Legionaries after the order admitted that Maciel had fathered at least one child and had molested young seminarians .
The explosive revelations have called into question the very future of one of the church 's most prominent religious movements and the Maciel case now stands as one of the more egregious cases of Vatican inaction concerning priestly sexual misconduct .
Cases of abuse in church - run institutions are rocking the church across Europe , including Benedict 's native Germany , and elsewhere .
On Thursday , Norway 's Catholic Church said it has received new allegations of clergy abuse , one day after revealing that its former bishop resigned after admitting to child molestation .
The current bishop , Bernt Eidsvig , said he has received e-mails alleging new cases of abuse .
But he said the nature and seriousness of the allegations remain unclear .
Norway 's Catholic Church disclosed on Wednesday that the reason Eidsvig 's predecessor , 58 - year - old Georg Mueller , resigned in June was that he had admitted to abusing a boy about 20 years earlier , when he was a priest .
Mueller 's current whereabouts are unknown .
A spokesman for a church - affiliated hospital in Germany says Mueller moved into an apartment on the premises in December but no longer lives there .
More on Legionaries
Sodano has long been accused in news reports in U.S. Catholic publications and in a book and documentary " Vows of Silence " of having helped stall a Vatican probe into the founder , although there 's no suggestion he did so to cover up any alleged misdeeds .
In fact , Legionaries officials today — even those who worked closely with Maciel — say they were completely blind to the double life that he lived for decades .
It was only in 2006 , nine years after the allegations against Maciel first went public , that the Vatican announced that it had concluded its investigation and had disciplined the Mexican prelate .
The Vatican invited him to a " reserved life of prayer and penance " — making him a priest in name only .
Maciel died in 2008 .
Given that , it was odd that Sodano , the dean of the College of Cardinals , was selected to give a high - profile salute to the pope at the start of Easter Mass on Sunday , praising Benedict as the " unfailing rock " of the Catholic Church .
" Holy Father , on your side are the people of God , who do not allow themselves to be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment , by the trials which sometimes buffet the community of believers , " Sodano said .
Sodano followed up on Wednesday with a front - page interview in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano , in which he blamed the " unjust attacks " against the pope on people who oppose the church 's teaching on family and life — Vatican - speak for opposition to abortion and same - sex marriage .
Sodano equated the scandal that Benedict is confronting to that facing Pope Pius XII , blamed by Jews for having failed to do enough to stop the Holocaust .
While Jewish leaders immediately questioned that parallel , critics of Maciel seized on the irony of Sodano coming to Benedict 's defense .
" It must have been extremely frustrating for the Holy Father to sit through that address , while knowing that the speaker himself had intervened to thwart the Vatican 's investigation into one of the most intransigent abusers — Marcial Maciel , " said Genevieve Kineke , a former member of the Legionaries ' lay movement Regnum Christi who edits life - after - rc.com , a discussion forum for people who have left the movement .
A message left at Sodano 's home Wednesday was not returned .
Maciel founded the Legionaries in 1941 in Mexico City .
The order 's conservative view , strict loyalty to Vatican teaching and its success in enrolling recruits won the admiration of Pope John Paul II , whom Sodano served as secretary of state for nearly 15 years .
But Maciel spent the last years of his life fending off the accusations by former seminarians that he had sexually abused them — accusations which formed the basis of a book " Vows of Silence " by investigative reporter Jason Berry and the late Gerald Renner .
After years of denying the charges and questioning the motives of the accusers , the Legionaries admitted in a March 25 communique that " though it causes us consternation , we have to say that these acts did take place . "
The Legion also admitted that Maciel had fathered a daughter , and that two other brothers had come forward saying they were his children from a relationship with another woman .
Sodano had long been one of Maciel 's top supporters in Rome , having befriended the charismatic Mexican while Sodano was the Vatican 's nuncio in Chile in the 1970s , Berry has written .
The National Catholic Reporter , a U.S. Catholic newspaper , has reported that Sodano helped shut down a preliminary investigation into the abuse allegations in 1998 being carried out by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , headed by then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now pope .
There 's no indication though that he did so to cover up for Maciel .
On Wednesday , Berry published a lengthy article in the National Catholic Reporter suggesting that Sodano and other top Vatican officials received payments from Maciel .
A Vatican spokesman , the Rev. Ciro Benedettini , said he had no comment .

Theologe outet sich als schwul Peter Bürger
Ein Beitrag von David Berger entlarvt die Funktionsweise des rechten Kirchenflügels
Am Karfreitag war es in Telepolis zu lesen :
" Der amtliche römisch - katholische Umgang mit Homosexualität , der alle Erkenntnisfortschritte und Lernprozesse der Gesellschaft hartnäckig ignoriert , kommt für die Kirche einer tickenden Zeitbombe gleich . "
Die Diagnose lautete : Gerade das gewalttätige System der Homophobie sorgt für Funktionstüchtigkeit und Dienstbarkeit von schwulen Theologen im röm . - kath .
Raum .
Die hier erwartete nächste Enthüllungswelle läuft früher an als gedacht .
Die extremistische Hetzseite kreuz.net sowie die jüngsten Ausfälle des Essener Bischofs Overbeck und des ranghohen Kardinals Bertone machen es möglich .
David Berger , habilitierter
Theologe mit einer beachtlichen Karriere im rechtskatholischen Intellektuellenmilieu der Ratzinger - Freunde , hat sich heute in einem couragierten Beitrag für die Frankfurter Rundschau als homosexuell geoutet .
Anschaulich beschreibt Berger aufgrund der eigenen Erfahrungen , wie das System der Unterdrückung funktioniert .
Geflissentlich wird die Homosexualität im Raum der Kirche übersehen , solange die betreffenden Personen die eigene Identität verbergen und angepasst bleiben .
Bei ersten Abweichungen deutet man diskret an , dass man durchaus vom wunden Punkt in der Persönlichkeit des Gegenübers weiß .
Durch solche erpresserischen Methoden werden Schwule im Raum der Kirche dahin getrieben , sich selbst zu verraten und im Zuge eines Kompensations - Konservatismus der herrschenden Linie besonders bereitwillig Folge zu leisten .
Dem Aussteiger David Berger kann man für seine Offenheit nur danken , denn er eröffnet für viele andere Schwule in der Römischen Kirche Perspektiven der Befreiung .
Oftmals laufen die Unterdrückungsmechanismen auch unbewusst ab .
Theologiestudenten oder Priester ahnen , dass in ihnen eine Orientierung zum gleichgeschlechtlichen Eros schlummert .
Solange dies unter dem Vorzeichen von Angst geschieht , fühlen sie sich wertlos und sündig .
Die reine Ratzinger - Lehre bekräftigt sie darin : Schon die bloße Neigung ist ihr zufolge ein objektiver Persönlichkeitsdefekt .
Und so geschieht es , dass Menschen , denen im Raum der Kirche niemand Mut macht , den eigenen Lebensreichtum zu entdecken und als Geschenk anzunehmen , sich verkaufen .
Sie stützen dann ein reaktionäres Klerikalgebäude , das mit der Botschaft des Jesus von Nazareth schon lange nichts mehr gemeinsam hat .
Zu den dreisten Lügen der antihomosexuellen Hetzer im Raum der Kirche gehört zum Beispiel die Behauptung des Kölner Kardinals Joachim Meisner , er achte als Bischof gewissenhaft darauf , dass es unter seiner Führung keine schwulen Priesteramtskandidaten und Priester gibt .
Hier sagt der Kirchenfürst nicht die Wahrheit .
Der Verfasser dieses Eintrages weiß es aus eigener Erfahrung , denn er hat in den 1980er Jahren zusammen mit den Westberliner Priesteramtskandidaten des damaligen DDR - Bischofs Joachim Meisner in Paderborn studiert .
Würden gemäß eines bald nach der Wahl von Papst Benedikt XVI .
erlassenes Vatikanschreibens alle Homosexuellen vom Priesterdienst ausgeschlossen , stünden augenblicklich unzählige Gemeinden ohne Seelsorger da .
Die Bischöfe und Personalreferenten der Diözesen wissen das ganz genau .
Möglich wird ein Neuaufbruch zur Wahrhaftigkeit wohl nur , wenn noch mehr Gläubige sich mit ihren schwulen Amtsträgern solidarisieren und dadurch das Erpressungsinstrumentarium einiger Hierarchen ad absurdum führen .
Two GOP congressmen say most Republicans on the Hill now believe the Iraq war was a mistake , and “ more than half the Republican caucus ” believes the way in which the US entered the Afghanistan war was also a mistake .
Reps .
Tom McClintock ( R - CA ) and Dana Rohrbacher ( R - CA ) made the comments at a discussion panel at the Cato Institute on Thursday .
Going into Iraq “ was a mistake because I thought we had to finish the job in Afghanistan , ” Rohrbacher told the panel , echoing a popular Democratic talking point at the time .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In retrospect , almost all of us think that was a horrible mistake , ” Rohrbacher said .
“ Now that we know that it cost a trillion dollars , and all of these years , and all of these lives , and all of this blood … all I can say is everyone I know thinks it was a mistake to go in now . ”
Asked by panel moderator Grover Norquist what percentage of Republican congressmen agree with that view , McClintock said , “ I think everyone [ in Congress ] would agree that Iraq was a mistake . ”
McClintock added that he believed the Bush administration also made a mistake in the way it entered the Afghanistan war .
“ I think virtually everyone would agree going into Afghanistan the way we did was a mistake , ” he said .
It ’s worthwhile noting that McClintock and Rohrbacher were speaking at the Cato Institute , a libertarian - leaning conservative think tank .
Libertarians have famously stood apart from their conservative brethren in opposing the Iraq war and other foreign wars .
The Republicans ’ remarks came a day before former national security adviser and state secretary Condoleezza Rice voiced regret at the bloody aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
But she said the Bush administration had in the end “ got it right ” in the country .

Rice was unrepentant about the ouster of Saddam Hussein .
“ I would many times over liberate Iraq again from Saddam Hussein .
I think he ’s a danger to the Middle East , ” she said in a speech at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , when asked what she thought she had got wrong .
“ We should have worked with the tribes .
We should have worked with the provinces .
We should have smaller projects than the large ones that we had . ”
Nonetheless , she insisted , the administration had “ finally got it right ” in 2006 , the year before a new “ surge ” strategy was employed to bring down levels of unrest .

While the US was focused on the health care drama over the weekend , over across the pond events are rapidly deteriorating in euro land .
For this week ’s Outside the Box I offer two columns , one from the Financial Times and another from the London Telegraph .
Both describe the problems that the eurozone faces .
It is not pretty .
I was sent this note from a Steve Stough who translated this from a German TV news show ’
It is a nice set - up for the two short columns .
I was reading an interview with Germany ’s most - quoted economist and then , all of a sudden , his face pops up on a TV show ( a panel discussion on Germany ’s version of Fox Business News ) at the same time , so I paid close attention .
Hans - Werner
Sinn ’s remarks are apparently listened to as closely as are the Federal Reserve Chairman ’s remarks in the US .
He said :
The Greek drama will have a ‘ frightful ’ ( ‘ schreklich ’ ) ending no matter which course of action is taken .
The objective is to avoid having a Greek default trigger another banking crisis across the EU .
The EU member states are too financially fragile to take on any flaky Greek debt .
The actual Greek deficit is running at 16 % of GDP , not 12 % as previously reported .
Greece is in a deepening retraction , not a recovery , as previously claimed .
[ Germany ’s social security , welfare , unemployment , and health care entitlement programs are all running cash - negative or soon will be , but that is another subject entirely .
Angela Merkel has a committee established to work on tax reform , meaning tax rate reductions – Steve ] .
entitlement programs are all running cash - negative or soon will be , but that is another subject entirely .
Angela Merkel has a committee established to work on tax reform , meaning tax rate reductions – Steve ] .
There are three bad alternatives .
He recommends # 3 ( effectively , default ) : A Franco - German bailout .
Dr. Sinn believes this is impractical and the worst of the three alternatives because the amounts required for an effective bailout are so large that it would trigger a jump in yields on French and German sovereign debt which would result in a Euro - wide financial crisis .
In addition , Angela Merkel said ‘ no , ’ and so did Guido Westerwelle ( her coalition partner and foreign minister ) .
IMF loans .
Dr. Sinn believes that this would accelerate the Greek economic contraction with a dramatic deflation of wages and prices , which could lead to civil war , revolution and a political destabilization of the area .
Exit the Euro zone , revive the Drachma , re-denominate the sovereign bonds in Drachma , let the Drachma collapse , and rebuild after the collapse , largely on tourist remittances Assuming a small amount of domestic ( internal ) default , this would be the least - painful to the Greek populace , but German banks and investors would lose approximately $ 38 Bn in bond investments +/- what can be recovered after the Greek economy recovers .
Eventually , Greece would be allowed to re-join the EU .
Formation of an EU monetary fund is out of the question , he believes , because it requires treaty modifications that might take many years to pass .
As an aside , he said that if German tax rates are not lowered , that Germany will slide back into recession .
Steve Stough
As a quick aside , I know I said two weeks ago that I would do an assessment of the affect of taxes on the US economy .
I decided to hold off until we can see what the health care taxes rally look like , rather than guessing .
I will get to it , as I am quite curious as to the total level of the tax increases .
Now , to this week ’s OTB .

Outside the Box
Has Germany just killed the dream of a European superstate ?
By Ambrose Evans - Pritchard from the Telegraph
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has little hope of selling a bail - out of Greece to German voters
German and Dutch leaders have concluded in the nick of time that they cannot defy the will of their sovereign parliaments by propping up a country that lied about its deficits , or risk court defeats by breaching the no-bail - out clause in Article 125 of the EU Treaties .
Chancellor Angela Merkel has halted at the Rubicon .
So has Dutch premier Jan Peter Balkenende , as well he might in charge of a broken government facing elections in a country where far - right leader Geert Wilders is the second political force , and where the Tweede Kamer has categorically blocked loans for Greece .
The failure of EU leaders to cobble together a plausible bail - out – if that is what occurs at this week ’s Brussels summit – is a ‘ game - changer ’ in market parlance .
Eurogroup chair Jean - Claude Juncker said last month that such an outcome would shatter the credibility of monetary union .
It certainly shatters many assumptions .
There will be no inevitable move to fiscal federalism ; no EU treasury or economic government ; no debt union .
It is Stalingrad for the federalist camp and the institutions of the permanent EU government .
I remember hearing Joschka Fischer , then German Vice - Chancellor , telling Euro - MPs a decade ago that EMU was “ a quantum leap … creating an inexorable federal logic ” .
Such views were in vogue then .
Any euro crisis would force Europe to create the necessary machinery to make it work , acting as a catalyst for full - fledged union .
Yet the moment of truth has come .
There is no quantum leap .
We have a Merkel pirouette .
Paris is watching nervously .
As Le Monde put it last week , “ behind the question of aid to Greece is a France - Germany match that pitches two conceptions of Europe against each other . ”
The game is not going well for ‘ Les Bleus ’ .
The whole point of the euro for the Quai D’Orsay was to lock Germany into economic fusion .
Instead we have fission .
EU leaders may yet rustle up a rescue package that keeps the IMF at bay , but alliances are shifting fast .
Even Italy has slipped into the pro-IMF camp , knowing that rescue costs can be shifted on to the US , Japan , Britain , Russia , China , and the Saudis , lessening the burden for Rome .
Besides , too much has been said over the last week that can not be unsaid .
Mrs Merkel ’s speech to the Bundestag was epochal , a defiant warning that henceforth Germany would pursue the German national interest in EU affairs , capped by her call for treaty changes to allow the expulsion of fiscal sinners from Euroland .
Nothing seems so permanent about the euro any more .
Days later , Thilo Sarrazin from the Bundesbank blurted out that if Greece cannot pay its bills “ it should do what every debtor has to do and file for insolvency .
This would be a suitably frightening example for every other potentially unsound state , ” he said , pointedly excluding France from the list of sound countries .
Dr Sarrazin should be locked up in a Frankfurt Sanatorium .
It was such flippancy that led to the Lehman disaster , requiring state rescues of half the world ’s financial system .
A Greek default would alone be twice the size of the combined defaults by Argentina and Russia .
Contagion across Club Med would instantly set off a second banking crisis .
Some suspect that ultra-hawks in Germany want to bring the EMU crisis to a head , deeming delay to be the greater danger .
How else to interpret last week ’s speech by Jürgen Stark , Germany ’s man at the European Central Bank , calling for tightening to head off inflation .
This is alarming .
Core inflation in Euroland was 0.9 pc in February , the lowest since the data series began .
It is certain to fall further as the doubling of oil prices fades from the base effect .
M3 money has been contracting for a year .
Business credit is shrinking at a 2.7 pc rate .
So , it is not enough for the EU to impose a fiscal squeeze of 10 pc of GDP on Greece , 8 pc on Spain , and 6 pc on Portugal , and 5 pc on France over three years , we need a dose of 1930s monetary policy as well to make sure life is Hell for everybody .
Be that as it may , Greece ’s George Papandreou says his country is in the worst of both worlds , suffering IMF - style austerity without receiving IMF money – which comes cheap at around 3.25 pc .
So why allow his country to be used as a “ guinea pig ” – as he put it – by EU factions pursuing conflicting agendas ?
The IMF option has its limits too .
The maximum ever lent by the Fund is 12 times quota , or € 15bn for Greece , not enough to nurse the country through to June .
The standard IMF cure of devaluation is blocked by euro membership .
So Greece will have to sweat it out with a public debt spiralling to 135 pc of GDP next year , stuck in slump with no exit route .
The deeper truth that few care to face is that under the current EMU structure Berlin will have to do for Greece and Club Med what it has done for East Germany , pay vast subsidies for decades .
Events of the last week have made it clear that no such money will ever be forthcoming .
Let me be clear .
I do not blame Greece , Ireland , Italy , or Spain for what has happened .
No central bank could have tried more heroically than the Banco d’España to counter the effects of negative real interest rates , but the macro- policy error of monetary union washed over its efforts .
Nor do I blame Germany , which generously agreed to give up the D - Mark to keep the political peace .
It was the price that France demanded in exchange for tolerating reunification after the Berlin Wall came down .
I blame the EU elites that charged ahead with this project for the wrong reasons – some cynically , mostly out of Hegelian absolutism – ignoring the economic anthropology of Europe and the rules of basic common sense .
They must answer for a depression .
Gaps in the eurozone ‘ football league ’
By Wolfgang Münchau from the Financial Times
At last we are heading towards a resolution , albeit a bad one .
After weeks of pledges of political and financial support , Angela Merkel appears ready to send Greece crawling to the International Monetary Fund .
Germany cites legal reasons for its position .
In past rulings , its constitutional court has interpreted the stability clauses in European law in the strictest possible sense .
These rulings have left a deep impression among government officials .
It is hard to say whether this argument is for real or is just an excuse not to sanction a bail - out that would be politically unpopular .
It is probably a combination of the two .
I have heard suggestions that a deal may still be possible at this week ’s European summit , but only if everybody were to agree to Germany ’s gruesome agenda to reform the stability pact .
That would have to include stricter rules and the dreaded exit clause , under which a country could be forced to leave the eurozone against its will .
I am not holding my breath .
But either outcome will mark the beginning of the end of Europe ’s economic and monetary union as we know it .
This is the true historical significance of Ms Merkel ’s decision .
While Greece faces the most acute difficulties , it is not the only member in trouble .
There are at least four – Greece , Spain , Portugal and Ireland – that are probably not in a position to maintain a monetary union with Germany under current policies indefinitely .
There may be several more , where the problems are not yet quite so evident .
In the presence of extreme current account imbalances and a lack of bail - out or fiscal redistribution mechanisms , a monetary union among such a diverse group of countries is probably not sustainable .
In a column several weeks ago I put forward three conditions necessary for the eurozone to survive in the long run : a crisis resolution mechanism , a procedure to deal with internal imbalances , and a common banking supervisor .
Since then , things have been moving in the wrong direction on all three counts .
For a start , we have come from a situation in which the “ no bail - out ” clause of the Maastricht treaty , having been almost universally disbelieved for 10 years , is suddenly 100 per cent credible .
The minute the IMF marches into Greece , all ambiguity will end .
The debate on imbalances is also regressing .
It would be unreasonable to ask Germany to raise wages or cut exports , but there is a legitimate complaint about Germany ’s lack of domestic demand .
Berlin should accept it needs to develop a strategy .
But the opposite is happening .
Rainer Brüderle , economics minister , said last week there was nothing the government could do about demand because consumption was a decision by private individuals .
A senior Bundesbank official even compared the eurozone to a football league , in which Germany proudly held the number one slot .
The long - term direction of fiscal policy is even more alarming , as the gap between Germany and the others will widen .
On banking supervision , the main reason for a common European system is macroeconomic .
In a monetary union , imbalances would matter a lot less if the banking system were truly anchored at the level of the union , not the member state .
As banks can obtain liquidity from the European Central Bank , even extreme and persistent current account deficits should not matter in good times .
But they matter in times of crisis .
For as long as bank failures remain a national liability , persistent imbalances could ultimately lead to a national insolvency .
If the banking sector were genuinely European , imbalances would still be an important metric of relative competitiveness but we would need to worry a lot less , just as we do not worry about the current account deficit of a city relative to its state .
The lack of a bail - out system , of an agenda to reduce imbalances and of a common banking system are realities that investors should take into account when making long - term decisions , as should policy - makers when they make important choices for citizens .
The reality is that the eurozone , as it works today , is not a monetary union but a souped - up fixed exchange rate system .
In the past , global investors have placed a lot of trust in European politicians .
They believed Peer Steinbrück , the former German finance minister , in February 2009 when he ended a speculative attack on Ireland , Greece and others with a simple statement of support .
They also believed , as I did myself , that political leaders would ultimately do the right thing to save the system , having first explored all the alternatives .
As I follow the political debate in Berlin , I am no longer certain that is the case .
Ms Merkel is not a politician driven by a strong historical destiny , unlike Helmut Kohl , her predecessor but one as chancellor .
However real the constitutional problems may be , I suspect Mr Kohl would never have hidden behind a technical or legal argument on such a crucial issue .
Europe ’s current generation of leaders lacks this accident - avoiding instinct .
So when Ms Merkel and her colleagues in the European Council see the iceberg coming , they will tend to rush not to the helm but to the nearest constitutional judge .
I am not predicting a catastrophe .
I am merely pointing out that the present policy choices are inconsistent with the survival of the eurozone in its current form .

The broadest measure of unemployment is the Civilian Employment - Population Ratio , which is exactly what it sounds like : the ratio of employed civilians to the total population .
It stands right around 59 % , which is the lowest its been since the early 80s .
Fortunately , the recent end of layoffs seems to have staunched the fall .
But even if the economy rebounds , do n't expect this measure to jump back to old highs .
For one thing , the recovery could very well be jobless .
But beyond that , demographics wo n't be very favorable here as more and more Americans retire , placing a greater strain on those who are working .
The one way this wo n't be true if is we continue to keep bringing in immigrants like we have .

Solar panels .
French energy giant EDF is building the world 's biggest photovoltaic solar power plant at an abandoned NATO air base and plans to have it open by 2012 , a spokesman said Tuesday .
French energy giant EDF is building the world 's biggest photovoltaic solar power plant at an abandoned NATO air base and plans to have it open by 2012 , a spokesman said Tuesday .
Jean - Marc Dall ' Aglio , of EDF 's green energy subsidiary EDF - EN , said the 415 hectare ( 1,025 acre ) site in Toul - Rosieres , near the eastern city of Metz , would produce 143 megawatts , enough for a town of 62,000 people .
The current largest photovoltaic plant is at Olmedilla in Spain , producing 60 megawatts .
Several much larger plants are under construction in the United States and Australia and might beat the French contender .
Toul - Rosieres will quadruple nuclear - dependent France 's photovoltaic power output , but still leave it far behind sunny Spain and Germany , which generate 1,671 MW and 1,505 MW respectively .
Dall 'Aglio said it was difficult to find sites large enough for the huge arrays of solar panels needed to generate a viable amount of power , insisting that EDF was always looking for more .
Asked why the latest one was to be sited in cloudy Lorraine rather than the sunny south , he said that the state had decided to increase the tariff paid to solar energy producers in gloomy regions to encourage investment .
" We 're hunting all the time , everywhere .
In Toul - Rosieres the advantage is that the site is available straight away , " he said , adding that EDF would pay the government rent of around a million euros ( 1.35 million dollars ) a year .
Some 150 people will be involved in building the plant , including the work of removing asbestos from around 100 abandoned military structures , and once it is open it will employ 15 permanent staff , he added .

I hear a lot of talk opposed to hard counters and it has been suggested that Blizzard is trying to phase them out .
Personally , I think hard counters make sense , add realism to the game , and add necessary complexity to the game .
Let me begin by describing what I think hard counters are and why I think they make sense ...
A hard counter is when a particular unit is more effective at either dealing or receiving damage from another unit type .
For example , an Immortal with its big guns and shield does a lot of damage against ( usually big [ excepting the roach ] ) armored units while its shield type prevents bigger attacks from getting through completely .
If you think of it in terms of realism , this makes sense .
A real cannon , for example , might do a lot of damage against a large stationary target ( plus damage ) while it would be inefficient at targeting smaller fast units .
Similarly , it might be armored so that massive bombing of it would n't be effective while an individual soldier could walk up and drop in a small grenade to disable it .
This is why in actual , historical warfare , tank divisions are accompanied by infantry -- it makes sense for defensive and offensive purposes .
Secondly ...
I think players should be required to adjust to the units their opponents are producing -- that adds complexity to the game which makes it fun to watch and exciting to play .
It makes people have to adjust their builds rather than always using the same old build order every game .
A lack of hard counters would lead to some very standard and boring builds .
Finally ...
I hope that blizzard does n't neutralize hard counters simply because people want an easy answer to a complex situation .
They 've added this complex element into the game and should expand it rather than diminish it -- especially considering that they will , in all likelihood , add expansion units .
With a greater diversity of units , hard counters will make even more sense in the future -- and the added units will likely be hard counters themselves !
So ... that 's my opinion .
Let me know what you think .
At the very least I hope you 'll be willing to compromise on this issue because doing away with hard counters completely is , hopefully and probably , somewhat unlikely anyway .
Terran are the plague !

I Miss super effective things like high damage storms and scarabs .
I miss powerful stuff .
I wish a baneling in the mineral line would be a huge deal .
More expensive but more effective , that 's how I want things .
Makes for more ahhh !

I do n't think hard counters should stay , i do like the bonus damage part but i'd preffer a unit having 20 Damage with +5 against armoured then 10 damage and +15 against armored .
The old system was just way too one sided .
Of course some units will beat some units but not ALL units should be hard counters to eachothers .

This is an excellent point and another reason to be in favor of hard counters .
Even if a player builds hard counters they still have to use them properly !
It 's not like hard counters are the end all , be all , to any particular game but merely a reasonable aspect of it .
You can macro perfectly , and make the perfect unit combination , but if you can't micro it does n't necessarily matter much anyway !

The complexity is in the production switch ( or better scouting in the first place ) .
If the 'toss is building immortals , then maybe the terran should consider switching to banshees to support mass bio units .
If someone sees immortals coming into play and keeps going with the same mech build , it 's their fault , not the games .
Tech switches make sense and add necessary complexity to the game in order to make it more dynamic and interesting .

The problem with hard counters now is that we really only have 2 actual armor types : armored , light ( maybe massive too ) .
Because all attacking units and buildings have one or the other , you are now forced to mass the hard counter .
Since its not like X unit counters Y unit , we have X unit counters everything light , or Y unit counters everything armored .
Which is just as stupid as having a rock / paper / scissors balance with only 2 of the counters instead of 3 .

And if you have insanely good micro you can beat an immortal with a marauder without being hit ( if you have concussive shells ) ( yes it 's possible , Naruto did it ) .
It works the same in SC2 as it does in SC1 !

The original hard counters are hard counters because of the way they deal damage .
Splash damage used against closely packed units in all of the cases above .
The new hard counters simply deal bonus damage to a flat type of armor .
Quite boring , because it ALWAYS works .
Spider Mines work only when you plant them right ; if you screw up tank placement you will lose ; if your Archons arent where the Mutas are you lose ...
No skill is required for " new hard counters " .
Imagine a truly realistic hard counter : A tank versus a Marine .
If you make it 100 % realistic the Marine should do " 1+4 vs light " damage instead of flat 5 .
As a result you are screwed if one tank shows up in front of your 30 Marines .
The fight would be over without any real excitement , because the outcome is clear .
As a result the " damage number hard counters " should be reduced as much as possible and the " mechanics based hard counters " should stay .
Maybe that is one of the reasons why Zerg is relatively boring to play / watch : The Lurker is gone and got replaced by the one - shot Baneling .
They dont really have a persistent " mechanics based hard counter " anymore while Terran ( Marauder slow shot , Hellion flamethrower , Tank splash , Thor ) and Protoss ( Colossus ) have several .
I dont count Infestors , Sentries and Phoenix as a " mechanics based hard counter " , because they are casters .

where once was small , medium , large , we now have a stupid boolean system .
does it have a bonus or not ?
nothing in between .
and yes , e.g. hydras or vultures were medium sized .
they took 100 % from normal attacks , 75 % from " large weaponry " ( explosive ) or 50 % from " small " stuff ( concussive ) .
and normal damage was n't that high unless it was a unit costing 200 + gas .
a unit such as the 16 ( + 2+2+2 ) normal - dmg roach was unthinkable .

Adobe has now squarely aligned itself with Google and Android Adobe is to stop making software tools that allow Apple 's iPhone and iPad to use its popular Flash technology .
The decision reverses an earlier pledge in which it said it would help get Flash working on the gadgets .
Flash is very widely used on the web and many sites use it to power animations , media players and other multimedia elements .
Despite this , Apple 's products do not support Flash and it has made public statements criticising the technology .
Closed tools
In mid-April , Adobe released software called Creative Suite 5 that contained translation tools that automatically turn Flash code into programs that run on the iPhone .
Shortly before the release , Apple updated the terms and conditions of the license software developers must sign to create iPhone and iPad applications .
The revisions prompted a lot of criticism from many iPhone developers .
The revised terms placed strict restrictions on what developers can use to create these applications and effectively banned them from using code translators such as Creative Suite 5 .
At the time Adobe wrote that it still intended to deliver the translation tools .
Now it has said it will halt development of future translation tools for Creative Suite .
" We will still be shipping the ability to target the iPhone and iPad in Flash CS5 , " wrote Mike Chambers , Adobe 's principal product manager for developer relations , on his blog .
" However , we are not currently planning any additional investments in that feature . "
Mr Chambers also commented on Apple 's revision of its terms and conditions .
He wrote : " ... as developers for the iPhone have learned , if you want to develop for the iPhone you have to be prepared for Apple to reject or restrict your development at any time . "
Apple responded in a statement to technology news site CNet in which it described Flash as " closed and proprietary " .
Apple preferred to support more open standards which replicate everything Flash can do , added the statement .
Mr Chambers wrote that now Adobe will concentrate on Google 's Android smartphone software and ensure that its Flash technology works well with that .
" Fortunately , " he wrote , " the iPhone is n't the only game in town . "

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa wants a plan to be drawn up to shut the city down for two days a week beginning April 12 because of their budget crisis .
" There are no easy decisions or simple ways to solve this budget crisis , ” Mayor Villaraigosa said in a statement .
“ But as the CEO of this great city , it is my responsibility to make these difficult but necessary decisions to steer the city out of this crisis and onto solid financial ground . "
Villaraigosa said he hoped a plan could quickly be developed so they could calculate how much money it would save the city while they hold emergency meetings to try and figure out how to replenish the city 's general fund .
" We can no longer wait .
We can no longer keep saying no , " Villaraigosa said .
" We must act now . "
Billionaire Pepe Fanjul was robbed at his suite at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons Hotel at the height of Oscar week .
The Cuban - born sugar baron — one of the world ’s richest men — and his wife , Emilia , were robbed by a man posing as a hotel worker Friday night .
A source told us , “ They were riding up in the elevator when a man in a blue uniform with ‘ hotel ’ written on his shirt started to talk Spanish to Pepe ( inset ) .
They both got off on the same floor , and Pepe and his wife went into their suite .
They then heard a knock on the door .
It was the man in the elevator , who said , ‘ I am here to fix your air conditioner . ’
They let him in , and he took valuables including Emilia ’s jewels — thought to be worth millions — and fled . ”
The Palm Beach - based couple , in town for Oscar celebrations , were unhurt but shaken up .
Hotel security is believed to have ID ’d the perp from videotape but no arrests have been made .
Fanjul confirmed to us , “ We were victims of a robbery at the hotel .
He took my wife ’s jewelry that was both valuable and sentimental .
We are OK and have reported the incident to the police . ”
The LAPD said they did n’t yet have details and a Four Seasons rep did n’t get back to us .

Nothing in football is so traduced as the offside law .
Most seem to regard it as a piece of killjoy legislation , designed almost to prevent football producing too many goals and being too much fun , while for the punditocracy it has become the universal scapegoat , the thing that " nobody understands " .
Just because Garth Crooks does n't get something , though , does n't make it a bad thing .
The modern offside law may be the best thing that 's ever happened to football , and it is almost certainly the reason Barcelona have been so successful with a fleet of players whose obvious asset is their technique rather than their physique .
A brief history of offside
The first laws of the game drawn up by the Football Association in 1863 stipulated that a player was offside if he was in front of the ball : " When a player has kicked the ball , anyone of the same side who is nearer to the opponent 's goal - line is out of play , and may not touch the ball himself , nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so , until he is in play … "
That effectively militated against passing and the assumptions that underlay that culture continued to shape English football for the following decade .
English football in those days was all about head - down charging , which is why England were so startled when they encountered the passing approach of Scotland , who had had no such law , in the first international in 1872 .
In 1866 , the law was liberalised so that a player was considered to be onside if there were three defensive players between him and the goal ( or was behind the ball , which has remained a constant ) ; this was the variant to which Queen 's Park committed when they joined the FA four years later .
In 1873 that law was modified so that offside was judged when the ball was played , rather than when the player received the ball .
Since then , the process has been of increasing liberalisation .
In 1903 , the notion of interfering with play was introduced : " It is not a breach of Law for a player simply to be in an off - side position , but only when in that position , he causes the play to be affected . "
Four years later it was decided a player could only be offside in the opposition 's half , and in 1921 that it was impossible to be offside from a throw - in .
Teams , though , had become adept at applying the offside trap .
Notts County had begun the trend , but by the mid-20s several clubs , most notably Newcastle United with their full - back pairing of Frank Hudspeth and Bill McCracken , had become so obsessed with offside that games would be compressed into a narrow sliver either side of the halfway line .
When Newcastle drew 0 - 0 at Bury in February 1925 , it came as the final straw .
It was Newcastle 's sixth goalless draw of a season that produced what at the time was an unthinkably low average of 2.58 goals per game .
The football was boring , attendances were falling and the FA , for once , not only recognised that something needed to be done , but set about doing it .
The 1925 change
The FA came up with two possible solutions : either to require only two defending players to be in advance of the forward for him to be onside , or to add a line in each half 40 yards from goal behind which a forward could not be offside .
After an exhibition match in which one alternative was trialled in each half , the FA plumped for the former .
It was recommended to the International Board , and introduced ahead of the 1925 - 26 season .
Goals shot up to 3.69 per game in that season , but the ultimate impact was to usher in a radical change in tactics .
Previously a side looking to play the offside trap had been able to retain one full - back as cover as his partner stepped up to try to catch the forward ; the new legislation meant that a misjudgment risked leaving the forward through one - on - one with the goalkeeper .
What teams did instead was to withdraw the centre - half in the 2 - 3 - 5 to man-mark the centre - forward ( which is why central defenders in Britain are still referred to as centre - halves ) .
Some , such as the great Austrian journalist Willy Meisl , insisted this was the death of football , and to the extent that it was the end of a particular style of football , he was right .
Moving the centre - half led to the 2 - 3 - 5 being dismantled as Herbert Chapman developed the W-M formation at Arsenal , from which sprang almost all tactical developments since .
Although the rule change was initially effective , the offside trap had returned by the mid-60s , as the advent of zonal marking and improvements in nutrition and physical training led to the development of pressing .
When the likes of Viktor Maslov 's Dynamo Kiev or Rinus Michels 's Ajax pressed , manipulating the effective playing area to suit their ends , it could produce thrilling football .
Once less technically skilled teams did it , particularly when two were ranged against each other , it could lead to the game , once again , being compressed into a narrow band straddling halfway .
Italia 90
It was the sterility of Italia 90 , as with so many rule changes , that provided the impetus .
First a player level with the second - last defender was deemed to be onside , whereas previously he had had to be behind .
Then in 1995 came a subtle change to the wording of the law so that a player was deemed to be active if he was " gaining an advantage by being in that position " rather than , as previously , if he was " seeking to gain an advantage " .
But it was in 2005 that the most radical changes came , and the switch to a law that , 142 years after it was first formulated , at last seems to have got it right .
First , it was clarified that a player is offside only if a part of his body with which he is legally able to play the ball is beyond the penultimate defender .
That , realistically , is academic , for no linesman can make a snap judgment as to whether , say , it is upper arm or torso he can see protruding beyond the defender , but what the change did was to shift the benefit of any doubt yet further in favour of the forward .
More significant , though was the rewording of what it means to be interfering : " Interfering with play means playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a team - mate . "
A later amendment clarified that : " A player in an offside position may be penalised before playing or touching the ball if , in the opinion of the referee , no other team - mate in an onside position has the opportunity to play the ball .
" If an opponent becomes involved in the play and if , in the opinion of the referee , there is potential for physical contact , the player in the offside position shall be penalised for interfering with an opponent . "
The impact of the 2005 change
So to be offside , a player has either to touch the ball or be in a position potentially to make physical contact with an opponent .
Crucially , if a defender steps up because he senses by so doing he would force a forward into an offside position , that is no longer sufficient to render him active .
Which means that against savvy opponents , who contrive to keep the ball away from those who have wandered offside , the offside trap has been rendered ineffective .
The figures bear this out .
Opta stats show that in 1997 - 98 there were 7.8 offsides per game in the Premier League , after which there was a fairly steady decline to 6.3 in 2005 - 06 .
Since the new legislation came into force , there has been a further decline , to 4.8 so far this season .
There are still pundits – and managers and players and fans – who ask what a defender is supposed to do in situations in which he would previously have stepped out and tried to play offside , or if a player is behind him in the box when a ball is played in .
He is , of course , actually supposed to challenge for the ball .
Why should defenders be allowed simply to step up ?
Just because they 've done that for 80 years does n't make it a God - given right .
Although the FA 's variant of offside when adopted in 1863 was predicated on a dribbling game , the variants further north – in Nottingham , Derby , Sheffield and Scotland , for instance – where a passing game prevailed , were designed to stop goal - hanging , and prevent the game becoming about endless hoofs into the danger area where a goalkeeper would battle with a handful of forwards who could legitimately stand straight in front of him .
The modern law stops that , but brilliantly it does it without the side - effect of legitimising the offside trap .
And that must , even at its most basic level , be a good thing .
Surely nobody , not even George Graham , goes to a game thinking : " Hmm , I hope they play some good offsides today ? "
Making defenders defend , forcing them to mark or block or intercept or tackle , has to be a good thing .
If sides are n't pushing up to play offside , the effective playing area is also larger .
A few years ago , there were semi-serious suggestions that the pitch should be made bigger to accommodate players who are physically far larger now than they were in the Victorian era when pitch dimensions were standardised .
Smaller players , ran the argument , were n't getting a chance beside physical colossi who were often less skilful , but were better equipped for the attritional conflict football had become .
Stop sides playing the offside trap and they defend deeper , that central band , the effective playing area , expands ( hence the widespread shift from three - band formations to four - band formations ) , and the result is that the size of players matters less and skill is one again prospering .
Barcelona 's victory in the Champions League and Spain 's success in Euro 2008 were both brought about by the sort of small , skilful midfielder who was supposed to have died out two or three decades ago .
The modern offside law remains unappreciated , but it has generated a climate in which some of the most beautiful football ever played has been produced .
WASHINGTON — Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is lobbying hard to kill a provision in financial industry overhaul legislation requiring big banks to sell off their derivatives - trading businesses , and rival banks are welcoming the help , shrugging off attacks on the firm by lawmakers and securities regulators .
Goldman 's lobbying could put Democrats and the White House , which is lukewarm on the provision , in a difficult position .
With congressional elections looming in November , lawmakers do n't want to appear supportive of Goldman or Wall Street .
But Goldman 's leadership is less concerned about politics than the provision itself , known as " section 106 . "
The nation 's five largest banks together earned $ 23 billion from derivatives trading in 2009 , and are working separately and together to defeat the provision .
" I do n't think political Kabuki theatre is having any impact on the ability to get meetings and be heard " in Congress , says a person familiar with Goldman 's strategy .
" The point of the matter from their standpoint is they can be heard ... Nobody 's being treated like lepers . "
A non-Goldman banking executive agreed that working together to kill the provision was a " no- brainer . "

Can I search for my name ?
Yes .
It is now possible to search the “ Moment in Time ” interactive gallery by the name given in the photographer ’s credit line ( actual name , pseudonym or screen name , as the contributor chose ) .
You ’ll find the search box in the upper right corner of the opening page .
If you believe your picture was n’t posted , we urge you to give this a try .
Update , May 13 |
Where Is My Picture ?
Contributors who have n’t found their pictures in the gallery ( be sure you ’ve looked under “ All ” ) may resubmit to pix@nyt.com .
Attach a JPEG file , no larger than 5MB , to an e-mail message with your name , location and caption .
Write “ Moment ” in the subject line .
Your picture should have been taken at 15:00 U.T.C. on Sunday , May 2 .
Resubmit only the image you originally sent ; nothing new .
We apologize and thank you for your patience .
Where Is My Credit ?
Contributors whose pictures have been published without credit should send an e-mail message to lensnytimes@gmail.com with their name and the URL of their picture .
( It ’s a long one , beginning www.nytimes.com and ending with a string of two dozen numbers and letters . )
Again , please accept our apologies .
Update , May 11 |
The interactive gallery is now open .
Original post | Attention : everyone with a camera , amateur or pro .
Please join us on Sunday , May 2 , at 15:00 ( U.T.C./G.M.T. ) , as thousands of photographers simultaneously record “ A Moment in Time . ”
The idea is to create an international mosaic , an astonishingly varied gallery of images that are cemented together by the common element of time .
How do I submit my picture ?
Call up this form , submit.nytimes.com / moment , which should be self explanatory .
That ’s all there is to it .
( If you ’re looking at the submission form before Sunday , May 2 , or after Friday , May 7 , you ’ll find that you can read it but ca n’t actually use it . )
How long do I have to submit my picture ?
Five days , until 15:00 ( U.T.C. ) on Friday .
We recognize that not every photographer will be near a computer on Sunday .
Some of you may not be able to get to a computer for days .
This extended deadline is for you .
How many pictures may I send in ?
One .
If you ’ve shot several over the space of a moment or two , send the single best .
Do I have to take my picture at exactly 15:00 ?
No .
We do n’t expect atomic - clock precision .
And we ’d rather you send a good picture taken one minute after the hour than a mediocre picture taken exactly on the hour .
We ask only that you come as close to 15:00 as is reasonably possible .
Keep in mind that the purpose of this exercise is to create a marvelously simultaneous portrait of our world and its people .
What if I cheat ?
Come on .
Why would you ?
Look , we trust you .
Besides , there are n’t enough cups of coffee in New York to keep our tiny staff awake for the time it would take to peruse the metadata in every single JPEG we receive .
So we ’re relying on you to understand that any significant departure from the benchmark hour only subverts the communal enterprise .
Of course , if we ’re presented with evidence that your entry was n’t taken close to 15:00 , we ’ll remove it from the gallery .
How much may I alter the image ?
Not much .
You may certainly crop the edges .
You may also perform minor adjustments , like color balancing , that are intended to increase the photo ’s verisimilitude ; in other words , to make the image on your screen resemble the scene that was before your eyes as closely as possible .
But please do n’t even think of cloning any element into or out of it .
Do n’t do anything you could n’t have done simply and easily in a darkroom .
( If you know what a darkroom is . )
What about adding or subtracting or combining elements ?
Again , do n’t .
Here is The Times ’s news policy , which we ’re applying to this project , too : “ Images in our pages , in the paper or on the Web , that purport to depict reality must be genuine in every way .
No people or objects may be added , rearranged , reversed , distorted or removed from a scene ( except for the recognized practice of cropping to omit extraneous outer portions ) . ”
And if I do so anyway ?
Really , why would you ?
We ’re not going to pore over submissions looking for fakery and fraud .
But we will remove any photographs that are demonstrably manipulated .
Please , just spare us .
Color or black and white ?
Horizontal or vertical or square ?
Your choice .
May I use my cellphone camera ?
By all means .
We ’re suckers for the medium .
See “ Reader ’s Photos : Call Forwarding . ”
May I shoot my picture on old - fashioned film ?
Absolutely , though you ’ll have to convert your negative , print or slide into a JPEG file in order to submit it .
Given the five - day deadline , that ought to be possible , even going through a commercial photo - finisher .
( If you know what that is . )
Who ’ll own my picture ?
You will .
You own the picture .
You own the copyright .
What you ’re doing is granting a limited license to The Times to reproduce your picture .
Here ’s the deal in its entirety : “ By submitting to The New York Times , you are promising that the content is original , does n’t plagiarize from anyone or infringe a copyright or trademark , does n’t violate anybody ’s rights and is n’t libelous or otherwise unlawful or misleading .
You are agreeing that we can use your submission on Lens , the photojournalism blog of The New York Times , and in the online and print version of the New York Times promoting or referring to the Lens post . ”
Do I keep the copyright on the picture ?
Yes , you do .
See the answer above .
Do I have to make my full name public ?
It ’s certainly our preference that you do .
And we think it adds a personal dimension to your submission .
But , no , it ’s not a requirement .
What about the caption ?
Keep it concise , please .
Just a sentence or two .
The form will actually prevent you from writing much longer than that .
And specifying my location ?
On the submission form , you ’ll find a Google map that will help you pinpoint your location .
If you ’re not in a settled place , you might also want to note in your caption that the picture was taken on the Zambezi River , atop Mount Agamenticus , or the like .
Anything else I need to know ?
The submission form will ask you to choose a topic under which you think your photo best fits .
They are : arts and entertainment , community , family , money and the economy , nature and the environment , play , religion , social issues and work .
You can also select “ other . ”
When will I start seeing results on the Web ?
By Sunday evening , we hope to have posted a small sampler of images ; not really the “ best of , ” but a brief overview of the many places and people and situations our contributors managed to capture .
Early in the following week , we plan to post a much fuller gallery , with thousands of images .
Frankly , the timing depends somewhat on the number of submissions we receive and how much editing is needed .
There ’ll be no way to know for certain until it actually happens .
How can I find out if you ’ve used my picture ?
Our plan — emphasis , “ plan ” — is to post almost every picture we receive .
So your work will almost certainly be included , unless it fails any of the tests mentioned above or is more graphic than news photographs we would customarily publish .
The interactive gallery that will appear next week takes the form of a globe on which you can find your location , or those of other photographers .
It was designed by Zach Wise of The Times and is , to use highly technical professional vernacular , too cool for school .
Will I get paid ?
Not by us .
But the photo is yours , after all .
Make of it , or out of it , what you will .
What is Coordinated Universal Time ( U.T.C. ) anyhow ?
It ’s an accepted worldwide benchmark against which all local time zones can be expressed , plus or minus .
Informally speaking , it ’s the equivalent of what you may know as Greenwich Mean Time ( G.M.T. ) .
Here ’s a helpful converter .
Eastern Daylight
Time is four hours behind U.T.C. , meaning that it will be 11 a.m. in New York .
Central Daylight
Time is five hours behind , so it will be 10 a.m. in Chicago .
Mountain Daylight
Time is six hours behind , so it will be 9 a.m. in Denver .
And Pacific Daylight
Time is seven hours behind .
( Good morning , San Francisco ! )
It will be noon in Buenos Aires , 4 p.m. in London , 5 p.m. in Cape Town , 6 p.m. in Baghdad , 7 p.m. in Moscow , 8:30 p.m. in Mumbai ( yes , there ’s a half - hour difference ) , 10 p.m. in Bangkok , 11 p.m. in Beijing , midnight in Tokyo and 1 a.m. Monday in Sydney .

At least 300 people have died and thousands are feared hurt after a magnitude - 6.9 earthquake struck China 's Qinghai province , officials say .
The powerful tremor hit remote Yushu county , 500 km ( 310 miles ) south - west of provincial capital Xining , at 0749 ( 2349 GMT ) , at a shallow depth of 10 km .
Chinese TV showed wrecked buildings and people scrabbling through debris .
Officials ordered rescue crews and supplies to Yushu , but the area is hundreds of miles from an airport .
RECENT DEADLY QUAKES Feb 2010 : Magnitude 8.8 quake in central Chile kills at least 450 Jan 2010 : About 230,000 die in magnitude 7.0 tremor in Haiti April 2009 : Quake measuring 6.3 in L'Aquila , Italy , kills 300 people May 2008 : 87,000 die in 7.8 scale tremor in Sichuan province , China Oct 2005 : Quake measuring 7.6 hits north Pakistan , killing 73,000
History of deadly earthquakes " Soldiers have been dispatched to save the people buried in the collapsed houses , " local official Huang Limin was quoted as saying by China 's state news agency Xinhua .
One official told journalists more than 85 % of buildings in Jiegu town near the epicentre had collapsed .
" The streets in Jiegu are thronged with panic - injured people , with many bleeding in the head , " Zhuo Huaxia told Xinhua .
" Many students are buried under the debris due to building collapse at a vocational school .
" I can see injured people everywhere .
The biggest problem now is that we lack tents , we lack medical equipment , medicine and medical workers . "
Many of the buildings in Yushu , a county with a largely Tibetan population of about 80,000 , were thought to be made from wood .
In 2008 , a huge quake struck neighbouring Sichuan province which left 87,000 people dead or missing .
Quake - prone region Karsum Nyima , from Yushu county 's TV station , told China 's state - run CCTV that school students had been assembled in outside playgrounds , although school buildings had not collapsed .
ANALYSIS Michael Bristow , BBC News , Beijing
The earthquake struck just before 0800 local time - when many people were still at home .
It was followed by three aftershocks .
Some media reports say most buildings in the town near the epicentre fell down .
Grainy pictures on Chinese television showed rescuers pulling at the rubble of one collapsed structure .
Soldiers have been sent to the area to help with the rescue .
The earthquake happened in a remote and sparsely populated area on the Tibetan plateau .
The area is regularly hit by earthquakes .
" In a flash , the houses went down .
It was a terrible earthquake .
In a small park , there is a Buddhist tower and the top of the tower fell off , " he said .
" Everybody is out on the streets , standing in front of their houses , trying to find their family members . "
Zhuo De , an ethnic Tibetan resident of Yushu , who spoke by phone from the capital of Qinghai province , Xining , said there could be many more casualties .
" The homes are built with thick walls and are strong , but if they collapsed they could hurt many people inside , " he said .
The remote high - altitude region is prone to earthquakes , but officials from the US Geological Survey said this was the strongest quake within 100 km of the area since 1976 .
Residents of Yushu fled their homes after the quake
The region , which is home to ethnic Mongolians and Tibetan farmers and herdsmen , is dotted with coal , tin , lead and copper mines .
After the Sichuan quake , five million people were left homeless , and officials estimated rebuilding work would take at least three years .
The government later punished people who had compiled lists of the victims and had suggested shoddy school - building was partly to blame for the high death toll .

The Ides of March , 2010 may be remembered as the day the entitlements crash began .
Social Security liabilities exceed inflow , and SSA has begun tapping its vault full of Treasury bonds .
“ Too bad ” ( as the AP story notes ) “ the federal government already spent that money … ”
Technically , Social Security is now broke .
Since it ’s politically unthinkable to admit this , the Treasury will have to go cap in hand to the bond markets and buy more short - term debt in order to keep the benefits flowing .
This will heavily increase a structural federal deficit that is already unsustainable .
The government will fail to do anything meaningful to address the problem — because there is nothing it can do .
Cutting payouts is n’t on the table , not for an administration ideologically committed to redistributionism .
Nor will raising taxes work .
According to the Tax Foundation ’s figures we ’d have to triple the tax rates on the top 50 % of earners just to cover the Federal FY 2009 budget of $ 3.55 trillion , let alone cover any debt or accumulate revenue for future years .
And the bottom 50 % only pays 2.89 % of revenues ; there ’s no money there .
The next stage of this slow - motion train wreck will arrive when the bond rating agencies admit that the U.S. is broke and not going to get un - broke , and downgrade the risk rating on Treasuries from AAA .
There ’s already talk of this and warnings from the agencies ; I ca n’t see it being more than nine months out at this point .
If Obamacare actually passes , expect the downgrade sooner rather than later ; vaporous talk of “ bending the cost curve ” is n’t fooling anyone with actual money on the table .
When Treasuries get downgraded , the Treasury will have to offer higher interest rates to sell bonds , increasing future deficits and putting solvency further out of reach .
At some point not too long after that , the bond markets ( and by that I mean China and Japan ) will stop playing .
Game over .
We have passed the fiscal event horizon .
A singularity looms .
Debt default , hyperinflation , or something equally traumatic is coming soon .
UPDATE : At Zero Hedge , economist Tyler Durden says : “ In a word : the US collects enough money organically ( via taxes ) to cover less than a third of its outlays . ”
* Spending culture “ seeped into our national party ”
* Mahoney is latest to leave Republican National Committee
* Questions surround chairman Steele ( Adds Republican National Committee comment )
WASHINGTON , April 6 ( Reuters ) - A top Republican resigned from his party ’s governing body on Tuesday , deepening a controversy around party chairman Michael Steele as Republicans try to focus on U.S. congressional elections in November .
Sean Mahoney , a member of the Republican National Committee from New Hampshire , quit in a letter to Steele , the latest fallout after revelations that a party organizer billed the RNC for $ 2,000 spent at a sex - themed club in Los Angeles .
Mahoney denounced the “ out - of - touch , free - spending culture of Washington ” that he said dominates Congress and said “ the same mentality has seeped into our national party . ”
“ Let me be clear so that there is no misunderstanding , ” Mahoney wrote .
“ I do n’t care if the $ 2,000 was spent in February at a strip club or a pizza parlor .
This is a matter of principle .
That $ 2,000 should have been used to promote our conservative ideals . ”
Mahoney ’s resignation followed a shakeup at the RNC on Monday in which chief of staff Ken McKay became the highest official to leave since the nightclub scandal erupted .
Steele has generated questions about his leadership of the RNC , which is supposed to recruit candidates , raise money for campaigns and prepare the party for elections .
The problems come as Republicans seek to bounce back after election drubbings by the Democrats in 2006 and 2008 .
Republicans appear poised to make gains in November ’s elections in which all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and more than a third of the 100 - seat Senate are up for grabs .
In a statement , the RNC thanked Mahoney for his service and said he was among many Americans concerned about “ binge spending in Washington . ”
“ The RNC is committed to ensuring that every donor dollar goes to building the infrastructure needed to elect conservative candidates that believe in the fundamental principles of our party , ” said party spokeswoman Katie Wright .
Steele has been criticized as an attention - seeker too fond of appearing in television interviews instead of focusing on the core duties of organizing and raising money .
While many Republicans would like Steele to leave , some expect him to hang on until after the November elections -- but possibly not much longer .
The next election for RNC chairman is in January .
The winner will guide the party through the 2012 election , in which Republicans will seek to stop President Barack Obama , a Democrat , from winning a second term .
Steele “ never understood the role of the national chairman , ” said Republican strategist Scott Reed .
“ This pattern of behavior has finally caught up with him , ” Reed said .
“ He ’s about guaranteed that he wo n’t be re-elected , especially during a presidential cycle where the national chairman has to run a national convention , raise money and work with the Republican nominee . ” ( Editing by David Alexander and John O’Callaghan )

Roy Weinstein had given up .
To heck with the patent office , the 82 - year - old physicist decided .
After waiting two decades for a patent on his potentially revolutionary superconducting magnets , he'd had enough .
“ As you might imagine , waiting 20 years is a pretty nasty chore , ” said Weinstein , an emeritus professor at the University of Houston .
Then , amazingly , the patent arrived on Feb. 23 — 20 years and three days after he applied for it .
The breakthrough came after the intervention of his son , Lee , an engineer and inventor who has had his own battles with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .
The patent lets Weinstein move forward with commercial development of his supermagnets that , when chilled to super - low temperatures , can produce a field with the strength of 2 tesla , billions of times stronger than the magnet on your refrigerator .
Weinstein 's magnets are about the size of a stack of five dimes , weigh an ounce , and cost $ 300 .
Commercially available electromagnets that can produce a comparable magnetic field weigh two tons and cost $ 60,000 to $ 100,000 , he says .
The most immediate application may be in motors , which use magnets to create motion .
The stronger the magnet , the more powerful the motor .
Although the magnets would have to be kept cool with liquid nitrogen , this would be cost - effective in larger motors , Weinstein said .
The prospect of a more powerful , much smaller magnet has experts excited .
“ The basic design of motors has been understood for about a century , ” said Robert Hebner , director of the Center for Electromechanics at the University of Texas at Austin .
“ It 's new materials that make it exciting , and it seems to me this is a material that has the potential to revolutionize motors . ”
Weinstein said he is developing a $ 7 million agreement with Round Rock - based TECO - Westinghouse Motor Co. to construct a 1 megawatt motor that will be a prototype for a 10 megawatt version .
The company declined comment .
New field ‘ looked like fun '
The U.S. Navy is expected to provide much of the funding , Weinstein said , because of the potential to reduce the size of ship - borne motors by three - fourths .
“ On a Navy ship that extra space is pure gold , ” the physicist said .
And there are other potential applications , a gusher of which Weinstein expects to flow now that the patent has been approved .
His patent odyssey began back in 1987 with perhaps the most momentous physics discovery in Houston 's history .
It was then that UH physicist Paul Chu discovered that a specialized material called yttrium barium copper oxide , or YBCO , acted as a superconductor of electricity at minus - 294 degrees Fahrenheit , launching the field of “ high - temperature ” superconductivity .
Although that 's still plenty cold , it is in fact warm enough that liquid nitrogen can be used as a coolant .
In 1987 Weinstein was not quite 60 years old , and he 'd arrived at UH four years earlier to become dean of the College of Natural Sciences .
Weinstein had spent nearly four decades in the field of particle physics , working at all the major particle accelerators around the world and amassing himself a nice career studying atoms .
But Weinstein began to become disenchanted .
When he was starting out in the early 1950s , a group of two or three scientists could use a $ 10,000 machine to make basic science discoveries .
Now it took groups of hundreds of scientists and billion - dollar - machines .
Then Chu found the YBCO compound , and the field of superconductivity tantalized Weinstein .
“ It looked like fun , ” he said .
“ You get to play with liquid nitrogen and you get to blow things up . ”
Weinstein began experimenting with the new high - temperature superconductor material .
It was well - known that when a material “ transitions ” into a state of superconductivity , and begins to carry electricity with no loss , the material expels its magnetic field .
What Weinstein soon discovered was that drilling tiny cylindrical holes inside pellets of YBCO — making the superconducting material look like Swiss cheese — allows it to trap a magnetic field , and thus become a powerful magnet .
Reason for delay unclear
By 1990 he was ready to apply for a patent .
Weinstein might well have felt he was entering a real - life Circumlocution Office — the fictional government agency Charles Dickens created in his novel Little Dorrit to ridicule out - of - control bureaucracy .
It 's not clear entirely why the patent office did n't approve Weinstein 's application , which he and his lawyers actively pursued for the first 15 years or so .
“ It is very rare for patents to be pending this long , ” agreed Jennifer Rankin Byrne , a spokeswoman for the office .
What is clear is that the patent did n't start moving until Lee Weinstein became involved about a year ago .
Son picked up the phone
The younger Weinstein himself had wrangled with the patent office before , having earned 15 patents and having another 40 applications outstanding .
Among the electrical engineer 's claims to fame is the development of laser tag in 1984 while he worked in Houston at Schlumberger .
Weinstein's “ Star Laser Force ” in Houston and George Carver III 's “ Photon ” in Dallas were the first two businesses in the world to offer laser tag to paying customers .
Instead of communicating by letters , Lee Weinstein called the patent examiner directly and struck up a relationship .
He assuaged the examiner 's concerns that a patent for the magnet would cover too many existing technologies and might restrict billions of dollars in trade .
“ To be honest , this is an area of science that almost certainly a patent examiner would n't understand , ” Lee Weinstein said .
“ It 's deep physics .
I tried to help him understand that by granting a claim this was n't reaching out and covering some technology it should n't cover . ”
When the patent finally gained tentative approval , it was further delayed because when it was originally filed the patent office did n't use computerized records , Lee Weinstein said .
But it finally did come through .
And how did that make Roy Weinstein feel ?
“ It made me feel pretty dang good , ” he said .

King is a big fan of baseball , particularly the Boston Red Sox , as anyone who ’s read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon can tell you , and now he ’s ready to take us out to the ballpark again .
In the lead - up to Opening Day , indie publisher Cemetery Dance has just announced the release of Blockade Billy , a new baseball - themed novella from King .
The work is the tale of William Blakely , a player long erased from the history books , who harbored a deep , dark secret .
Knowing the author , I suspect it ’ll be something a lot creepier than steroids or pine tar .
“ People have asked me for years when I was going to write a baseball story , ” King said in the press release .
“ Ask no more ; this is it . ”
According to Cemetery Dance , Blockade Billy will be available to ship in a few weeks , but you can order a copy now via the publisher ’s online store .
The first copies will also come with a baseball card of the protagonist .
( And those who do n’t order online may be out of luck .
As the Cemetery Dance website notes , “ We ’ll be filling direct orders first and then distributors , online stores , and the chains if there are copies left available after we ’ve taken care of our regular customers . ” )
With GDC right around the corner I thought that I would take the opportunity to show off a game prototype that we will be trying to pitch to anyone and everyone that we can .
We call the game Dark Frontier and if you have n't guessed it already , its a space flight simulator game that was inspired by classic games like the X - wing and Freespace series and of course being " mech heads " Macross :)
We had originally made this prototype as a pitch to the InstantAction portal , but they were not interested at the time .
Unfortunately other paying work came up and so we had to put this aside until we had an opportunity to showcase it again ...
About the game ( fun facts & information ) ...
- It 's made with TGEA ( we based a lot of it off of the code that we did for Lore Aftermath , in fact internally we called it " Space Lore " for a while ) .
We would definately update it to Torque3D though if the opportunity came around .
- Development time was only a couple of weeks since we based a lot of it off of existing code .
- All artwork for the game , except for the skybox , is original work thats based off of previous concept samples that we had .
- Just like in Lore , we use ribbons for all of the weapon projectiles .
This is custom code that we developed that both draws the ribbon , handles it with a shader and allows for mounting of other objects to the tip of it .
We used very few particles for this ( mostly for the space dust that you pass through ) .
- This is the game that we entered into the Green Ear contest that was held a year or so ago and won their big prize .
- Yes the game is actually quite fun to play even at this stage ( the controls are a bit loose but nothing major that cannot be fixed up ) .
This particular video comes from a 3 on 3 multiplayer match that we did .

BUENOS AIRES , Argentina —
Oil is spreading across the Gulf of Mexico — the result of the sinking of an oil rig last week .
A spill of this magnitude so close to the wetlands , estuaries and national fisheries of south Louisiana is unprecedented .
Though it 's unclear how badly wildlife along the Gulf Coast will suffer , the timing of the spill could n’t be worse .
This is peak spawning and nesting season for many species of fish , birds , turtles and marine mammals .
Many species remain in set breeding areas during this time and there ’s less instinct to move away from danger .
[ Read about the 10 worst man-made environmental disasters ]
Disturbances to nests , fish spawning grounds or key links in the food chain might have lasting effects on species already at risk , commercial fish stocks and the people who make a living harvesting them .
Minor oil spills are relatively common on the Gulf Coast , but this one has biologists , wildlife agencies , conservation groups and fishermen particularly concerned .
Here ’s a selection of animals at risk in the open water , along the coasts and in the wetlands .
1. North Atlantic bluefin tuna
The Great Bluefin Tuna , prized for sushi and sashimi , is one of the species most in danger of slipping into extinction .
Traveling down across the Atlantic seaboard , bluefin tuna spawn in the Gulf of Mexico between mid-April and mid-June .

2. Sea turtles
Five of the world ’s seven sea turtle species live , migrate and breed in the Gulf region .
Kemp 's ridley is the world 's most endangered species of sea turtle , and one of its two primary migration routes runs south of Mississippi .
Loggerhead turtles , also endangered , feed in the warm waters in the Gulf between May and October .

3. Sharks
Shark species worldwide are in decline .
The grassbeds south of the Chandeleur Islands are very close to the oil spill .
These grasses are a known nursing area for a number of shark species , which are now beginning their spawning season in the Gulf .
Whale sharks , the world ’s largest fish , feed on plankton at the surface of the water and could also be affected .

4. Marine mammals — whales and dolphins
Oil spills pose an immediate threat to marine mammals , which need to surface and breathe .
Not only does the oil pose a threat , but also the nasty toxins that the oil kicks off into the air .
A resident pod of sperm whales in the spill area could be at risk along with pygmy sperm whales and dolphins .

5. Brown pelican
The state bird of Louisiana , the pelican nests on barrier islands and feeds near shore .
Brown pelicans only came off the endangered species list last year , but they ’ve had a rough time in past seasons with storms .
Their reproductive rates are low .
Breeding season just started , and with eggs incubating the oil could pose a significant threat .

6. Oysters
The coastal waters around the very tip of Louisiana ’s boot - shaped coast are home to some of the most productive oyster farms in the country .
Oils and hydrocarbons are toxic to oysters .
Unfortunately , hydrocarbons can persist in coastal sediments for months or even years .
Louisiana oyster farmers , many of whom barely scrape by with high fuel costs and global competition , could have trouble weathering the oil spill if their harvests are affected .
7. Shrimp and blue crab
Coastal marshes are key to the life cycle and development of Louisiana shrimp and blue crab — both staples of the local seafood industry .
Inshore shrimp season will open in mid-May , while brown shrimp are in their post - larval and juvenile development stages .

8. Menhaden and marsh - dwelling fish .
The young offspring of species such as mullet , menhaden and marsh - dwelling forage fishes are especially vulnerable at this time of year .
Menhaden is a little fish you 've probably never heard of , but people all over the world use it everyday .
Menhaden fish oil and meat are used in everything from cosmetics to animal feed .
Louisiana is one of the world ’s biggest suppliers and the oil spill comes smack in the middle of menhaden spawning season .

9. Beach - nesting and migratory shorebirds
Overdeveloped beachfronts all along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida have made life difficult for several species of plovers , sandpipers , terns and oystercatchers .
Those that build their nests on the ground and feed on invertebrates are susceptible to oil on the beaches .
Some migratory shore birds fly nearly the length of the Western Hemisphere and use barrier islands in the Gulf for key resting and refueling spots on their journey .

10 . Migratory songbirds — warblers , orioles , buntings , flycatchers , swallows and others
About 96 species of neotropical songbirds make a 500 - mile journey without a pit stop across the Gulf of Mexico .
The next two weeks mark the height of their migration as they travel north from Central and South America to breed in North America .
The smoke from controlled burns to mitigate the oil spill could affect the migration , but the impacts will be difficult to monitor .

On a positive note , the sweet crude oil found in the Gulf is lighter and less toxic than other oils .
It can be burned without refining it first and some ecosystems might be able to break it down over time .

Editor 's note :
This story has been updated to correct the spelling of pygmy sperm whales and to correct a reference to porpoises .
Faced with a pandemic of online piracy , Hollywood studios and the major record labels have pressed governments around the world to make it easier for them to enforce their copyrights .
In particular , they 've tried to shift responsibility for infringements from the individuals who commit them -- who are legion and hard to identify -- to targets that are easier to hit .
And gradually , they have been succeeding .
The latest example is a hotly disputed British law that sets new rules for digital broadcasting and the Internet .
Dubbed the Digital Economy Act , it requires Internet service providers to send warning notices to customers whose broadband connections have allegedly been used for piracy .
If the warnings do n't reduce infringement to the government 's satisfaction , regulators can order ISPs to ramp up sanctions on repeat offenders , potentially culminating in the suspension of their Internet access .
This sort of " three strikes " approach , which France has also adopted , has drawn howls of protest from certain ISPs and technology advocates .
Some do n't consider online piracy to be a problem , or believe copyright holders should simply embrace the fact that millions are downloading their works for free instead of buying them .
We have little sympathy for that point of view .
On the other hand , British lawmakers seem to have paid scant attention to the fact that copyright holders can't tell who , exactly , is bootlegging their movies , games and songs online .
No one can .
ISPs can tell which account was involved and , potentially , which computer was used .
But they can't tell who was sitting at the keyboard .
And in the case of a public wireless network at an airport or a restaurant , they may not be able to say for sure which of the dozens of simultaneous users was the pirate .
As a result , by exposing those who pay for broadband accounts to sanctions rather than the specific users , the law muddles the issue of who 's responsible for misdeeds online .
It also could give copyright holders too much power over ISPs and disruptive technologies .
Much depends on how the law is implemented by the government officials who were left to work out key details .
One danger is that the duties and liabilities they impose could prompt those who provide Internet access in public spaces -- coffee shops , libraries , universities and the like _ to stop or limit their services to avoid any risk of even innocent infringement .
That would be a step backward for Britain 's efforts to promote ubiquitous broadband .
Another potential pitfall is that the law 's appeals process wo n't prevent broadband account holders from being penalized for a third party 's misbehavior .
Nor are ISPs in any position to judge when an alleged infringement is actually a fair use of copyrighted works .
That 's why Britain should move forward carefully .
The first anti-piracy step called for by the new law -- having ISPs alert customers about alleged infringing activity on their accounts -- could be a good one , if the government sets the right threshold .
The steps after that , however , raise the risk of ugly unintended consequences .

NEWARK — An East Orange police officer who was off - duty but in uniform was arrested Wednesday morning , charged with assaulting a 20 - year - old woman at a bus stop in Newark , then spitting on her , the Essex County Prosecutor ’s Office said today .
The officer , Anthony Reed , 31 , had just finished his shift and was driving his own car when he allegedly approached the woman on Stuyvesant Avenue and Abinger Place around 10 a.m. , said Charlotte Smith , a prosecutor ’s office spokeswoman .
The officer exchanged words with the woman , who was sitting at the bus stop , and who authorities said he had never met .
Reed then got out of his car , grabbed her , pushed her to ground and spit on her face , police said .
Authorities are investigating what prompted Reed , who has been on the force for two years , to approach the woman in the first place .
Newark police arrested him at the scene .
He was charged with attempted aggravated assault , and bail was set at $ 75,000 .
Newark police and the Essex County Prosecutor ’s Office is still investigating .
East Orange police Sgt. Andrew DiElmo said the department ’s own professional standards unit is also looking into the incident .
You 're probably aware by now that the Nashville Predators ' top two - way center ( or is he ? ) has n't been producing on the offensive end of the rink the way fans , bloggers , and Barry Trotz would like .
The actual numbers , however , might alarm you .
Here are Leggy 's point totals since December 31st against Columbus :
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - David Legwand - 12/31 to current 39 3 11 14 - 2 12 0 n/a n/a 0 63 n/a
In the 41 games before that , David had eight goals and sixteen assists , which in my mind is a reasonable expectation ( averaged out over a year ) for an above - average defensive player being payed $ 4.5 million a year .
The mega - slump has been hard to peg because Legwand has predominantly played with the same linemates ( Joel Ward and Jerred Smithson ) and has n't been injured at all ( that we know of ) .
We know he 's capable , too , because he's had two 20 goal campaigns in his career , one of them coming just last year .
Quickly , lets look at what could be done to reignite David Legwand 's offensive game :
Give him new linemates .
Ward and Smithson are n't known for their o- zone prowess , and perhaps a player like J.P. Dumont could help get him going .
Move him to the wing .
Barry Trotz tried it last year with varying results , but some dedicated time in a position that carries more emphasis on scoring might not hurt .
' Bench ' him .
Obviously , Nashville can't outright sit Legwand , and I would n't want them to , but reducing his ice time in order to send a subtle message could snap him out of it .
This is n't a very viable choice , however , as Legwand contributes so much more on defense than what shows up on the stat sheet .
Its a strange case , to be sure .
On the one hand , you can't ask much more of a guy who keeps at bay teams ' most potent offensive lines .
On the other hand , the Predators are a much more dangerous team with David Legwand contributing offensively .
What do you think is the ' problem ' with David Legwand , and what would you do to fix it ?
Hi , I 'm new to the community , but I wanted to thank all you ladies for the great info and all your stories ; and to appologize for the typos and misspellings , phones are not meant to be substitutes for computers sometimes .
I also wanted to see if any of you ladies have had a similar experience to mine , if my situation is normal , or if I should be genuinely concerned .
I 've had a copper IUD for 2 years , had a horrendous time after insertion for about the first 2 months , but I absolutely LOVE having my IUD .
My periods fluctuate between heavy to moderate , month to month , and I have no other problems beside the following :
So , for the last 2 or 3 weeks , maybe a month , I 've began to have cramps after EVERY bowel movement .
Sorry for the TMI , but I really do n't know if this is normal .
I 'm also a grad student between insurances right now , so a trip to my gyno would probably be equivalent to my meals for the next few weeks , so gotta be sure I 'm really in need of an appointment and not over exagerating .
The pain starts AFTER the BM , never during .
It 's usually more on the left side , like I can pin point the exact spot I feel things at .
I do n't know if it 's just because of the muscle contractions .
I 've also noticed pink ( blood ) discharge after sex .
Today , I 'm having a feeling in my uterus , not necessarily pain .
I mean , there is some pain , like cramping , but there 's also a weird feeling , and the best way I can describe it , is when you have a sticker in your foot , and you are so uncomfortable , but you know that you 'll have sweet reliefe when it 's out .
I feel like I just want to rip this thing out !!!
I have my suspicions of whats going on , I do n't want to admit them , but I just need the opinion of some ladies in my shoes .
My fiancee freaks out any time I have a hang nail so its hard to consult him when he wants to take out loans and sell our souls for a doctors appointment I may not need 😅 Have any of you ladies had the same experience ?
What was the cause , how was the issue mediated ?
this is hilarious .
it might be classic , but i have NEVER seen it before .

BEREA , Ohio -- Cleveland Browns president Mike Holmgren says the team has no plans to play Texas quarterback Colt McCoy as a rookie after selecting him in the third round of the NFL draft .
Though Cleveland fans may already be clamoring to see McCoy play , Holmgren cautions that it would be a mistake to put him on the field before he 's ready .
Holmgren said he made a phone call to the Rams 20 minutes before the draft began on Thursday and offered a package for the No. 1 pick .
Instead , he waited it out and took McCoy 85th .
Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford was chosen first overall by St. Louis .
Holmgren said he made the offer to Rams general manager Billy Devaney " at the limits of what I was willing to do . "
Holmgren says Devaney " finally said we 're going to take him [ Bradford ] . "
Holmgren would not specify what he offered the Rams .
Holmgren , who has coached Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Steve Young and Brett Favre , said teams run the risk of " scarring " a young quarterback by playing him too soon .
Cleveland signed free agent Jake Delhomme during the offseason as its starter and acquired Seneca Wallace from Seattle to be his backup .

Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon will address a conference in Brisbane which claims to be the first specifically organised to help people who have left cults .
Senator Xenophon has been campaigning for an inquiry into the Church of Scientology and its tax exempt status .
In a speech in Parliament late last year he raised allegations of false imprisonment , coerced abortions and embezzlement of church funds , of physical violence and intimidation , blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information .
The Cult Information and Family Support Group Queensland 's two - day conference starts in Brisbane today .
It will hear from American experts , and Senator Nick Xenophon will speak at the conference tomorrow .
The support group 's spokeswoman Helen Pomery says former members of cults tend to suffer in silence .
" There are far more than we know about here in Australia , " she said .
" Although we know that cults exist and we perhaps hear about a lot of the extreme ones from America they 're certainly here in our midst in Australia . "
She says workshops at the conference will allow them to connect with each other .
" Many of these people have never had any treatment before , " Ms Pomery said .
" They 've gone away , they 've resumed their lives , they 've shelved a lot of the issues , and this is the first time they really have a chance to start to process the pain that they 've suppressed within themselves . "
Most of the talk about future fourth - generation ( 4G ) mobile broadband networks appears to focus on speed .
These networks will be far , far faster than current 3G networks .
But speed is n't actually the main reason why every carrier in the developed world is trying to extend the life of 3G networks by speeding them up , and build 4G networks as fast as equipment and financing is available .
It 's all about congestion and capacity , not speed .
( In the developing world , 2G networks are being boosted to 3G speeds , too . )
" They 're not really for speed , they 're not really for voice , they 're for capacity , " said Allen Nogee , a principal analyst at the In - Stat research firm .
Overwhelmed network operators need to handle more devices , each of them owned by high - revenue customers .
Regardless , this year we have already seen significant 3G network upgrades by AT&T and T - Mobile , the mass - market expansion of Clearwire 's 4G WiMax network , and the commercial launch of Verizon 's 4G LTE ( Long Term Evolution ) network .
What 's the road to 4G look like ?
So far , it 's remarkably free of missteps ; delay has been the watchword instead of disaster .
The current landscape
If you 've used an iPhone in San Francisco or New York , I do n't have to explain the problem of congestion to you .
The iPhone is the flag bearer for mobile networks that were underbuilt and overutilized .
AT&T hemmed and hawed , but the company has now quite openly admitted that it was n't spending enough on its mobile network , particularly on backhaul , and has stepped up tremendously .
There are two major parts of a cellular network that handle data relevant to our purposes : the local link , or the wireless connection from your phone , laptop , MiFi router , or other device equipped with mobile broadband , to the nearest cellular base station on a roof or tower ; and the backhaul , which connects all the radio gear from a carrier to its core network .
( There are , of course , a whole lot of other components , too , such as the core network , the base station software , the network 's interchanges with other networks , and so on , but these pieces have less obvious and direct impact on what an end user experiences . )
Let 's address backhaul first , because it 's much simpler .
Most cell base stations had relatively paltry backhaul until the last two years , even in dense urban markets .
Before 3G started to be heavily used by mobile devices , and for previous 2G networks , a 1.5 Mbps T - 1 line or an even slower link ( whether wireless or wired ) could handle all the voice and data capacity for a carrier .
Hundreds of voice calls and multiple data devices would n't flood the line .
Generation Gap
There are four defined generations of cellular technology .
1G was all analog .
2G is digital , with a small provision for data networking at speeds slower than dial - up modems .
2.5G was a stopgap of 100 to 200 Kbps data networking while 3G was finalized and deployed .
3G networks needed to have a raw downstream rate of 2 Mbps or higher , but voice and data traffic are managed separately .
4G networks are ostensibly all Internet protocol with low latency to allow voice and video to work well without extra effort .
But a cellular node can have multiple pieces of gear and handle multiple cellular channels at once .
In the 3G - and - beyond world , that could mean devices capable of pulling down 3 to 4 Mbps per channel .
A T - 1 does n't cut it , and the move from T - 1 to 10 Mbps is n't a smooth one unless the carrier is the incumbent local exchange carrier ( ILEC ) and it's in an urban area with plenty of wire or fiber .
Carriers have been struggling and investing many billions of dollars to build out fiber or high - speed , high - frequency , point - to - point wireless links to handle the additional backhaul needed .
In areas where one carrier has to deal with another — for Sprint and T - Mobile , that 's everywhere — it can be even harder .
In a recent interview with T - Mobile , in which the firm announced that a faster 3G flavor was in place ( see below ) , the company said it had paired its new installations with the fastest backhaul it could arrange .
" That 's the most complicated part of the upgrade and something we 've been at for some time , " said Jeremy Korst , a T - Mobile director in charge of broadband products and services .
T - Mobile spokesperson David Henderson noted that the new service was a " pretty basic upgrade from a radio side , and then the backhaul is really the biggest gating factor . "
Fiber and wireless are both being used .
AT&T seems to agree .
While announcing an identical network service upgrade in January , the company said it would n't be switching on the faster flavor on the back - end ( only on the local link ) until it had finished a project to " dramatically increase the number of high - speed backhaul connections to cell sites , primarily with fiber - optic connections . "
It 's odd — possibly even ironic — how wireless networks are so heavily constrained by wires and cables , but that 's how the business works .
For the local link , there are currently four dominant network standards for 3G and 4G that are deployed or in the process of being deployed : the GSM flavors of 3G HSPA and 4G LTE , CDMA's 3G EVDO Rev. A , and WiMax , which is considered a 4G standard .
GSM network standards , which dominate cellular markets worldwide , have been broken into many incremental improvements , which allowed a lot of stairstepping and retrofitting of 2G and 3G networks .
For instance , the so - called 2.5G ( a spot between 2G digital and 3G broadband mobile networks ) EDGE standard was developed to provide speeds several times faster than 2G data ( GPRS ) both before 3G could be deployed and in markets where it was cost - prohibitive to build 3G .
EDGE was a relatively minor software and hardware upgrade on the base station side , and less expensive to build into handsets and other devices .
Apple 's very first iPhone could work only as fast as EDGE .
From EDGE ( usually 100 to 200 Kbps ) , networks moved to UMTS ( 384 Kbps ) , and then various flavors of paired HSDPA ( High Speed Download Packet Access ) and HSUPA ( the U for Uplink ) .
HSDPA rates commonly deployed are 3.6 , 7.2 , 14 , and 21 Mbps depending on the network ; HSUPA rates run from 1.5 Mbps to 6 Mbps on production networks .
AT&T has paired HSPDA on nearly all of its phones with UMTS for upstream .
On the CDMA side , the US market halts at EVDO Rev. A , even though Qualcomm , CDMA 's prime mover , had a Rev. B update and a 4G standard in development .
Rev. A tops out at 3.1 Mbps downstream , and 1.8 Mbps upstream .
( Rev . B will appear in non-US markets , while Qualcomm 's 4G Ultra Mobile Broadband was abandoned . )
The two CDMA carriers in the US , Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel , took different 4G courses .
Verizon opted for LTE , which it knew would be years away and which it did n't possess the right spectrum for at the time it made its technology decision .
Sprint chose WiMax , which was a near - term solution for which it had enough spectrum to deploy right away .
Interesting choices in both cases .
I 'll get to 4G in a moment .
Bumping up 3G
We all know that 4 follows 3 , but just as the sequence in cell generations went 2G , 2.5G ( EDGE ) , 3G in order of deployment , we 'll see a lot more tweaks to 3G networks before 4G networks have anything like full national coverage .
T- Mobile already has plans to leapfrog over AT&T , however , with HSPA + , a 21 Mbps variant that it can generally add as a software update .
In January and February , AT&T and T - Mobile respectively announced that their networks had moved from the 3.6 Mbps to 7.2 Mbps ( often called HSPA 7.2 ) flavor of HSDPA .
Both networks have also moved to 2.0 Mbps HSUPA .
HSPA 7.2 doubles the local link , and it may have an advantage even without increasing backhaul .
With a faster local link , you have less congestion among devices contending to have any communication with a cell base station .
That means each device can be more fairly dealt with , even while receiving slender slivers of Internet access .
The rub for both firms is backhaul and coverage .
As noted above , T - Mobile and AT&T are both focused on improving backhaul .
T - Mobile has a little advantage because the company is building its 3G network fresh with spectrum acquired a few years ago .
T - Mobile had no 3G network until May 2008 , and now covers over 200 million people in nearly 300 cities with service .
AT&T has been building 3G service for years , but has n't built as fast as one might expect .
That telco claims it passes — has the ability to offer service to — just 233 million people with its 3G flavor .
For those who can get access , AT&T and T - Mobile will likely shortly be slugging it out for the fastest 3G network .
In a series of PCWorld tests conducted by Novarum in December 2009 and January 2010 , AT&T had substantially higher speeds than the other three major 3G network providers , including T - Mobile .
That 's partly due to AT&T's pre-announcement HSPA 7.2 testing .
While HSPA 3.6 typically performs in a downstream rate of 700 Kbps to 1.7 Mbps , AT&T claims , HSPA 7.2 can average 1 to 2 Mbps in typical usage based on results from existing deployments .
Ken Biba , the founder and chief technology officer of Novarum , said that his firm found spikes of near 4 Mbps in nearly all the 13 cities tested .
Average raw TCP downloads — which score better than , say , a Web download — averaged over 3
Mbps for 1 minute in 1 percent of tested cities , and 2.5 Mbps in 10 percent of those cities .
( Biba said Novarum has no past or current contracts with carriers to test 3G data performance . )
The iPhone 3GS and nine other current AT&T devices use HSPA 7.2 , although the company does n't appear to provide a list .
T - Mobile has several HSPA 7.2 compatible devices and smartphones , including its USB webConnect adapter .
T- Mobile already has plans to leapfrog over AT&T , however , with HSPA + , a 21 Mbps variant that it can generally add as a software update .
The GSM Association lists 17 networks worldwide already using this flavor , including three in Canada .
The company plans to start with coastal US cities in the next few weeks , following commercial availability in Philadelphia , its pilot city , and then fill in most of the rest of its territory during 2010 .
So far , only one HSPA + device has been announced — another USB adapter — but there 's a variety of HSPA + gear already for sale in Europe and Canada that can be adapted .
( T - Mobile has a nearly unique slice of 3G spectrum that is n't harmonized with any other North American or European carrier . )
These efforts add some life into 3G , and allow AT&T and T - Mobile to both ease congestion and have greater performance than Sprint and Verizon .
Sprint and Verizon wo n't be able to speed up their existing 3G networks , and both are relying on future deployments to let them jump up a notch to 4G , as discussed next .
T- Mobile , as the trailing fourth - largest carrier , and a relatively small amount of mobile broadband spectrum may be able to take the technical advantage for two to three years , as AT&T has no present plans to adopt HSPA +.
Monica Paolini , the principal at analysis firm Senza Fili Consulting , said , " An operator with less spectrum , but also fewer subscribers may be better off than a larger operator with more spectrum , " but that " HSPA + is at best a short term advantage " as competitors ramp up for true 4G networks .
Biba of Novarum agreed : " I came away with the clear impression that HSPA 7.2 and HSPA + have legs over WiMax — much less LTE , " he said .
But how long can those flavors compete ?
It all depends on how fast LTE and WiMax blanket the country .
ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Debt - stricken Greece appealed to its European partners and the IMF for emergency loans on Friday , yielding to overwhelming market pressure to start the first financial rescue of a member of the euro zone .
Prime Minister George Papandreou asked to tap the 45 billion euro ( $ 60.5 billion ) package after investors feared a default and pushed borrowing costs to record levels , undermining Athens ’ efforts to cut its 300 billion euro debt pile .
“ It is a national and imperative need to officially ask our partners in the EU for the activation of the support mechanism we jointly created , ” Papandreou said in a statement broadcast live from the remote , tiny Aegean island of Kastellorizo .
“ The time that was not granted to us by the markets will be given to us by the support of the euro zone . ”
European markets rallied on the announcement but fell back as investors said the long - awaited bailout , which could be the largest multilateral rescue of a country ever tried , would bring only short - term relief .
There were concerns it could force harsher austerity on Greece , deepening its recession , and that it would set a precedent for other euro zone underperformers .
Greek riot police fired teargas on Friday at leftist protesters marching through central Athens against austerity measures , police said .
The euro was up 0.8 percent on the day at $ 1.3390 .
The Greek crisis has hit confidence in the single currency which is shared by 16 of the 27 EU member states .
There are fears problems could spread to weaker euro - zone economies like Portugal and Spain and fuel skepticism in some quarters about the euro ’s long - term survival .
“ On the one hand it could be perceived a relief that Greece is taking the financial help but it does not address the systemic risk and begs the question as to whether countries like Spain may look for the same rescue package in the near future , ” said Simon Brown , CEO of financial analysts Prospreads in London , forecasting further euro weakness .
The premium investors demand to buy Greek 10 - year government bonds rather than euro zone benchmark Bunds tightened to 525 basis points , versus 611 on Thursday , before rebounding back to 570 .
Torn between punishing global market forces and Greek workers protesting at painful austerity measures , Papandreou ’s socialist government hesitated over pressing the “ help ” button , tempting investors to bet against its debt .
The last straw came on Thursday when the European Commission revealed that Greece ’s 2009 public deficit was even higher than feared at 13.6 percent of gross domestic product , raising the bar for this year ’s drastic cut .
That drove Greek bond yields to 12 - year highs , making borrowing prohibitive .
The decision to invoke the aid mechanism followed a marathon seven - hour cabinet meeting , at which some ministers voiced fears of still tougher austerity conditions , Greek media reported .
“ This certainly does not mark the end of the crisis , there ’s still much further to go , ” said Ben May , European economist at Capital Economics .
“ They ’ve still got the medium - term problems of getting their public finances in order , and obviously the issue of competitiveness . ”
TIMING IN FOCUS
Athens continued talks with the Commission , the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Friday on a three - year fiscal program including the aid package .
Time is pressing , with an 8.5 billion euro bond due to mature on May 19 .

Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said he expected the first tranche of aid to be disbursed before that deadline .
France said it hoped to approve its portion between May 3 - 6 .
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble , who will meet top lawmakers on Monday to discuss fast - track approval for loans to Greece , said Berlin would make its contribution if the EU , the ECB and the IMF agree Athens needs help . [ n BEB004452 ]
The United States , which has a veto over IMF decisions , supported Greece ’s decision to ask for the activation of the aid package , the White House said . [ n N23188357 ]
Economists say a rescue is likely to entail further European and IMF aid in 2011 and 2012 , and some forecast Greece will have to restructure its debt .

French and German banks are among the biggest holders of Greek bonds .
Germany ’s deputy finance minister on Friday said speculation about debt restructuring was unfounded .
It could take a week for the Commission and ECB to decide if Greece ’s request is valid and for euro zone finance ministers to then take a formal decision , the Commission said .
“ Everything is going to be done in such a way that the mechanism can be triggered as soon as ( necessary ) and as is necessary for Greece , ” spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said .
He said interest on the loans -- expected to be around 5 percent from euro zone states -- would be in line with a formula worked out by euro zone finance ministers earlier this month .
Because the date of the disbursement was not known yet , it was impossible to say now what the exact level would be .
Greece has said the Commission could potentially offer a bridge loan to fill a gap if the aid were not approved in time to cover its funding needs .
The timing could hardly be worse for German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
She faces strong public opposition to aid for Greece ahead of a key regional election on May 9 in which the center - right government ’s upper house majority is at stake .
Germany is Europe ’s largest economy and would be the biggest contributor to a bailout .
Merkel has had to drop her initial resistance to financial assistance and back down on demanding market rates on loans .
After a telephone call with Papandreou on Friday , she told reporters : “ I ’m absolutely in agreement with ( Foreign Minister ) Guido Westerwelle that the stability of our currency has priority , on the other hand we also agree that the savings efforts of Greece have to be absolutely credible . ” [ nLDE63M1T0 ]
STICKING -PLASTER
Another question is whether the 30 billion euros pledged by euro zone states and 10 - 15 billion from the IMF will cover the 39 billion euros in debt Greece has coming due in the next 12 months , plus other costs forecast in the 2010 budget deficit .
“ In the longer - term , it ’s just a sticking plaster over the situation , ” said Daragh Maher , deputy head of forex strategy at Credit Agricole CIB .
“ The situation remains highly uncertain . ”
Papandreou won an election last year pledging to tax the rich and help the poor .
He has come under increasing pressure since his government announced Greece ’s 2009 budget gap was twice previous estimates and four times the EU ceiling .
The main Greek public sector union brought nurses , teachers and other public service workers onto the streets of Athens against the government ’s austerity measures .
It vowed another 24 - hour strike in early May .
A poll showed on Friday support for Papandreou , while still high , was falling and a majority feared the bailout would hit living standards .
In Athens , many said the deal was inevitable , but public sector worker Sofia Hatzaki was angry .
“ I hit the roof when I heard , ” she said .
“ I want to scream .
This means more austerity measures are coming and recovery is very far away . ”
Are you a webmaster ?
Are you a freelancer ?
Do you run a home business ?
Has anyone ever heard what you do for a living and told you to “ get a real job ? ”
Oh , how that used to piss me off !
Do n’t people understand that working for yourself and working from home still have one key component of work ?
Apparently not .
Do n’t fret too much if you ’re in this situation now .
You ’ll get through it just like I did .
My family did n’t understand what I did .
They certainly did n’t understand that I was very good at what I did and that there was good money in it .
I got grief constantly .
My mother would randomly hand me job ads from the local paper as though she was trying to be caring and helpful ( and deep down I do think she really believed that ) .
At one point she even told me flat out that a “ real job ” meant working 9 - 5 , for someone else , doing work that you did n’t really like .
My sister would make the occasional comment about how no one wanted her to turn out “ like me ” ( meaning sans employment and supposedly unhappy ) .
They were pretty clueless .
I was extremely happy , even in the earliest days of self - employment before income picked up .
It was about freedom .
It was about pursuing a dream .
I was doing something that none of them were able to do , and I was going to succeed ( and have ) whether or not they thought it was a good idea .
Really , their concerns are understandable .
Here ’s why :
These people love you and really do want what ’s best for you .
I know my mom was n’t trying to piss me off when she ’d tell me to get a “ real job . ”
She was worried that I would n’t have a stable income and be able to support myself .
She was concerned that I ’d be lonely working by myself every day .
She was afraid that the stress of handling a start - up would manifest itself in depression .
In my case none of that was true .
I worked in a field where money was good .
I have a large network of clients and colleagues I deal with every day — I probably interact with more people daily than she does in a typical office environment .
And I was anything but depressed .
Tired ?
Yes .
( Holy friggin’ hell was I tired ! )
But it was a good kind of tired — an ecstatic exhaustion I suppose you could say .
People really do n’t understand what you do .
The other common issue is that your friends and family might really not understand the work you do .
I mean come on , what exactly does a webmaster do anyway ?
( Sure , we might know , but your typical John and Jane Doe probably do n’t have a clue . )
I ’m a full - time writer these days — a business writer .
I write press releases , marketing copy , Web content , blog posts , etc. with a business twist or a business - oriented mission .
But when people ask what I do , it always scares me .
I know the moment I say “ writer , ” most people will have preconceived notions of a starving artist barely scraping by .
That ’s why I always qualify “ writer ” by explaining the business / corporate aspects .
Then people do n’t glare at me with a look of pity in their eyes .
Before I became a full - time writer , I was an independent PR consultant .
You might think that being a consultant would command more respect from friends and family than being a writer or webmaster .
It really did n’t .
If anything , it just confused them .
“ What — people pay you to tell them what to do ? ”
Um , yeah , I guess you could put it that way .
What made it worse is that most people really do n’t understand what PR is .
In that sense , becoming a writer was a blessing .
It ’s not that people are necessarily trying to be malicious .
They really do n’t understand .
They do n’t know what a typical work day is like when you work at home .
They assume you watch soap operas and eat bon bons all day .
( Ick . )
They assume you can take a vacation whenever you please , as though no one is counting on you .
( Yeah , right . )
They think you spend all day in your pajamas and fuzzy slippers .
( Okay .
I do this .
But I ’ve earned that right , and like to think it ’s more jealousy than a lack of understanding when people say this . )
People just do n’t get it , and you ca n’t let that bother you too much .
How to Convince People You Already Have a “ Real Job ”
I have to tell you , one of the best moments of my self - employed life was the day the “ get a real job ” speeches stopped once and for all .
A family member needed some money for a down payment on a new apartment .
We were just casually discussing it , and how frustrated they were , because without finding a way to come up with the money they would n’t be able to move as planned .
I went to my little safe in my office .
I opened it .
I pulled out a wad of cash ( $ 1000 ) .
I handed it over .
After a brief moment of bright eyes and hesitation , they took the money .
I told them to just pay it back whenever they could .
That was the end of it .
It finally sunk in that I was making real money .
No , not play money , not hobby money — real money .
They assumed I was living paycheck to paycheck ( or is that client to client ) , and I was far from it .
It took cold , hard cash to wake them up .
That ’s okay .
There ’s nothing wrong with people needing to see something concrete .
Sometimes that ’s what it takes .
Yes , it would be nice if they ’d stop adding to the stress much earlier so we could get on with business , but the reality is that it ’s the norm .
As for those with incredibly supportive parents , friends , spouses , and others in their lives , I ’m quite envious .
For the rest of us , show people something “ real ” that they can appreciate and understand ( money , media coverage , or a contract with an awesome big - name client for example ) , and you ’ll shut up those “ get a real job ” rants in no time .
How about you ?
How many times have you been told to “ get a real job ? ”
How does it make you feel ?
Does it make you want to quit ?
Cry ? Scream ?
Or do you just let the comments roll right off of you ?
Did you finally find a way to make those comments stop ?
If so , tell us how you did it by leaving a comment below .

Game Spotlight : Stunts
This Game Spotlight is coming out of nowhere actually .
It ’s a case of casually looking around the net and then suddenly being reminded of a certain game you used to play way back in the age of DOS based games … wow .
For those of you who remember Stunts ( aka 4D Sports Driving ) , just the mere mention of the name will bring back a lot of great memories of the track editor , racing against those crazy AI opponents , the strange glitches and trying to get yourself to ricochet off an obstacle and fly hundreds of metres into the air …
For those of you who do n’t know what the hell I ’m talking about , prepare to be schooled …
Like many other DOS games of the time , it had killer music … though not much of it , only the intro and start menu from what I can remember .
It ’s the kind of music that you immediately remember when you hear it and associate it to this classic game … in fact , here ’s a YouTube video to highlight exactly what I mean …
The game is a pretty simple concept … you have fast cars , you race them around a track with obstacles , such as jumps and loops , against a timer or a computer controlled opponent .
There were a number of preset tracks and a selection of real world cars to choose from including the Lamborghini Countach , Porsche 911 Carrera 4 and Honda NSX … though do n’t expect Gran Turismo realism out of them … this was a DOS game after all .
Going up against the timer was pretty fun , but nowhere near as fun or as crazy as challenging the computer controlled opponents .
When going head to head against the computer , you ’re actually able to choose from a number of profiles to race against … basically just a more fun way of setting the difficulty level of the AI .
Although , and it may just be misguided memories from back then , I ’m pretty sure the computer player ’s personality would change depending on which profile you chose for the opponent .
For example , one profile would go absolutely nuts , swerving all over the place if you passed him and took the lead … but another profile would drive more aggressively and end up taking back the lead in what has to be hax driving .
Of course , the best part of Stunts came from its track editor .
I remember I used to spend hours making up the wackiest tracks with the most stupid obstacles until I eventually discovered that you could send your car flying into the air if you crashed a certain way … so then I spent hours created tracks that would allow me to fly as high into the air as possible … .
I think I remember doing that with San Francisco Rush : Extreme Racing on the N64 too …
It would be truly awesome if this game was remade … it ’s the perfect time for a Stunts revival with people swapping track data and seeing crazier and crazier tracks being built and conquered .

10 % rise in housing price in 4 hours By Zhang Jiawei ( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2010-04-14 11:37
A Hangzhou resident who decided to buy an apartment worth 1.5 million yuan ( $ 220,000 ) from an agent was told four hours later the price had increased by 10 percent , the chinanews.com.cn reported Wednesday .
" Buying an apartment is a lifetime thing ; I can't decide in a hurry and should talk with my family first , " the woman surnamed Lou told staff from the housing agent who was urging her to buy the second hand house at 1.5 million yuan .
But four hours later , Lou got another call from the housing agent telling her she had to pay 1.65 million yuan if she wanted to buy the apartment she had viewed , and that other people were queuing to buy the property .
Lou was not alone in suffering this situation .
Another woman surnamed Liu paid a deposit to a housing agent to buy a second hand apartment for her son's wedding in Hangzhou , but later she was told the owner would rather pay back her deposit and an additional 50,000 yuan in default payment than sell the apartment .
Liu is now seeking legal advice .
" The housing market is decided by market rules and we are not convenient to comment this matter , " the chinanews.com.cn cited a person in charge of Hangzhou 's housing authority as saying .
DURHAM , N.C. , April 7 , 2010 — Duke University has instituted a new “ sexual misconduct ” policy that can render a student guilty of non-consensual sex simply because he or she is considered “ powerful ” on campus .
The policy claims that “ perceived power differentials may create an unintentional atmosphere of coercion . ”
Duke ’s new policy transforms students of both sexes into unwitting rapists simply because of the “ atmosphere ” or because one or more students are “ intoxicated , ” no matter the degree .
The policy also establishes unfair rules for judging sexual misconduct accusations .
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) is challenging the policy .
“ Duke ’s new sexual misconduct policy could have been written by Mike Nifong , ” said FIRE Vice President Robert Shibley .
“ Members of the men ’s basketball team could be punished for consensual sexual activity simply because they are ‘ perceived ’ as more powerful than other students after winning the national championship .
Students who engage in sexual behavior after a few beers could be found guilty of sexual misconduct towards each other .
This is not just illogical and impractical , but insane .
Given its experience during the lacrosse team rape hoax , Duke , of all schools , should know better than to institute such unjust rules about sexual misconduct . ”
The new policy was introduced at the beginning of the school year with fanfare from the Duke Women ’s Center — the same center that apologized for excluding pro-life students from event space in a case FIRE won last month .
Women ’s Center Director Ada Gregory was quoted in Duke ’s student newspaper
The Chronicle justifying the new policy , saying , “ The higher [ the ]
IQ , the more manipulative they are , the more cunning they are … imagine the sex offenders we have here at Duke — cream of the crop . ”
( In a follow - up letter to The Chronicle , Gregory claimed that the quote was inaccurate and did not reflect her views , but stood by her analysis that campuses like Duke are likely to harbor smarter sex offenders who are better able to outwit investigators . )
Duke ’s vastly overbroad definition of non-consensual sex puts nearly every student at risk of being found guilty of sexual misconduct .
Students are said to be able to unintentionally coerce others into sexual activity through “ perceived power differentials , ” which could include otherwise unremarkable and consensual liaisons between a varsity athlete and an average student , a senior and a freshman , or a student government member and a non-member .
Further , students are said to be unable to consent to sexual behavior when “ intoxicated , ” regardless of their level of intoxication .
Duke has turned mutually consensual sexual conduct , which might merely be poorly considered , into a punishable act .
Adding to the confusion , if both parties are intoxicated at all , both are guilty of sexual misconduct , since neither can officially give consent .
North Carolina law does not support this definition of consent .
“ Of course , there is no way that everyone who was intoxicated during sexual activity , let alone ‘ perceived ’ as more powerful , is going to be charged with sexual misconduct , ” said Adam Kissel , Director of FIRE ’s Individual Rights Defense Program .
“ Add to that the provision about an unintentional atmosphere of coercion , and anyone can see that Duke ’s policy is impossible to rationalize or to fairly and equitably enforce .
As a result , this policy effectively trivializes real sexual misconduct , which is a gravely serious crime . ”
The new policy even makes reporting of so - called sexual misconduct mandatory for any Duke employee who becomes aware of it , regardless of the wishes of the alleged victim .
Furthermore , Duke has made fair enforcement of the sexual misconduct policy even more difficult by establishing different procedures and even a different “ jury ” to judge sexual misconduct complaints .
For instance , sexual misconduct charges are judged by two faculty or staff members and only one student , but all other offenses are judged by a panel of three students and two faculty or staff members .
Duke fails to explain why a jury with a majority of one ’s peers is necessary for charges like assault or theft but not sexual misconduct .
Other problems in the sexual misconduct policy , detailed in FIRE ’s letter to Duke President Richard Brodhead of March 4 , include giving the complainant more rights than the accused , requiring the results of a hearing to be kept secret in perpetuity even if one is found not guilty or is falsely accused , and allowing anonymous and third - party reporting so that the student may never be able to face his or her accuser .
FIRE wrote , “ As a private university , Duke is not obliged to agree with the authors of the Bill of Rights about the value of the right to face one ’s accuser .
Nevertheless ,
Duke ignores their wisdom at the peril of its own students and reputation . ”
Duke has declined to respond to FIRE ’s letter in writing .
“ More than any other school in the nation , ” Shibley said , “ Duke should be aware that its students deserve the best possible rules and procedures for ensuring that rape and sexual misconduct charges are judged fairly .
Sexual misconduct is a serious offense .
Duke students deserve a policy under which true offenders will be punished but the innocent have nothing to fear . ”

Most skeptics are aware , but it cannot be repeated too often : Temperature data presented before the global warming movement really started in the mid 1980 ´ies compared with recent official temperatures shows that the temperature trends 1940 - 1978 has been changed fundamentally .
I believe the best way to show this is simply to compare temperatures of the largest possible temperature area from before the 1980´ies with the same area presented today .
The area best suited for this is the entire Northern hemisphere .
Temperatures in National Geographic 1976 :
( Alternatively NH temperatures from Stanley 1975 )
Now compare the 1935 - 1975 decline for the same area – the entire Northern hemisphere – presented by CRU / Brohan 2006 :

State wildlife officials Wednesday ruled that the California tiger salamander deserves protection as a threatened species , subjecting landowners to more scrutiny if they want to build or farm in the amphibian 's habitat .
The California Fish and Game Commission made the decision after finding roughly 400,000 acres of the amphibian 's habitat is threatened by future development and the expansion of farming , mostly in the Central Valley .
The tiger salamander lives in nearly half the state 's counties , in a region that stretches from Yolo County to Santa Barbara County .
" We have learned over the years , at our peril , that remoteness is no guarantee of conservation , " commissioner Michael Sutton said .
" What is remote today may well be suburban sprawl tomorrow . "
The 3 - 2 vote came over the objections of the wine industry , business groups and home builders , which complained scientists were unable to show accurate population counts for the salamander and had exaggerated how much rural land might be developed in the future .
" This recommendation relies principally on anticipated loss of habitat , " Tim Schmelzer , who oversees regulatory affairs at the Wine Institute , told the commission .
" That projected loss is considerably overstated . "
For example , similar federal protections and local city and county plans that guide future development were not consulted , Schmelzer said .
At least one commissioner agreed with the industry , questioning state scientists who predicted at least a third of the salamander habitat would be developed over the next 10 years without any protection .
" It 's insanity .
It will never happen , " said commissioner Daniel Richards , who voted against the listing .
The tiger salamander breeds in seasonal pools and ponds , but spends most of its 10 - year life underground primarily in the Central Valley .
Those key spawning habitats have severely diminished over the years .
In 1997 , only 12 percent of the Central Valley 's 5 million acres of historical seasonal pools remained , said Sonke Mastrup , chief deputy director at the Department of Fish and Game .
The remaining habitat is also at risk for being broken up and isolating the species , Mastrup said .
The tiger salamander was listed as a federally protected species in 2004 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
The state commission , which met in Ontario ( San Bernardino County ) , had twice previously denied listing the salamander and was sued in 2004 by the Center for Biological Diversity .
A state appellate court ordered the Department of Fish and Game to reconsider the issue .
State law is typically more protective of vulnerable species than federal law , leading to worries that farmers , developers and vintners might have to do more to protect the salamander if they want to build or move into sensitive habitat .
Lacking witnesses but blessed with hundreds of hours of video , the cops and spooks worked the case of the slain weapons smuggler like a movie in reverse .
Dubai ’s cameras never blink .
The security system allows law enforcement to track anyone , from the moment they get off an airplane , to the immigration counter where their passport is scanned , through the baggage claim area to the taxi stand where cameras record who gets into what cars , which log their locations through the city ’s automated highway toll system , all the way to their hotels , which also have cameras .
Which brings us to the Bustan Rotana hotel on the night of Jan. 19 , and an assassination made to look like a run -of - the - mill heart attack .
The dead man , as the world now knows , was a 50 - year - old Hamas commander named Mahmoud Mabhouh , wanted by Israel in the killing of two Israeli soldiers .
Once Dubai investigators narrowed the time of death to 8 to 8:30 p.m. , they quickly found that seven people in the Bustan Rotana had no business being there .
Using facial recognition software , a source familiar with the investigation said , a team of 20 investigators pored over hours of security camera videos to sketch out a picture of the suspects ’ movements and accomplices , a group that has grown to at least 27 people .
They tracked down taxi drivers and grilled them about the suspects .
They even traced the trip of a female suspect to a shopping center and discovered what she bought .
For years , the United Arab Emirates has been using its considerable oil wealth to build up its defense and security infrastructure , including the National Security Agency , the secret police , which is playing a key role in the investigation .
“ They buy the best , ” said Kamal Awar , a retired Lebanese army officer and editor of Beirut - based Defense 21 , a regional military magazine .
“ They bought the latest technology in satellite and communications . ”
In the end , a mixture of high - tech razzle - dazzle and old - fashioned investigative work cracked the case .
“ What it takes is a few skilled police officers putting stuff on the board and figuring out who relates to what , ” said Col. Patrick Lang , a former U.S. military intelligence officer who served in the Persian Gulf for years .
“ It ’s not a magic thing .
It ’s a question of thinking clearly . ”
A homicide in disguise
The middle - aged man was splayed out dead in his hotel room as if he ’d gone into cardiac arrest .
The door was chained from the inside .
Coroners surmised that he ’d died of natural causes .
But one doctor noticed an abnormality in the blood .
He later spotted strange puncture marks on a leg and behind an ear .
And after the Palestinian militant group Hamas informed Dubai authorities that the dead man was Mahmoud Mabhouh , they decided it could n’t hurt to double - check .
Blood samples were sent abroad .
Days passed .
When the toxicology reports showed that he ’d been given a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic , Dubai authorities knew they had a high - profile homicide on their hands .
Though Mabhouh was no friend of the Emirates , authorities were furious about the killing .
“ The whole operation was based on one key assumption : that the death will be recorded as a natural death , ” Mustafa Alani , an analyst at the Gulf Research Center , a Dubai think tank , said of the assassins .
“ And that was the downfall .
The reason why they were so careless was because they thought there would be no investigation . ”
At least half of the passports used by the 27 suspects bore the names and registration numbers of Israeli dual citizens who held British , Irish , Australian , French or German passports , leading many experts to believe that Israel ’s spy outfit , Mossad , had forged the identities .
Israeli officials have been tight - lipped about the case and refused to confirm or deny the nation ’s involvement .
None of the suspects captured on video or identified in passport photos , including a bottle - blond and an assortment of beefy , balding guys wearing rectangular glasses , have come forward to deny or confirm their involvement .
Interpol announced last week that it was joining the international investigation .
“ Investigative information provided by the authorities in Dubai bore out the international links and broad scope of the number of people involved , as well as the role of two ‘ teams ’ of individuals identified by the Dubai police as being linked to al - Mabhouh ’s murder , ” Interpol said in a statement .
An unlikely place to strike
Perhaps no hotel in Dubai is less amenable to an assassination than the upscale Bustan Rotana , in the Garhoud district adjacent to the airport .
The circular building ’s rooms are arrayed around a vast airy atrium .
“ If you ’re sitting in the lobby you can see the door to every room , ” said Theodore Karasik , a security analyst at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Affairs , a think tank with offices in Dubai and Beirut .
“ If there ’s a scuffle , you can see and hear it . ”
Security experts around the world have also puzzled over the apparent size of the hit team : 27 bearers of Western passports and , according to Hamas , two or three Palestinians .
Some security experts said the assassins knew what they were doing , organizing themselves into evacuation , surveillance and execution teams .
But others see a classic bureaucratic blunder .
“ You have a surveillance team and a counter - surveillance team and the technical people as well as the security people around the perimeter , ” said Lang , the former U.S. military intelligence officer .
“ Once you start doing that , you have to have shifts .
You have to have two or three sets of these people and rotate them .
Once you start doing it that way you ’re going to have a lot of people . ”
The assailants apparently entered the hotel room without any struggle , suggesting that someone on the team knew Mabhouh .
A fatal dose of the powerful muscle relaxant succinylcholine quickly paralyzes its recipient and ultimately mimics the effects of a heart attack .
It should have killed Mabhouh within 15 minutes .
But something must have gone wrong , said the source with knowledge of the investigation , because the assassins pressed a pillow against Mabhouh ’s face for one or two minutes until he suffocated .
“ They were panicking for one reason or another , ” said the source .
The hit team tidied up the room and laid Mabhouh out as though he ’d suffered a massive heart attack and dropped dead .
Dubai Police Chief .
Lt. Gen. Dhahi Khalfan Tamim told satellite channel Al Arabiya that “ the murderers tried their best to mislead us . ”
A knack for putting things together
Just as police were about to conclude that it was a natural death , a Palestinian man trying to contact Mabhouh learned of his death and telephoned his family in Gaza .
It was only then that Hamas officials contacted Dubai police , Tamim said .
“ Dubai police are very good at piecing together crimes , ” analyst Karasik said .
“ I ’ve seen it before when you had robberies or murders occur and you ’ll forget about the story and then six months later the guys are arrested via Interpol , brought back here and then they disappear into the system . ”
Although Mabhouh ’s assassins managed to enter the country , kill him and get out without getting caught , the case has generated what most analysts consider unwelcome fallout for Israel , which most suspect of being behind the attack .
Authorities are now reexamining the death of Faisal Husseini , a charismatic Palestinian leader who died in his Kuwait hotel room in 2001 .
“ Now we know their tradecraft , ” said Alani .
“ We know how they operate . ”
If Mossad agents were behind the attack , the operation blew the identities of 27 agents ; it takes up to five years to train each agent .
“ They ’ll never be able to go outside of Israel again , even with disguises , ” Karasik said .
“ Biometrics means all of the contours of your face are on file . ”

Mr. Easterly and others have criticized Mr. Sachs as not paying enough attention to bigger - picture issues like governance and corruption , which have stymied some of the best - intentioned and best - financed aid projects .
Image Sauri was the first of more than 80 projects across Africa .

The New York Times
For example , one can easily picture what would happen in Kenya , where corruption is essentially a national pastime , if there were a free , donor - supported fertilizer program for the entire nation .
The fertilizer would very likely never reach its intended target and would disappear like the national grain reserves that were plundered during a famine in 2008 , or the billions of dollars of foreign aid that have ended up in the pockets of Kenyan politicians , according to numerous reports by human rights groups and financial auditors .
Mr. Sachs says he is the first to admit that he can not do it all .
In Kenya , he says , to eradicate poverty nationwide , the country ’s leaders would need to improve infrastructure and urban industries substantially .
“ What we ’re focusing on , ” he said , “ is about one - third of the problem . ”
Another criticism is that Mr. Sachs is not evaluating his programs in a rigorous , scientific way .
Many aid experts have suggested that the only way to really know if the Millennium Villages are worth the expense ( around $ 110 per capita , per year ) is to collect data from similar “ control ” villages that are receiving no help .
“ No one would dream of ‘ scaling up ’ the use of a new pharmaceutical in the U.S. without rigorous evidence comparing people who got the medicine to people who did not , ” said Michael Clemens , a research fellow at the Center for Global Development .
But Mr. Sachs says that “ Millennium Villages do n’t advance the way that one tests a new pill . ”
Beyond that , he does not like the idea of going into a village , subjecting poor people to a battery of questions and then leaving them empty - handed , though other aid specialists have said that studying poor people without giving them anything in return is done all the time .
“ It pains me to be in a village that does n’t have bed nets ” to protect against malaria - carrying mosquitoes , he said , adding that some comparison studies were under way .
Since joining the Fox News Channel as a legal analyst in 1998 , former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Napolitano has emerged as one of America 's most prominent champions of limited constitutional government .
He 's the author of five bestselling books , including Constitutional Chaos and Dred Scott 's Revenge : A Legal History of Race and Freedom in America , the regular fill - in host for Fox News superstar Glenn Beck , and the host of his own popular FoxNews.com show , FreedomWatch .
In his latest book , Lies the Government Told You : Myth , Power , and Deception in American History , Napolitano takes a broad look at the government 's long war on the truth .
Associate Editor Damon W. Root spoke with Napolitano in his office at Fox News headquarters in New York .
Reason :
You begin your book with the Declaration of Independence and end with the debate over ObamaCare , hitting almost every point in between .
Has the government been lying to us all along ?
Judge Andrew Napolitano :
Yes , the government has been lying to us all along .
Think about it .
The very same generation — in many instances the same human beings — that wrote " Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech " also wrote in the Alien and Sedition Acts just 10 years into the country that you can go to jail if we do n't like what you say .
These guys did things which were directly contrary to first principles .
And among them was the obviously erroneous , self - serving proclamation that " all men are created equal . "
They were n't !
I mean , half those guys owned slaves , even the person who wrote that phrase owned slaves .
He did n't buy them — he inherited them — but he owned them .
Reason :
You emphasize the role of crisis and war in government lying .
Napolitano :
War is the health of the state .
That is a self - evident truth .
Because in wartime people unite behind whoever the commander in chief is .
They part with their wealth more easily .
They accept restrictions on their personal behavior .
We now know — economists have demonstrated — that none of the rationing during World War II was necessary .
That was n't done to have coffee or sugar or leather for the soldiers .
That was done to keep people at bay , to give them a feeling that they were cooperating in the war effort .
Any type of crisis is an opportunity for the government to take liberty and take property and turn those into power for itself .
Reason : Each of your chapters is devoted to a different government lie .
I was struck by how many of the lies were direct quotes from the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution .
Napolitano :
The biggest lie is not one of those chapters , it 's all of the chapters taken together : lack of fidelity to the Constitution .
When they take an oath to uphold the Constitution they do n't really mean it .
Just the other day , this congressman from Illinois , Phil Hare , said " I do n't worry about the Constitution . "
Reason : Rep. James
Clyburn once told you that the Constitution does n't apply to most of what Congress does .
Napolitano : Clyburn , bless his soul , was candid but wrong .
" Where in the Constitution is health care prohibited to the Congress ? " he said .
This was prompted by a question on - air from me about where in the Constitution is the federal government authorized to regulate health care .
When he turns that around , he misunderstands the Constitution .
The Congress is n't a general legislature that can regulate any behavior , tax any event , it 's a legislature of precisely limited powers .
Reason :
It was a rare example of some honesty from the government .
Napolitano :
You know what he said later in that interview ?
He said we do what we think the people want and let your buddies in black robes — referring to my former colleagues on the bench — worry about whether or not it 's constitutional .
Again , he 's being very candid .
That allows members of Congress to go back home and say , " We got you this .
The courts took it away . "
So they win both ways .
They do n't have to pay for it , because the courts took it away , and they win political support because they tried to give it to the people .
Reason :
You agree with Rep. Clyburn in a way .
You call for judges to be " constitutional activists . "
That 's very different from a lot of conservatives , who advocate judicial restraint .
Napolitano : I am not a conservative , I am a libertarian .
I believe in the primacy of the individual over the state .
I believe in ironclad fidelity to the Constitution and I believe in the Natural Law , that there are areas of human behavior that are utterly and totally immune from government regulation .
Just because the majority rules does n't mean the majority is right .
That 's why we have an independent judiciary .
It is to be the non-democratic or even anti-democratic branch of government .
Otherwise there would be nothing to prevent the tyranny of the majority from taking our liberty or property just because they wanted it .
Reason :
Is that a useful check on the government 's lies ?
Napolitano :
It 's a check as long as judges do what they 're supposed to do .
When judges do what they did after FDR threatened to pack the Court and just supinely find ingenious ways to claim that something is interstate commerce when in fact it 's just wheat grown in somebody 's backyard , to declare that interstate commerce so the Congress has the power to regulate is a lie and a perversion of the judicial process .
If I were free to do so , one of the things I would change right away is to put the burden on the state to prove the morality , lawfulness , and constitutionality of its behavior .
Look , I believe the only legitimate function of government is to preserve our freedom .
And everything else the government does is illegitimate .
But I would let it make the argument in court .
What we have is the opposite .
The government does n't even have to make the argument in court .
It is presumed that whatever they do , no matter what it is , no matter what it takes , no matter what it compels , no matter what it steals , is constitutional just because the government has done it .
Reason :
You end the book with a call for a " major political transformation . "
What is the single most important reform ?
Napolitano : I would repeal the 17th Amendment [ which provides for the popular election of U.S. senators ] .
Can an amendment to the Constitution itself be unconstitutional ?
Yes , that one .
If you read Madison 's notes from the constitutional convention , they spent more time arguing over the make - up of the federal government and they came up with the federal table .
There would be three entities at the federal table .
There would be the nation as a nation , there would be the people , and there would be the states .
The nation as a nation is the president , the people is the House of Representatives , and the states is the Senate , because states sent senators .
Not the people in the states , but the state government .
When the progressives , in the Theodore Roosevelt / Woodrow Wilson era , abolished this it abolished bicameralism , the notion of two houses .
It effectively just gave us another house like the House of Representatives where they did n't have to run as frequently , and the states lost their place at the federal table .
That was an assault , an invasion on the infrastructure of constitutional government .
Even kings in Europe had to satisfy the princes and barons around them .
And that 's how they lost their power , or that 's how their power was tempered .
Congress believes it does n't have to satisfy anybody .
Its only recognized restraint is whatever it can get away with .
Reason :
What do you make of the recent attacks on the idea of states ' rights , linking it directly to evil things like the defense of slavery ?
Napolitano : Probably the best act of nullification of which I 'm aware , whereby a state government nullified an act of the federal government , was the state of Massachusetts nullifying the Fugitive Slave Act .
The state of Massachusetts said do n't even try it here .
We 'll prosecute anybody that kidnaps anybody else in this state .
So nullification has a beneficial and salutary history as well as the sordid one .
Reason :
You wrote that the notion of being innocent until proven guilty is " probably the least questioned and most believed government lie . "
Napolitano :
It 's drawn from my professional experience .
The defendant is dragged into the courtroom and the jurors assume he 's guilty .
Why would the government be wasting our time ?
When I would charge jurors — explain the law to them — I would insist on saying , " in order for him to be convicted you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty of his guilt . "
The state always objected to that phrase ( " and to a moral certainty " ) until I pulled out the case law by appellate courts saying that it was perfectly appropriate .
There are some horror stories in my book of people who were punished without trial .
In the Herrera case , [ defendant Leonel Torres Herrera ] was executed , with the state knowing that somebody else had committed the crime .
They just did n't care because he filed his petitions too late .
Chief Justice John Roberts , when he was Judge Roberts , was asked at his confirmation hearing , does the Constitution prohibit the execution of the innocent by the state ?
He paused and said yes .
Who could possibly pause ?
If it prohibits anything it prohibits that .
Reason :
Are you optimistic about any of this ?
It 's a pretty depressing book .
Napolitano : I always tell friends that my books do n't have a happy ending .
I am torn .
The pre-Vatican II Catholic side of me reminds me that hope is a virtue and I should always be optimistic .
But I 'm not naive .
I see what 's happening .

Some lit up bongs , some blasted Bob Marley and others waved flags emblazoned with the marijuana leaf in a Sunday afternoon protest outside police headquarters to protest the shuttering of Cannabis as Living Medicine .
Officers raided the Queen St. E. clinic of CALM , an organization that sells marijuana to medicinal users , on March 31 and charged nine people with a variety of drug - related offences .
On Sunday , some 300 people took to the street outside police headquarters to protest the raid and subsequent closure of the clinic , and to demand that Health Canada make it easier for those with medical needs to access the drug .
“ A lot of people need help from cannabis , but it ’s hard to get high - quality cannabis , ” said Neev Tapiero , CALM ’s owner , adding that the clinic ’s users have rallied in the wake of the closure .
“ Everyone ’s in great spirits ; the community is behind us . ”
Police officers lined both the north and south sides of the building behind security fences and shut down part of the street , but no incidents were reported .
The crowd was a mix , with dreadlock - sporting marijuana legalization activists rubbing shoulders with sufferers of epilepsy and people with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , who say the drug helps their conditions .
Kevin Clarke , a homeless man who briefly ran for mayor of Toronto , appeared at the protest , shouting at police .
Tapiero says it ’s an uphill battle to get Health Canada to change its policy around organizations like CALM , referencing recent statements by Prime Minister Stephen Harper implying he wants to keep a tight lid on marijuana .
“ I understand that people defend the use of drugs , but that said , I think I ’ve been very fortunate to live a drug - free life and I do n’t meet many people who ’ve lead a drug - free life who regret it , ” the prime minister said in a YouTube interview on the subject last month .
“ So obviously this is something we want to encourage for our children , for everybody ’s children . ”
Ron Marzel , CALM ’s lawyer , is hoping to file motion next week asking police to return some of the approximately 18,000 grams of marijuana and hash to users .
If the motion goes through , he says CALM could be back in business .
For now , however , the organization is operating without marijuana on the premises .
Instead , it ’s serving as a place for clients to co-ordinate for the court battle and organize a campaign of protest and pressure against Health Canada .
Tapiero is hoping a protest planned for May 1 at Queen ’s Park will draw tens of thousands .

Martin Afrika 's crudely tattooed body traces his life as a 20 - year member of Cape Town 's notorious 28 prison gang
Dan McDougall spent four months delving into Cape Town 's violent gang culture .
He witnessed young men - gangsters and drug addicts - turn to football to try to keep their heads above water .
But ultimately , he explains , his journey left him despairing of a broken society , a place where those growing up in the streets and townships of the rainbow nation are prisoners not of apartheid 's legacy and race , but of the true blights of modern South Africa - gangs , murder and drugs .
Martin Afrika sits before me brimming with dark menace .
" When you join the gang you can never leave - do you understand ?
These tattoos , these numbers in ink , they are here forever man , " the 32 - year - old career gangster , a member of South Africa 's notorious 28s prison gang , told me .
Despite weeks spent following his life on the streets of Cape Town , and seeing him close to tears as he grappled to explain the lure of gang life , I confess that I still have an unnerving , primal fear of him .
While they play football , they 're not out robbing , stealing , causing chaos around the city
Barney Stevens , MylifE Foundation
I first met Martin in his role as striker of a street football league that plays each week in the shadow of Cape Town 's gleaming new stadium - soon to host World Cup matches .
Two years earlier , Martin had been nearby , sucking on a pipe filled with crystal meth - known here as tik - when he was asked to join in a game .
A new ' high '
The MylifE Foundation , which uses football to lure young men away from Cape Town 's spiralling culture of gangs and drugs , was offering him another path and Martin soon found that the highs of goal scoring replaced the highs he craved from street drugs .
" Everyday when I play football , my mind does n't go back to gangsters , does n't go back to drugs , " he told me .
MylifE 's Barney Stevens , himself a former cocaine addict who now coaches the team , said : " While they play football , they 're not out robbing , stealing , causing chaos around the city . "
Obscenities are tattooed across Martin 's body For Martin , every inch of his bullet - scarred face and crudely tattooed body bears the marks of his past life .
The top of his left thumb is gone - a twisted stump and as Martin catches my gaze , he explains matter - of - factly that it was shot off as he ran away from a deadly gang battle .
It is in this Cape Town where the developing world 's townships are spilling over into the rainbow nation 's first world dream .
The overwhelming scale of gang life in Cape Town is alarming .
The city has around 150 gangs , with an estimated 100,000 members .
According to Cape Town 's respected Metro police chief , Rob Young , gangsters and the drugs they peddle are responsible for about 80 percent of crime in the area .
" Children are left to grow up on the streets and they will grow up with the rules of the streets and that is the problem we are dealing with , " he said .
Booming drugs trade Apartheid 's end has made things worse .
With overmatched police constrained by numbers and resources , the gangs in Cape Town 's poor neighbourhoods have grown in brutality and sophistication .
Well - armed , they have moved into lucrative rackets such as drug dealing , gun-running and money laundering .

As South Africa opened up after all - race elections in 1994 , the drug trade in particular boomed , providing a cash boost to the gangs that control it .
The reform of apartheid 's brutal policing and legal system has made it easier for gangs to get guns and more difficult for police to act decisively against them .
Martin says his own gang initiation began when he was abandoned to the streets by an alcoholic mother at the age of five .
He says she taught him his first and arguably only real lesson in life .
Trust no one .
By the age of 10 and living in the Cape Flats , a loosely connected chain of townships which holds some of the most desolate and violent communities in all of South Africa , Martin found a new family in the gangs and graduated while in prison to the notorious 28 gang - with a history that dates back to 1906 when 28 black prisoners , incarcerated by the British , revolted .
What started as a move to defy the atrocities of the white prison regime more than a century ago is now a feared and ruthless gang that operates both on the streets and behind bars of the city 's prisons .
Respite in football Martin 's life as a drug runner for his gang landed him in prison for the first time when he was just 12 .
" My childhood was about gangsterism and drugs , " says Martin .
" It is all I ever knew .
It is all I will ever know . "
Almost 20 years after Martin fell under the spell of the 28s , the gang continues to recruit children from broken families who wander the streets .
Among the likely future recruits is Martin 's own four - year - old son , Renauld .
He took me to meet the boy and his mother , Chantelle , a tik addict who , when I met her , was barely coherent .
The cupboards are empty , the electricity long since shut off .
Renauld is left to the streets and the random care of neighbours and Martin sees no way out for the boy .
Martin said his own criminal history means that he cannot seek custody of Renauld and he despairs that his young life is already pre-destined to gangsterism .
Reporter Dan McDougall despaired at the gangs , murder and drugs culture " I do n't want his life to end up the same as mine , to be put out of the house at five .
I 'm trying my best . "
Two years ago , Martin found respite from gang life through football .
" I found that I was a good player man , " he says of the talent he did not know he had until that pick - up game .
" I scored many goals and everyone was congratulating me .
It was better than drugs . "
Within a year Martin said he was winning his battle with drugs and even took part in the Homeless World Cup , representing South Africa at football in Italy .
He agreed , along with five of his football teammates , to film for us in order to help us gain insight into gangland life .
But despite his confidence that he was leaving his past behind , he was not strong enough to act as an observer .
On his third trip to film for us , Martin disappeared for nine days .
He had sold the camera equipment we loaned him and spent the money on an epic drugs binge that led to his arrest .
" You do n't leave the gangs .
You do n't leave the gangs .
This mark is here forever , " he told me after his arrest .
Football it seemed , was n't enough to save Martin Afrika .

Also from the Climate Desk : A look at domestic legal strategies to address global warming .
The Pruné ?ov power station is the Czech Republic ’s biggest polluter : Its 900 - foot - high smokestack pushes a plume of white smoke high above the flat , featureless fields of northern Bohemia . *
Pruné?ov reliably wins a place on lists of Europe ’s dirtiest power plants , emitting 11.1 million tons of carbon dioxide each year .
So when CEZ Group , the state - controlled utility , proposed an overhaul to extend the facility ’s life for another quarter of a century , protests flared — including one from a place about as far from the sooty industrial region as you can get , a place of tropical temperatures and turquoise seas with not a smokestack in sight .
This January , the Federated States of Micronesia , some 8,000 miles away in the Pacific Ocean , lodged a legal challenge to the Pruné ? ov plant on the grounds that its chronic pollution threatens the island nation ’s existence .
Is that , well — legal , you might ask ?
In international law , there ’s an established principle called transboundary harm , which means that if a Canadian factory belches toxic chemicals into a river , fouling a reservoir in Vermont , sooner or later the people at the Canadian factory will be hearing from some American lawyers .
For the first time , Micronesia applied this tenet to climate change — arguing that its survival is jeopardized by any large power plant that does n’t curb its carbon footprint .
“ They ’re using a very creative approach to the international legal process , ” says Durwood Zaelke , president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development .
A groundbreaking transnational legal action might sound like a tall order for a country of 107,000 people whose most high - profile endeavor to date has been hosting the 16th season of Survivor .
Yet Micronesia has incentives to get innovative .
NASA satellite maps show that the nation inhabits the spot where sea levels are rising most rapidly .
For the past three years , abnormally high tides have assailed the islands , souring the soil and salting the aquifer , making it impossible to grow taro , one of the country ’s few staple foods .
Last year , the government declared a national emergency and spent more than 7 percent of its budget of $ 42 million to ferry bags of rice and drinking water to its low - lying islands .
Professor Charles Fletcher , a geologist from the University of Hawaii who has conducted research in Micronesia , said , “ This is the first situation I ’m aware of where sea - level rise has led to threats to food and water security . ”
Micronesia made its move against the Pruné ? ov plant on January 4 , when it filed a formal objection under the Czech Republic ’s environmental impact assessment law .
( Czech law does n’t limit which nations can participate in this process ) .
In response , the government first postponed its decision on the plant , and then called in an independent Norwegian firm to assess the plant ’s carbon output .
In March , the government decided to allow the plant to proceed — but the decision was so controversial that the environmental minister quit in protest .
With the world ’s top carbon - emitting nations seemingly unable to come up with a binding climate treaty , both environmental lawyers and representatives of small island nations are increasingly looking for other forms of leverage .
While Micronesia ’s effort did not succeed this time around , environmental lawyers hope it will encourage similar experimentation with legal tools that could be used to pressure big emitters to clean up their act .
“ If we can take our gaze to an international court , that would be an avenue the government may have to explore , ” said Andrew Yatilman , Micronesia ’s director of environment and emergency management .
One lawyer thinking along similar lines is Matthew Pawa , one of the lead attorneys on a pioneering lawsuit in which the Inupiat community of Kivalina , Alaska , is suing 19 US oil and utility companies , including BP and ExxonMobil .
The case is based in part on a simple nuisance claim — the same common - law principle you might deploy to sue your neighbor if he opened an obnoxiously loud nightclub next door .
Kivalina claims that the companies ’ carbon emissions are helping to melt the sea ice on which the village sits , which will require it to be relocated at a cost of up to $ 400 million .
That case was dismissed by a California court but is now on appeal ; Pawa is seeking overseas clients , too .
Environmental lawyers point to several possibilities for international claims .
Countries affected by oceanic changes could seek redress via the Convention on the Law of the Sea , although it ca n’t be used against the US — which has n’t ratified the treaty .
A nation could go after a polluter in the International Court of Justice on the grounds that its citizens ’ human rights would be violated if their country were wiped off the map — but , again , the US is not a signatory , and the ICJ is somewhat toothless .
A number of lawyers told me that the most promising avenue might be the common- law doctrine used in the Kivalina case .
Any nation could sue a US company in US court for a “ nuisance ” caused by climate change — Tuvalu v. ExxonMobil , if you will .
And a couple of island nations that were once American protectorates , like Micronesia and Palau , have legal compacts with the US that give them more powerful tools :
They could potentially sue a company or even a government agency , using domestic statutes such as the Clean Air Act .
Which is not to say that winning will be easy .
While the scientific evidence of climate change has hardened to the point of irrefutability , blaming someone for it in a court of law is a knottier business .
US judges have swatted down most climate lawsuits either by ruling that global warming is for Congress to address , or by finding that it would be unfair to hold a handful of companies responsible for damage caused by centuries of pollution across the world .
Nevertheless , industries are bracing for a tide of climate lawsuits .
The major insurer Swiss Re has warned that “ climate change - related litigation could become a significant issue within the next couple of years . ”
Pawa compares this nascent field to the epic court battles over tobacco and asbestos .
“ It ’s a process of learning by doing , ” said Pawa .
“ Just by bringing these cases over and over again , the judiciary [ and ] the public get used to the idea of liability . ”
According to a forthcoming United Nations study , the world ’s 3,000 biggest public companies could be on the hook for $ 2.2 trillion — more than 30 percent of their profits — if they were made to pay for the fallout of their carbon emissions .
In truth , legal challenges do n’t even need to reach that point to serve a purpose .
“ Lawsuits are part of an overall strategy to make the US move , ” one lawyer told me .
“ They could be a chip in some grand bargain for legislation :
We ’re going to eliminate liability for climate change , but we ’re going to get a really good deal on mitigation . ”
Hauling global companies to court would be an audacious gamble for tiny nations that rely heavily on foreign aid .
“ There are huge political risks , ” said Stuart Beck , Palau ’s ambassador to the UN .
But with world leaders already downplaying hopes for a binding treaty at the climate talks in Mexico this November , vulnerable countries are contemplating which is the larger hazard : angering their donors , or waiting patiently until the only aid they require is a bulk purchase of plane tickets .
As attorney Pawa puts it , “ Countries are literally being driven out of existence — they are going to turn to whatever systems they can .
Right now they ’re looking to require developed nations to reduce emissions .
In the future , I think they ’ll be looking for compensation . ”

In this image provided by NASA - TV astronauts Rick Mastracchio , left , and Clay Anderson work on the International Space Station early Sunday morning .
( ( NASA / Associated Press ) )
Spacewalking astronauts had to pull out a hammer and pry bar while attaching a big , new tank full of ammonia coolant to the International Space Station on Sunday , successfully driving in a stiff bolt after two frustrating hours .
The 346 - kilometre - high action unfolded on the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 13 .
Making their second spacewalk in three days , Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson banged and pulled and shoved , with no success , on the stuck bolt .
They undid the good bolts and jostled the 771 - kilogram , refrigerator - size tank in case it was misaligned .
Finally , the troublesome bolt slid into its slot .
" You got to be kidding me ! " shouted Anderson .
" Did it go in ? " astronaut Dorothy Metcalf - Lindenburger asked from inside .
" Yes , yes .
You got to be kidding me , " Anderson replied .
" It is in there . "
Then he paused for effect .
" Now what do we do ? "
As he turned the bolt a dozen times , Anderson urged , " Come on , baby .
Get on there .
Yeah , get 'er done . "
The astronauts inside kept urging the spacewalkers to take a break and rest their hands .
But they insisted they were n't too tired .
Nevertheless , Mission Control put off the fluid line hookups for the tank and a few other chores , saying they could be completed in the third and final spacewalk Tuesday .
Even with that , the spacewalk ran long at 7 ½ hours .
By then , the two were beat .
Steak and corn for dinner
Shuttle Discovery 's commander , Alan Poindexter , urged his two crewmen to " take it slow and easy " as they headed back inside .
And Metcalf - Lindenburger promised them a good dinner .
Anderson , a Nebraskan , got a hankering for corn — and steak — after Metcalf - Lindenburger complimented him with a baseball term .
" Clay makes turning bolts look like a can of corn , " she said , referring to an easily caught fly ball .
" That was a long , long day , and you did a really good job . "
The slot for the fresh tank was emptied earlier in the spacewalk , when Mastracchio and Anderson popped out a spent ammonia tank that had been on the space station for eight years .
The ammonia is circulated through radiators to cool the station 's electronics .
Removing the old tank also proved difficult .
One side of the boxy container got hung up on a mechanism , and Anderson had to tug it loose .
Then , as the spacewalkers were moving the old tank toward the robot arm for capture , Anderson got caught on a pit pin and lanyard .
" Jiminy Christmas , " he grumbled , freeing himself .
With the spacewalkers serving as lookouts , the robot arm placed the old tank on a space station rail cart for storage .
The tank was moved to another temporary location a few hours later , after the spacewalkers attached another handle on it .
During Tuesday 's spacewalk , the empty tank will be placed into the docked shuttle for return to Earth .
NASA plans to refill the ammonia tank and fly it back to the space station this summer as a spare .
That will be the next - to - last shuttle flight .
As Mastracchio and Anderson worked outside Sunday morning , their colleagues unloaded more supplies out of the cargo carrier delivered by Discovery last week and stuffed it with old equipment and trash .
The new ammonia tank also flew up on the shuttle .
Discovery will remain at the space station until Saturday .
Landing is scheduled for April 19 .
Apollo 13 's three - man crew blasted off April 11 , 1970 .
An oxygen tank ruptured two days later as the astronauts made their way to the moon .
The rescue became one of the most dramatic ever seen by the world and remains one of NASA 's shining moments .

A window cleaner died after stabbing himself in the groin repeatedly with a jumbo souvenir pencil , an inquest heard .
Jeffrey Burton ’s family and friends were baffled by his bizarre death , which was recorded as an open verdict because there was no evidence he was trying to commit suicide .
Mr Burton , 57 , was found by police in a blood - soaked room in his house in St Leonards , East Sussex , on September 27 .
Worried neighbours raised the alarm after they were unable to get hold of him .
When police broke into his house they found Mr Burton lying on his back , wearing only his underpants .
The room was splattered with blood and music was still playing on his stereo .
The giant blood - covered pencil was beside him .
He had a deep gash in his upper thigh .
East Sussex coroner Alan Craze told the Hastings inquest : “ It ’s a mystery to me .
If you were choosing to take your own life , that ’s not the way you would do it .
“ It seems to me that it ca n’t have been a single stab wound .
He seems to have worked on it .
The pencil was blunt . ”
Mr Burton ’s sister Patricia Goodell told the hearing the pencil had sentimental value to her brother as it once belonged to their late mother .
The inquest heard Mr Burton had suffered a single psychotic episode in 2006 but when he died he was sociable and healthy and looking forward to a holiday .
He had never tried to commit suicide before and did not leave a note .
Mr Craze said : “ It does n’t stack up .
Something very strange has gone on .
We
will never know what has caused him to create this awful wound . ”
An upper -crust Long Island housewife accused of hiring a hit man to off her hubby lamented she could only afford to maim him — but then was thrilled to learn she could whack him at a bargain - basement price of just $ 20,000 , authorities said yesterday .
That ’s the stone - cold , cost - calculating mentality of sick soccer mom Susan Williams , 43 , who allegedly hired an undercover cop this week to whack her husband of 21 years .
She was held yesterday on $ 1 million bail .
The twisted plot did n’t surprise her long - suffering spouse , Peter Williams .
His lawyer said the woman “ tortured ” the poor man with sick lies during their divorce in a grab for their million - dollar Garden City home and other cushy assets .
She even allegedly turned their four kids — ages 11 to 19 — against him .
“ I ca n’t believe it took her this long ” to try to kill Peter , said his divorce lawyer , Nancy Dreeben .
“ She ’s a desperate woman , and she will just do whatever she needs to do to get what she wants .
She ’s a narcissist . ”
Dreeben said Susan admitted she cheated on her husband during their marriage — even bedding the real - estate lawyer for whom she worked before he fired her .
Susan stole marital assets and then , after filing for divorce in 2008 , falsely accused Peter — a 46 - year - old fence - company owner — of physical violence against their kids and of forcing her to have deviate sex , Dreeben said .
Those claims were never substantiated and Susan a year later even willingly agreed to allow Peter visitation rights , the lawyer noted .
Peter Williams , 46 , a Baldwin resident who is now working to get custody of his kids , said , “ I am thankful that the person that my wife sought to help in hiring a hit man had the decency to contact the appropriate authorities — otherwise I would probably be dead . ”
But yesterday , Susan ’s lawyer painted a different picture , accusing the husband of being abusive and a deadbeat dad .
“ There ’s a long history of problems , physical and sexual , ” in the marriage , attorney Stanley Kopilow said .
“ He ’s not a nice guy . ”
Susan ’s dad , Brendan Galligan , sobbed outside his Long Island home while defending his daughter .
“ She had no money , and he was n’t paying for anything .
She was having a very hard time , ” Galligan said .
“ We tried to help her as best we could as parents , but now this happens , ” he said .
“ It ’s totally devastated my wife and me . ”
Dreeben admits
Peter has failed to pay court - ordered monthly child support of $ 11,000 because he can’t afford it .
She also said that sky - high amount was set by a judge after Susan lied about the couple ’s finances .
Susan was busted Thursday after authorities secretly recorded her negotiating with the “ hit man ” — actually an undercover cop .
Susan had previously asked an unidentified man for help in arranging the attack on her husband , Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice said .
That man contacted the DA .
“ Initially it was , ‘ I want him hurt , ’ ” Rice said .
“ Then it became , ‘ I want him gone . ’
“ She did n’t think she could afford [ a murder ] .
She did n’t realize it was so cheap .
When the $ 20,000 amount was thrown out ” by the purported hit man , “ she then made it clear what she wanted him to do , ” the DA said .
After learning the price , Susan allegedly forked over a $ 500 down payment as well as her husband ’s photo and personal information , but no more money changed hands .

( CNN ) --
As the country was sinking into its worst financial crisis in more than 70 years , Security and Exchange Commission employees and contractors cruised porn sites and viewed sexually explicit pictures using government computers , according to an agency report obtained by CNN .
" During the past five years , the SEC OIG ( Office of Inspector General ) substantiated that 33 SEC employees and or contractors violated Commission rules and policies , as well as the government - wide Standards of Ethical Conduct , by viewing pornographic , sexually explicit or sexually suggestive images using government computer resources and official time , " said a summary of the investigation by the inspector general 's office .
More than half of the workers made between $ 99,000 and $ 223,000 .
All the cases took place over the past five years .
" It is nothing short of disturbing that high - ranking officials within the SEC were spending more time looking at pornography than taking action to help stave off the events that brought our nation 's economy to the brink of collapse , " said Rep. Darrell Issa .
The Republican is the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
" This stunning report should make everyone question the wisdom of moving forward with plans to give regulators like the SEC even more widespread authority , " he said .
" Inexplicably , rather than exercise its existing regulatory enforcement authority , SEC officials were preoccupied with other distractions . "
SEC spokesman John Nester said the employees involved have been disciplined or are being disciplined .
Some have been suspended or dismissed , he said , adding that the SEC has further increased penalties for misusing government resources in recent months .
" We will not tolerate the transgressions of the very few who bring discredit to their thousands of hardworking colleagues , " he said .
The investigation came to light on the same day President Obama gave a speech in lower Manhattan , calling for reform in the finance industry .
On Capitol Hill , the Senate is working on a financial reform bill that would set up regulatory oversight of the financial industry 's practices with the goal of preventing another Wall Street meltdown like the one in 2008 that launched the U.S. recession .
The bill includes an " early warning " system intended to spot signs of crisis , as well as a $ 50 billion liquidation fund created with money from banks and other finance industry corporations to ensure an orderly transition in closing down failing entities .
It was recently approved by the Senate 's Banking and Agricultural committees .
The House passed its version of the bill in December .
The inspector general 's report includes specific examples of misuse by employees .
A regional office staff accountant tried to access pornographic websites nearly 1,800 times , using her SEC laptop during a two - week period .
She also had about 600 pornographic images saved on her laptop hard drive .
Separately , a senior attorney at SEC headquarters admitted to downloading pornography up to eight hours a day , according to the investigation .
" In fact , this attorney downloaded so much pornography to his government computer that he exhausted the available space on the computer hard drive and downloaded pornography to CDs or DVDs that he accumulated in boxes in his office , " the inspector general 's report said .
Madison —
A district attorney is telling Juneau County schools to abandon their sex education courses , saying a new curriculum law could lead to criminal charges against teachers for contributing to the delinquency of minors .
Starting in the fall , the new law requires schools that have sex education programs to tell students how to use condoms and other contraceptives .
Juneau County District Attorney Scott Southworth said such education encourages sex among children , which is illegal , and could lead to charges against teachers .
The new law " promotes the sexualization - and sexual assault - of our children , " Southworth wrote in a March 24 letter to officials in five school districts .
He urged the districts to suspend their sex education programs and transfer their curriculum on anatomy to a science course .
" Forcing our schools to instruct children on how to utilize contraceptives encourages our children to engage in sexual behavior , whether as a victim or an offender , " he wrote .
" It is akin to teaching children about alcohol use , then instructing them on how to make mixed alcoholic drinks . "
Rep. Kelda Helen Roys ( D - Madison ) , who helped write the new law , said Southworth 's letter was irresponsible and that it was laughable to think teachers could be charged for telling students how to use contraception .
" Using condoms is n't a crime for anyone , " she said .
" This guy is not a credible legal source on this matter , I 'm sorry to say .
His purpose is to intimidate and create enough panic in the minds of school administrators that they 'll turn their backs on young people and their families . "
She said the Legislature passed the law because comprehensive sex education is the most effective way to change sexual behavior and reduce teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases .
Caught in the middle are schools , said Tom Andres , superintendent of the New Lisbon School District .
" Here we are again - short of money , getting a dictate that we have to do something different from two different sources , " he said .
Andres said district officials are studying Southworth 's letter and will consider it in the coming months as they decide what to do .
" The challenge with it is as soon as you start discussions with this issue , the morality aspect , the spiritual aspect . . . the family aspect has to be weighed , " he said .
" We do n't sit here and condone premature sexual behavior , yet it 's a societal reality .
So how do we deal with it ? "
When the new law was approved , all Republicans in the Assembly and Senate voted against it .
Gov. Jim Doyle , a Democrat , signed it in February .
The law requires schools that have sex education courses to teach students medically accurate , age - appropriate information , including how to use birth control and prevent sexually transmitted disease .
It also requires the classes to include information about how to recognize signs of abuse and how alcohol can affect decision making .
The classes also must inform students that teenagers who have sex can wind up on the state 's sex offender registry because sex with children 16 or younger is a crime .
Under the law , parents can remove their children from sex education classes as they could before .
Schools also would be allowed to not offer sex education , but they would have to notify parents they did not offer such courses .
" What we are asking educators to do is provide information , " said Rep. Tamara Grigsby ( D - Milwaukee ) , who helped write the law .
" In no way is that encouraging sex . "
Charges possible
Southworth , a Republican , says in his letter that he could charge teachers with contributing to the delinquency of a minor , depending on the specifics of cases he reviews .
" If a teacher instructs any student aged 16 or younger how to utilize contraceptives under circumstances where the teacher knows the child is engaging in sexual activity with another child - or even where the ' natural and probable consequences ' of the teacher 's instruction is to cause that child to engage in sexual intercourse with a child - that teacher can be charged under this statute " of contributing to the delinquency of a minor , he wrote .
He said the law went too far because it required teachers not to teach students about the effects of birth control , but on how to properly use them , " which turns objective instruction into implicit encouragement and advocacy . "
Southworth said in an interview that he could n't say how likely he would be to file charges if districts taught sex education under the new law because it would depend on the specifics of any case .
" I 'm not looking to charge any teachers , " he said .
" I 've got enough work to do . "
He disputed claims by Roys and Grigsby that he was inciting fear in teachers or trying to promote his political views , saying he had an ethical obligation to tell districts his interpretation of the law .
" If I 'd wanted to be ideological , I would have said in the letter you should n't have sex before marriage because that 's the Christian perspective .
I'm an evangelical , " Southworth said .
Southworth 's letter says the law undermines parental authority and requires schools to condone controversial sexual behavior because they have to teach students about gender stereotypes .
That likely would require schools to teach students about homosexuality and transgender and transsexual people , he said .
He said the law prevents teachers from telling students " that sexual promiscuity is even wrong " and would conflict with most students ' and teachers ' religious beliefs .
He said the law also opened the door to having sex eduction taught by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin , which provides contraception and abortions and lobbied for the changes .
Chris Taylor , public policy director for Planned Parenthood , said his group goes to schools only when invited .
Other districts
Officials with the Necedah Area School District received the letter , but the district has not taught sex education for years , said Charlie Krupa , the school superintendent .
Officials with the Mauston School District and Royall School District said they had n't decided how they would handle sex education in light of the new law .
An administrator with the Wonewoc - Center School District did not return a call .

The European Commission recommended the start of formal membership talks with Reykjavik , suggesting that the country could complete negotiations in little more than a year , with a further 12 to 18 months for formal ratification .
The recommendation , which needs to be approved by the 27 E.U. nations , comes ahead of a referendum due on March 6 over a law on the repayment of € 3.9 billion , or $ 5 billion , from the defunct Internet bank Icesave to the governments of two E.U. countries .
A no vote in the referendum could destabilize the Icelandic government and derail its E.U. membership bid .

Since its incorporation just over five years ago , Facebook has undergone a remarkable transformation .
When it started , it was a private space for communication with a group of your choice .
Soon , it transformed into a platform where much of your information is public by default .
Today , it has become a platform where you have no choice but to make certain information public , and this public information may be shared by Facebook with its partner websites and used to target ads .
To help illustrate Facebook 's shift away from privacy , we have highlighted some excerpts from Facebook 's privacy policies over the years .
Watch closely as your privacy disappears , one small change at a time !
Facebook Privacy Policy circa 2005 :
No personal information that you submit to Thefacebook will be available to any user of the Web Site who does not belong to at least one of the groups specified by you in your privacy settings .
Facebook Privacy Policy circa 2006 :
We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook ; that is why we give you control of your information .
Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your school , your specified local area , and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about .
Facebook Privacy Policy circa 2007 :
Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings ( e.g. , school , geography , friends of friends ) .
Your name , school name , and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network unless you alter your privacy settings .
Facebook Privacy Policy circa November 2009 :
Facebook is designed to make it easy for you to share your information with anyone you want .
You decide how much information you feel comfortable sharing on Facebook and you control how it is distributed through your privacy settings .
You should review the default privacy settings and change them if necessary to reflect your preferences .
You should also consider your settings whenever you share information .
...
Information set to “ everyone ” is publicly available information , may be accessed by everyone on the Internet ( including people not logged into Facebook ) , is subject to indexing by third party search engines , may be associated with you outside of Facebook ( such as when you visit other sites on the internet ) , and may be imported and exported by us and others without privacy limitations .
The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “ everyone . ”
You can review and change the default settings in your privacy settings .
Facebook Privacy Policy circa December 2009 :
Certain categories of information such as your name , profile photo , list of friends and pages you are a fan of , gender , geographic region , and networks you belong to are considered publicly available to everyone , including Facebook - enhanced applications , and therefore do not have privacy settings .
You can , however , limit the ability of others to find this information through search using your search privacy settings .
Current Facebook Privacy Policy , as of April 2010 :
When you connect with an application or website it will have access to General Information about you .
The term General Information includes your and your friends ’ names , profile pictures , gender , user IDs , connections , and any content shared using the Everyone privacy setting .
...
The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Facebook is set to “ everyone . ” ...
Because it takes two to connect , your privacy settings only control who can see the connection on your profile page .
If you are uncomfortable with the connection being publicly available , you should consider removing ( or not making ) the connection .
Viewed together , the successive policies tell a clear story .
Facebook originally earned its core base of users by offering them simple and powerful controls over their personal information .
As Facebook grew larger and became more important , it could have chosen to maintain or improve those controls .
Instead , it 's slowly but surely helped itself — and its advertising and business partners — to more and more of its users ' information , while limiting the users ' options to control their own information .

Even among serious beer drinkers , many do n’t know much about lambics .
They tend to be hard to find and expensive , but that does n’t mean you should n’t try them .
Lambics are a delicious and often forgotten corner of the beer world .
Here ’s an introduction to this quirky and delicious type of beer .
One of the reasons for lambic ’s relative obscurity is the limited number of brewers who can actually make it .
Much like real champagne only comes from the Champagne region in France , real lambic is only brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium .
The name lambic is thought to be derived from a village in the area , “ Lembeek . ”
The reason for limited area is the unique strains of yeast used in lambics only grow in this region .
Instead of the carefully cultivated and preserved strains of yeast that are added to ales and lagers , lambics get their yeast through spontaneous fermentation of wild , natural yeast .
The unfermented beer ( known as wort ) is laid out by the brewer in the open air and wild strains of yeast and bacteria are allowed to naturally find their way into it .
Afterwards the lambic is sealed in huge wooden casks , 10 feet tall and over 6 feet wide that can hold almost 11,220 litters of beer each .
There it is allowed to ferment and age , usually for over 2 years .
Afterwards it will be released and blended in one of several styles .
Gueuze ( pronounced GER- ser )
A blend of young , one - year - old lambic and older two or three - year old lambic which then undergoes secondary fermentation in the bottle .
These beers tend to be very sour and tart with light and dry mouthfeel , similar to champagne or hard cider .
Many find the taste of gueuze to be too overpowering , but it ’s really unlike any other beer in the world and has to be tasted to be believed .
Fruit Lambic
This is gueuze which has been blended with fruit juice or brewed with raw fruit .
The sweetness of the fruit is used to counterbalance the tart nature of the lambic on its own .
Raspberry ( framboise ) , peach ( pêche ) , blackcurrant ( cassis ) , and cherry ( kriek ) are popular flavors .
Although there are many great “ wild ales ” brewed in the US and elsewhere which employ some of the bacteria and yeast used in lambics , true lambic has to be from Belgium .
When shopping for lambic avoid American attempts at the style like Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic and stick with the imported stuff .
Lindemans is probably the biggest producer of lambic .
All of their fruit and geuze varieties are worth a try , but their framboise is a personal favorite .
Oude Gueuze from Hanssens is probably my favorite gueuze .
Cantillon and Boon breweries make some terrific lambics as well .
What do you think of lambic ?

( CNN ) -- Color - changing frogs , the world 's longest stick insect and a slug that shoots " love darts " are among the biological " treasure " discovered by scientists in the lush green heart of Borneo .
Scientists have found 123 new species of animals , insects and plants on the South East Asian island since the three governments that control the land signed a pact to safeguard its future in 2007 .
The new species are on a list released Thursday by the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) to mark Earth Day and to raise awareness of the value of protecting areas rich in biodiversity .
" You have some iconic small species which are very interesting to talk about but perhaps it's the plants that are tremendously important in terms of potential future cures , " said David Norman , director of campaigns for the WWF .
" About half of all synthetic drugs have a natural origin -- these are commercial drugs based on plants and sometimes animals .
So we can't afford to lose species , " he said .
The number of new plant species discovered in Borneo in the last three years outnumbers all the other categories combined .
Sixty - seven new plants have been found , along with 29 invertebrates , 17 new species of fish , one bird , five amphibians and five reptiles .
The WWF describes the region as a " global treasure teeming with unique and extraordinary life . "
Some of the more unusual amphibians found there include color - changing frogs , which also fly .
Males of the species ( Rhacophorus penanorum ) are just 3.5 centimeters long and their skin changes from bright green during the night to brown during the day .
They can be found living in trees in the Tapin Valley within the Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak .
Their fully - webbed feet allow them to glide for up to 15 meters from tree branch to tree branch .
The tail of the long - tailed slug ( Ibycus rachelae ) is three - times the length of its head , allowing it to curl up to sleep .
More unusually , when it mates the slug fires a so - called " love dart " made of calcium carbonate that injects a hormone into its prospective partner to increase the chances of reproduction .
The world 's longest - stick insect ( Phobaeticus chani ) is more than half a meter long and lives high up in the rainforest canopy .
" Only three specimens have ever been discovered .
It 's quite extraordinary that it 's been there for so long -- you would n't miss it if it landed on you , " Norman said .
The rate of the discovery of new species has increased since 2007 when the governments of Indonesia , Malaysia and Brunei signed an agreement to conserve the area .
The agreement covers a 220,000 square kilometre tract of land that straddles all three countries which is known as the Heart of Borneo .
" This not just a nature reserve .
There are lots of people who live there .
Farming goes on there .
There is eco-tourism .
These are all things that must continue .
The point is to ensure that the value of the forest standing is much greater than the value of it being cut down , " Norman said .
The WWF says the Heart of Borneo Declaration has worked to conserve the environment by exerting pressure on governments , developers and industry to adapt their plans to minimize their impact on the land .
It credits the agreement with preventing the destruction of two million hectares of rainforest to create the world 's largest palm oil plantation .
Plans to build a road through the middle of the region in 2007 were also shelved for environmental reasons .
" About half of all the land in the heart of Borneo lies in private hands .
It 's so remote you can't possibly enforce this , so this is very much about negotiating agreements .
Whenever there is a new proposal for a new road or a new farm or a new plantation or a new mine , it is worked through in the context of the agreement that was signed in 2007 , " Norman said .
Meanwhile , scientists are still busy surveying the tangled mass of plants , animals and insects that thrive in the hot , humid conditions of the Borneo rainforest .
The WWF says it is impossible to predict how many more new species will be found .
" It is so difficult to know how many species there are on the planet .
Scientists sometimes estimate maybe there are 10 million species in total out there and we 've only described 1.7 million of them so far , " Norman said .

Political leaders have headed off on the campaign trail after Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the UK general election would be held on 6 May .
He said he would seek a " clear " mandate to continue the " road to recovery " , as Labour bids for a fourth term .
David Cameron , whose Conservative Party has been ahead in the polls , said they offered " hope " and a " fresh start " .
Nick Clegg , leader of the UK's third biggest party the Liberal Democrats , said only they offered " real change " .
Shortly after announcing the date at Downing Street , Mr Brown boarded a train and headed to Kent to meet voters at a supermarket in Rochester .
Mr Cameron headed to a hospital in Edgbaston , Birmingham , before addressing a rally in Leeds while Mr Clegg met young people in Watford .
All three are leading their parties into a general election for the first time .
Announcing the widely - predicted 6
May election date after meeting the Queen , Mr Brown said he wanted a " clear and straightforward mandate " to continue the work of economic recovery .
He said he would be travelling the country telling voters : " Britain is on the road to recovery and nothing we do should put that recovery at risk . "
CORRESPONDENT VIEW
Ben Wright
BBC political correspondent
So today we have Labour pitching itself to voters as the party of experience - stewards of an economic recovery that 's still fragile , and protector of public services .
Gordon Brown is asking the country to stick with him and not risk a switch to the Conservatives .
It 's an echo of the Tories ' campaign in 1992 .
But David Cameron is determined not to be the Kinnock of this contest .
His speech to party activists was an effort to lift the aspirations of a politically weary electorate .
Mr Cameron knows that it's not enough to show that his party 's changed , and today promised real economic and political reform .
A smaller state is the thread running through his appeal .
Nick Clegg is calling for the c-word too - but change to a new way of doing politics that cracks open the two - party dominance .
So is this a classic choice of change versus more of the same ?
The opinion polls provide no answer and many voters remain undecided or fed up with politics after the expenses scandal .
Add in the televised debates and this feels like a very different sort of contest .
Election day at - a - glance Reactions from the web
He added : " We will not allow 13 years of investment and reform in our public services , to build up the future of these great services , to be put at risk . "
Mr Brown also said he would produce a plan to make politics more transparent and accountable .
Stressing his " ordinary middle - class background " , he said Labour would " fight for fairness at all times " .
Mr Brown said : " We will say to the British people : ' Our cause is your cause ' , " before adding : " Let 's go to it . "
But Mr Cameron said he offered a " modern Conservative alternative " and his party offered " hope , optimism and change " and a " fresh start " .
" It 's the most important general election for a generation .
It comes down to this .
You do n't have to put up with another five years of Gordon Brown . "
He criticised 13 years of Labour 's " big government " and said it was time for the Tories ' " big society " instead .
He pledged to work for the " great ignored " , who he described as " honest hard - working people " who " do the right thing " .
" Let 's get off this road to ruin and instead get on the path to prosperity and progress , " he said .
Addressing party supporters later in Leeds , he attacked Labour 's economic record and said the public should " never forget " that Gordon Brown presided over the longest recession in more than 60 years .
Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said the election campaign would not be a " two - horse race " between the two biggest parties , and people were " crying out for something different " .
He said it would be a choice " between more of the same from the old parties ... or real change , something different from the Liberal Democrats " .
" I think we just need to do something new this time , " he added .
Hung Parliament
The election campaign will be the first to feature live television debates between the three main party leaders in the UK .
BBC , Sky and ITV announced the first 90 - minute debates would be on ITV on Thursday 15 April , the next on Sky on 22 April and the last on the BBC on 29 April .
Few could doubt Gordon Brown 's determination to win the general election but many question his ability to do so
The BBC's Iain Watson
Brown 's hurdles to clear Cameron 's challenge Clegg 's battle ahead
The three main parties - along with a host of other smaller parties - will be fighting for 650 seats , four more than currently exist because of constituency boundary changes .
SNP leader Alex Salmond , the first minister of Scotland , hopes his party will win 20 seats at Westminster .
He told the BBC the other parties had " blown the gaffe " by outlining plans for deep cuts .
" In these circumstances the need for Scotland to have national champions in the SNP is greater than ever before , " he said .
He said the SNP would work with Plaid Cymru in the event of a hung parliament to try to secure the best deals for Scotland and Wales .
Plaid Cymru 's leader Ieuan Wyn Jones added : " We want to secure the best deal for Welsh communities in this election .
And in a situation where no party has overall control in the next parliament then we will be fighting for a fairer funding system for the people of Wales . "
DUP leader Peter Robinson told the BBC the election would be a " defining moment " for Northern Ireland : " It 's an opportunity for people to decide whether they want to move forward , whether they want to continue the progress , I think that will be the main issue , though the hung parliament issue will loom large . "
But he said , in the event of a hung parliament , the DUP would not be " in hock " to any of the main parties .
To secure an overall majority , a party must win at least 326 seats .
If no party succeeds in doing so , the result will be a hung Parliament .
This was not a day for surprises .
It was not a day for detail .
It was more a day of impressions carefully created and choreographed by the party machines .
Nick Robinson
BBC political editor
Read Nick 's thoughts in full Scots parties hit election trail Parties ready for election fight NI 's parties gear up for election After 13 years in power , Labour enters the election with a notional majority of 48 seats , meaning that a loss of 24 seats would see them lose their overall majority .
Whatever the result , a post - war record number of MPs are standing down at the election - 144 - so there will be a lot of new MPs in the next Parliament .
Parliament will not be officially dissolved until Monday 12 April .
MPs will have until close of business on Thursday to get remaining legislation , that the parties can agree on , through Parliament - a process known as the " wash - up " .
Commons leader Harriet Harman said this would include all stages of the Finance Bill , which enacts the Budget , and further debate on the Digital Economy Bill , constitutional reform and crime and security legislation .
The government will drop plans for a referendum on changing the voting system and to phase out remaining hereditary peers .
MPs will not return until Tuesday 18 May - later than the traditional start date of the week after the election .
A modernisation committee recommended a 12 - day gap after the election to allow for a proper induction for new MPs .
Opinion polls timed to coincide with the announcement all suggest a Conservative lead over Labour , by differing margins .
An ICM survey for the Guardian indicates the Tory lead has dropped to just four points , with the Conservatives on 37 % , Labour on 33 % and the Lib Dems on 21 % .
However a YouGov poll in the Sun and another by Opinium for the Daily Express suggest the Tories have opened up a 10 % lead - the margin David Cameron is likely to need in order to win an outright majority on 6 May .
The Sun has the Tories on 41 % , Labour on 31 % and the Lib Dems on 18 % .
The Express reports a 39/29/17 split .

Several animal species can easily be considered as true masters of disguise .
They have the magnificent ability to melt in with their environment so they almost look invisible .
Here you can see pictures of how animals camouflage in nature .
You can barely see the caterpillar on the green leaf , the light brown spider is not visible in the sand , and the green snake is safe on the top of a similar colored tree , and that ’s only a few of all the animals that use both color , shape and behavior to melt into the environment as good as possible .
If you ca n’t find the animal on some of the photos , comment below and tell us which one .
But the Bronx also faces stubborn hunger problems .
According to a survey released in January by the Food Research and Action Center , an antihunger group , nearly 37 percent of residents in the 16th Congressional District , which encompasses the South Bronx , said they lacked money to buy food at some point in the past 12 months .
That is more than any other Congressional district in the country and twice the national average , 18.5 percent , in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Such studies present a different way to look at hunger : not starving , but “ food insecure , ” as the researchers call it ( the Department of Agriculture in 2006 stopped using the word “ hunger ” in its reports ) .
This might mean simply being unable to afford the basics , unable to get to the grocery or unable to find fresh produce among the pizza shops , doughnut stores and fried - everything restaurants of East Fordham Road .
Precious , the character at the center of the Academy Award - winning movie by the same name , would probably count as food insecure even though she is severely obese ( her home , Harlem , ranks 49th on the survey ’s list , with 24.1 percent of residents saying they lacked money for food in the previous year ) .
There she is stealing a family - size bucket of fried chicken from a fast - food restaurant .
For breakfast .
That it is greasy chicken , and that she vomits it up in a subsequent scene , points to the problem that experts call a key bridge between hunger and obesity : the scarcity of healthful options in low - income neighborhoods and the unlikelihood that poor , food - insecure people like Precious would choose them .
Full - service , reasonably priced supermarkets are rare in impoverished neighborhoods , and the ones that are there tend to carry more processed foods than seasonal fruits and vegetables .
A 2008 study by the city government showed that 9 of the Bronx ’s 12 community districts had too few supermarkets , forcing huge swaths of the borough to rely largely on unhealthful , but cheap , food .

How Free Were American Women in the Gilded Age ?
By Bryan Caplan
I largely agree with David Boaz ’s recent attack on libertarian nostaglia .
While many Americans were freer in the Gilded Age than they are today , plenty were not .
But precisely who belongs on the list of people who have more libertarian freedom in 2010 than they did in 1880 ?
Boaz mentions “ Jews , blacks , women , and gay people . ”
For blacks , his case is obvious and overwhelming : Slavery was finally over , but blacks still suffered from both Jim Crow and private racist brutality .
The case for gays is similarly strong :
If you were openly gay in 1880 , you probably would have been prosecuted under the sodomy laws – and lived in fear of private violence even if the law left you alone .
However , it ’s hard to see why Jews belong on the “ freer than they used to be ” side of the ledger ; 19th - century America not only had legal religious toleration , but as far as I ’m aware , pogroms and other private anti-Semitic violence were virtually absent .
It ’s when we get to women , though , that things get interesting .
Women are more than half the population .
If they ’re freer today than they were in the Gilded Age , we can truly say that most people in America are freer today than they were before the rise of the welfare state .
On reflection , though , this is a very big if .
Without a doubt , women lived much harder lives in 1880 than they do today .
So did men .
In those days , almost everyone endured long hours of back - breaking toil .
But of course the standard libertarian take on this is that while freedom causes prosperity in the long - run , prosperity and freedom are n’t the same .
In what ways , then , were American women in 1880 less free than men ?
Most non-libertarians will naturally answer that women could n’t vote .
But from a libertarian point of view , voting is at most instrumentally valuable .
Will Wilkinson seems aware of this when he writes :
[ W] omen in 1880 had almost no meaningful rights to political
participation , ensuring that they were unable to demand recognition and
protection of their basic liberty rights through the political system .
Yet the fact that women were unable to vote in defense of their “ basic liberty rights ” does n’t show that American political system denied them these rights .
Did it ?
The main example that Will and others put forward is coverture .
Wikipedia ’s summary :
Under traditional English common law an adult unmarried woman was considered to have the legal status of feme sole , while a married woman had the status of feme covert …
A feme sole had the right to own property and make contracts in her
own name .
A feme covert was not recognized as having legal rights and
obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects .
Instead , through marriage a woman ’s existence was incorporated into
that of her husband , so that she had very few recognized individual
rights of her own .
As it has been pithily expressed , husband and wife were one person
as far as the law was concerned , and that person was the husband .
A
married woman could not own property , sign legal documents or enter
into a contract , obtain an education against her husband ’s wishes , or
keep a salary for herself .
If a wife was permitted to work , under the
laws of coverture she was required to relinquish her wages to her
husband .
In certain cases , a woman did not have individual legal
liability for her misdeeds , since it was legally assumed that she was
acting under the orders of her husband , and generally a husband and
wife were not allowed to testify either for or against each other .
Judges and lawyers referred to the overall principle as “ coverture ” .
I ’ll admit that coverture does n’t sound like a very libertarian doctrine .
On reflection , however , matters are much more complicated than they seem .
1. Marriage was still voluntary .
From a libertarian standpoint , coverture would only have been a serious problem if parties were not legally allowed to write alternative marital agreements .
As far as I can tell , such alternatives were legal :
One exception to the feme covert rule was in the instance of a
prenuptial contract .
All colonies accepted these contracts , but few
couples signed them .
Sometimes , parents
of wealthy daughters insisted on a contract to keep family property in
a trust for their daughter and her heirs ( daughters had no control over
trusted property , however ) .
Widows often drew up prenuptial contracts
before marrying again , but they had to obtain their new husband ’s
consent in order to keep the property inherited from their first
marriage through a contract .
2. Still , was n’t coverture a blatant attempt to “ nudge ” people in a patriarchal direction ?
Maybe , but as Sunstein and Thaler often point out , there ’s got to be some default contract .
The most libertarian option , of course , is separation of state and marriage , leaving the defaults up to private parties .
But the next most libertarian alternative , I think , is to defer to common definitions .
If by “ marriage ” most people mean “ monogamous marriage , ” it ’s reasonable for monogamy to be the default rule .
If by “ marriage ” most people mean “ a marriage where the wife needs her husband ’s permission to work , ” it ’s reasonable for that to be the default rule .
But did coverture capture how couples in the Gilded Age defined marriage ?
I ’m not sure , but it ’s actually pretty plausible .
Example :
At the time , almost all married women kept house and raised children .
When a couple decided to marry , this sexual division of labor was probably what both of them had in mind .
For a women to work outside the home against her husband ’s will was probably almost as contrary to their mutual expectations as adultery .
3 . While it ’s tempting to dismiss pre-modern legal doctrines as blind sexism , it ’s often unfair .
As the economics of the family teaches us , the traditional family made a lot of sense in traditional times .
In economies with primitive technology and big families , it makes perfect sense for men to specialize in strength - intensive market labor and women to specialize in housework and childcare – and for default rules to reflect this economic logic .
4 . Even if you think you can condemn coverture on libertarian grounds , the letter of the law rarely makes a difference in marriage .
In modern marriages , spouses can’t legally “ forbid ” each other to take a job , but as a practical matter they still need each others ’ permission .
Husbands are n’t legally required to hand over their earnings to their wives , but if a guy suddenly stops depositing his paycheck in their joint checking account , he can’t avoid dire consequences by protesting , “ I ’m within my legal rights ! ”
Coverture might have made a difference in a few marriages – especially in the upper classes .
But it ’s hard to see how this legal doctrine could have done much to restrict 19th - century women ’s freedom .
I know that my qualified defense of coverture is n’t going to make libertarians more popular with modern audiences .
Still , truth comes first .
Women of the Gilded Age were very poor compared to women today .
But from a libertarian standpoint , they were freer than they are on Sex and the City .

Atlas has the basic story largely right back in September as the following quote will show ( ignore the part apart being turned away from offices and the news value )
It 's too bad he 's chosen to tell the completely fabricated after - the - fact narrative constructed by Boehlert and others now .
" Like all large organizations made up of human beings , ACORN is not without flaws .
But it has a long history of quickly responding to its weaknesses .
After the videotape prank by two young right - wing activists posing as a pimp and prostitute seeking tax and business advice , ACORN ’s CEO Bertha Lewis quickly dismissed the offending employees .
Although no tax returns were filed , no loans provided , and ACORN ’s management oversight mitigated any further harm from taking place , Lewis has appointed a group of eminent experts , including former Maryland ’s former Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , to help implement necessary internal reforms .
This week , a former Massachusetts attorney general was named to oversee an internal review .
Meanwhile , Fox news broadcast these " gotcha " videos on a virtual round - the - clock basis , causing a controversy far out of proportion to its news value .
We now know the hidden tapes were doctored , misleading and in some cases probably taken illegally , and that contrary to the filmmakers ’ claims , they had been turned away from several ACORN offices . "

Yesterday , Daleyrocks wrote :
The " hoax " narrative only works on those who did not watch the videos as they came out or are too stupid to understand what they are seeing since it was clear from the first video O'Keefe did not wear the gaudy pimp outfit into the ACORN offices and that footage was edited onto the beginning and end of each video for effect .
This drew a response from me that blew so many holes in the good ship Daleyrocks that it swiftly sunk to the bottom of the lake that can be found at the corner of Brad Street and Democracy Blvd .
Today , @3 Daleyrocks writes [ emphasis added ] that John " Atlas has the basic story largely right back in September , quoting from Atlas ' piece wherein Atlas , whose piece emerged before the Harshbarger analysis and which gives no indication that Atlas had reviewed and compared the transcript and doctored videos , referred to the incident as a " prank by two young right - wing activists posing as a pimp and prostitute seeking tax and business advice .
But of course , the Harshbarger report , and the painstaking research reflecting in the numerous pieces posted here at The BRAD BLOG reveal that , for example , when they entered the ACORN Baltimore office , O'Keefe and Giles posed as a " dancer " and a " college " student --- a point Daleyrocks willfully choose to ignore .
Daleyrocks then adds something that is manifestly inconsistent with what he and the smear merchants at Fox , at Patterico and throughout the right - wing echo chamber have been saying .
Fox news broadcast these " gotcha " videos on a virtual round - the - clock basis , causing a controversy far out of proportion to its news value .
We now know the hidden tapes were doctored , misleading and in some cases probably taken illegally , and that contrary to the filmmakers ’ claims , they had been turned away from several ACORN offices . "
That last paragraph has be thunderstruck , Daleyrocks .
Is this you being converted , finally , to the truth ?
Judging from everything else you 've written , I suspect that I would be unduly optimistic to expect a Daleyrocks epiphany , but it would indeed be refreshing .

Ernie -
No holes here , dream on .
I included that second paragraph of Atlas ' out of fairness and also because it does no harm .
Now Ernie , contrast how you just referred to what happened in Baltimore above , with how you did in the comments to your 3/10 post :
What a load of crap !
" O' Keefe wore the outfit outside one ACORN office ; spliced it into every video , used voice - overs to make answers to what had been innocuous questions appear as if the ACORN employees were giving advice to a pimp and a prostitute when , in fact , they had posed , in the Baltimore office , for example , as a " dancer " and a " college student . " "
Since I just ripped you a new one in the comments down there about denying O'Keefe and Giles posed as a pimp and prostitute in Baltimore , I take it by your language above you have decided to stop lying about the situation .
That makes me happy .

Daleyrocks @ 5 wrote that I denied that " O'Keefe and Giles " posed as a pimp and prostitute in Baltimore . "
_____________________
I 'm beginning to understand why it is so difficult to communicate with you , Daleyrocks .
You 're dyslexic !
I never said that Giles did not , at some point during the Baltimore ACORN interaction , " pose as a prostitute . "
I wrote that when the scurrilous duo " entered " the Baltimore ACORN , Giles posed as a " dancer " and O'Keefe posed as a " college " student . "
If you read the Harshbarger report and actually take time to read and digest what I wrote in my article , and in my comment to you , Daleyrocks , you would know that : a ) Harshbarger interviewed many , many ACORN employees who were not on the supposedly complete transcripts .
Harshbarger says that the pair told a third part - time Baltimore ACORN employee , a receptionist , that Giles was a " dancer " and O'Keefe was a " college student . "
That receptionist was not recorded on audio , which suggests that the audiotapes and transcript do not provide a complete record of the representations Giles & O'Keefe made to ACORN and ACORN Housing employees .
b)
The first 14 pages of the Baltimore transcripts reveal that your deceptive , hero , the accused federal felon James O'Keefe , and his accomplice , Hanna Giles , hid what it was that Giles supposedly did for a living .
The word " prostitute " does not appear once until they secured the juicy sound - bites they were looking for and the ACORN tax lady says she 's looking for a code to apply to Giles ' theretofore unlabeled and undefined " business " that O'Keefe pops up with " there 's a code for prostitution " ?
c)
I did not say and have never said that Giles did not , at some point during their interactions at the Baltimore ACORN office , pose as a prostitute .
I did say that at no time did O'Keefe refer to himself as a pimp .
Giles never said O'Keefe was her pimp .
Neither said that O'Keefe would solicit customers for Giles or any other person . d)
I did say that it was utterly disingenuous for Patterico aka L.A. County Deputy DA Patrick
Frey to extract the words " we " and " cash for my campaign " out - of - context from page 40 of a 46 page transcript and make the claim that this amounted to " posing as a pimp " when the entire thrust of the transcript reveals O'Keefe representing time and again that he is a law student who was simply trying to help a friend , Giles .
Perhaps if you are incapable of reading and digesting what I actually write , you can get someone else to read my posts and comments to you aloud so as to overcome your dyslexia .
Further , Daleyrocks , you have failed to answer some direct questions I have posed to you .
1 ) Are you aware of any published news reports that suggested that ACORN was involved in aiding pimps or prostitutes before O'Keefe & Giles initiated " The Great Pimp Hoax " ?
2 ) If not , can you tell me what motive , if any , O'Keefe & Giles had for conducting this little charade in the first place ?
--- other than the unassailable inference that they targeted ACORN for this charade only because the hard - right 's years - long efforts to smear ACORN as a voter fraud organization has repeatedly blown up in the smug faces of the likes of Hannity , O'Reilly , Beck and the rest of the Fox propaganda team .
Per the Congressional Research Study 49 federal , state and local investigations of ACORN as of Oct. 2009 which failed to produce a single case in which someone improperly registered by an ACORN employee actually cast a ballot .
Wipe the floor with me ?
In your dreams my deluded right - wing friend .

Ernie the Attorney @ 10 - In comment 5 I merely quoted from a comment of yours in the thread to your post of 3/10 .
If you do not believe the words " as if the ACORN employees were giving advice to a pimp and a prostitute when , in fact , they had posed , in the Baltimore office , for example , as a " dancer " and a " college student " are intended to tell your readers that you do not believe Giles and O'Keefe posed as a pimp and a prostitute in Baltimore or you cannot write plain english if you believe they mean something else .
Please explain since you seem to have so many problems with words .
" Further , Daleyrocks , you have failed to answer some direct questions I have posed to you . "
Ernie -
It 's stupid of you to ask me about the motivations of O'Keefe and Giles .
As I 've mentioned before here , O'Keefe explained his motivations on Biggovernment.com when the videos first came out .
Why are you so dense ?
Ernie , you calling Patterico disengenuous because the pimp mention does n't come until page 40 of 46 - how many times and how early would have been sufficient to meet your standards ?
Are there rules about this sort of stuff , because you seem to be just sort of making it up as you go .
It 's not as bad as you and Brad picking out eight stories or clips that mention O'Keefe wearing a pimp outfit inside ACORN offices out of the thousands of stories and clips about the videos , though , and deciding those eight drove the story .
That 's disengenuous !

RE : Daleyrocks remedial schooling here ...
It 's amazing to watch these corporate - wealth funded trolls appear and demand they we hand walk them through line by line every story .
Personally I think that 's what they intend , for Bradbloggers to be weak readers and lazy writers so the trolls can have a " gotcha " moment .
I appreciate Brad and Ernie 's attention to detail and tedious spelling out of the matter at hand .
Even if the Daleyrocks types are n't paying attention or even care about the facts ... it does show the world that Brad and Ernie have a strangle hold of every issue they report or write about .
Brad and Ernie 's availability to hang around and defend their work has to be a mundane neccesity ... but I 'm glad they do .
I amazed that the right wing operatives still send only B - league trolls like Daleyrocks to this site to get their asses handed to them ... Brad , Ernie and the commenters here use guys like Daleyrocks as batting practice .
Maybe some time in the future ... we 'll see a major league right wing challenge here , Patterico could of been a contender ... but he turned out to be just a pretender .
Nevertheless ... Ernie that was a thorough dismantling of Daleyrocks best effort .

____________________________________
Fact # 1
I did not say that O'Keefe called himself a " pimp " until page 40 .
Fact # 2 O'Keefe did not call himself a " pimp " on page 40 or anywhere else in the transcript .
The word " pimp " appears only once , well into the discourse and this relates to the matter of rescuing Giles from her pimp , who is elsewhere described as " this other guy . "
Fact #3
During the first 40 pages of transcript , O'Keefe poses as a law student trying to simply help a friend .
At page 37 he says that he would have nothing to do with the house and that Giles would be completely " independent . "
At p. 40 O'Keefe slips in the word " we " and then says that they would use " cash for his campaign . "
While this would technically suffice to raise the question posed to a law student on a bar exam asked to spot a potential violation of CA PC 266h ( which does not actually apply in MD ) so as to prosecute for pimping under CA law ( accepting money from a prostitute can qualify as pimping in CA ) , it clearly did not meet the classic definition of a " pimp " , that is , someone who procures clients for a prostitute ; panders .
This point has been made over and over and over again to you , but you keep coming back either because you are too intellectually challenged or too dishonest to accept the unassailable truth .
Blue Hawk @ 21 : I 'm not certain there are any " A " league trolls .
Patterico , aka LA County Dep. DA Patrick Frey , was so overwhelmed by the unassailable facts that Brad and I assembled that he retreated back to his own site where he has been left to post mumblings about how ill Brad and I supposedly treated him .
Frey told his mindless followers that Brad and I have asked him to resign his position as an LA County Deputy DA --- something which neither of us ever suggested , though , if Frey wanted to take such a course , I would n't protest either .

DaleyRocks continued carrying water for Dep. D.A. Patrick " Patterico "
Frey , who has been attempting to carry water for admitted liar Andrew Breitbart , who has been attempting to carry water for accused felon and known hoaxster James O'Keefe @ 13 with : O'Keefe explained his motivations on Biggovernment.com when the videos first came out .
Well then , I guess we should just take the known liar and accused felon 's word for it then !
Why not ?
BTW , O'Keefe also said ACORN " receive [s ] billions in tax money " when " the videos first came out " ( he reported as much on Breitbart 's site with his very first video , over six months ago , and neither he nor Breitbart have yet bothered to issue a retraction or correction for that bit of " journalistic malpractice " as both would call it , to this day . )
It 's not as bad as you and Brad picking out eight stories or clips that mention O'Keefe wearing a pimp outfit inside ACORN offices out of the thousands of stories and clips about the videos , though , and deciding those eight drove the story .
That 's disengenuous !
Really ?
You 're sticking with that one ?
I have shown some 8 instances of the misreporting in just the New York Times alone since Harshbarger 's report was released in December ( unreported by the Times ) .
That does n't account for all of their misreports prior to the Harshbarger report .
Nor the scores and scores and scores of similar misreports by CNN , Fox " News " , AP , NPR , Washington Post , Dallas Morning News , Baltimore Sun and hundreds of other papers and media outlets .
So you 're serious with the above ?
Or being a disingenuous tool of the L.A. County Dep. D.A. Patrick
Frey who keeps stepping on the same rake over and over again , and then lying about it in hopes of hiding the bumps on his own head ?

Remedial Logic for Slippery Rocks : From Comment # 13 : If you do not believe the words " as if the ACORN employees were giving advice to a pimp and a prostitute when , in fact , they had posed , in the Baltimore office , for example , as a " dancer " and a " college student " are intended to tell your readers that you do not believe Giles and O'Keefe posed as a pimp and a prostitute in Baltimore or you cannot write plain english if you believe they mean something else .
Please explain since you seem to have so many problems with words .
To say that Giles and O'Keefe posed as a pimp AND a prostitute means that O'Keefe posed as a pimp AND Giles posed as a prostitute .
This statement would be true if BOTH are true .
The statement is false if only ONE of the propositions is false : Giles and O'Keefe posed as a pimp and a prostitute .
If true , then :
Giles posed as a prostitute .
AND
O'Keefe posed as a pimp .
If only ONE of these propositions is false , then the entire statement is false .
So :
Giles posed as a prostitute .
BUT
O'Keefe did NOT pose as a pimp .
Because the second proposition is false , the entire statement : Giles and O'Keefe posed as a pimp and a prostitute is FALSE , as Ernest stated .

Dead on right , you are , sir B .

Ernest writes in a previous thread : " ... They can't compete with the facts or the law , so they repeatedly raise bogus points , time and again , hoping that , if nothing else , they can get the two of use expending enormous time chasing facts they are already fully aware of --- or , in the case of Daleyrocks , misquoting me out - of - context , thereby forcing me to make the same point I had already provided in the body of this piece ...

Exactly .
I responded : ( forgive me for reposting myself but the comment in question is hung up in moderation over there (? ... Was it that pu*&y joke I told that time ? )
" Any other commenters would have been long banned for so many despicable turns of tide .
While I would n't mind seeing that happen , I am not advocating it .
I very much appreciate that you and Brad are giving them every benefit of the doubt to post here in good faith ( as they do not extend the same ) and every good grace to try to make their case based here based on the merits of rational debate ( as they can not rise to meet you in the same ) no matter much they whine and wheeze and call foul .
Friends .
You have defeated them .
They are unraveling in front of us .
I know you meant to hoist them on their own petard , but have n't they successfully hoisted their own petards to the moon and back by now ?... "
Not for nothing , but I 've been brainstorming some suggested ways of keeping their lies in check without allowing them to waste our time and talents ad infinitum ( tho I seriously doubt we 'll be seeing much of them over here now that they 've been so publically perma-stomped . )
What if we :
1. Limit our number of collective written rebukes per ridiculous comment / accusation / misleading info or lie / and or insult from them per post .
One rational steps up to do the smacking ( reassert the facts ) , redirect to sources that refute their bad / wrong data , and then we move on ; free to gleefully continue on our rightful track without giving them control of our discussion , reshape the facts to suit their nasty agenda .
2 . Try to economize your responses to them - they do n't read them , anyway .
They do n't .
Long , carefully worded , accurate responses are lost on them .
A gift they will return damaged and with no receipt .
You 're writing just to practice your writing when you 're writing to them .
So instead of prepping mini-essays , provide several strong sentences and include one or two Hot Links to reliable sources that refute their ever - parroted misinformation .
3 . ) Help Brad and Ernest by linking new readers to this series and the comment sections here as rejoinder for new and future attacks .
It 's all been said , said again , re-said , re-iterated , re-hashed , re-visitied , discussed and dismembered with each of us bearing witness .
Anyone with some residual gray matter will see right through them .
Oh , and it should be painfully obvious by now that they are NEVER going to answer your fine questions .
Ever .
They can't , so they wo n't , as Ernest rightly reasons above .
Ask them if you must , but do n't expect respect or response .
4 . ) Do n't call them by name .
They 're narcissistic and love the attention , even when it 's for all the wrong reasons .
Call them by the number of their comment .
Just sump - pumpin ' the brain .
That 's all I got for now .

We 're talking about the ability to move forward and backwards in time , building on the work of Tesla and others .
This technology also proves the existence of zero point energy that would totally transform this planet .
The problem is this knowledge is now in the hands of other governments around the world who are rapidly catching up to us .
If you think a nuclear war is a threat , imnagine a war between governments with the ability to manipulate time and space .
Dr. Anderson is trying desperately to raise public awareness that our government is suppressing this technology , and this is just one technology they are sitting on .

Here 's the " game " they played : they purposely mislead the media and everyone into thinking O'Keefe wore the Halloween pimp costume in the ACORN offices .
They knew everyone would think this .
The proof is that everyone DID think it .
Including the media .
Now they say : " Well , O'Keefe ( and we ) never specifically said that " .
Yes ... BUT , you sat by quietly when your plan worked to deceive everyone into believing he did .
THAT is how the whole plan works .
THEN , you say : " Well , we never SPECIFICALLY said that blah blah blah " .
But you never answer these questions : - Why did you sit by idly when everyone thought that ?
- Why did n't you proactively say : " Wait a minute !
He never wore the pimp costume " as media outlets were reporting that ?
The answer : it 's because the PLAN was to mislead everyone to think that and then be quiet about the truth .
THEN , if it was outed , you could honestly say : " We never specifically said that " .
But saying that , does n't get you off the hook , because that was your backup plan all along .
PERIOD !
So stop saying : " We never specifically said he wore the pimp costume " .
Do you think we 're stupid ???
And you did n't think of the plan to mislead people into thinking something , and the backup plan of saying you never specifically said it .
Bush mislead everyone into thinking Sadaam attacked us on 9/11 .
He never specifically said it , he just kept saying " Sadaam " and " 9/11 " a million times a day and showing pictures of Sadaam and the twin towers .
Then Bush honestly said : " I never said Sadaam did 9/11 " .
When asked , he was forced to say , " No , he had nothing to do with 9/11 " .
But that was never the point , was it !
The point was " ASSOCIATION " .
You can associate things and never specifically say it .
ASSOCIATION is as guilty as specifically saying it .
THAT is the point you are missing !
Not specifically saying it DOES NOT GET YOU OFF THE HOOK , WHEN YOU PURPOSELY ASSOCIATED THE IDEA !!!

Thanks , Big Dan .
Excellent link .
Now if we could somehow break through the corporate media 's electronic curtain and have the Sibel Edmonds story available in full to every citizen .

NYT did n't " botch " anything .
They set out to deceive , with malice aforethought , period .
Why does the NYT hate America ?

If they gave Oscars for acronyms , you 'd grab some gold for that one and be the most sought after acronym writer in the business .
And for what it 's worth ( and at the risk of coming across semi- smug ) - yours WAS a bullet - proof line of reasoning .
As was BlueHawk's .
And Ernest's .
And Brad's .

And T.R.O.'s.

And ( of course ) Big Dan's .
Even our Lasagna 's ' benefit of doubt extended ' further revealed them to be Gurus of DooDoo and Princely Purveyors of Poop .
When there is this much abundant , ample proof of poop ( A.A.P.O.P. ) as we have seen squeezed out again and again in this repugnant case , there can be no common ground green enough for any seedlings to take root .
All the Ca-ca in the world do n't make a bullshit garden grow .
This might be a good time to reiterate how much I appreciate your " deceiver " vs " believer " terminology as a way to distinguish our own course of rehabilitation ; possible deprogramming vs. dissembling strategies .
That 's a critical determination , as intent is all .
And as our beloved David Lasagna is keen to remind us , the believers are frightened and therefore may be better suited to the " Lasagnified empathic methodology . " ( L.E.M. )
FYI - I tend to not care that the believers are " frightened " , because it 's clear they WANT to be frightened .
My Aunt
Sue could never articulate what it was that was scaring her so - it was all these abstract and meaning - mauled FOX - isms .
Besides I 've been " frightened " by a TON of things the government has done in the last decade and it has n't driven me to bite off any fingers .
Tho ' I do harbor fantasies about severing a phalange or two on Liz Cheney 's right hand .

The whole ACORN thing was orchestrated top to bottom by a cabal of right wing operatives and their cohorts in the government and media .
Observing closely , you can read through this simply by the timing of the elements :
Planted news reports > pundit commentary > fake grassroots outrage > hearings .
Look at what 's happening to Toyota right now .
This is obviously being engineered to bring them down , with " real news " stories breaking about these massive recalls ( even NPR 's Diane Rehm convened a panel to exclusively douse Toyota in fear , doubt and suspicion ) .
Then Congress starts hearings , lawsuits ensue .
But the giveaway is the laser focus on Toyota , the # 1 ranked car .
In all this , not one defect or recall by Honda , Nissan , Subaru , Mazda , Scion , Hyundai , Mitsubishi ... or god forbid an American make .
Toyota was targeted by the smear machine , the new American way of doing business .

U.S. Treasury Jumps on 3 - D Bandwagon , Unveils Redesigned Benjamins
Fun 3 - D holograms give Mr. Ben Franklin a facelift for the new decade .
Words commonly used to describe mug shots include " menacing , " " pathetic , " " disturbing " and " hilarious " -- but usually not " sexy . "
So congrats , Dustin Winesberry .
The seductive , come - hither mug shot taken of you yesterday at Boulder County Jail looks like the cover of a ' 70s - era album -- say , Dustin Winesberry Gets Next to You -- by an R&B lover man .
If only you were n't a registered sex offender .
Bruce Haas , administrative commander for the Boulder County Sheriff 's Office 's jail division , admits to being caught off - guard by the snap .
" If I showed you a hundred mug shots , 99 of them would be fairly consistent : people with their hands down to their sides , looking forward and then looking sideways , " he says -- a comment borne out by our gallery of Denver 's 50 most wanted fugitives .
" So I was surprised by this one as well . "
What did Winesberry , 22 , do to earn this photo session ?
As reported by the Boulder Daily Camera , he was arrested after climbing onto the balcony of an apartment and trying to convince the women inside to hang out with him .
The invitation was n't appreciated :
One of the women called the cops , who busted him on suspicion of attempted second - degree trespass and transported him to the Boulder County Jail for that sultry closeup .
According to Haas , mug shots can be challenges to capture depending on the situation .
" Sometimes people come in intoxicated , and we try to get the picture the best way we can , " he says .
" But most people are cooperative . "
Maybe a little too cooperative in Winesberry 's case .
To Haas , " it looks pretty smug , " what with his hand on his chin , his eyebrows and his body cocked at a casual angle .
That 's why " I 'm going to be looking into this , to find out who took the picture , so we can make sure we do n't make a habit of taking those kinds of photos , " he says .
Too bad -- because this one certainly brought sexy back to an unexpected venue .
Streaming bei Pop - Portal : Last.fm streicht Kostenlos - Musik
Bis vor kurzem ließen sich beim Portal Last . fm Musikstücke in voller Länge anhören - werbefinanziert .
Das Modell ist gescheitert .
Konkurrenten wie Spotify zittern ebenfalls .
" Himmlische Jukebox " nannte Last.fm seine Idee - und den Nutzern gefiel sie naturgemäß : Seit 2008 war es beim deutschen , amerikanischen und britischen Ableger des viel benutzten Musikportals möglich , Songs und Alben zahlreicher Künstler kostenlos und in voller Länge bis zu drei Mal per " On Demand Streaming " ( " Musikströme auf Abruf " ) im Browser abzuhören .
Der Plan dahinter : Plattenfirmen sollte neben dem Direktverkauf von Musik die Möglichkeit gegeben werden , auch mit Online - Werbung Geld zu verdienen , das man sich dann mit Last . fm teilen könnte .
Zur Einführung des Dienstes , der jahrelang vorbereitet worden war und erst nach zähen Verhandlungen mit den Musikkonzernen umgesetzt werden konnte , sprach das Songportal gar von einer " Neugestaltung des Musikgeschäfts " , die man damit nun einleite .
Die Macher sagten das voller Stolz .
Von selbigem ist nun offenbar nichts mehr geblieben .
Wie Last.fm in dieser Woche in seinem Blog fast beiläufig erwähnte , wird das " On Demand Streaming " abgedreht .
Als Begründung wurde genannt , dass " die Beschäftigung der Nutzer mit anderen Funktionen wie den Profilen und den personalisierten Radiostationen " grundsätzlich größer sei als mit der Kostenlosmusik .
Man wolle deshalb lieber seine " Kernkompetenz " stärken , als verbindendes Element für Musikfreunde im Netz zu agieren .
Auch eigene Musikvideos will Last .fm nicht mehr einbinden : Allerdings kann man nach wie vor zufällig ausgewählte Songs einzelner Künstler in Form eines Pseudo - Radios hören .
Um die Nutzer nicht vollends zu vergraulen , will das Portal auf andere On - Demand - Angebote verlinken .
Blöderweise klappt das allerdings nicht in allen Ländern .
Jukebox - Dienste wie Spotify oder We7 , die weiterhin auf werbefinanzierte Gratis - Mucke setzen , sind etwa in Deutschland schlicht nicht nutzbar , weil ihnen die Rechte fehlen .
Das gleiche gilt für den von den Plattenlabels eingerichteten Musikvideodienst " Vevo " , den man nur inoffiziell außerhalb der USA und Kanadas erreichen kann .
Warum Last.fm seine " himmlische Jukebox " tatsächlich zum Absturz bringt , darüber schweigt sich das mittlerweile zum US - Medienkonzern CBS gehörende Unternehmen aus .
Beobachter gehen aber davon aus , dass das " On Demand Streaming " schlicht auf Dauer zu teuer war .
Die Plattenfirmen und Lizenzgeber der Künstler hielten stets die Hand auf , auch wenn keine ertragreiche Werbung neben dem Musikabspielprogramm erschien - ein Problem , das auch das Videoportal YouTube kannte und deshalb zwischenzeitlich ganze Musikvideobibliotheken sperrte .
Spotify , der Marktführer für kostenlose Musikstreams im Netz , dürfte die Entscheidung von Last . fm mit gemischten Gefühlen aufnehmen .
Zwar gibt es nun einen Konkurrenten weniger , der das eigene Angebot zudem verlinken wird .
Doch lenkt dies ein Schlaglicht auf das eigene Finanzierungsproblem : Auch hier scheint über Werbung noch nicht genügend Geld hereinzukommen , weswegen das Portal mittlerweile verstärkt auf die Vermarktung eines Monatsabos setzt .
Auch aus diesem Grund stockt die Expansion : Wichtige Märkte wie die USA oder Deutschland werden von der schwedischen Firma noch immer nicht bedacht , nur in Schweden , Norwegen , Finnland , Spanien , Frankreich und Großbritannien kann man über eine leicht bedienbare Client - Software soviel Musik hören , wie man möchte .
Andere neuartige Strategien , mit digitaler Musik abseits der üblichen kostenpflichtigen Downloads Geld zu verdienen , kommen ebenfalls nicht auf die Füße .
Nokias " Comes with Music " - Projekt , bei dem ausgewählte Handys gegen Zuzahlung mit einer unbegrenzten Anzahl an herunterladbaren Songs ausgestattet wurden , hat die hohen Erwartungen bislang verfehlt - knapp 110.000 Käufer sollen nur gefunden worden sein .
Auch hakt es am Kopierschutz : Die Songs funktionieren nicht mit herkömmlichen MP3 - Spielern wie dem iPod.
Ausgerechnet in China , einem Land mit hoher Rate an Musikpiraterie , verzichten die Finnen indes auf diese Maßnahme : Hier geht " Comes with Music " in diesem Monat ohne Rechteschutz an den Start - Erfolgsaussichten derzeit noch ungewiss .
Three years ago the International Cricket Council ran a World Cup in the Caribbean so inept that it made the Atlanta Olympics seem like a roaring success by comparison .
The region , so keen to take advantage of the profile offered by the event , instead was humiliated .
Overshadowed by the death of Bob Woolmer , it was – beyond a memorable opening spectacular in Trelawny – a fiasco , culminating in the farcical finish it deserved .
In wanting to present the essence of Caribbean cricket the ICC missed the point memorably .
New stadiums were built , designed to hold the thousands who never came because they had been priced out , alienated and subjected to ludicrously overstated security .
The disincentives to gaining enjoyment might have come straight from a puritan handbook .
But over the next three weeks or so there is a chance of redemption .
That the World Twenty20 comes so soon after the last edition , an outstanding success in England , is unfortunate , not least for the reigning champions Pakistan , but represents a recalibrating of the international calendar .
However , the opportunity for the region to re-establish its cricketing credentials is huge , with a hit - and - dash schedule to match the cricket .
The format is snappy , with group matches mainly in Guyana and St Lucia , all double - headers , designed to pare back a dozen teams to make a Super Eight series in Barbados .
Then come semi-finals in St Lucia and a final on 16 May at the magnificently redeveloped Kensington Oval .
The women 's tournament takes place on St Kitts , with semi-finals and final following those of the men .
The failure of India and Pakistan to make it through to the Super Eight stage of the last World Cup was a financial disaster for rights holders on the subcontinent .
From that perspective the biggest game was supposed to have been in Bridgetown between the two great rivals : Bangladesh against Ireland did not have the same allure .
For the next World Cup and indeed this tournament ICC has gone out of its way to try to ensure such an anomaly cannot happen .
But the shorter the game , the greater the chance of an upset .
T20 is set up for surprise results and so , if Bangladesh , Zimbabwe , Ireland and Afghanistan after their brilliant story are marked down as the fall guys , then the warm - up games – in which Zimbabwe have beaten Australia and Afghanistan thumped Ireland – have shown what a dangerous presumption that can be .
Of the four groups England 's , with West Indies and Ireland , is probably the easiest to predict .
The hosts are mavericks , potential winners even , and their new head coach , Ottis Gibson , may bring some discipline to their game .
But Ireland , realistically , ought not to be able to compete , though England 's defeat by Holland in the last T20 is still a sore point .
The Afghanistan story will probably come to an abrupt end in St Lucia , as they have to beat both South Africa and India .
But what to make of the remaining two groups ?
Zimbabwe 's success against Australia the other day was a pointer and the seat - of - the - pants nature of Pakistan 's cricket means that Bangladesh must have real hopes of qualifying .
They are improving all the time , and suited to what , if their game against England on Wednesday is anything to go by , will be slow take - the - pace - off - the - ball pitches .
Zimbabwe must have hopes too .
They face Sri Lanka and New Zealand , powerful sides on their day but beatable nonetheless .
In terms of batting , England appear to have progressed , although the obsession with the first six overs disregards that there is no time for dalliance at any stage and that even more emphasis should be on the final three or four overs .
The latest opening pairing of Michael Lumb , with his IPL experience , and Craig Kieswetter is a step in the right direction but a lack of international experience could count against .
But in Kevin Pietersen , Paul Collingwood ( the one genuine England IPL success ) and Eoin Morgan they have quality T20 players .
Instead it is the bowling that may let them down .
Two of the seamers , James Anderson and Stuart Broad , are prone to haemorrhage runs at the best of times while Luke Wright comes into the enthusiastic category .
It may be that Graeme Swann , Collingwood with his cutters and , as shown by Wednesday 's game , Michael Yardy have real parts to play .
Trying to pick a winner , or even semi‑finalists , is pin-sticking , though .
No predictive element holds good in T20 .
India ought to be competitive and have brought on some exciting young players for the future in IPL .
But their first match against Afghanistan , tomorrow , is not to be taken lightly .
If the Super Eight pitches are slow , then neither Australia nor South Africa , with significant pace attacks , will be quite the force they might otherwise be .
On the other hand , such conditions might help both Sri Lanka and New Zealand , the latter always dangerous if historically unable to go the final mile .
West Indies have a real chance and might just be inspired by the support they will get now that ticket pricing is sensible ( around 60 % of tickets pre-sold apparently ) .
Pakistan ?
Who knows ?
Which leaves England and it is hard to see them progressing beyond the Super Eight stage .
Instead an England success will have to come from the women , who have been toppled from the perch recently but who are back to full strength now .
There was no better match of the last tournament , male or female , than their semi-final against Australia , and there is stronger competition now .
But they have the drive to win .
Two months ago I began an apprenticeship at Fleisher 's Meat Shop in Kingston , New York , that started with a single premise : Could Joshua Applestone and his team of butchers teach me , your humble nasty bits columnist , to break down a pig in one week or less ?
It took me a week to learn how to butcher a pig , but what I could n't have anticipated are the months I needed to recover from my time upstate .
What started as a simple goal became a turning point in my meat - obsessed life .
I loved everything about butchery : the sound of cracking bones and cartilage , the thrill of digging my fingers into inches of pristine fatback and feeling all that creamy fat lodging deep within my nails .
I loved the aroma of raw meat : fresh , feral , and bloody all at once .
And when giant hunks of aged steak were pulled out of the freezer , I loved to lean in and inhale the smells of meat mastery at its finest .
I loved it so much , in fact , that my return to the city was almost unbearable .
Like the pounds of leaf lard I so enjoy rendering , I myself experienced a meat meltdown .
The kind of meltdown that had me wandering around my apartment every morning in my robe , drinking too many cups of coffee and all the while wondering , " How come I 'm not at Fleischer 's breaking down more pigs ? "
The most difficult thing about going through a meat meltdown is the meat that taunts you .
For a few weeks I took my version of a meat hiatus and scaled down to eating meat only twice or thrice a week .
But everywhere I looked , I saw intimations of meat .
People on the subway could be broken down into primals .
Long , slim Japanese eggplants looked like purple sausages .
And when I finally allowed myself to eat animals , my hunger was insatiable .
Each week became worse and worse .
I hit a low point three weeks ago when , faced with a very large and delicious hunk of pastrami that Ed had given me , I took the entire piece of pastrami to bed and ate the whole thing between fat slices of rye .
The crumbs fell into the covers but instead of getting up to sweep them away , I let them lie there with me as I napped .
Nothing felt quite as real to me as the store and the people who make the place so unique .
It would only be a minor exaggeration to claim that Fleisher 's sells the best - tasting meat in the country , but then again , Fleisher 's is no ordinary butcher shop .
It supplies meat to superstar chefs like Dan Barber .
It 's been featured in countless books and magazines .
( Ever heard of Julie Powell and Cleaving ?
Yes , that was Fleisher 's as well . )
The owners , Jessica and Joshua Applestone , insist that what they 've accomplished at Fleisher 's is no different than what butchers have been doing for centuries .
Breaking down animals that arrive at the shop in whole , halves and quarters , and selling all manner of cuts , is certainly a practice in butchery that has been overtaken only in recent decades by sytrofoamed packed , factory - farmed meat .
To call Fleisher 's a traditional shop , however , would be to underestimate the extraordinary things that take place in the shop on a daily basis .
Fleisher 's is a store , but it's also a meat university , a place where the art of butchering is discussed , demonstrated and above all , practiced .
Learning from Hans , the Master Butcher
I 'm finally ready to talk about meat .
I learned so much in my time at Fleisher 's , and though I need to return to continue my education in lamb and beef , I have a pretty solid grounding in pig now .
It may take Josh a cool forty - seven seconds to break down a half side of pig and me , several hours , but no matter .
I can look at a half side of pig and instead of being overwhelmed by the sheer mass of a very large animal , I see bacon and hams , whole loin roasts and shoulders .
My tutelage began under Hans , a German gentleman from Bavaria who'd been a master butcher at the Culinary Institute of America for two decades prior to coming to Fleisher's .
His directions were gentle but firm ; his speech bears the signs of his Bavarian heritage .
Such as , " Chichi , you are putting your knife in the wrong direction to remove the teender - loin .
Put it dere .
See vat I mean ? "
A spry man in his sixties , Hans is quite tall .
He has a son who 's a professional football player , yet Hans himself is lean rather than muscular .
Fond of plaid shirts and sauerkraut , Hans displays a quiet , assured strength that 's the closest I 've ever witnessed to the zen of butchery .
With neither strength nor weakness , Hans wields his knife like it's an extension of his hand .
There is an eerie continuity between the two , as if Hans is not leading his knife but the other way around .
With x-ray acuity , Hans can separate joints with a subtle twist of his wrist .
He can make the trotter tumble away from the hock by pointing the tip of his knife into the joint connecting the two and giving it one deft twist with his wrist .
Once , when the shop was perfectly still , I heard the faintest pop of air as he inserted his knife into the joint , smoothly carving around the joint .
It took me several pigs to successfully insert the tip of my knife into the joint .
Doing so in the beginning felt like desperate jabs in the dark , but when I finally managed , I felt a jolt of assurance in my palm when the tip of the knife went cleanly in .
A lot has been written about the composition of meat — that , contrary to the common conception of meat as an impenetrable composite , flesh is in fact stitched together by collagen and tissue , by sinews that are plainly visible on the cutting table .
Following the sinews is quite a bit like following a roadmap of meat .
The muscular groups on the hind leg of a pig are not much different than that of the cow ; both kinds of legs can be taken apart and put back together again in discrete masses of flesh .
One of the first tasks Hans had me work on was taking apart a pig's hind leg and putting it back together again .
The hind leg is composed of a few cuts : the top round , bottom round , the eye of round , and the knuckle .
A few deft slashes of the knife will separate the leg into these parts .
It took me the better part of an hour to get the hang of using my knife , during which time Hans had started to break down a whole lamb .
Each time I looked up from my station Hans had further fabricated the lamb .
In the beginning he manually sawed off the head with a large bandsaw and set it aside .
I looked at down at the head and was struck by its alien nature , so angular and narrow underneath the guise of skin and wool .
A lamb 's tongue , gray and flaccid , often hangs out of the mouth between perfectly neat rows of tiny teeth .
My mouth watered thinking of confited tongue .
When lunchtime neared , I handed the lamb 's head back to Hans .
" Let 's have the brains , " I said .
A real butcher shop may be the one place in the world where I will never have to explain what I love to eat .
Without so much as batting an eye , Hans walked over the mechanical saw and cut the head in half , carefully extracting the lobes from inside the skull .
Then he turned on one of the burners in the kitchen where , adjacent to our burner , a giant vat of stock was bubbling away .
Adding a bit of butter to the pan , Hans tossed in the lobes .
Brain is primarily composed of fat ; each segment is barely held together by a thin membrane that displays the intricate pattern of veins and blood vessels underneath .
Upon contact with the heat , the brains spurted and sizzled .
Hans let them brown for a moment and then cracked a few eggs into the pan as well .
Waiting until the eggs had barely congealed , he removed the scrambled brains and eggs from the pan onto a single plate for us to share .
A butcher 's lunch in three minutes time .
Scrambled Brains
What do brains taste like ?
The texture is easier to describe : creamy but firm , like overly curdled yogurt or lumpy tofu .
The taste is unlike any other part of the animal , with the exception perhaps of sweetbreads .
Both brains and sweetbreads possess animalistic flavor that 's neither iron - intensive like the livers or gamey like the kidneys .
Brains also taste somewhat like a firm fish roe , though without the fishiness , of course .
The general consensus about brains is that they should be soaked in water for several hours to leech out the excess blood .
The fresher the brain , however , the less likely it is that you 'll need to do so .
The lamb 's brain at Fleisher 's did not have to travel far to be cooked : its trajectory started from inside the skull to the cutting table ; then it was plopped onto to the frying pan nearby .
We did not soak it in water .
It was extremely tender and flavorful , with no extraneous or overly assertive flavor .
Furthermore , the membrane surrounding the brain was so fresh , thin , and delicate that there was almost nothing to trim .
( Had the brains come from a pig or cow , they would have been less delicate . )
Since the brains you are mostly likely to buy will not have been sitting in a skull immediately prior to your consumption , you 'll want to soak them in a water or briefly poach them in salted water before use .
To soak the brains , wash them in cold water , then place them into a bowl and soak in several changes of cold water .
Then pull off as much of the filament as you can without tearing into the brains .

Climate scientists have long warned that global warming could unlock vast stores of the greenhouse gas methane that are frozen into the Arctic permafrost , setting off potentially significant increases in global warming .
Now researchers at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , and elsewhere say this change is under way in a little - studied area under the sea , the East Siberian Arctic Shelf , west of the Bering Strait .
Natalia Shakhova , a scientist at the university and a leader of the study , said it was too soon to say whether the findings suggest that a dangerous release of methane looms .
In a telephone news conference , she said researchers were only beginning to track the movement of this methane into the atmosphere as the undersea permafrost that traps it degrades .
But climate experts familiar with the new research reported in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science that even though it does not suggest imminent climate catastrophe , it is important because of methane ’s role as a greenhouse gas .
Although carbon dioxide is far more abundant and persistent in the atmosphere , ton for ton atmospheric methane traps at least 25 times as much heat .
Businessman Neal Forde , 51 , says Conservative leader got details about him wrong while discussing immigration in televised election debate
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The " 40 - year - old black man " famously referred to by David Cameron in this week 's televised election debate has hit out at the conservative leader for getting the story wrong .
Neal Forde was quoted by Cameron as being ashamed of Britain 's " out - of - control " immigration system , but the Tory leader got the 51 - year - old businessman 's age wrong by 11 years .
He also told the audience of 9 million viewers that Forde had served in the Royal Navy for 30 years , when in fact he served for six .
Cameron referred to Forde , who runs a business supplying kitchen worktops , while speaking about immigration during the ITV debate on Thursday .
The Conservative leader said : " I was in Plymouth recently and a 40 - year - old black man ... said , ' I came here when I was six , I 've served in the Royal Navy for 30 years , I 'm incredibly proud of my country .
But I 'm so ashamed that we 've had this out - of - control system with people abusing it so badly ' . "
But Forde said the Conservatives did not have the answers to Britain 's problems on immigration and , like Labour , had " forgotten the British people " .
He said he had been teased by his friends and colleagues because of the inaccuracies in Cameron 's anecdote .
" He said I spent 30 years in the navy when I was actually in for six years as a marine engineer , " said Forde .
" But at least he took 11 years off my age . "
Forde , who has not yet decided who to vote for , was involved in the Icelandic " cod wars " in the late 1970s and left the service in 1980 .
He said : " Britain needs immigrants .
It 's a rich and diverse country with a heritage to be proud of , but what I find unacceptable is that the politicians seem to care more about everybody else and forget the British people .
" What I want the politicians to tell me is what they are going to do to safeguard the British people from the immigrants who come here and commit serious crimes . "
Space entrepreneur Robert Bigelow ( left ) discusses layout plans of the company 's lunar base with Eric Haakonstad , one of the Bigelow Aerospace lead engineers .
After launching two prototype space stationsinto orbit , space entrepreneur and pioneer Robert Bigelow is now setting hissights a bit higher .
His latest vision : A quick - deploy moon base capable ofhousing up to 18 astronauts in inflatable modules on the lunar surface .
The base itself would be fabricated in space , with considerationbeing given to crewmembers piloting the entire base directly onto the moon ' ssurface .
" I see a huge sea change in usingexpandable systems , " Bigelow told SPACE.com in an exclusive interview .
" Ifeel this architecture is fundamentally safer , less expensive , and can save anawful lot of time . "
[ Future moon basephotos . ]
Bigelow founded Bigelow Aerospace in 1999 , headquartered in Las Vegas , Nevada , drawing upon his construction , real estate , and hotel know - how to pioneer the use of expandable space structures .
To datehe has dedicated over $ 180 million to his visionary quest .
Two prototype space modules built by BigelowAerospace are now circuiting the Earth .
Lofted in July 2006 and in June 2007 , respectively , the company 's Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 expandable modulesserved as forerunners to ever - larger and human - rated space structures .
Bigelow 's moon visions come at a time whenNASA is overhauling its plans for human spaceflight and planning to depend moreon commercial space companies for future hardware and spacecraft .
On Thursday , U.S. President Barack Obama isexpected to announce the revival of NASA ' scancelled Orion spacecraft to serve as a crew escape ship for the InternationalSpace Station , as well as guidelines for a heavy - lift rocket capable oflaunching heavy payloads into space .
Beyond low Earth orbit
" We want to go to the moon . . . and theexpandable habitats are a good example of an enabling technology that will beleveraged to bring this vision to fruition , " said Michael Gold , Directorof Washington , D.C. Operations & Business Growth for Bigelow Aerospace , LLC , based in Chevy Chase , Md. " Our goal has always been beyond low Earthorbit . "
Gold said that Bigelow Aerospace has beenaggressively establishing an international consortium of what the group termsas " sovereign clients " — along with hammering out the financial andlegal structure , he said , for such partnerships to blossom , first in low Earthorbit and then beyond .
" We need to make low - Earth orbit workfirst before we go beyond . . . but I believe we will , " Gold told SPACE.com .
" Oncewe 've established a robust infrastructure in Earth orbit , created the economiesof scale necessary to produce facilities in low Earth orbit . . . at that point , we 'vereally enabled ourselves to look at a variety of options . "
Bigelow Aerospace has taken a hard look athow their habitats could function on the lunar surface , Gold said .
" Webelieve our expandable habitat technology will be a critical piece of buildinga presence on the moon , " he added .
Speaking volumes
The testing of expandable habitatsin Earth orbit is key , Bigelow said .
" The concept has always been to create genericenvelopes . . . for use as habitats , depots , storage warehouse facilities and giantlaboratories too , " he added .
There is " on-going discussion " about use of a Bigelow Aerospace - supplied module attached to the InternationalSpace Station , Bigelow said .
Furthermore , Bigelow Aerospace is partneredwith Boeing for Commercial Crew Development ( CCDev ) — a commercially managedsystem that could be used to transport astronauts to and from the InternationalSpace Station , Bigelow Aerospace 's Orbital Space Complex , and other potentialdestinations in low Earth orbit .
But Bigelow and his team are sketching outarchitectures to also put their structures in the Lagrangian Point L1 — partwaybetween the moon and the Earth — and also used as depots for outboundexpeditions to Mars .
" We think it 's all very doable , " Bigelow said .
The company is pressing forward on athree - person Sundancer module and the larger BA - 330 , a unit that offers 330 cubic meters of leasable internal volume for a crew of six .
But space is big , and so too are Bigelow ' sideas .
One size does n't fit all
Given a NASA go - ahead to work on a superheavy lifter , much larger habitats are on the drawing boards , Bigelow said , " and the volumes that we can launch are absolutely gigantic . "
Bigelow Aerospaceenvisions expandable habitats offering 2,100 cubic meters of volume — nearly twice the capacity available on the International Space Station — whileanother plan sketches out use of a super - jumbo structure providing 3,240 cubicmeters of volume .
For the moon base , three BA 330s , along withtopped off propulsion tanks and power units , could be joined together and thenmigrated from either L1 or lunar orbit and flown to a pre-selected lunar spot .
" The vessels are configured to beindependent of each other , to be self - sustaining , " Bigelow said .
" Intheory , you might have 12 people occupying the lunar station . . . which couldactually handle 18 people .
But I 'm a huge fan of margins .
The larger the marginthe better I like it . "
The expandable systems are extremely tough , able to sit down on any kind of surface , Bigelow explained .
" We wouldreinforce everything , the intersections where the spacecrafts come together , sothey would be able to accommodate an uneven surface . "
Nearby the landed base , a solar array fieldwould be deployed .
Bigelow said that he 's spent a good deal ofhis life in construction , putting together things for some 40 years .
" And anybody that 's done thatunderstands that a lot of things can go wrong .
And they go wrong all the time .
So you want to absolutely minimize logistics , " Bigelow advised .
It 'scrucial that integrating activity be minimized , he said , be it on the lunar or Martiansurface .
" All this is step by step taking us onthe way to Mars .
The moon is a great practice ground , " Bigelow concluded .
" Themoon is a very valuable asset for a lot of reasons . "

BUSINESS OPINION : Seán Quinn is architect of his own downfall and the sooner he realises his insurance adventure is over the better , writes JOHN McMANUS
WATCHING SEÁN Quinn on the television news last Thursday , it seemed pretty obvious that someone needs to take him aside and explain a few things .
The extent to which Quinn seems deluded is positively frightening .
It is clear that he fundamentally does not understand the prudential bargain at the heart of the insurance business .
On the news and in several subsequent interviews , he has gone on at length about the profitability of Quinn Insurance , which he tells us makes profits of € 20 million a month , and which in theory will allow him repay the Quinn Group ’s € 4 billion of debt .
The first point to make here is that Quinn Insurance does not meet the solvency requirements set by the regulator and has a history of not doing so .
The Government allows companies sell insurance provided they obey certain rules , the most fundamental of which is the requirement to have enough assets to meet your liabilities .
One of the ways you do this is set aside some of your profits .
Anyone in insurance will tell you that it ’s much easier to make profits if you do n’t meet your solvency targets .
The trouble is that if you are not meeting your solvency targets you are not running an insurance company , you are running something else .
And it ’s something that might not have the wherewithal to meet its commitments .
That in turn is not something that the Government can let you do if it ’s serious about protecting its citizens .
In fact its something they should take off you before people get hurt , including the employees .
The only amazing thing about Quinn Insurance – and sadly it ’s not that amazing in the Irish context – is that the company was not seized years ago .
Mr Quinn ’s decision to use the reserves of the insurance company to finance his disastrous foray into Anglo Irish Bank shares should have been sufficient grounds to seize the company in 2008 , demonstrating as it did his blindness to the prudential fundamentals of insurance .
Over and above that , the whole – and as yet unexplained – thinking behind taking a secret 28 per cent stake in the country ’s third - largest bank should , as a minimum , have shown an approach to investment at odds with running an insurance business .
Never mind what it said about an attitude to corporate governance .
The anger expressed by Quinn Insurance staff is entirely misplaced .
The person they should be asking questions of is the man whose massive investment gambles pushed the company into the arms of the administrator .
The second point on which Mr Quinn needs to be wised up on is that his folksy code of “ if I make a mistake I will fix it ” does not actually cut when you have helped wreck a bank that will end up costing € 20 billion to put down , never mind save .
When the consequences of that include putting in jeopardy an insurance company that one million people count on and that 2,400 work for , “ I made a mistake , I will fix it ” just sounds like the recipe for mashing up what is left of the business .
The third thing that Seán Quinn needs to grasp is that the fact that he lost € 3 billion on shares – most of which went on a disastrous investment in Anglo Irish Bank shares – makes him even less qualified to be let near an insurance company .
But , by his tortured logic , the scale of his losses should engender some sort of empathy and lead to us giving him a further chance .
It ’s crackers .
Seán Quinn is the architect of his own downfall and the sooner he realises the game is up as far as his adventure in the insurance industry the better .
The real issue is how to save Quinn Insurance , because if it goes down the unintended collateral damage will be huge .
Not only are jobs at risk , there is the nightmarish scenario of what happens to the health insurance market if Quinn Insurance flounders .
Private health insurance is one of the creaky pillars on which the health service is built .
Withdraw cover from 400,000 people and the whole thing falls over .
The preferred solution is to find a buyer for Quinn Insurance as quickly as possible and before the whole thing unravels as its bankers and customers take flight .
An international buyer would be preferable because it would shift the risk on to their balance sheet and away from the State .
The other alternative is for the State to take it on to its already rather stretched balance sheet via Anglo Irish Bank , which is owed € 2.8 billion by the Quinn family and has a charge over the family ’s assets .
But Anglo is in deep enough trouble as things stand without also turning it into a lifeboat for Quinn Insurance
At this stage it ’s unclear which way things will go , but one thing is obvious : there should be no role for Seán Quinn in what happens .
( CNN ) --
A chemistry professor at Harvard University is trying to shrink a medical laboratory onto a piece of paper that 's the size of a fingerprint and costs about a penny .
George Whitesides has developed a prototype for paper " chip " technology that could be used in the developing world to cheaply diagnose deadly diseases such as HIV , malaria , tuberculosis , hepatitis and gastroenteritis .
The first products will be available in about a year , he said .
His efforts , which find their inspiration from the simple designs of comic books and computer chips , are surprisingly low - tech and cheap .
Patients put a drop of blood on one side of the slip of paper , and on the other appears a colorful pattern in the shape of a tree , which tells medical professionals whether the person is infected with certain diseases .
Water - repellent comic - book ink saturates several layers of paper , he said .
The ink funnels a patient 's blood into tree - like channels , where several layers of treated paper react with the blood to create diagnostic colors .
It 's not entirely unlike a home pregnancy test , Whitesides said , but the chips are much smaller and cheaper , and they test for multiple diseases at once .
They also show how severely a person is infected rather than producing only a positive - negative reading .
The paper chips are expected to be used in concert with mobile phones , which are exploding in popularity in the developing world .
Since people in remote parts of Africa and Asia often have to travel great distances by public transit or foot to reach a medical clinic , patients simply can take photos of the chips with cell phones and then send them to larger cities for diagnosis .
And Whitesides said his group is also working with a cell phone maker to develop apps that would tell patients the results of their tests automatically if doctors are n't available .
" Doctors are as scarce a resource as money is , " he said .
The tests may also be useful for highly contagious diseases such as hepatitis C , which require sick people to be quarantined to prevent further infection .
Watch Whitesides talk at the TED Conference
Whitesides ' work , if successful , will bolster the argument that solutions to complicated problems often are found in simple , low - cost technologies .
From consumer electronics to medical equipment , a growing number of people seem to be searching for technologies that are cheap , reliable and even somewhat retro .
Computer operating systems are being stripped of new features in favor of a simplified experience ; basic devices such as the Flip cam seem more chic and popular than high - end video equipment .
The spiking costs of health care in the U.S. put pressure on doctors to perform expensive tests with high - end equipment only when necessary .
And in the developing world , the medical community has realized there 's not always electricity to power and doctors to manage high - tech medical clinics with rooms full of electronics and labs .
Cheap and reliable health care technologies are what the developing world and the Western world need , said Dr. Gaby Vercauteren , coordinator of diagnostics and laboratory technologies at the World Health Organization .
" Obviously smaller , easy to use , inexpensive technologies will find their way throughout the whole system and will provide better access to care to all those who need it , " she said .
She said many medical diagnostic tests are too expensive for people in poorer areas of the world to afford .
But they are the essential first step to health care .
" Today , many people do n't get the necessary diagnosis that will lead to access to the right treatment because diagnostic tests and lab tests are , most of the time , out of pocket , " she said .
" People do n't have the money to buy that .
Therefore , often , diseases are not diagnosed or only diagnosed far too late . "
Keith Herold , an associate professor of bioengineering at the University of Maryland , said Whitesides ' ideas build on a branch of science that 's trying to develop " lab - on - chip " technologies , which use credit - card size devices to perform laboratory analyses .
Whitesides ' paper chips are much simpler than other lab - on - chip projects , many of which require intricate production methods and heavier materials such as glass and plastic .
But simpler might be better in this case , he said .
" I think it 's real .
It can be very useful , but it's not the fanciest manifestation of lab on a chip by any means , " he said .
" If it works and it 's cheap , it 's good for everybody . "
Still , Whitesides ' paper tests could run into some pitfalls .
Vercauteren , of the WHO , said the paper may mold in humid , hot climates .
And it 's still important for people to get access to doctors so they know what to do about their diagnoses , she said .
She said its possible to conquer those challenges .
The first test , Whitesides said , will be designed to detect liver function , which is important for people with HIV and who are on some strong medications .
David Kernell 's lawyer said his actions amounted to a college prank
A jury in Tennessee has convicted a former student of hacking the e-mail account of Sarah Palin .
David Kernell , 22 , was found guilty of obstructing justice and unauthorised access to a computer .
The son of a Democratic lawmaker , he faces up to 20 years in prison for the first charge and one year for the charge of hacking .
He broke into Mrs Palin 's e-mail account during her 2008 Republican campaign for the US vice - presidency .
Kernell was cleared of a charge of wire fraud .
' Political intrigue '
The jury were unable to agree on a verdict on a charge of identity fraud , for which he could face another trial .
Mrs Palin posted a statement on Facebook , welcoming the verdict
Wade Davies , Kernell 's lawyer , had said his client 's actions amounted to a college prank , rather than a crime .
Kernell was a student at the University of Tennessee at the time .
But prosecutors said it was an attempt to influence a national election through illegal means .
The jury took four days to reach a decision .
Mrs Palin , a former governor of Alaska , posted a statement on her Facebook page saying she was " thankful that the jury thoroughly and carefully weighed the evidence and issued a just verdict " .
" As Watergate taught us , we rightfully reject illegally breaking into candidates ' private communications for political intrigue in an attempt to derail an election , " it read .
Mr Davies said in a statement that Kernell , whose father is Tennessee Democratic representative Mike Kernell , was " grateful for the time and consideration the jury gave to his case " .
In a 30 - minute testimony last Friday , Mrs Palin said that Kernell had compromised the main way she had communicated with her family during the campaign by breaking into her Yahoo e-mail account .
Earlier this week , her daughter Bristol testified that she had received harassing calls and text messages after screen shots of e-mails from the account revealed her mobile phone number .
A sentencing date has not yet been set .
Description :
The past half - decade has seen an increasing interaction between combinatorialists , probabilists , computer scientists and theoretical physicists concerned broadly with the study of " probability theory on graphs " or " statistical mechanics on graphs " .
The programme will build on this cross-fertilisation .
It is particularly timely for a number of reasons :
* methods from mathematical physics are beginning to make their mark on previously intractable combinatorial problems ;
* increasing computer power , together with the wide availability of symbolic - algebra packages , has brought the possibility of exploration of non-trivial examples ;
* phase transitions are increasingly being investigated on a wide variety of combinatorial structures , including matroids , set partitions and constraint satisfaction problems , as well as graphs .

The resort had been a key source of income for North Korea North Korea is to seize five properties owned by South Korea at the Mount Kumgang tourist resort , say reports .
The North will either take ownership of the facilities itself or hand them to a new tourism partner , says state news agency KCNA .
Pyongyang has been angered by Seoul 's suspension of tours to the resort , which was developed by a Southern firm .
The move comes as tensions rise over an unexplained blast which sank a South Korean ship , leaving more than 40 dead .
A North Korean tourism official said the properties were being confiscated " in compensation for the damage the North side suffered due to the suspension of the tour for a long period " , KCNA reported .
The five facilities to be seized include a fire station , a duty free shop and a Red Cross - built centre to host family reunions .
The official said the properties would be returned to state possession or " handed over to new businessmen according to legal procedures " .
All remaining assets will also be frozen and South Korean personnel expelled from the resort , said KCNA .
Ship link
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says the wrangling over Mount Kumgang - once seen as a beacon of hope for inter-Korean relations - has been going on for months but this is the most serious step the North has taken so far .
KUMGANG RESORT
Joint tourist resort developed with money from the South Visited by thousands of tourists Contains a Red Cross building to host reunions of families divided by the border Key source of foreign currency income for the North South suspended tours in 2008 after a tourist shot dead
The resort had been a lucrative source of income for North Korea , until Seoul suspended its tours after a South Korean woman was shot dead there .
Park Wang - ja , 53 , was killed by North Korean guards on 11 July 2008 on a beach near the resort .
South Korea says it wants the killing - when the tourist allegedly strayed into a military area - properly investigated before it allows tours to resume .
Last month , North Korea threatened to take " extraordinary measures " unless the South lifted its ban .
Pyongyang 's statement on Friday also made a clear link between the property seizure and what it perceives to be South Korean claims that it was behind the sinking of the Cheonan warship last month .
The statement said Seoul had been " deliberately linking " the disaster to Pyongyang .
Fifty - eight crew survived , but 46 sailors died when the ship went down close to the sea border with North Korea on 26 March .
South Korean media has speculated that the North was responsible , but officials have been more circumspect .
Pyongyang has denied any involvement and accused the South of making " a foolish attempt " to implicate them .
North and South Korea are technically still at war after the Korean conflict ended without an armistice in 1953 .
Our correspondent says there had been high optimism of reconciliation a few years ago , but relations began to deteriorate and now appear to be at their lowest point in a decade .

Fears that Britain could become embroiled in Europe 's deepening financial crisis intensified tonight after Spain had its debt downgraded , Portugal announced tougher austerity measures and Germany questioned whether beleaguered Greece should ever have been allowed to join monetary union .
With direct comparisons being drawn with the panic prompted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , European leaders promised to provide tens of billions of euros to Athens within the next three weeks .
But Germany was still insisting on tougher economic reforms from Greece before approving a € 100 bn - €120bn ( £ 89 bn - £ 104bn ) joint EU bailout , leading to fresh turbulence on Europe 's financial markets .
Angela Merkel , Germany 's chancellor , promised swift action to end the crisis , but said it was a mistake for Greece to have been allowed to join the single currency .
" In 2000 we had a situation when we were confronted with the question of whether Greece should be able to join the eurozone , " she said .
" It turned out that the decision [ in favour ] may not have been scrutinised closely enough . "
With the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , Angel Gurría , comparing the crisis to the ebola virus , the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats warned of Greek - style problems for Britain unless swift action was taken to repair the public finances .
" This is like ebola .
When you realise you have it you have to cut your leg off in order to survive , " said Gurría .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , said : " If anyone doubts the dangers that face our country if we do not , they should look at what is happening today in Greece and in Portugal . "
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , accused the Tories of " economic illiteracy " over the claim , but Vince Cable , the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman , also drew the same comparison .
" The Greek position is much more serious but it is a salutary warning that unless the next government gets seriously to grips with the deficit problems , which we are determined to do , we could have a serious problem , " Cable said .
At the end of a day that saw interest rates on two - year Greek bonds rise to 38 % at one point , Spain joined Greece and Portugal tonight in seeing its credit rating downgraded .
The announcement by rating agency Standard & Poor 's that weak growth in Spain would intensify the country 's budgetary difficulties reinforced fears of a cascade of sovereign debt emergencies in southern Europe with a disastrous knock - on effect on the euro .
" The crisis in Greece could pose as big a risk to the global economy and financial markets as the collapse of Lehman Brothers did in September 2008 " , said Julian Jessop , of Capital Economics .
He added : " It crystallises the worries about the dire state of the public finances in many countries in the same way that the collapse of Lehmans raised fears of a domino effect throughout the financial system . "
Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ , said : " There is evidence of contagion from Greece .
The UK 's fiscal position is dire and I think the market is selling sterling on the back of that today . "
Criticised for dragging their feet for months over the Greek crisis , the leaders of the 16 eurozone countries agreed to an extraordinary summit , likely on 10 or 11 May , to finalise the terms of the Greek bailout package .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund and Jean - Claude Trichet , the president of the European Central Bank , met Merkel and her finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , in Berlin yesterday in an attempt to fast - track a three - year rescue deal .
Merkel , backed by German public opinion , has been hostile to footing the bill for Greece 's profligacy .
But amid speculation that Greece would have to restructure its € 300bn debt , Schäuble said all negotiations should be wrapped up by the weekend .
He would then push enabling legislation through the German parliament next week .
That would be followed the summit of the eurozone leaders .
Athens would get its hands on the money before 19 May when it needs to raise € 8.5 bn .
" The goal of the German government ... is to come to a decision as quickly as possible .
The stability of the euro is the question , the last resort question , " said Schäuble , a firm supporter of helping the Greeks .
University of California , Berkeley , biologists have found a signal that keeps stem cells alive in the adult brain , providing a focus for scientists looking for ways to re-grow or re-seed stem cells in the brain to allow injured areas to repair themselves .
The researchers discovered in fruit flies that keeping the insulin receptor revved up in the brain prevents the die - off of neural stem cells that occurs when most regions of the brain mature into their adult forms .
Whether the same technique will work in humans is unknown , but the UC Berkeley team hopes to find out .
" This work does n't point the way to taking an adult who has already lost stem cells and bringing them back mysteriously , but it suggests what mechanisms might be operating to get rid of them in the first place , " said Iswar K. Hariharan , UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology .
" Plus , if you were able to introduce neural stem cells into an adult brain , this suggests what kinds of mechanisms you might need to have in place to keep them alive . "
Hariharan noted that other researchers have gotten neural stem cells to persist by blocking genes that cause them to die .
Yet this alone does not produce healthy , normal - looking neural stem cells that can make mature neurons .
The UC Berkeley team 's new finding shows that it also is necessary to provide an insulin - like signal .
If stopping neural stem cell death is analogous to taking your foot off the brake , then providing an insulin - like signal is like stepping on the gas , he said .
Both are essential .
Hariharan , post - doctoral researcher Sarah E. Siegrist and their colleagues published their findings in the online version of the journal Current Biology .
Their report will appear in the journal 's April 13 print edition .
Most areas of the adult mammalian brain and fruit fly brain are devoid of neural stem cells , the only cells able to generate full - fledged neurons .
Presumably , Hariharan said , the lack of neural stem cells is why the injured brain is unable to replace dead neurons .

In the new study , Siegrist showed that the stem cells present in the pupal stage of fruit flies are gone in the adult brain because they die off , rather than merely mature into neurons .
The stem cells that persisted the longest were in the mushroom body , a region of the fly brain responsible for memory and learning that , in some ways , is like the hippocampus in humans .
In subsequent experiments , she attempted to prevent the death of neural stem cells in fruit flies by genetically blocking a process called programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) .
While this allowed the stem cells to survive longer , the cells were small and did not make many neurons .
In fact , Siegrist said , they showed signs of impaired growth , suggestive of insulin withdrawal .
She then tried various genetic manipulations to mimic an insulin - type signal , this time using mutant fruit flies with their apoptosis genes also blocked .
Amazingly , the neural stem cells persisted for at least a month and even generated many mature , apparently normal , nerve cells .
" These neural stem cells seem to behave properly , they express the proteins that you expect neural stem cells to express , they look like their normal counterparts , and most importantly , they spin off cells which become normal mature nerve cells that put out processes ( axons ) that , in some cases , seem to go where normal processes go , " Siegrist said .
" We do n't know whether these cells function normally or whether they are electrically active .
At least it is encouraging that we can get nerve cells made in a part of the ( fruit fly ) brain that normally cannot make nerve cells in the adult brain . "
" Sarah had to do two manipulations together to keep these neural stem cells alive , and neither worked alone , " Hariharan said .
" One was to keep the insulin signal on , and one was to block programmed cell death .
Each improved things a little bit , but when you did the two together , the neural stem cells survived for a month , at which time they were throwing off mature neurons or normal looking neurons that sent out processes . "
Siegrist plans to continue her search through mutant fruit flies to find other genes that improve survival in the mushroom body and allow stem cells in other areas of the fly brain to persist .
She also plans collaborations to explore similar mechanisms in mammals , to see if analogous manipulations could keep neural stem cells alive in the mammalian brain .
" In fruit flies , pathways downstream of the insulin receptor are important in keeping these neural stem cells alive , " Siegrist said .
" Mammals have the same genes downstream of their insulin receptors , so we may find the same response to insulin or insulin - like growth factors in mammals . "

There are many things to think about when deciding whether genetic testing is right for you .
Although these tests can provide important information about health risks , they can also be upsetting or raise questions about what the results mean .
Genetic tests also have certain limitations that are important to understand .
Your personal and family medical history , as well as your goals for testing , should all factor into your decisions about whether and how to test .
A genetic counselor , a healthcare professional with special training in genetic conditions , will be able to answer your questions and help you make an informed choice .
We recommend that you speak with a genetic counselor before testing , and also after testing to help you understand your results and what actions you should take .
This is especially important for health conditions that are preventable or treatable .
Genetic counselors can help you navigate common questions , such as :
What are the risks and benefits of genetic testing ?
Are there diseases that run in the family ?
How do you handle potentially distressing information ?
What are you hoping to find out from genetic testing ?

Payrolls may finally be creeping higher , but Americans are more scared than ever of losing their jobs .
Gallup 's poll of employed Americans found that 21 % think it is likely they will be laid off in the next year .
Only 38 % are confident they wo n't be laid off .
Both indicators are at record levels and getting worse .
Rising fear shows the average American does not believe in the recovery .
The fossil remains found in a cave in South Africa could represent an evolutionary link between tree - dwelling apes and our earliest human ancestors to walk upright
Fossilised skeletons recovered from a deep underground cave in South Africa belong to a previously unknown species of human ancestor , scientists claim .
The partial skeletons of an adult female and a young male , aged 11 or 12 , were found lying side by side in sediments that first covered their remains an estimated 1.9 m years ago .
The individuals are thought to have fallen into the cave network through a fissure before being carried a few metres by mud or water into a subterranean pool , where they were gradually encased in rock .
The extraordinary remains are thought to represent a period of evolutionary transition between tree - dwelling apes and the earliest human ancestors , or hominids , to take their first tentative steps on two feet .
Their position at the very root of our family tree has led scientists to claim that the skeletons will help define what it means to be human .
The remains were recovered alongside the fossilised bones of at least 25 other animals , including sabre - toothed cats , a hyena , a wild dog , several antelope and a horse , according to two reports in the journal Science .
At the time the creatures died , the region was dominated by a grassy plain crossed by wooded valleys .
The discovery of the mass grave has led researchers to suggest that the ancient animals and the hominids fell into the cave network through " death trap " holes in the surface and were unable to escape .
The skeletons were so well preserved that palaeontologists believe the two individuals fell into the cave together and were dead and buried within days or weeks .
The remains , found in the Malapa cave network at the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site 40 km outside Johannesburg , have already triggered a row over their identity , because they share anatomical features with both early humans from the genus , Homo , and their ancient predecessors , the Australopithecines , or southern apes .
The skeletons have long arms similar to those of orang - utans , a trait shared with Australopithecines , which suggests they were adept at living in trees .
But unlike other Australopithecines , they have long legs and a pelvis that is well adapted to walking upright .
Analysis of the male 's skull revealed small teeth and facial characteristics seen in early members of the genus Homo .
Their brains were exceptionally small , around a third the size of a modern human's .
Given their long arm bones and other physical characteristics , lead scientist Lee Berger , a palaeontologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , assigned the remains to a new species , Australopithecus sediba .
The word " sediba " means fountain or wellspring in Sotho , one of the official languages of South Africa , and was chosen because the species might be a direct ancestor of the genus Homo , and the point at which the story of modern humans begins .
According to Berger , Australopithecus sediba may be descended from the more primitive South African ape men , Australopithecus africanus , which lived more than 2 m years ago and are known from the skeletons of the Taung child and Mrs Ples , recovered in South Africa in 1924 and 1947 respectively .
" These fossils give us an extraordinarily detailed look into a new chapter of human evolution , and provide a window into a critical period when hominids made the committed change from dependency on life in the trees to life on the ground , " said Prof Berger .
" Sediba may very well be the Rosetta stone that unlocks our understanding of the genus Homo . "
Other experts argue that the remains have been misclassified and belong to the genus Homo .
" The transition to Homo continues to be almost totally confusing , " Donald Johanson at Arizona State University in Tempe told Science magazine .
Based on the thinness of the lower jaw and other bone features , Johanson is convinced Berger has it wrong : " It 's Homo , " he said .
Teams of palaeontologists will spend the next weeks and months poring over the fossils in the hope of building up a more complete picture of their postition in the human story .
Berger said he hoped to retrieve DNA from the remains , which could add enormously to scientists ' understanding .
" Any time we find remarkable fossils like this , in remarkable completeness , and of this quality , they are going to answer a great many questions in a very fragmented fossil record , " he added .
" As more fossils are recovered from the species , it is undoubtable that it is going to contribute enormously to our understanding of what was going on at that moment when the early members of the genus , Homo , emerged . "
The fossils were discovered by Berger 's nine - year - old son , Matthew , in a visit to the Malapa site in 2008 .
Since their recovery , researchers have carefully removed the fossils from the concrete - like sediments in which they were encased .
" These new fossils from Malapa return the spotlight to South Africa as a possible location for the presumed transition from Australopithecus to the genus Homo , " said Chris Stringer , head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London .
" The fact that experts differ over whether to classify these specimens as Australopithecine or human indicates the mixed features that they display , and the fossils provide valuable clues to the evolutionary changes that led to the first members of the human genus . "

Any swearing is mild .
Player Characters Kaltos Sturn Mercenary , Age 32 Falling into the underworld of organised crime at a young age , only collusion , corruption and undeserved good fortune have kept Kaltos from a significant period behind bars .
Now he has turned his back on the life that cost him his marriage and is trying to make ends meet as a sword for hire ; an increasingly difficult prospect in a world reigned by gunpowder .
Ionae Unemployed , Age Unrecorded Ionae appears to be a loner by choice , travelling the quiet back roads of Western Lereftain late at night and conversing only when absolutely necessary .
This is perhaps for the best - arrogant , selfish , neurotic and oddly unfamiliar with local Lereftese custom , Ionae makes poor company at the best of times .
Her tattered cloak hides a pair of folorn , moulting brown wings from curious eyes .
Mericious Johan Weiss Priest ,
Age 47 Mericious has spent most of his uneventful life as a priest deep in study , until the clergy of the great library at Prestin decided that a reassignment would do him and everyone else there a world of good .
There 's somewhere that he really ought to be right now but , in no hurry to arrive into his new life , Mericious has wandered somewhat astray .

The only son of Eamon and Aetlia Talbot , and heir to the Talbot estate , Ferwin is a cheerful and enthusiastic young man struggling with the weight of his parents ' expectations .

Charlotte Kaye Self - Employed , Age 27 Drifting from one noisy tavern to another , Charlotte 's brash and sunny disposition hides a deep longing for an entirely different life , one of certainty and commitment that she seems unable to find .
She appears to be comfortably well off despite having no apparent source of income , and for some reason chooses to avoid setting foot in larger towns and cities .
PyanPau Sai Permitted Visitor , Age 25 A wide - eyed visitor from the tiny neighbouring state of Sakeida , PyanPau has been granted temporary access to Lereftain to take part in his Journey , the rite of passage that all Sakeidan priests must undertake before gaining their title .
PyanPau 's charming demeanour and disarming curiosity have served him well in his travels across a country highly suspicious of foreigners .
Denever Halterbrooke Retired Guardsman , Age 76
An elderly and distinguished member of the now - defunct Dragon Guard , Denever retired fourteen years ago .
But with no family to go home to and no other professional skills , he has found himself unable to put down his sword and abandon the only life he has ever known .
Relying on his state pension and the kindness of strangers , Denever has been walking the back roads of Lereftain and helping those who cannot help themselves , trying to outrun and outfight his advancing age .
Grace Winters Retired Army Officer , Age 51 Wife of local councillor Jeremiah Winters and mother of three , Grace is widely known across Lereftain as the first female officer to rise to the rank of General .
As one of the three senior commanders directing the miltary response to the Amaran uprising of 726 , she is reviled in Amara itself and hailed as a hero in the rest of the union .
Troubled by her role in the conflict , Grace later resigned and now spends her time supporting her husband and lecturing on security matters in various academic institutions .
Enshadu Ensekku Unemployed , Age Unrecorded Amiable , educated , intelligent and well trained as a priest , Enshadu nethertheless makes for unsettling company .

They are the authority to which the Lereftese parliament bows and their rule remains popular .
The Keepers Secretive Organisation
The cult of the Keepers have met in secret for as long as the Lereftese state has existed , and only they know just how long that is .
Now they have taken to the streets .
They have a long list , and every citizen named on it must die .
i Pad mania has hit since Apple 's answer to the tablet became available for pre-order on Friday morning .
We already mentioned with glee that the mute switch has been transformed into an orientation lock .
Now , sales estimates suggest that virtual iPads are flying off virtual shelves as fast as Apple fans can click " Buy Now , " and a number of details are surfacing about iBooks , 3G data services , and more .
Of course , Apple has n't made any official announcements about sales numbers , but that has n't stopped clever buyers with a Google spreadsheet from estimating how many iPads Apple is selling .
Using order numbers matched up to the time of order , estimates range from about 20,000 to 25,000 iPads sold per hour in the hours after Apple raised the curtain .
Assuming the majority of sales are the $ 499 entry - level model , Apple could be grossing about $ 10 million per hour .
If this rate keeps up , it 's possible Apple will sell through its first batch of iPads ( set to ship April 3 ) this weekend .
Supplies are expected to be constrained for some time .
Apple is limiting general consumers to just two iPads per person for preorders .
However , it is also limiting business and academic purchases to just two per person as well .
And initial store stock may be based on the number of preorders that are reserved for pickup at a particular location .
If a store does n't get many reservations , it may not have many extra iPads to sell to other customers .
Apple is really pushing preorders for those that want to get an iPad on launch weekend .
Apple is allowing preorders for many of the iPad accessories as well , including the keyboard dock and the VGA video - out adapter .
However , conspicuously absent is an option to order the Camera Connection Kit , which allows connecting a digital camera via USB or directly accessing an SD card to download images and videos to the iPad .
The iPad 's tech specs say that it supports H.264 and MPEG - 4 video — no surprise there — but it will also support Motion JPEG in an AVI wrapper , which is still a common video format for many digital point - and - shoot cameras .
It looks as though roughly 20 to 25 percent of iPad buyers are opting for the model with integrated 3G networks for mobile data .
That model carries a $ 130 premium , and will add at least a few weeks to your wait .
However , the extra cost and the no-contract data plans are actually quite a good deal .
Earlier in the week , we examined some alternate options for data on - the - go using mobile hotspots , and the pricing for hardware and data plans fall clearly in the iPad 3G +
WiFi model 's favor if you plan on needing to use your iPad while far from WiFi hotspots .
Also , if you opt for the $ 15 per month , 250 MB limited option , you 'll get warnings when you get close to the limit , as well as an option to move up to the more expensive plan .
You can activate and cancel data services at any time right from the device , so you only have to pay for data when you need it .
We also have some good news and some bad news regarding iBooks .
The bad news is — and this is something we fully expected — books purchased through the iBookstore will have Fairplay DRM and wo n't be compatible with other e-readers .
The good news is that iBooks uses the standard ePub format , so any DRM - free ePub files can be loaded into iBooks using iTunes syncing .
( Apple has n't said whether publishers will have an option to make their titles DRM - free . )
Some even better news is that iBooks can use VoiceOver to read the contents of any book aloud .
You might remember that publishers balked when Amazon added a similar feature to the Kindle 2 , and Amazon was forced to remove the capability for most books — though publishers can still choose to enable it on a per - title basis .
Finally , one little last detail was revealed on the detail page for the YouTube app : sharing options now include posting links to YouTube video to your Facebook wall .
Our crack Apple hardware review team was up and ready to pre-order iPads the minute the Apple Store came online at 7:30 am CT , so you can be sure we will have a full and thorough review as soon as humanly possible after they arrive in Orbiting HQ .
Until then , we 'll be sure to keep you abreast of any developments .
There is a naive quality about Rodrik 's belief in government ’s capacity to shape efficient economic designs .
Since his writing is very influential as well as wrong - headed , it needs refutation .
First , he calls for various forms of organized government - business collaboration .
In the advanced societies this was called corporatism .
Despite having the advantage of modern state institutional capacity Germany and the UK largely gave up corporatism when it became obvious that corporatism was inflexible and non-evolutionary .
In developing countries without formal divisions of powers and democratic accountability , government - business ' embeddedness ' is more likely to simply take the form of collusion and rent seeking .
Rather than engineering “ financial incentives ” or utopian “ states of mind ” , governments can more usefully focus on the economic incentives that nature provides by improving regulatory framework to ensure formally equal playing fields for competitive markets in which the incentive for cost discovery is the possibility of extinction .
Second , Rodrik calls for temporary and performance - based government incentives .
This is pie in the sky .
No political system has ever been devised that could withstand the interest - group pressures implied by any state - activist form of promoting business .
It may reasonably be said in line with Schumpeterian theory that government ’s job is to ensure that monopolistic privileges generated by market actors can only ever be temporary .
It is not , however , government ’s role to generate those privileges in the shape of subsidies or protection given in return for state - defined performance targets .
Third , Rodrik calls for transparent and accountable decision making in industrial policy , leaving the field open to new entrants .
The welfare states in advanced democracies are already overloaded .
It is absurd to suggest that governments should actually expand their field of microlevel discretionary decision making about individual enterprises .
Authoritarian industrial policy is bad enough .
‘ Democratic ’ industrial policy subject to public choice lobbying dynamics would be worse !
Fourth , Rodrik claims there is a difference between picking winners and identifying losers .
The distinction is spurious .
It would not be necessary to identify a loser ( and withdraw a public subsidy ) unless there had already been a wasteful effort to pick a winner .
Whilst it is true that learning is by doing , i.e. by trial and error , the prior task of policymaking can reasonably be to predict the unintended consequences of stupid policies .
There is no point in making errors deliberately for the sake of learning .
The onus of cost discovery should lie with business ( when it fails ) rather than the government that foots the bill .
In any case , monitoring of business errors by government requires an unlikely army of politically detached and superbly disciplined bureaucrats .
Even if bureaucrats had enough expert knowledge of economic life to pick winners and identify losers ( which they do n’t ) it would still be a costly , risky and unnecessary task for government to undertake .
Fifth , there is of course evidence that industrial policy can succeed , for a while .
But there are just as many examples of its catastrophic failure .
If we leave aside island or city states such as Singapore , there is not a single country in the world in which the types of large - scale and prolonged neoactivism Rodrik proposes in his most recent book have not eventually led to political decay and economic crisis .
Just look at Japan .
( China cannot possibly sustain its present path . )
I describe the Weberian counter - logic to Rodrik ’s influential neoactivism more fully in chapter six of my book Capitalism , Institutions , and Economic Development ( 2009/2011 ) .

Critics are crying foul after provincial tax collectors hit the HST jackpot .
Ontario's 1,251 collectors are each receiving up to $ 45,000 in severance pay as their jobs transfer from the provincial ministry of revenue to the federal equivalent .
Displaced employees are being offered jobs with the Canada Revenue Agency because collecting the 13 per cent harmonized sales tax will be a federal responsibility .
The HST , which blends the 8 per cent provincial sales tax with the 5 per cent GST , comes into force July 1 .
In British Columbia , where the HST also comes into force in July , provincial tax collectors who accept a transfer to the federal government will not get severance pay .
The Ontario payouts had the Progressive Conservatives on their feet in the Legislature on Thursday .
Tory MPP Ted Arnott ( Wellington - Halton Hills ) demanded to know why employees were receiving a " hefty - six - month severance package " for changing job titles .
" They 're not going to miss a day of work , and they 're being paid up to $ 45,000 to change their business cards , " he said .
Premier Dalton McGuinty defended the severance from Listowel , Ont. , where he was making an announcement , saying the government is bound by the terms of the employees ' collective agreement .
" There is an agreement in place .
I think we have a responsibility to respect those contracts , " McGuinty said .
" I guess the alternative is we could introduce legislation in the House and say , ` You signed a deal and we signed a deal , it is no longer convenient for us to respect that deal . '
So , where does that take you ? "
Government officials can't just change their mind whenever they feel like it , McGuinty added .
About $ 25 million has been set aside for severance costs , assuming all the employees take the transfer , said Leslie O'Leary , press secretary to Revenue Minister John Wilkinson .
Ironically , the Tories introduced the clause that provides for severance pay when premier John Robarts was in power in 1970 – a fact that had Liberal Finance Minister Dwight Duncan chortling .
" It 's an interesting position that he takes today , having had a Conservative government put that clause in the collective agreement and now saying that we should n't honour it , " Duncan said .
News of the payouts comes as Ontario tries to come to grips with a record $ 24.7 billion deficit – a process McGuinty has said will see him approach public - sector unions for co-operation .
The tax collectors belong to the Ontario Public Service Employees ' Union ( OPSEU ) and the Association of Management and Professional Crown Employees of Ontario .
The government is just following the terms of the collective agreement , said Greg Hamara , an OPSEU spokesman .
" Our members are losing their jobs .
That is a termination , " he said .
The severance is equal to one week 's pay per year for up to 26 years of service .
The collective agreement covering the tax collectors who belong to OPSEU came into force Jan. 1 , 2009 , and runs for four years .
The government announced the HST in its March 2009 budget .
Hamara added the members will be losing their seniority when they move to the revenue agency .

" When the inevitable job cuts Prime Minister Stephen Harper is threatening come , it is potentially our members who could be affected , " he said .
That differs from British Columbia , where Graham Currie , spokesman for the B.C. Ministry of Finance , said the agreement signed with provincial employees matches them to a position in the federal government where they will receive similar salaries and keep their seniority in terms of job security .
Erin Sikora , a spokeswoman with the B.C. Government Employees ' Union , said the collective agreement signed in 2006 does not require severance for employees transferred to another employer .
" It 's quite different here in than in Ontario .
Our collective agreements are different , " said Sikora .
" There is no severance for transfers . "
Outside of question period , Duncan defended the payout and blamed it on the work of " successive governments in Ontario . "
" We had to follow the provisions of the collective agreement that have been in place for many , many years , " he told reporters .
The employees were not guaranteed jobs but federal government officials found spots for everyone .
" To their enormous credit , and I want to give them credit publicly , they did that , " he said .
There have been numerous opportunities to take this provision out of the collective agreement but it was never done , Duncan said .
Many of the employees entitled to the payout live in areas such as Durham Region that have been hit hard by the recession , he added .
The employees will be offered jobs in a revenue office close to home , said O'Leary .
Those who accept the job offers will join the federal agency in two groups – the first in November , and the second group on March 1 , 2012 .
They wo n't miss a day of work because they are scheduled to start with the federal agency immediately after their last day of employment with Ontario .
The tax collectors can opt to stay with the Ontario public service .
But those who do so will not get the severance , said O'Leary .

After living through a decade of attacks against the Confederate battle flag and school administrators suspending students who wear Dixie regalia , Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell ( R ) is , like a true Johnny Reb , fighting back .
By reinstating Confederate History Month after previous Democratic governors banned it in the Old Dominion , Governor McDonnell says he wants to remember the South 's sacrifices ahead of sesquicentennial commemorations of the Civil War , which start next year .
This is the state that housed the Confederate government in Richmond and where most of the Civil War , the country 's bloodiest campaign , was fought .
But the designation by the Virginia governor for the month of April is bringing back ideas and symbols that many Americans – including many Southerners – find offensive and divisive .
It could derail efforts to win favor among Democrats , not to mention Southern blacks , and it could drive a cultural wedge into the Republican Party as it looks for ways to win in November .
On the other hand , McDonnell 's proclamation could also rally a substantial conservative base that 's felt beleaguered by attempts to , if not rewrite , effectively banish Confederate history .
Some see those attempts as part of a political correctness movement .
" If the proclamation does anything , it hopefully will be a nail in the coffin of political correctness , " writes Brag Bowling , commander of the Virginia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other groups have for years fought against Southern states keeping Confederate symbols , especially on public lands such as capitol grounds and public colleges .
To many , the Old South is a slave - holding blot on history and deserves to be demoted in the annals of history .
Indeed , most appalling to critics is McDonnell 's decision to leave out references to slavery , which were included in a previous proclamation .
McDonnell 's declaration asks Virginians to " understand the sacrifices of the Confederate leaders , soldiers and citizens during the period of the Civil War .... "
He did not mention slavery , he told The Washington Post , because " there were any number of aspects to that conflict between the states . "
He continues , " Obviously , it involved slavery .
It involved other issues .
But I focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia . "
" Confederate history is full of many things that unfortunately are not put forth in a proclamation of this kind , nor are they things that anyone wants to celebrate , " former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder , who is the first African - American to win the governor 's office in Virginia , tells the Post .
" It 's one thing to sound a cause of rallying a base .
But it 's quite another to distort history . "
One backdrop to efforts like McDonnell 's declaration is what Southern Legal Resource Center founder Kirk Lyons describes as a situation where Southerners are facing discrimination , harassment , humiliation , employment termination , and school suspensions " simply because they 're proud of their Confederate ancestry . "
At the same time , some Southerners are starting to reclaim their heritage , in part by flying giant Confederate flags along Southern interstates .
McDonnell , who has been known as a staunch social conservative , avoided hot - button cultural issues during a governor 's race that was seen as a repudiation of recent Democratic victories across the United States .
But he has since waded into cultural issues such the gay rights debate and now Confederate commemorations .
Politically , McDonnell 's move shows the tone - deafness of Republicans , writes Charles Johnson in True / Slant , an online news network .
" Republicans like McDonnell are reveling in their racism , and pandering to the most vile segments of US society , " he writes .
" And then they whine and complain when African Americans want nothing to do with them . "
Shawn Rider , in a review of Tony Horwitz 's " Confederates in the Attic , " writes that the age - old pull between the darker meaning of the Civil War 's symbols and the affection Southerners have for their ancestors who fought and died in the Civil War is an enduring American condition .
" [ G ] reat enthusiasm leads to reverence for ancestors that do not necessarily deserve it , " he concludes .
" Still , it is not as if any individual can decide for another which ancestors are worth revering …
[ W ]e need the courage to confront our [ past ] head on .... "

I have a fear of horror films , and by extension horror games .
I 'm just too attenuated to suspense and having the hell scared out of me .
But what I 'm really experiencing , argues one writer , is just that : scary , not horror .

Craig Lager , at Gaming Daily , points out the real differences in the two themes in arguing that the horror games genre has to grow up .
Calling such games as Doom 3 and F.E.A.R. " lazy in execution " and stocked with jump - out - at - you tropes , he compares them to scenes in other games that truly are horrific .
The difference is , of course , a design question , which is why we 're chewing this over here .
Horror , to me , would demand stronger writing and the ability to communicate a complex set of feelings through the medium : Sadness , dread , a little anger or revulsion .
Brian and I , covering crime and car wrecks , confronted some very horrible things without being afraid of them .

But I never walked into an imminently dangerous situation .
That 's fear , which is a survival response , and as it comes from the lizard brain set of stimuli it 's more easily provoked .
And that 's where most games are , currently , Lager says .
Maybe until they advance , the name of the sub - genre should be changed to " survival scary . "
Horror Needs to Mature [ Gaming Daily , March 8 ]
Stuff jumping out at you is always going to be scary .
Not horrific , but scary – which I think holds a more significant difference than just scale .
Someone jumping at you and shouting ‘ boo ' as you walk down a familiar , brightly lit corridor in the middle of the day will make you jump .
It 's not a nice experience , and only worsened if you are semi expecting it .
With a vague fore - warning a week in advance , suddenly that corridor is an unpleasant environment .
It 's not a scary corridor ; you are just scared every time you walk down it of what might happen .
And yes , we could argue semantics of my use of ' scary ' here , but you get the point .
The corridor is not horrific , your apprehension is built merely on the suggestion of a cheap scare that anyone could pull off .
Games are great at doing this this .
Magical code can make things appear right in your face with a crash of sound .
They prepare you for it too – the build up of string music and faintly audible noises of suggestion ; the equivalent of that vague fore - warning .
FEAR does it exquisitely , DOOM 3 does it , Dead Space , Condemned ; they all do it .
What they are n't so good at though is genuine horror .
Making you scared , not because you know that something is going to get shoved in your face , but because something that goes against what you fundamentally know as right is happening – a primeval fear .
The Cradle ; a famously horrible level in Thief 3 took me about 4 months to complete .
It 's a level built inside a mental - asylum - turned - orphanage which suffered a massive fire .
I could n't progress for more than scant seconds at a time without genuine terror building in me .
Nothing ever jumps out at you in The Cradle , nothing runs at you screaming .
There is actually little drama at all – just a horrible back story , eery shadows and an incessant banging coming from the attic .
I was a quivering wreck .
For that single level
Thief 3 had managed to completely undermine every single self proclaimed horror game out there , and it did it casually .
It was one level , a singularity , and it worked . [...]
As horror films progressed from men in monster costumes , games need to progress from this in - your - face nonsense .
It 's cheap , joyless thrills that are used at the expense of creating proper terror .
I want to be afraid for my life , not afraid of jumping out of my chair .
I want exploration into fearful territory , not screaming faces filling my monitor .
There is a definite place for horror games in my heart but not when they are making me squeal rather than worry .
It needs to mature , to see what the likes of Stalker and Thief did and build on it – and then I might actually complete more of them too .

Adeyoola was found guilty of murdering 84 - year Anne Mendel , who was found by her husband in March last year lying in a pool of blood at the bottom of the staircase in her home .
She had been stabbed 14 times .
The DNA of the 18 - year - old , who had formerly been a neighbour , was found on Mrs Mendel 's hand , a fact Adeyoola explained away by saying she had , by chance , helped the elderly woman across the road earlier that day .
Adeyoola pleaded not guilty , but the prosecution argued successfully that she had carried out the murder herself , possibly as a " dry run " for the slaughter of a wealthy woman who would make a more lucrative " job " .
It was a killing the teenager had meticulously planned in a murder manual written a few months earlier when she was in juvenile custody .
Staff at the Bullwood Hall juvenile offenders ' institution , where Adeyoola was serving a sentence for shoplifting , found the blueprint in October 2004 , during an inspection of her cell .
On being confronted the teenager claimed the whole thing was fiction .
But within the space of a few months the fiction turned into reality .
The handwritten notes , entitled " Prison and After : Making life count " , began innocently , with plans to " lose two stones from 11 stone eight to nine and a half stone " , and " locate two - bed apartment " .
Adeyoola , herself the daughter of a millionaire property developer , went on to outline how she would obtain bank accounts , " make £ 2,000 " to furnish her apartment , buy a Mercedes and clothes and DVDs .
Despite having been privately educated Adeyoola left school with no qualifications , and wanted to obtain fake GCSE and A - Level qualifications over the internet , and mock up a CV stating she had attended the Chelmsford School for Girls .
But " the main changes for [ a ] happy future " depended on Adeyoola getting " a minimum of £ 3m " , according to the journal .
For this she would need to rob and murder an elderly woman , and frame the woman 's husband for the killing .
Such a feat would require equipment : petrol canisters , plastic bags , cling film , semi-automatic guns , Taser stun guns and a bullet - proof vest were all duly listed .
So were various disguises - wigs , dark glasses , and bizarrely , a " full body fat suit , approximately 18 stone woman " .
She sketched out her ideal victim : " She must be wealthy , quite elderly and defenceless .
Find a candidate and watch her .
Their routine must be closely observed .
Follow her .
She will probably be married .
See if they get any visitors .
Create a survey questionnaire and visit them disguised as an A - level student .
Tell them it 's field work .
Ask them : ' Do you have guns to protect yourself ? ' "
The attack was imagined in emotionless detail : lie in wait for the victim , creep up on her , and cover her mouth with a gloved hand .
Once in the house , threaten the victim with a knife , extract bank account details and the code to her safe , get her to write a fake ' I 'm leaving ' note , and then despatch her .
" With your butcher 's knife remove her head .
Wrap it in film to contain bleeding , detach limbs one by one , " she wrote .
" When you have completed the task , put head , body pieces in black bag . "
The " job " was to be done by February 2005 .
Throughout her trial Adeyoola insisted the document was a work of fiction , notes for a crime thriller she was writing in the style of a James Patterson book .
Following the discovery of the papers in her cell she was interviewed by a senior staff member and psychologist , whom she told : " I want them back .
It 's a story . "
In court she dismissed the manual as " the scribblings of a 16 - year - old girl " .
She said she was fascinated by writers such as Martina Cole and James Patterson , and wanted to emulate them .
" I had always considered writing a book .
I 'd like to be an author .
When I was in Bullwood Hall I thought it would be a good place to start , " she told the court .
In her evidence the teenager also told how she had set up house with another girl in Belsize Park , north London , and worked as an escort to pay the rent .
" All we had to do was go out on a date and we could make £ 500 a night .
We could make up to £ 5,000 a week , " she said .
" It was safe because we shadowed each other and it was easy . "
A police source described finding a cache of sex toys when Adeyoola 's flat was raided after she was arrested .
" There were several vibrators , nipple clamps , lesbian pornographic magazines , edible underwear made of candy , revealing outfits , handcuffs - all sorts of equipment , " the source said .
Police also discovered piles of stolen designer clothes and a book entitled Great Crimes .
Adeyoola also told the court she had begun stealing from shops at age 15 , something she described as a " skill " .
She earned a string of convictions for theft , which culminated in her serving three months in a young offenders ' institution , where she hatched her murder plans .
The young woman was also charged with two counts of peverting the course of justice , after she was taped setting up a bogus alibi for the murder with a 16 - year - old accomplice .
She and the 16 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , were convicted on one of those counts .
Speaking after the verdict , Detective Inspector Steve Morris of the Metropolitan police described the case as " a wicked , premeditated murder committed by a callous , devious young woman and her cold , calculated use of extreme violence beggars belief " .
Her father , Bola Adeyoola , who runs a successful property management company , said : " What she did was evil . "
Presiding Judge Richard Hone QC suggested she may have even committed the murder to amass " material " for her future literary endeavours .
Adeyoola was remanded in custody to await sentencing next month .
A life of privilege
Kemi Adeyoola is the daughter of Bola Adeyoola , a property manager and former boxer who is worth an estimated £ 10 m .
He said yesterday that his daughter was a spoilt , cunning girl who had been obsessed with money from an early age .
He lost contact with her when she was 11 .
After that , he said , he passed money and messages to her through her grandparents .
Following her release from Bullwood Hall prison he set her up in a flat but they fell out when he advised her to " go straight " .
According to Mr Adeyoola , she responded by vandalising his office .
Despite the discovery of the " blueprint for murder " , psychologists at Bullwood Hall had held high hopes for Adeyoola on her release , describing her as an articulate , " intelligent and sophisticated " girl .
