WASHINGTON  Within hours of President Obama ’s decision to penalize imports of automobile tires from China , Chinese officials accused the United States of violating international trade laws and succumbing to political pressure for protectionism .
“ China is firmly opposed to this measure of serious commercial protectionism by the United States , ” the Chinese ministry of commerce said Saturday .
The sharp and swift reaction , though not necessarily indicative of a serious new clash , amounted to a warning shot just at a time when American officials need China ’s help on issues including the global economic recovery and possible additional sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program .
Few decisions by President Obama have appeared more uncomfortable and fraught with larger considerations than the blandly worded announcement at 9:15 p.m.
Friday that he would impose a tariff of 35 percent on Chinese tires for cars and light trucks .
At Hot Chips this past week , AMD unveiled more details of the upcoming 12 - core " Magny - Cours " processor that it hopes will help it stay competitive in the server game .
Due in 2010 on AMD 's 45 nm SOI process , Magny - Cours uses the same basic core microarchitecture as the current Shanghai quad - core server processor , so if there 's any improvement in per - thread performance it will have to come from better system design .
The basic idea behind Magny - Cours is simple : take two six - core Istanbul processors , downclock them a bit to reduce power , and squeeze them into a multichip module ( MCM ) so that they can fit into a single socket .
By using an MCM , AMD will be able to fit 12 cores into the same thermal and power envelope as Istanbul .
Making this work requires a few tradeoffs , and one of them is the MCM itself .
AMD had previously ridiculed Intel 's use of an MCM for its first dual - core effort , the Pentium 4 - based Smithfield , as not " true " dual - core .
They repeated the charge with Intel 's first quad - core , which was also an MCM .
But with Nehalem cleaning up in per-core absolute performance , AMD is having to hustle to maintain a credible server presence , and part of that hustle is adopting the MCM strategy that it had formerly ridiculed .
For system architecture reasons , AMD 's MCM picture is a little more complex than was Intel 's , because each Istanbul chip has its own on - die dual - channel DDR3 memory controller , along with four HyperTransport links .
Obviously , you can't push each chip 's full interconnect bandwidth through a single socket , so AMD had to cut out some links .
The company 's MCM 2.0 design has four total HT ports ( two per chip ) and four DDR3 memory ports ( two per chip ) on each MCM .
For each individual chip , one of the links is x16 and another is x8 .
The two chips are connected inside the module by a x16 HT link .
Even with four HT links and four memory channels to keep the MCM fed , 12 cores is still a lot to pack into a single socket , and bandwidth starvation is a concern .
To help alleviate the bandwidth pressure AMD's Istanbul made a very smart tradeoff in the form of HT Assist , and this tradeoff is carried over to Magny - Cours , where it 's even more necessary .
One of the big challenges in multiprocessor system design is keeping the various processors ' caches in sync with one another ; solutions to this problem all involve some amount of communication among the processors , and this " snoop " traffic eats up valuable bus bandwidth .
The solution that AMD has adopted with Istanbul and Magny - Cours involves setting aside 1MB of each chip 's 6MB cache to store a directory of the contents of the other chips ' caches , so that by consulting this local directory each chip can avoid broadcasting a significant number of traffic - increasing snoop requests to the other chips .
The reason HT Assist works is that die area is relatively cheap compared to bus and socket bandwidth , so any trick that lets you trade some on - die transistors for a boost in real - world bus bandwidth is a win .
This is in fact the basic idea behind caches of all kinds , and HT Assist 's directory is really just another type of cache .
Per - socket bandwidth will become increasingly precious as the number of cores in each socket goes up , and as a result we 're going to see multicore floorplans swing back to the way things were at the end of the single - core era , i.e. , where a processor die is mostly a large chunk of very fast memory with some compute blocks embedded in it .
After Magny - Cours , AMD intends to keep upping the per-socket core count while maintaining backwards compatibility with Magny - Cours ' and Istanbul 's socket , power , and thermals .

WASHINGTON / OSLO ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in a stunning decision that honored the first - year U.S. president more for promise than achievement and drew both praise and skepticism around the world .
The bestowal of one of the world ’s top accolades on Obama , who has yet to score a major foreign policy success after nearly nine months in office , was greeted with gasps from the audience at the announcement ceremony in Oslo .
Describing himself as surprised and deeply humbled , Obama said he would accept the award as a “ call to action ” to confront the global challenges of the 21st century .
“ I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations , ” he said in the White House Rose Garden .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Obama for “ his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples , ” citing his fledgling push for nuclear disarmament and his outreach to the Muslim world .
Obama , a Democrat who took office as the first black U.S. president in January , has been widely credited with improving America ’s global image after the eight - year presidency of George W. Bush , who alienated both friends and foes with go - it - alone policies like the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
But critics called the Nobel committee ’s decision premature , given that Obama has achieved few tangible gains as he grapples with challenges ranging from the war in Afghanistan and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea .
Obama , told of the prize in a pre-dawn call from his press secretary , now also has the burden of living up to its expectations .
The president , who will travel to Oslo to receive the award on December 10 , plans to donate the prize money of 10 million Swedish crowns -- roughly $ 1.4 million -- to charity , the White House said .
LITANY OF UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS
Obama , 48 , has struggled with a litany of foreign policy problems bequeathed to him by Bush , while taking a more multilateral approach than his predecessor .
Obama acknowledged that while winning a prize dedicated to peace , he was commander - in - chief of a country in two wars .
“ We have to confront the world as we know it , ” he said .
He won the award on the same day he was convening his war counsel to weigh whether to send thousands more troops to Afghanistan to turn the tide against a resurgent Taliban .
His troubles at home include a battered economy and a fierce debate over healthcare reform that have chipped away at his once - lofty approval ratings and a Republican opposition that has moved well past the honeymoon phase .
“ One thing is certain -- President Obama wo n’t be receiving any awards from Americans for job creation , fiscal responsibility , or backing up rhetoric with concrete action . ”
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement .
But Obama is still widely seen around the world as an inspirational figure .
“ Very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world ’s attention and given its people hope for a better future , ” the Nobel committee said in its citation .
LAST SLAP FOR BUSH ?
Some analysts saw it as a final slap in the face for Bush from the European establishment , which had resented what they saw as his arrogant “ cowboy diplomacy ” in world affairs .
U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters the prize could stimulate diplomacy .
“ We think that this gives us a sense of momentum when the United States has accolades tossed its way rather than shoes , ” he said .

Crowley ’s remark was an apparent reference to a December 2008 incident in which an Iraqi reporter hurled his shoes at Bush and called him a “ dog ” at news conference , both grave insults in the Arab World .
While the award won praise from statesmen such as Nelson Mandela , Mikhail Gorbachev and Jimmy Carter , all Nobel laureates , it was also attacked in some quarters as hasty and undeserved .
Afghanistan ’s Taliban mocked the award .
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid , speaking to Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location , said it was absurd to give a peace award to a man who had sent 21,000 extra troops to Afghanistan , and Obama “ should have won the ‘ Nobel Prize for escalating violence and killing civilians . ’ ”
Despite declining U.S. public support for the war , Obama is considering a request for at least 40,000 more troops from his top commander , who says otherwise the mission could fail .
Slideshow ( 12 images )
Nobel Committee Chairman Thorbjoern Jagland rejected suggestions from journalists that Obama was getting the prize too early .
“ We hope this can contribute a little bit to enhance what he is trying to do , ” he told a news conference .
Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize after Carter won in 2002 , Woodrow Wilson picked it up in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt was chosen for the 1906 prize .
TOO HASTY ?
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki called the award premature , but at the same time contrasted Obama with the Bush administration .
“ The decision in this connection was hasty and the granting of this prize was premature , ” Mottaki told the semi-official Mehr news agency .
“ If this prize serves as an element of encouragement for the practical negation of the previous U.S. administration ’s war - mongering and unilateral policies with an orientation on a just peace we would not oppose it . ”
Liaqat Baluch , a senior leader of the Jamaat - e - Islami , a conservative religious party in Pakistan , called the award an embarrassing “ joke . ”
But chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat , expressed hope Obama would help achieve Middle East peace .
Lauding Obama , U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said , “ His commitment to work through the United Nations gives the world ’s people fresh hope and fresh prospects . ”
While many Americans voiced pride , some were puzzled .
“ It would be wonderful if I could think why he won , ” said Claire Sprague , 82 , a retired English professor as she walked her dog in Manhattan ’s Greenwich Village .
“ They wanted to give him an honor I guess , but I ca n’t think what for . ”
Obama ’s former Republican presidential rival John McCain said Americans should be pleased for their president , but also insisted he now has “ even more to live up to . ”
The committee said it attached “ special importance to Obama ’s vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons , ” saying he had “ created a new international climate . ”
On other pressing issues , Obama is still searching for breakthroughs on Iran ’s disputed nuclear program , on stalled Middle East peacemaking and the fight against climate change .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he looked forward to working with Obama on peace efforts , a day after Israel ’s foreign minister said there was no chance of a peace deal for many years .

Controversial HIV / AIDS Campaign
In Bed with Hitler
A controversial German health education campaign , focused on the prevention of HIV / AIDS , features Adolf Hitler having sex .
It has been criticized around the world as tasteless and inappropriate -- but the campaign 's makers do n't see what the problem is .
Typography can be one of the most creatively rewarding parts of web design , but it can also be one of the most frustrating .
Working with just one or two fonts can be challenging enough for most web designers , yet some still insist on using three , four , seven , or even more fonts in their designs .
Some people excel at creating sites with complicated typography , while others fail miserably .
Read on to find out tricks to creating fantastic website designs with complicated type , as well as some great examples of sites that get it right , and those that get it wrong .
1. Pay attention to scale and proportion
Multiple fonts work best together when they have similar proportion and scale .
For example , Georgia and Verdana have similar shapes , even though one is serif and one is sans serif .
The same could be said for Times New Roman and Arial Narrow .
Look at specific characters in each font to see how similar they are , as well as entire words .
Fonts do n’t necessarily have to be identical in scale and proportion .
What you want to look for are either fonts that are very , very similar , or fonts that are very , very different .
Fonts that are “ kind of the same ” are generally going to look strangest when placed near each other .
Fonts that are very similar are going to appear to have the same weight on screen in most cases , while fonts that are very different can more easily be played against one another to give emphasis to specific parts of the site .
2. Unify fonts with color or style
If you throw up six different fonts on your site , with ten different colors , and four different styles , you ’re probably just going to give your visitors a headache ( if they stick around that long ) .
While you do n’t necessarily have to only use one color or one style , you need to be much more careful in how you use them .
As far as colors go , try to stick to colors either in the same hue or saturation level .
You want the colors to mesh , rather than clash .
You have a bit more leeway with font styles , but make sure that the styles you choose make sense with the existing weight and emphasis of the particular fonts you ’ve chosen .
You can make a heavier font oblique ( italic ) to de-emphasize it ’s weight a bit , or add a strong tag to a lighter - weight font to bring it more in - line with the heavier fonts on your page .
Underlining can emphasize both light and heavy fonts without making either appear heavier than they already are .
3 . Pay attention to priority and emphasis of different fonts
This has been touched on a bit already , but the priority and emphasis that different fonts convey naturally has to be taken into account .
Some fonts are going to draw more attention than others .
It ’s one reason using multiple fonts is both incredibly fun and very hard to get right .
You can compensate for heavier or lighter fonts in a few ways .
Increasing or decreasing the size is the most obvious .
Adding styles and font decorations ( oblique , strong , underline , etc. ) can also emphasize and even help de-emphasize most fonts .
Changing the color of a font can help , too .
If your typography is mostly black , adding in shades of gray to de-emphasize certain parts can work really well .
In fact , putting certain type in gray can work even if your design is more colorful ( to really unify things , make sure the gray has just a hint of one of the main colors in your other typography ) .
4. Avoid anything too similar
Similar fonts are tricky .
Using something like Georgia and Garamond right near each other , for example , does n’t really do much and can end up making one or both fonts look a little off .
A lot of non-designer folks might not really see the differences between the fonts and think they just look strange — not quite right .
The same can be said for fonts like Verdana and Tahoma or Arial and Helvetica .
Try for a bit more variation for the best end - result .
5 . Keep body text readable
While playing around with funky typography can work really well in navigation , headers , and other parts of your site , large chunks of body copy just do n’t work well with multiple typefaces .
Stick to one , preferably site - wide .
Pick a font that ’s easy to read and web safe while also being similar in proportion and weight to the other fonts on your site .
6 . Do n’t overlook different font styles
We ’ve talked about how using different styles and font decorations can change the priority and importance of different typographic elements .
But one thing many designers overlook is using multiple styles , sizes , and decorations to achieve the look of mixed typography while still working entirely with web - safe fonts .
This technique is also great for designers who are just starting to experiment with web typography , as it eliminates many of the common issues with proportion and scale between different typefaces .
Mix italic , bold , small caps , all caps and other styles within the same fonts to get the look of mixed typefaces without the headaches .
7 . Trust your instincts
This is probably the most important thing on this list .
Whenever you ’re designing anything , you should be sure to take a step back from it often and look at the big picture .
If something does n’t look right or feel right to you , cut it .
It ’s no different with typography .
If a certain font just does n’t seem to be working , you ’ll have to cut something .
In these cases , you have two options : you can cut that font and find another one that works better , or you can scrap all your other fonts and find ones that work better with the one you ’re having trouble with .
What you do depends on which fonts you ’re more attached to .
Examples of Great Typography
Here ’s a collection of sites that use multiple fonts really well .
Most use between three and five fonts , and sometimes in really creative ways ( there ’s at least one case where the ampersand in the header is a different font than basically everything else on the site ) .
Hubble Opens New Eyes on the Universe
Space Telescope Science Institute
Baltimore , MD
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope is back in business , ready to uncover new worlds , peer ever deeper into space , and even map the invisible backbone of the universe .
The first snapshots from the refurbished Hubble showcase the 19 - year - old telescope 's new vision .
Topping the list of exciting new views are colorful multi- wavelength pictures of far - flung galaxies , a densely packed star cluster , an eerie " pillar of creation , " and a " butterfly " nebula .
With the release of these images , astronomers have declared Hubble a fully rejuvenated observatory .
Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski , D - Md. , unveiled the images at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , on Sept. 9 , 2009 .
With its new imaging camera , Hubble can view galaxies , star clusters , and other objects across a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum , from ultraviolet to near - infrared light .
A new spectrograph slices across billions of light - years to map the filamentary structure of the universe and trace the distribution of elements that are fundamental to life .
The telescope 's new instruments also are more sensitive to light and can observe in ways that are significantly more efficient and require less observing time than previous generations of Hubble instruments .
NASA astronauts installed the new instruments during the space shuttle servicing mission in May 2009 .
Besides adding the instruments , the astronauts also completed a dizzying list of other chores that included performing unprecedented repairs on two other science instruments .
Now that Hubble has reopened for business , it will tackle a whole range of observations .
Looking closer to Earth , such observations will include taking a census of the population of Kuiper Belt objects residing at the fringe of our solar system , witnessing the birth of planets around other stars , and probing the composition and structure of the atmospheres of other worlds .
Peering much farther away , astronomers have ambitious plans to use Hubble to make the deepest - ever portrait of the universe in near - infrared light .
The resulting picture may reveal never - before - seen infant galaxies that existed when the universe was less than 500 million years old .
Hubble also is now significantly more well - equipped to probe and further characterize the behavior of dark energy , a mysterious and little - understood repulsive force that is pushing the universe apart at an ever - faster rate .

Information theory – perhaps one of the most remarkable inventions of the twentieth century - naturally leads on to the consideration of how information can be coded and hence coding theory .
A Programmers Guide To Theory
First Draft
There is a more recent version of this :
Now available as a paperback and ebook from Amazon .
Contents
* To be revised
In Information Theory we learned that if a message or symbol occurs with probability p then the information contained in that symbol or message is - log 2 ( p ) bits .
For example , consider the amount of information contained in a single letter from an alphabet .
Assuming there are 26 letters in an alphabet and assuming they are all used equally often the probability of receiving any one particular letter is 1/26 which gives - log 2 ( 1/26 ) =4.7 bits per letter .
It is also obvious from other elementary considerations that five bits are more than enough to represent 26 symbols .
Quite simply five bits allow you to count up to more than 26 and so you can assign one letter of the alphabet to each number .
In fact , five bits is enough to represent 32 symbols because you can count up to 31 i.e. 11111=31 .
Using all five bits you can associate say A with 0 and Z with 25 and the values from 26 to 31 are just wasted .
It seems a shame to have wasted bits just because we can’t quite find a way to use 4.7 bits – or can we .
Can we split the bit ?
Average information
Before we go on to consider “ splitting the bit ” we need to look more carefully at the calculation of the number of bits of information in one symbol from an alphabet of 26 .
Clearly the general case is that a symbol from an alphabet of n symbols has information equal to –log 2 ( n ) bits assuming that every symbol has equal probability .
Of course what is wrong with this analysis is that the letters of the alphabet are not all equally likely to occur .
For example , if you do n’t receive a letter “ e ” you would be surprised – count the number in this sentence .
However your surprise at seeing the letter “ z ” should be higher – again count the number in some other sentence than this one !
Empirical studies can provide us with the actual rates that letters occur – just count them in a book for example .
If you add the “ Space ” character to the set of symbols you will discover that it is by far the most probable character with a probability of 0.185 of occurring , followed by “ e ” at 0.100 , “ t ” at 0.080 and so on .. down to “ z ” which has a probability of only 0.0005 .
It makes you wonder why we bother with “ z ” at all !
But , given that “ z ” is so unlikely its information content is very high –log 2 ( 0.0005 ) =10.96 bits .
In other words “ z ” contains nearly 11 bits of information compared to just over 3 bits for “ e ” .
If you find this argument difficult to follow just imagine that you are placing bets on the next symbol to appear .
You expect the next symbol to be a Space character so you are very surprised when it turns out to be a z .
Your betting instincts tell you what the expected behaviour of the world is and when something happens that is n't expected you gains some information .
Taken to the extreme it seems almost obvious .
The sun rises every morning and so the news that it has risen this morning is really no news - no information .
Now consider the opposite event , that is some information !
We can define an average information that we expect to get from a single character taken from the alphabet .
If the ith symbol occurs with probability p i then the information it contains is –log 2 ( p i ) bits and the average information contained in one symbol , averaged over all symbols is :
Average information=
–p 1 log 2 ( p 1 ) – p 2 log 2 ( p 2 ) –p 3 log 2 ( p 3 ) … –p n log 2 ( p n )
You can see that this is reasonable because each symbol occurs with probability p i and each time it occurs it provides –log 2 ( pi ) bits of information .
Notice that while “ z ” carries 11 bits of information the fact that it does n’t occur very often means that its contribution to the average information is only about 0.0005 x 11 or 0.0055 bits per symbol .
Applying this formula to the letters of the alphabet and their probabilities gives an average information of 4.08 bits per symbol which should be compared to 4.76 bits per symbol for an alphabet of 27 equally likely characters .
Notice that the average information in 27 equally likely characters is also 4.76 bits – to see why try working it out .
There is also a nice theorem which says that the average information per symbol is largest if all of the symbols are equally likely .
This means that if any of the symbols of an alphabet are used more or less often than others the average information per symbol is lower and this observation is the key to data compression techniques .

A mixture of the organic polymer PDDTT and the fullerene derivative shown yields a photodetector with a broad response .
Text Size A A
A promising new polymer photodetector material shows an unprecedented ability to detect photons throughout the full range of UV - Vis to near - IR wavelengths .
Photosensors are ubiquitous tools in today ’s technologies , used for remote sensing , surveillance , and environmental monitoring .
The new material , fabricated by a group that includes University of California , Santa Barbara , physics professor Alan J. Heeger , Cbrite Inc. senior scientist Xiong Gong , and their colleagues there and at South China University of Technology ( SCUT ) , in Guangzhou , could be used to make a single device that would replace the three devices — typically based on GaN , Si , and InGaAs — currently required to cover this spectral range .
Scientists have been exploring the combination of polymers and fullerenes as photodetectors since the early 1990s .
Heeger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 for his work on conductive polymers .
The advantages of polymer photodetectors are many .
For example , whereas today ’s inorganic IR silicon - based photodetectors require cooling to about 4 K , polymer photodetectors can operate at room temperature .
The thin , light polymer materials can also be fabricated into different shapes .
Numerous researchers have developed detectors with sensitivities at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 900 nm , but this new material is the first to detect the full UV - Vis to near - IR spectrum , ranging from 300 to 1,450 nm .
“ The work is very exciting , ” says Yang Yang , a UCLA materials science professor whose group focuses on organic electronic materials and devices .
The paper will “ open a new direction for polymer electronics , ” he adds .
Yang also notes that this particular polymer — known as PDDTT and developed by SCUT chemistry professor Yong Cao — has an unusually small bandgap .
“ Often when a bandgap becomes this small , it could become a conductor , ” he says .
The group spin-cast the polymer with a fullerene derivative into thin films .
It is now fabricating arrays of the detectors , as well as examining ways to expand the spectral response of this class of photodetectors , Gong says .
Sous la Ve République , les interviews et les conférences de presse du président de la République sont des genres particuliers de journalisme et , surtout , de communication politique : des rituels de monarchie républicaine .
Les « hôtes de l’Elysée » , comme on dit , invitent les journalistes de leur choix à ponctuer les monologues présidentiels de questions sans surprise , de relances sans relief et d’objections sans suite .
Présidentialisme des institutions et journalisme de révérence conjuguent leurs effets , sans qu’il soit toujours aisé de démêler ce qui relève du droit de sa majesté à discourir sans répliques et ce qui doit être attribué à la courtoisie complaisante des faire - valoir .
Dernier en date de ces exercices : l ’interview que Nicolas Sarkozy , le mercredi 23 septembre 2009 , a « accordé » , sans doute à sa demande , à David Pujadas et Laurence Ferrari , et que TF1 et France 2 ont diffusée en différé à 20 heures .
Une fois de plus dans l’histoire de la Ve République , l ’interview a donné des apparences de dialogue à un monologue .
Une fois de plus , le président de la République a pu , quand il le voulait , contourner les questions qui lui étaient posées ou les timides objections qui lui étaient soumises .
Une fois de plus , il a pu proférer des énormités sans être contredit .
Si la possibilité de faire une « interview » digne de ce nom d’un Président de la Ve République est à peu près nulle , le seul reproche conséquent qu’on pourrait adresser aux heureux journalistes « élus » serait … d’accepter d’y participer – de ne pas faire la grève du zèle , en quelque sorte .
Mais cela ne saurait nous empêcher de mesurer l’étendue des dégâts , avant de revenir dans un prochain article sur les commentaires autorisés que , la polémique sur les « coupables » de Clearstream aidant , les journalistes – « élus » ou non – ont émis sur ce triste spectacle .
Car les journalistes - commentateurs n’ont , en général , retenu que le « lapsus » présidentiel désignant les prévenus du procès Clearstream comme des « coupables » avant même qu’ils aient été jugés , et l’absence de réaction des ses interlocuteurs .
Pourtant , comme on va le voir , d’autres « perles » auraient mérité qu’on les relève [ 1 ] , et les deux intervieweurs ne l’ont jamais fait .
Prisonniers de leur scénario , ignorants des dossiers ou tétanisés par la verve présidentielle ?
Où l’on peut voir que rien n’a pu enrayer le monologue de Nicolas Sarkozy , mis en scène par Nicolas Sarkozy , qui a pris soin , toutefois , de s’assurer du concours de deux grands journalistes , pour enchaîner les « thèmes » comme d’autres enchaînent les sketches .
Un bêtisier présidentiel resté sans répliques
Scène 1 : La crise racontée aux enfants
Pour commencer , Nicolas Sarkozy nous raconte l’histoire de la crise .
Et ça commence très fort :
- Nicolas Sarkozy : « Y a eu la crise parce que le capitalisme est devenu fou [ … ]
Une bulle s’est créée , et elle a explosé . [… ]
A ce moment - là , la confiance s’est effondrée , et j’avais pris l’engagement devant les Français que pas un centime de leur épargne ne serait sacrifié .
Pas un centime ne l’a été .
Et il faut reconstruire . »
Cet « engagement » tenu de Nicolas Sarkozy a dû surprendre plus d’un téléspectateur .
Mais pas Laurence Ferrari , qui ne relève pas et relance hardiment : «
Mais aujourd ’hui , tout recommence comme avant … »
Ce qui nous vaut une nouvelle déclaration spectaculaire :
- Nicolas Sarkozy : «
Pardon de le dire , enfin si vous me permettez , c’est pas tout à fait exact . [… ]
Il n’y a plus de paradis fiscaux et , à Pittsburg , l’un des enjeux , c’est que dès le premier trimestre de l’année prochaine des sanctions soient appliquées sur des places , sur des pays , qui ne respecteraient pas les règles en la matière . »
« Il n’y a plus de paradis fiscaux » , puisque des sanctions à leur encontre sont … envisagées !
Ce seront donc des paradis moins paradisiaques .
David Pujadas ne relève pas , puisqu’il tient en réserve une question d’une impertinence presque violente , dont Nicolas Sarkozy , concentré sur son monologue , ne tient pas compte :
- David Pujadas : «
Alors on entend votre détermination , est-ce que vous irez jusqu’à quitter ce sommet en cas d’absence de résultats tangibles ? »
- Nicolas Sarkozy : « [ … ]
J’avais dû dire ça à Londres , ça m’avait valu quantité de moqueries , mais on y était arrivé .
Les paradis fiscaux , le secret bancaire , c’est terminé … »
S’il peut marteler une première contre - vérité et en ajouter une deuxième sans être repris , c’est qu’il a lui- même changé de sujet :
- Nicolas Sarkozy : « … mais y a d’autres choses , ça ne résout pas tout .
Y a eu aussi cette pratique absolument effrayante de ce qu’on appelle les bonus sur les traders . »
David Pujadas accompagne le virage présidentiel , en tentant de glisser une nouvelle question :
- David Pujadas : «
Mais alors , tout le monde est d’accord pour dire que c’est un symptôme de la crise mais que ce n’est pas la cause de la crise , même si c’est moralement choquant , alors pourquoi ce choix d’insister sur les bonus ? »
Et Nicolas Sarkozy poursuit sur sa lancée .
« Ce n’est pas la cause de la crise ? » , relancera un peu plus tard Pujadas .
Mais c’est Nicolas Sarkozy qui conduit l’entretien .
Ses interlocuteurs ( et avec eux les téléspectateurs ) l’écouteront pendant 4 minutes raconter l’histoire des bonus défaits par la « position de la France » , à peine interrompu par une relance de Laurence Ferrari ( « Si vous n’arrivez pas à un accord sur les bonus , est - ce que vous considérerez que c’est un échec ? » ) .
C’est à peine s’il concédera à David Pujadas qu’il a entendu sa question dans une formule involontairement savoureuse : « Alors David Pujadas a raison , on peut pas tout focaliser sur les bonus , mais c’est quand même la partie visible de l’iceberg , y a d’autres choses , les règles comptables , je veux pas rentrer dans les détails … »
Des « détails » constituant la majeure partie de « l ’iceberg » , et qui resteront donc immergés .
Scène 2 : Nicolas
Sarkozy taxe le carbone
- Nicolas Sarkozy : « Quelle est la situation ? (…)
Le monde va à sa perte si on continue à émettre du carbone , qui crée un trou dans la couche d’ozone et qui brise les équilibres de la planète .
Ça c’est un constat . »
Un « constat » qui a fait rire beaucoup de monde [ 2 ] ceux qui ne confondent pas le carbone et les gaz CFC ( responsables du trou dans la couche d’ozone ) , mais pas les deux interlocuteurs , qui restent de marbre .
Et qui le resteront face aux deux sorties suivantes .
Sarkozy évoque la taxe carbone , et explique qu’il s’agit de taxer les entreprises qui polluent .
«
Et les particuliers ?! » s’exclament en chœur les deux journalistes vedettes , qui ont travaillé leurs dossiers .
«
Et les particuliers aussi , pour faire changer les comportements » , poursuit en substance Sarkozy : c’est , ajoute - t - il , le même principe que le bonus - malus sur les voitures .
- Laurence Ferrari : «
On aurait pu le faire sur les produits de grande consommation . »
- Nicolas Sarkozy : «
C’est exactement ce qu’on a fait .
J’ai pris un engagement devant les Français , et je le dis à nos compatriotes : tout l’argent , au centime d’euro près , prélevé par la taxe carbone vous sera rendu . »
Annonce stupéfiante [ 3 ] , qui n’est pas sans poser problème .
Pourquoi « changer de comportement » , par exemple , si « tout l’argent nous sera rendu » ?
Des questions qui n’ont pas l’air d’effleurer les deux intervieweurs , qui écoutent religieusement le Président expliquer comment cette nouvelle taxe nous sera versée [ 4 ] .
Dernier exploit , également signalé dans un communiqué du SNJ - CGT qui fustige l’apathie des « porteurs de micros » et l’ensemble de la « mascarade » : « il a osé dire que la France était le premier pays européen à adopter une “ taxe carbone ” , alors que d’autres pays ont institué une telle taxe depuis plusieurs années .
» Naturellement , aucune réaction des « porteurs de micros » , et on passe à la suite , servie sur un plateau par David Pujadas .
Scène 3 : Nicolas Sarkozy guérit l’économie française
Troisième volet : la situation économique intérieure française .
Le ton est donné d’emblée par Pujadas , et il est à la hauteur :
- David Pujadas : «
Alors ça nous amène à l’économie française .
Quel est votre diagnostic aujourd ’hui sur l’économie française ?
Est-ce qu’on peut dire , est -ce que vous dites que le plus dur est derrière nous ou pas ? »
Mais Pujadas a commis une erreur de conducteur et le Président n’a que faire de sa question , puisqu’il n’a pas fini son discours sur l’environnement .
Il revient alors , de son propre chef , sur le sommet de Copenhague , parce que « j’ai deux choses à dire » : la taxe carbone européenne , et son souhait de créer l’Agence mondiale de l’environnement .
Quelques minutes plus tard , Laurence Ferrari peut reprendre le cours de l’entretien , soutenue par Pujadas :
- Laurence Ferrari : « Les Français sont très inquiets de la fin de la crise , est-ce qu’elle approche ou pas ?
Est -ce que vous la voyez arriver ? »
- David Pujadas : « Est -ce que le plus dur est derrière nous ? »
Les prédictions de Nicolas Sarkozy n’auraient pas beaucoup d’intérêt si elles ne lui donnaient l’occasion d’une nouvelle sortie de route , superbement ignorée des deux présentateurs :
- Nicolas Sarkozy : « Naturellement , pour les gens , quand on dit ça va mieux et qu’ils se retrouvent au chômage , faut comprendre !
On a envie de casser son poste de télévision .
[ sourire ]
Parce qu’ils pensent qu’il y a un tel décalage entre ce qu’on dit , vous et moi , et la réalité …
Donc on sera sorti de la crise quand le chômage recommencera à baisser .
Ce que je peux dire , c’est que ça fait deux trimestres que la France a une croissance positive . »
Encore perdu .
Le « décalage entre ce qu’on dit , vous et moi , et la réalité » s’accuse aussitôt : selon le site de TF1 , par exemple , un communiqué de l’AOF publié le 25 septembre indique que « le PIB français a progressé de 0,3 % après quatre trimestres consécutifs de baisse , a annoncé l’Insee » .
Bouquet final
Nullement freiné , Sarkozy enchaîne alors les tonneaux ( « Le plan de relance français a été unanimement vu comme l’un des meilleurs au monde .
L’un des plus efficaces . » ) , jusqu ’au dérapage final , que chacun connaît désormais , surtout parce que l’avocat de Dominique de Villepin en a , presque « en direct » , informé la cour : « Deux juges indépendants ont estimé que les coupables devaient ê tre jugés devant le tribunal correctionnel … ».
Entre-temps , des échanges dont les curieux pourront se faire une idée de la pugnacité en suivant la note [ 5 ] .
David Pujadas tente alors une relance , non dénuée de pertinence .
Renvoyé dans ses cordes par une réponse hors de propos , il insiste timidement , et cède aussitôt devant l’énergique répétition de la « réponse » qui élude la question .
Retenons cette séquence révélatrice :
- David Pujadas : « Est -ce qu’au - delà du fond du dossier , est -ce que ce n’est pas compliqué d’être partie civile dans un procès , alors qu’on sait que le président de la République , chef de l’exécutif , a la tutelle sur les procureurs ? »
- Nicolas Sarkozy : «
Enfin le président de la République n’a pas la tutelle sur les juges qui jugent , hein , jamais ! »
- David Pujadas : «
Sur le parquet … »
- Nicolas Sarkozy ( agitant la main ) : « Jamais !
Jamais !
J’ajoute que quand j’ai déposé plainte et qu’on a voulu me mettre dans le scandale , j’étais pas président de la République .
(…) J’ai certainement beaucoup de défauts , mais je ne suis pas un homme qui ment , je ne suis pas un homme qui renonce , et je ne suis pas un homme qui plaisante avec les principes d’honneur , et de probité . »
Après cette mâle déclaration , Nicolas Sarkozy en fait immédiatement l’application , sur une question de David Pujadas :
- David Pujadas : «
Deux ou trois sujets d’actualité pour terminer .
[ Les tests ADN :] qu’est -ce qui vous a fait changer d’avis ? »
- Nicolas Sarkozy : «
Je n’ai jamais cru à l’immigration zéro »
Jamais , comme le montre par exemple cette vidéo ( que l’on doit à un partisan de de Villiers … ) .
Mais ce mensonge réitéré , qui contraste singulièrement avec l’autoportrait qui précède , ne suscite chez Pujadas que cette question – fondamentale :
- David Pujadas : «
Certains se demandent si c’est votre épouse qui vous a fait changer d’avis… »
Par charité , on rejettera en note la façon dont le président a été odieusement interpellé sur l’humour de son ministre de l’intérieur , la gestion de la crise du lait , ou son état de santé . [ 6 ]
Épilogue
Une dernière question s’imposait cependant , en ce 23 septembre 2009 .
Et c’est David Pujadas qui la posa : « L’entretien touche à sa fin .
Une toute dernière question M. le Président .
Est-ce qu’il vous arrive le matin à New York ou à Paris en vous rasant de penser à 2012 et à une nouvelle candidature ? »
Sarkozy répond non , et Laurence Ferrari insiste , dans une relance où l’on sent pointer l’inquiétude : «
Mais vous laisseriez tout cela en plan , pendant que les chantiers sont en cours ? »
Et le président est contraint d’insister à son tour : Non , il n’y pense pas , vraiment .
Et « j’ai toujours été sincère dans ma vie politique » , ajoute - t - il pour conclure , symbolique cerise sur le gâteau .
On a beau en connaître à l ’avance la recette , il est toujours aussi difficile à avaler .

During his New Hampshire town hall meeting on health care reform in mid-August , Obama explained that under his plan , people who lack health insurance would be able to purchase it in a new exchange that offered a similar “ menu of options that I used to have as a member of Congress . ”
Obama said that by creating a big pool of potential customers , the exchange would allow the uninsured and even small businesses to shop around , easily compare various private health care plans and get a better deal than they could on their own .
Most of the health care reform bills circulating in Congress contain some form of this concept .
The exchange , in fact , is now the centerpiece of proposed plans drafted mainly by Democrats .
It ’s a curious development , because the concept was largely popularized by the Heritage Foundation , a right - wing think tank best known in recent years for advocating Social Security privatization during the Bush administration .
Its track record ought to make Americans more wary of Obama ’s proposals than any talk of “ socialized medicine . ”
Heritage is the source of a number of radical free - market and socially conservative policy plans that have occasionally worked their way into law , with questionable results .
Among the most prominent : welfare reform , which it advocated in the mid-1990s as a means of reducing out - of - wedlock births and restoring “ personal responsibility . ”
The idea — also embraced by a Democratic president — was considered a resounding success during the boom years of the late Clinton era when millions of poor single mothers went to work .
But now that the country has hit a major recession , it has become clear that welfare reform mostly succeeded in shredding the safety net for poor children .
( Incidentally , out - of - wedlock births have never been higher ) .
More recently , Heritage has promoted the idea that what poor women really need to get themselves out of poverty is a good man .
At its urging , the Bush administration gave more than $ 100 million in grants to “ marriage entrepreneurs ” charged with encouraging poor single mothers to get hitched rather than to get welfare .
Needless to say , the poverty rate is still on the rise .
Like many of the foundation ’s ideas , a health insurance exchange looks better on paper than in practice .
When Massachusetts launched its health reform experiment in 2006 , it relied heavily on Heritage ’s policy prescriptions .
Under then - Governor Mitt Romney , Massachusetts created a voluntary insurance exchange similar to the one Obama often promotes .
Massachusetts outlines some basic requirements for plans that participate but it does n’t set rates or reimbursement levels .
And far from revolutionizing health care , the exchange — known in Massachusetts as the Connector — is demonstrating the limitations of relying solely on the market to solve the nation ’s health care woes and rein in skyrocketing medical costs .
Trudy Lieberman , a contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review , has done a stellar job of reporting on the Massachusetts initiative .
She recently found that the Connector had all but failed to create more affordable insurance options for people in Massachusetts as promised .
Using a hypothetical family from Pittsfield in western Mass , Lieberman went shopping on the Connector website .
She found that coverage for a 44 - year - old couple with an income of $ 66,150 , slightly over the eligibility limit for a state insurance subsidy , “ All but three of the fourteen Connector policies cost at least $ 1,000 a month , or $ 12,000 a year — eighteen percent of their income . ”
The cheapest policy , at $ 820 a month , was no bargain .
Yet according to the state ’s own guidelines , a Pittsfield family with kids could only afford $ 364 in monthly premiums .
Those prices also vary by age .
Lieberman found that if she changed the age of her Pittsfield family to 54 , the premiums jumped significantly .
And Lieberman reports that it ’s not just consumers who are complaining .
Insurance companies have failed to garner the promised deluge of new customers , who ’ve been deterred by the high prices .
In the reform bills currently pending in Congress , Democrats have modified the Connector model by introducing a public plan that would compete in the exchange to help keep costs down .
But the public option seems increasingly doomed , in no small part to the Heritage Foundation itself , which is apparently horrified by Obama ’s embrace of its pet policy .
In July , Heritage released a report warning that a public option would cause millions of people to lose their private insurance and serve as a Trojan horse ushering in a single - payer system .
Heritage also has decried the way Obama and congressional Democrats have morphed its voluntary free - market concept into a vehicle for more federal regulation .
Several of the congressional proposals would use the structure of an exchange to impose new requirements on insurance companies .
Robert Moffit , director of the foundation ’s Center for Health Policy Studies , wrote in July , “ If the objective of the President and Congress is to expand the role of the federal government in providing health insurance and determining the kind of health insurance that Americans will get , the national health insurance exchange is a convenient tool for that federal expansion and control . ”
Obama , then , is running a big risk .
The Massachusetts model suggests that if he fails to win a public option for his federal exchange plan , he could leave Americans with a largely useless shopping program cooked up by the same people who brought us marriage counseling as a poverty cure .
It ’s hard to call that real reform .
The investigation into the RAAF 's program to replace fuel tank sealant on Australia 's ageing F - 111 strike aircraft has found an extra 2,000 defence personnel should be offered ex gratia payments .
A compensation scheme was established four years ago for personnel who worked on the jets ' fuel tanks , but the parliamentary committee inquiry found the scheme was too limited and that it excluded hundreds of personnel who had legitimate claims .
Committee chairman , Labor MP Arch Bevis , says the compensation scheme was " born of fuzzy logic , shrouded in misleading spin and then administered in confusion " .
The report made 18 recommendations which the Government is now considering .
Australia acquired its F - 111 strike fighter fleet in 1973 and almost instantly discovered a major problem with their fuel tanks ; specifically the sealant used disintegrated quickly .
Unlike other aircraft which had simple fuel tanks or bladders , the F - 111 stored fuel , as Liberal MP Stuart Robert explained , everywhere - in every nook and cranny .
And to fix the leaks defence sent personnel into those confined spaces without protection .
" RAAF men were sent inside the smallest nooks and crannies imaginable in F - 111 aircraft and in 1973 out on the tarmac there were no sheds , no covers , " Mr Robert said .
" In scorching heat in an Amberley summer these men would crawl in , many of them in shorts and T - shirts with no personal protective equipment , to carefully pick off the sealant and trace where the hole was and then to reseal it . "
The program became known as " de- seal / re-seal " .
The crews were dubbed " pick and patch " workers .
The scheme operated for nearly 20 years and hundreds of workers were exposed to the harsh chemicals .
Five years ago an ex gratia scheme was established , paying some personnel $ 10,000 or $ 40,000 based on their working conditions and not on the subsequent health problems they experienced .
Two - thousand people missed out .
Health impact
An earlier health study showed the de-seal / re-seal workers had a 44 per cent higher rate of cancer than the rest of the population .
A second parliamentary inquiry into the program was established last year .
Its findings were published today .
Committee chairman Arch Bevis says compensation should be offered to the 2,000 people who missed out .
" The exclusion from the scheme of about 2,000 personnel who undertook pick and patch work in the squadrons whilst providing benefits to those doing identical work in other units caused understandable anger , " he said .
" In addition the 2005 scheme provided payments to people who reported no ill health effects at all whilst denying the same benefits to workers whose health had suffered .
That simply aggravated the anger . "
The committee has made 18 recommendations , including that families and workers be offered group counselling and that Defence hire more occupational medicine specialists .
As Mr Bevis highlighted , a similar recommendation made eight years ago has been ignored .
" Today , amazingly Defence has only one person , one person engaged full - time on that vital task , " he said .
" How can that be when we hear so often that our men and women are our greatest asset ?
And indeed they are .
Yet eight years after the board of inquiry said Defence needed to improve the delivery of services in occupational health and safety and to have appropriately qualified medical officers , there is one full - time in the entire ADF . "
And he had damning words for the Department of Veterans ' Affairs ( DVA ) .
Mr Bevis said staff had a callous disregard for workers affected by the de-seal / re-seal program and he recounted one such case today .
" This particular gentleman had sought access to the ex gratia scheme .
He along with others had suffered both physical and mental health issues .
He was in hospital on suicide watch when the Department of Veterans '
Affairs thought it would be opportune and appropriate to advise him that his application had been rejected , " he said .
" Mr Deputy Speaker , it astonishes all of us that the considered view of DVA could be to provide that quite shatteringly bad advice to a former RAAF officer when he was on suicide watch in a hospital .
There is a need for the DVA to review its training procedures and the committee makes recommendations accordingly . "
Cautious welcome
The President of the F - 111 De-seal / Re-seal Support Group , Ian Fraser , says the report goes some way towards reducing a blight on Australia 's character caused by the ill - treatment of the affected workers .
He is pleased that more of the victims have been recognised , but he says their avenues for compensation remain inadequate .
" I applaud many of the recommendations from this report .
A great number of them are ones that we sought ; to be more inclusive , the other workers who performed pick and patch duties , the abolition of cut - off dates that prevented widows from receiving payments , " Mr Fraser said .
" One of the core disappointments though is ... not enough has been done around compensation issues .
" One of the things that we had hoped for would have been a recommendation for a mediation process so that each of us have a chance to present our cases to receive access to fair and equitable compensation .
" The only people that get any compensation out of those sort of processes are lawyers .
" This country was built on the good old Australian fair go and for us that just has n't happened . "
This past Tuesday during a show at Red Rocks , the band Coldplay gradually and eventually all fell asleep during one of their songs , which was about changing the world , making a better world , or a girl being their world .
Some members of the band rested their heads on their instruments , while others took the horse method and just fell asleep standing up .
The crowd began cheering to wake them up , but the band just slept right through it , staying stationary for the remainder of the concert .
After about ten minutes , many people started filing out and eventually the band woke up to an empty venue .

The fans were not as upset as one might think , though , despite the fact that their money was not returned to them .
" We were kind of relieved , because we all had to get up early the next morning for class , " say all the fans .
" Yeah , were all in high school .
All of us . "
The band opened with Yellow , which went off without a hitch .
" Yellow is my favorite song by us , " says lead singer Chris Martin , " Actually , I would say its the only song by us that I like .
Or , at least , it 's the only song by us that I know .
Once we got into the other songs , I think we all just sort of checked out .
In retrospect , we probably should have played Yellow last so we would have had something to look forward to . "
I was watching MSNBC the other day and I saw Chuck Todd looking a bit annoyed when he talked about this new poll that said Americans did n't believe the Beltway elite media after they repeatedly slammed the president for going on TV too much .
So I looked for the poll and here it is .
Sorry , I do n't have the video of Todd .
There 's a new NBC / WSJ poll out and it has some interesting information .
For weeks now the Beltway gasbags have been singing in concert that President Obama is doing way too much media : he 's overexposed , he 's on TV too damn much , blah blah blah .
Well , they are yet wrong again .
Here 's the question :
When it comes to doing his job as president , do you feel that you see and hear President Obama too much , about the right amount , or too little ?
Too much .......................................... 34 About the right amount ..................... 54 Too little ............................................9
Not sure ..........................................3
After all the hubbub made by the pundit class , Americans feel that the President is doing the right amount of media exposure .
What a shock .
I do enjoy watching the overwrought Peggy Noonan say that Obama was just sooo boorish , darling .
Noonan :
This is his way .
Because everybody will say yes .
I do n't think it 's about the media environment but I do think the media environment allows a modern leader to be something subtly damaging and that is boorish .
They get their face in your face every day all the time .
It 's boorish and it makes people not lean towards you , but lean away from you , no matter what the merits of the issue and the merits of this issue are not such great merits .
She 's proven wrong , like the huckster she is .
Why Noonan is taken seriously is beyond me anyway .
She was already caught off camera talking to Chuck Todd and Mike Murphy and just bashing Sarah Palin and the Republican Party , but she would never say that on TV , live that is .
She exposed herself as a hypocrite and a liar .
Why is she considered a trusted source of conservative opinion ?
Howard Kurtz wrote a pretty good article on this :
I raised the question a few months back whether Obama was diluting his impact by constantly popping up on the tube .
He 'd already done ESPN , Leno , the network anchors , " 60 Minutes " and a slew of other programs .
Then there was NBC 's day in the life , ABC 's town hall forum , the four prime - time news conferences , the comedy bits for Conan and Colbert , and on and on . --
" Is this a good idea ?
Should he just but a 24 - hour webcam in the White House and be done with it ?
" I kid , but I am on record as saying that those who knock the President for ' overexposure ' miss an important fact about the media today .
Overexposure is the point .
The audience is fragmented .
The way to get through is to reach this audience here and that one there , and that one there ... read on
Kurtz believes Obama should have gone on FOX too , but I do n't .
Obama was wise not to reward foul and destructive behavior by the anti-Obama network and grant an appearance to Chris Wallace on FOX so that he coould ask Obama about FOX ' phony breaking story about Death Panel books .
Anyway , every time you hear a pundit complain about Obama doing too much media , just tell them America is n't listening to them .

For download : An Excel file -- available here or here -- showing how each voter voted this week and in past weeks .
The file includes a " powerflaws " sheet pointing out potential flaws in voters ' thinking by showing how many higher - ranked opponents each team has defeated .
For example , the Steelers rank higher than the Bears even after losing to Chicago .
The Texans rank lower than the Titans after beating them .
The Bengals rank lower than the Packers despite beating them .
And so on .
A quick primer on the powerflaws sheet :
The Urbana - Champaign Senate voted in favor of resolution SC.10.01B Monday , which called for the removal of President B. Joseph White and Chancellor Richard Herman .
A vote on the resolution was postponed at the previous senate meeting Aug. 31 .
A draft constructed Sunday night did not mention President White or Chancellor Herman .
However , a more specific amendment calling for a combination of “ continuity and stability ” as well as “ the need for a timely transition in both positions ” was added during a closed Executive Session .
The senate voted 98 - 55 in favor of the resolution once the group reconvened .
“ There was clearly a lot of deliberation , and it certainly sends a strong statement , ” said Brad Tran , student body president and senate member .
“ I ’m glad we ’ve reached a consensus . ”
The meeting began with statements by Senate Executive Committee chair Joyce Tolliver .
“ We would n’t have asked for this ( meeting ) had we not considered it very important .
It goes without saying that we want what is best for the University , and we believe that passing this resolution is what is best for us right now , ” Tolliver said .
She said the board committed to further meetings with faculty and senate members on a regular basis in the future after a meeting with University Board of Trustees Chairman Chris Kennedy last week .
“ We hope that our recommendation will be taken into account , ” Tolliver said .
“ This is a fantastic opportunity that we ’ve been working towards for years . ”
The senate also heard comments from White and Herman .
“ I am an independent person and not in anyone ’s army , ” White said .
“ I would not support bad policy , and I protected the University ’s autonomy .
That was my job and I did it . ”
U - C Senate and faculty member Tom Overbye questioned the president ’s involvement in questionable admissions processes .
“ Admissions is not a science , and it ’s predictive exercise that has a lot of uncertainty about it , ” White said .
“ Admits are never a problem , but there ’s a third bucket into which many decisions fall . ”
With regards to his connection to the current state of the admissions issues ,
White said he takes some responsibility , but distanced himself from direct involvement .
“ Yes , I ’m president and I have overall responsibility for what happens in the University , ” he said .
“ But I made the distinction last time between overall responsibility and distinct responsibility . ”
Herman asked the senate to consider continuing his involvement as a University administrator .
“ I make a humble request : give me an opportunity to remain in our arena , ” Herman said .
“ Let me be given the opportunity to continue in our cause . ”
Faculty member Paul Diehl , professor of political science , spoke during public comment .
He said that although many faculty members sympathize with pressures administrators face , many are reluctantly supporting the resolution because of the long list of unethical actions .
“ Certain transgressions do n’t just tip the scale , they make it come crashing down , ” Diehl said .
The Board of Trustees will meet Nov. 12 in Springfield and will discuss the senate ’s resolution .
Subliminal messaging is most effective when the message being conveyed is negative , according to new research .
Subliminal images - in other words , images shown so briefly that the viewer does not consciously ' see ' them - have long been the subject of controversy , particularly in the area of advertising .
Previous studies have already hinted that people can unconsciously pick up on subliminal information intended to provoke an emotional response , but limitations in the design of the studies have meant that the conclusions were ambiguous .
Today , the journal Emotion publishes a study by a UCL team led by Professor Nilli Lavie , which provides evidence that people are able to process emotional information from subliminal images and demonstrates conclusively that even under such conditions , information of negative value is better detected than information of positive value .
In the study , Professor Lavie and colleagues showed fifty participants a series of words on a computer screen .
Each word appeared on - screen for only a fraction of second - at times only a fiftieth of a second , much too fast for the participants to consciously read the word .
The words were either positive ( e.g. cheerful , flower and peace ) , negative ( e.g. agony , despair and murder ) or neutral ( e.g. box , ear or kettle ) .
After each word , participants were asked to choose whether the word was neutral or ' emotional ' ( i.e. positive or negative ) , and how confident they were of their decision .
The researchers found that the participants answered most accurately when responding to negative words - even when they believed they were merely guessing the answer .
" There has been much speculation about whether people can process emotional information unconsciously , for example pictures , faces and words , " says Professor Lavie .
" We have shown that people can perceive the emotional value of subliminal messages and have demonstrated conclusively that people are much more attuned to negative words .
" Clearly , there are evolutionary advantages to responding rapidly to emotional information .
We can't wait for our consciousness to kick in if we see someone running towards us with a knife or if we drive under rainy or foggy weather conditions and see a sign warning ' danger ' . "
Professor Lavie believes the research may have implications for the use of subliminal marketing to convey messages , both for advertising and public service announcements such as safety campaigns .
" Negative words may have more of a rapid impact , " she explains .
" ' Kill your speed ' should be more noticeable than ' Slow down ' .
More controversially , highlighting a competitor 's negative qualities may work on a subliminal level much more effectively than shouting about your own selling points . "
Subliminal advertising is not permitted on TV in the UK , according the broadcasting regulator Ofcom .
However , there have been a number of cases where the rules been stretched .
In one particularly infamous case in 1997 , comedian Chris Morris used a half - frame caption at the end of the satirical show Brass Eye to criticise the chief executive of Channel 4 , Michael Grade , for heavily editing the controversial programme .
The description of his boss - " Grade is a ****" - would certainly have fallen into the category of negative words as described in Professor Lavie 's research .

Do you ever get sick of working with the same script that you are loathe to even look at it anymore ?
If so how do you get a tenth wind to reset your perspective ?
I ’ve gone through six drafts and am still incorporating changes from someone ’s notes .
This script was my world for nine months and I ’d like nothing better than to move on to my next project full - time , but I feel like Pacino in Godfather III .
Any suggestions ?

Here ’s the thing : writing sucks .
It ’s difficult on a good day , and intolerable on most others .
That ’s why I ’ll gladly answer your question rather than spend these 20 minutes of staring at the scene I ought to be writing .
First drafts are hard , but at least they ’re exciting and new .
Second drafts have the advantage of problem - solving , and feel like forward progress .
Every draft after that is a slog .
And I mean slog in the most onomatopoetic sense : boots sinking in mud to your ankles , a thick slurp with each exhausting footstep .
Sure , you want the draft to be good , but you mostly just want it to be done .
When you ’re getting paid for it , you can sometimes muscle through a rewrite by calculating how much you ’re getting paid per page .
Even imaginary income works for this .
While I ’m annoyed by the lottery mentality with which a lot of aspiring screenwriters approach the craft ( spec sale as sweepstakes ) , let ’s face it : your script is n’t worth anything until it ’s finished .
If you ’ve promised a new draft to someone whose opinion you value , picturing his or her face can be a motivation .
Better yet , promise exactly when you ’ll deliver it .
Deadlines help , as do consequences .
Consider rewards .
For every three pages you finish , you get to watch a Dollhouse on the DVR .
Beyond that , I can offer a few suggestions that are not of the carrot - or - stick variety :
Challenge yourself to remove one seemingly important scene .
Imagine what would happen if the actor you needed died during production , and that scene never got shot .
Could you work around it ?
Could you make the movie better for its absence ?
Push yourself to use better words .
Particularly in the back half of a script , there ’s a tendency to get a bit sloppy and repetitive .
Make that scene description on page 98 as sharp as it was on page 13 .
Here ’s a test :
Are you using “ there are ? ”
If so , you could do better .
Imagine a secondary plot that we ’re not seeing .
Like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , perhaps there ’s an offscreen adventure taking place that a reader will never see .
Only you as the writer will know it ’s there .
Dangerous ?
Sure .
But on your fifth draft , a little danger may be what you need .
Will you reach a point at which it ’s simply impossible ( or self - defeating ) to keep rewriting ?
Yes .
But do n’t confuse the standard difficulties of writing with true burnout .
Here ’s the difference :
When you ’re burned out , you simply do n’t care .
You ’ll make a scene worse just to get it done .
That ’s when you need to quit and write something else .
To celebrate my fiftieth birthday I undertook a journey to backpack 200 miles from Kings Canyon to Northern Yosemite .
Inspired by Steve Roper 's Sierra High Route , I created a route that took me along the crest of the Sierra Nevada range , mostly avoiding trails and sticking to timberline terrain as much as possible .
During summer of 2005 I hiked the entire distance in one long trip , about six weeks in duration .
The journey was broken into five stages and friends joined me for one or more stages .
The adventure was an amazing , fantastic experience .
It far exceeded my expectations .
I 've written up some of the highlights of the trip that you might enjoy reading .
The gallery has some selected photos , and you can consult the map section to see where I hiked .
I 've also included answers to some Frequently Asked Questions .

Parched fields and abandoned villages of Hasake province
By Natalia Antelava
BBC News , Beirut
For the past two years Iraq , Syria , Jordan and parts of Turkey and Lebanon , have suffered the devastating effects of the worst drought the Middle East has experienced in decades .
In addition to human suffering , the security implications of water scarcity are also becoming increasingly obvious .
Water wars is a term that was coined in the Middle East , but it is the existing conflicts that make the region 's water crisis so much more difficult to solve .
Almost four decades after Israel 's occupation of the Golan Heights , the city of Quinetra is still a ghost town .
For Syrians , its ruins serve as a reminder that the war will not be over until Israel gives back not only all of the land , but also all the water it has taken with it .
Irssan Irssan was a little boy when Israeli tanks rolled into his village .
Dams in Turkey have reduced flow of water downstream Today , he is in charge of water resources in the Syrian controlled part of the Golan .
He says there is a growing feeling of injustice among Arabs about the way water is distributed in the region .
" Every Israeli uses 10 times more water than every Palestinian or Syrian , " he says .
" Israelis are digging wells in the Golan Heights , and they are taking the resource that should be shared . "
The Israeli government says it has not recently dug any wells or built any dams in the Golan Heights , but that the region 's aquifers provide a crucial source of water for the country .
And disputes over access to water have hindered the peace process in the past .
It 's a vicious cycle - as water becomes more scarce and competition for it becomes more fierce , ending the conflict is also becoming much more difficult .
Tainted relationships
Water is also playing an increasing role in shaping relations between other states across the Middle East .
Construction of upstream dams , without the consent of downstream states , has long been a problem in the Middle East , but never before have the consequences of these dams been so evident .
In Hasake province , in Syria 's drought - stricken north - east , skeletal sheep and goats wander through parched fields and dozens of villages stand completely abandoned .
This is death level .
It 's a disaster
Samir Mora Prayers for rain in Syria dust bowl Jordan faces up to water crisis Egypt oasis risks becoming mirage Iraq 's drought : Eden drying out
River beds and canals are dry - not only because of the drought , officials say , but also because of dams that Turkey has built across the border .
" If only Turkey allowed water to flow the same way it used to flow before the dams were built , our situation would be much better , " said Motha Najeeb Salloum , governor of Hasake province .
Both Iraq and Syria hope that , following intense negotiations , Turkey will begin releasing more water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers .
While Turkey is also affected by the drought and needs the water for its farmers , in Syria there is no water left for irrigation .
And now they are running out of their last drinking supplies .
The region 's main source of drinking and irrigation water - the main reservoir - has shrunk to 4 % of its original size .
" This is death level , " says Samir Mora , the head of water resources of Hasake Province .
" It 's a disaster . "
Changing demographics
The whole of Syria is feeling the effect .
Roads around the capital Damascus are lined with makeshift camps .
An estimated 300,000 people have already fled the north - east and officials say every day brings more refugees .
With hundreds of thousands of people coming towards the cities , drought is changing the demographics of the Middle East .
It is spreading poverty and social discontent and putting an additional pressure on already vulnerable societies .
Water is a variable that could undermine any government .
If they do n't take water security much , much more seriously , they are walking into a black hole
Hussein Amery
Author on water issues " Water is definitely a security problem in the region , " says Samir Taqi , director of the Orient Centre for Strategic Studies , a Damascus - based think tank .
" It has always been this way in the region , but now what is making it of much greater amplitude is that from one side the drought is much heavier , and second , the region itself is much more vulnerable geo-politically speaking . "
Experts say a whole array of measures is urgently needed to ease the situation : from reforming the agricultural sector , which consumes most water across the Middle East , to introducing better water management and better water - sharing agreements .
' Running out of time ' " Water is a variable that could undermine any government , and the ' business as usual ' approach to water scarcity would result in significant security challenges to local governments , " says Hussein Amery , the author of Water in the Middle East : Geography of Peace .
" If they do n't take water security much , much more seriously , they are walking into a black hole . "
Few in the Middle East believe that water alone can ever become the cause of war , but its destabilising power is already apparent .
" I am afraid that the region is running out of time .
Crises are blowing up everywhere .
There are some failing states in the region , which also endangers the whole figure of water distribution , immigration , stability conflict , " says Samir Taqi .
" This is why I say the region is very vulnerable .
We have states that are collapsing , we have societies that are collapsing . "
Across the drought - stricken Middle East , tens of thousands of livelihoods have already collapsed .
And with the growing desert , the prospects of regional peace grow more distant too .

GRAND JUNCTION — Alex Lange is a chubby , dimpled , healthy and happy 4 - month - old .
But in the cold , calculating numbered charts of insurance companies , he is fat .
That ’s why he is being turned down for health insurance .
And that ’s why he is a weighty symbol of a problem in the health care reform debate .
Insurance companies can turn down people with pre-existing conditions who are n’t covered in a group health care plan .
Alex ’s pre-existing condition — “ obesity ” — makes him a financial risk .
Health insurance reform measures are trying to do away with such denials that come from a process called “ underwriting . ”
“ If health care reform occurs , underwriting will go away .
We do it because everybody else in the industry does it , ” said Dr. Doug Speedie , medical director at Rocky Mountain Health Plans , the company that turned down Alex .
By the numbers , Alex is in the 99th percentile for height and weight for babies his age .
Insurers do n’t take babies above the 95th percentile , no matter how healthy they are otherwise .
“ I could understand if we could control what he ’s eating .
But he ’s 4 months old .
He ’s breast - feeding .
We ca n’t put him on the Atkins diet or on a treadmill , ” joked his frustrated father , Bernie Lange , a part - time news anchor at KKCO - TV in Grand Junction .
“ There is just something absurd about denying an infant . ”
Bernie and Kelli Lange tried to get insurance for their growing family with Rocky Mountain Health Plans when their current insurer raised their rates 40 percent after Alex was born .
They filled out the paperwork and awaited approval , figuring their family is young and healthy .
But the broker who was helping them find new insurance called Thursday with news that shocked them .
” ‘ Your baby is too fat , ’ she told me , ” Bernie said .
Up until then , the Langes had been happy with Alex ’s healthy appetite and prodigious weight gain .
His pediatrician had never mentioned any weight concerns about the baby they call their “ happy little chunky monkey . ”
His 2 - year - old brother , Vincent , had been a colicky baby who had trouble putting on pounds .
At birth , Alex weighed a normal 8 1/4 pounds .
On a diet of strictly breast milk , his weight has more than doubled .
He weighs about 17 pounds and is about 25 inches long .
“ I ’m not going to withhold food to get him down below that number of 95 , ” Kelli Lange said .
“ I ’m not going to have him screaming because he ’s hungry . ”
Speedie said not many people seeking individual health insurance are turned down because of weight .
But it does happen .
Some babies less hefty than Alex have had to get health endorsements from their pediatricians .
Adults who have a body - mass index of 30 and above are turned down because they are considered obese .
The Langes , both slender , do n’t know where Alex ’s propensity for pounds came from .
Their other child is thin .
No one in their families has a weight problem .
The Langes are counting on the fact that Alex will start shedding pounds when he starts crawling .
He is already a kinetic bundle of arm - and leg - waving energy in a baby suit sized for a 9 - month - old .
They joked that when he is ready for solid food , they will start him on Slim - Fast .
Meanwhile , they made Alex ’s plight public on KKCO this week .
They plan to appeal Rocky Mountain ’s denial .
If that does n’t work , they plan to take their case to the Colorado Division of Insurance .
“ My gripe is not with Rocky Mountain , ” Bernie said .
“ It ’s with the general state of the health care system . ”

IRAQI TOLL IRAQI TOLL BAGHDAD ( AP )  Iraq 's government said more than 85,000 Iraqis were killed from 2004 to 2008 , officially answering one of the biggest questions of the conflict : how many perished in the sectarian violence that nearly led to a civil war .
What remains unanswered by the government is how many died in the U.S. invasion in 2003 and in the months of chaos that followed it .
A report by Iraq 's Human Rights Ministry said 85,694 people were killed from the beginning of 2004 to Oct. 31 , 2008 , and 147,195 were wounded .
The figures include Iraqi civilians , military and police but do not cover U.S. military deaths , insurgents or foreigners , including contractors .
The Associated Press reported similar figures in April based on government statistics obtained by the AP showing that the government had recorded 87,215 Iraqi deaths from 2005 to February 2009 .
The deaths represent about 0.3 % of Iraq 's population of about 29 million .
That would be akin to the USA losing about 900,000 people over a similar period .
Violence in Iraq has declined dramatically since the height of the fighting though insurgent attacks continue .
On Wednesday , three nearly simultaneous blasts struck the southern Shiite Muslim holy city of Karbala , killing at least six people .
According to the ministry 's report , the dead included 1,279 children and 2,334 women .
At least 263 university professors , 21 judges , 95 lawyers and 269 journalists were killed — professions that had been targeted .
According to the report , 2006 was the deadliest year , when 32,622 were killed or found dead .
The count includes 15,000 unidentified bodies that were buried after going unclaimed by families .
Ten thousand people were listed as missing , although Human Rights Ministry official Kamil Amin said it is not known whether there is overlap between the missing and unidentified counts .
The report does not contain figures from 2003 , a period during which there was no functioning Iraqi government .
" The situation was chaotic .
...
The whole country was in total anarchy , " Amin said .
Iraq Body Count — a private , London - based group that has tracked civilian deaths since the war began — puts the number of civilian fatalities as of Aug. 13 at 93,540 at least .
The toll released by Iraq was based on death certificates issued by the Health Ministry .
The tolls measure only violent deaths — people killed in attacks such as shootings , bombings , mortar attacks and beheadings .
Although the Pentagon maintains meticulous records of the number of U.S. servicemembers killed — 4,339 as of Wednesday — it does not publicly release comprehensive Iraqi casualty figures .

After chasing off cheap Chinese beer competitors a decade ago , Vietnam 's state - run brewers are gearing up to fight a new invasion from Western beer brands .
One of their secret weapons is a popular , unpasteurized brew called bia hoi that already enjoys a cult following in parts of the country .

Controversial government plans to allow Jobcentre staff to " order " benefit claimants to undergo tests for drug and alcohol dependency are in breach of European law and unlikely to work , according to leading addiction charities .
The proposals , outlined in the welfare reform bill , which is due before the House of Lords next month , are part of a major government drive to reform Britain 's benefits culture and save taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds a year .
The government points to research that suggests that some 100,000 problem drugs users – heroin and crack cocaine addicts – are claiming benefits but are not in treatment , suggesting that it is unlikely they will ever be able to escape their addiction .
But as the bill draws nearer to becoming law , there are growing concerns about the new powers it will devolve to Jobcentre staff .
The legislation would allow them to ask benefit claimants searching questions about their drug or alcohol use .
Those suspected of having a dependency or of misusing drugs will then be asked to undergo an assessment and , if they refuse , face having their benefits withdrawn for a maximum of 26 weeks .
The bill also gives Jobcentres the power to share and exchange information with the police and probation services .
" Staff will be given unprecedented new powers that are intrusive , coercive and will take the benefit system in worrying new directions , " said Martin Barnes , chief executive of the charity DrugScope .
If the Jobcentre determines that benefit claimants ' dependency is affecting their prospects of obtaining work , they can be required to undergo treatment as part of a " rehabilitation plan " .
The DWP has denied that this constitutes forcing someone to undergo a particular form of drug treatment .
But Barnes said the threat of withdrawing benefits could be interpreted as compelling someone to receive treatment .
" Potentially , anyone could be required to answer questions about their drug or alcohol use as the bill includes no test or threshold which staff must first satisfy , " he said .
" Do we really want to see Jobcentres given the power to drug test , share information about claimants with the police and , for the first time , require vulnerable people to undergo medical treatment by waving the stick of benefit sanctions ? "
Release , a drug addiction charity , said the proposals " fail to understand the nature of problematic drug use " and claimed that requiring benefit claimants to detail their drug use contravened Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights – the right to privacy .
While the government intends to pilot the scheme with heroin and crack cocaine users , the bill includes a power for its provisions to be expanded to all drugs , including alcohol .
A DWP spokesman said : " Drug and alcohol addiction destroys lives .
We want to make sure people get the help they need to overcome their addictions , so that they can find a job and get their lives back on track .
That is why we are proposing measures to tackle addiction as part of the welfare bill .
We will ensure that they do sit within the confines of human rights law " .

Jean
Todt will succeed Max Mosley as the new head of motorsport 's world governing body , the FIA , after winning the presidential election in Paris .
The former Ferrari team boss claimed 135 votes compared to 49 cast for his rival Ari Vatanen with 12 abstentions .
Todt , 63 , was the favourite to win the vote after being backed by Mosley , F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and seven - time world champion Michael Schumacher .
The vote brings an end to Mosley 's controversial 16 - year reign .
" Jean Todt has been elected president of the FIA for a four - year term by the FIA General Assembly at its annual meeting in Paris , " an FIA statement said .
Schumacher , who had accompanied Todt to the meeting , added : " It 's positive , very positive . "
With the election over everybody must share the same goals , including those who did not support me
Jean Todt Mosley had agreed he would not stand for a fifth term as president as part of a peace deal struck in July to end the threat of a breakaway championship by Formula 1 teams .
Following his decision , Mosley immediately endorsed Todt ahead of Vatanen , who had already put himself forward as a candidate .
Todt and Vatanen , who worked together on the Peugeot rally team in the 1980s , fought an increasingly bitter campaign to succeed Mosley .
Both presented themselves as the candidate for change and harmony but Vatanen questioned Todt 's ability to drive the FIA forward after losing the election .
" I really doubt he will be able to give a new start to the FIA , but let 's hope I 'm wrong , " Vatanen said .
" Jean Todt has a lot of qualities but , if he wants to leave his footprints on the FIA , he has got to renew it .
" And if he does n't get rid of the ancient guard and all the people who worked with Mosley , he wo n't succeed . "
Todt ( right ) and Vatanen each spoke at the election Among Todt 's proposals is the introduction of a new commissioner to oversee the running of F1 , as well as the other FIA championships .
The Frenchman also wants to examine improvements to the stewards ' decision - making process .
" I am relieved , because it was a very trying experience , " a victorious Todt said .
" I like to make things go forward and I am really happy to see so many countries chose me , but everything is yet to be done .
" With the election over everybody must share the same goals , including those who did not support me .
" We are facing a new crucial era for cars , the environment and global warming , which has strong implications for motor racing . "
Former world champion Damon
Hill says it is important that Todt distances himself from the previous regime of Mosley and look instead to the future .
" It would good for him to put the past administration behind him and to separate himself from that and do it the way he would like to do it , " Hill told BBC Sport .
" It would be good for him to make clear what the FIA stands for in terms of sport and also what his ambitions are .
" I know from his campaign he wants to separate the judging process from the FIA and also to have a separate body that runs F1 .
I think those are good things to start with . "
Mosley 's presidency has become identified with a period of political strife in F1 , with a series of damaging rows in recent years .
Ill - feeling and suspicion remain and the F1 teams are concerned that the election of Todt , who Mosley has publicly backed as his successor , would effectively be a continuation of the Mosley era .
ANDREW BENSON ON TODT
What kind of FIA president will Todt be ?
Will he act in a supportive and conciliatory manner - or will he act as he did to his rival team bosses and be antagonistic and disruptive
That belief is enhanced because Mosley , as an ex-president , will retain a seat on the FIA Senate , the powers of which Todt wants to extend .
As part of Todt 's team , Nick Craw , who is president of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States , becomes president of the FIA Senate .
Mosley 's public backing of Todt infuriated Vatanen and led him to instigate legal proceedings last week to ensure the transparency and fairness of the election .
The Finn withdrew that lawsuit after he , Todt and Mosley agreed a procedure for the election in Paris .
The secret ballot at Paris 's Intercontinental Hotel were supervised by an external Huissier de Justice , a French state - appointed public witness .
The votes were then counted in private by the FIA legal department , under the supervision of scrutineers proposed by the two presidential candidates and designated by the General Assembly .
The votes will be now be sequestered for 12 months .
Todt developed a reputation in F1 as a divisive figure during his 15 years as Ferrari team principal .
That image is at odds with the one painted by former Ferrari team members and drivers , who are largely effusive about his skills as a team - builder and manager .
Todt was at Schumacher 's side as he won five drivers ' titles with Ferrari Todt says he stands for " consensus not conflict " , and he points out that he has already met the F1 Teams ' Association , Fota , to discuss his plans .
Fota president Luca di Montezemolo , who is also president of Ferrari , welcomed Todt 's appointment .
" I have always appreciated his ability , dedication and commitment , " he said .
" I am sure that , under his guidance , the federation will be rejuvenated and will restore a climate open to dialogue and constructive collaboration with the teams and Fota , thus ensuring stability of the regulations and the whole environment . "
Todt began his career in motorsport as a co-driver in the world rally championship , winning the manufacturers ' title with Talbot Lotus before retiring in 1981 .
After a successful spell in charge of rally teams , he moved to Ferrari and in 1996 he persuaded Schumacher and technical director Ross Brawn to join him .
Ferrari went on to win 13 world titles , including six constructors ' championships in a row from 1999 to 2004 .
After seeing Stefano Domenicali installed as team boss in 2008 , Todt severed his ties with the Italian team in March this year .
The 63 - year - old now begins another new era as Mosley 's successor to the FIA presidency .
Mosley began his spell in charge in 1993 and successfully implemented improved head and neck protection for drivers as he spearheaded several safety campaigns .
He was also the force behind the Euro NCAP programme , a mandatory safety test for road cars .
However , the 69 - year - old 's reign became more controversial towards the end of his career as he tried to force through several rule changes .
The son of former Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley also hit the headlines last year because of his involvement with a sex scandal that almost ended his career .

MTV recently asked Megan Fox what her favorite comics and creators are , and here 's what she said :
" Michael Turner , clearly -- J. Scott Campbell .
Those are my favorite artists now and forever .
I grew up reading ' Gen 13 . '
There 's one called Coward .
That 's not the same kind of comic .
That 's really dark .
That 's more of like a ' Jonah Hex . '
' Midnight Nation ' is super interesting .
It 's like religious - based .
Not unlike Constantine , you could say . "
People seem pretty excited that a beautiful movie star is actually saying the names of comic book creators and thus creating the illusion that she 's a comic book fan , but after multiple Comic - Cons and years of working in comics - related movies , she 's basically able to name 1 ) The guy who drew the comic book her next movie is based on ( " Fathom " ) , 2 ) The comic book that launched the movie she just starred in ( " Jonah Hex " ) and 3 ) an obscure comic by the creator of " Babylon 5 " that he tried to make into a movie ( " Midnight Nation " ) .
And " Gen13 , " which she was apparently reading when she was 8 years old , despite the fact that it featured women whose clothes were constantly falling off :
Also :
Does anyone else think she 's angling for the role of Rainmaker , the lesbian no wait bisexual hottie of " Gen 13 " who liked to randomly get naked ?
I 'll give her consistency , at least -- they 're the same titles and creators she name - dropped at Comic - Con and the last time she was on Jimmy Kimmel , where she added " Witchblade , " another Turner book , to her list of " Gen 13 " and " Fathom . "
And really , let 's pause for a second to consider what it says about you if you 've dipped even a toe into the larger world of actual comics and those are your three favorite books OF ALL TIME .
She also says she loves " Coward , " and if she 's talking about the Ed Brubaker / Sean Phillips crime comic arc then that is actually a very good book -- except that it 's named " Criminal , " and is not very much like " Jonah Hex " at all except that neither one has superheroes in it .
And Constantine ?
Is not a comic .
It 's a character in a comic book called " Hellblazer . "
Time to up your game , Megan !
If you 're going to pretend to like comics , at least let someone give you a list of really good ones that do n't have movies you 're currently starring in so that we can pretend to believe you .

Auf Wikileaks findet sich ein bemerkenswertes Dokument über die „ Gewinnverbesserung durch Abmahnverfahren “ .
Es handelt sich um die Selbstdarstellung eines in der Branche bekannten Unternehmens , das mit der Präsentation bei der Film - und Musikindustrie sowie Verlagen nach Aufträgen zur Ermittlung von „ Raubkopierern “ wirbt .
Die Präsentation soll sich zunächst auf der Webseite des Unternehmens befunden haben .
Sie wurde aber entfernt , nachdem gulli.com als erster darüber berichtet hat .
Schlagkräftigstes Argument : Mit Massenabmahnungen von Filesharern lässt sich viel mehr Geld verdienen als mit legalen Downloads .
Die Beispielsrechnung :
Schadensersatz gemäß Unterlassungs - und Verpflichtungserklärung : € 450,00 Anteil Rechteinhaber 20 % pro erfasstem und abgemahntem Rechtsverletzer , der tatsächlich bezahlt : 90,00 ( Quote der Sofortzahler liegt zur Zeit bei ca. 25 % ) Technikkosten , Administrationskosten , sonstige infrastrukturelle Kosten ,
Anwaltshonorar für Gerichtsanträge , Abmahnschreiben , Massenkorrespondenz
mit Rechtsverletzern , Zahlungsklagen , EV - Anträge in begrenztem Umfang :
360,00
Das Gewinn “ versprechen “ :
Ca. € 0,60 ( netto ) pro legal verkauftem Download gegenüber
€ 90,00 pro erfassten illegalen Download bei Rechtsverletzern , die zahlen .
Der Ertrag bei erfassten und bezahlten illegalen Downloads ist das 150 fache !
Das bedeutet : Wenn 1.250 Rechtsverletzer erfasst werden , die zahlen , müssten zur Erwirtschaftung des entsprechenden Ertrages 150.000 Downloads legal verkauft werden .
Bei einer Zahlquote von 25 % müssten also pro Monat 5.000 illegale Downloads eines bestimmten Produktes erfasst werden .
Dies ist pro Woche eine Erfassungszahl von 1.000 , was bei gut laufenden Themen realistisch ist .
Die Zahlquote wird durch Vergleichsschlüsse und Ratenzahler regelmäßig bei einem durchschnittlichen Überwachungs - und Bearbeitungszeitraum von 6 Monaten gesteigert .
Ein sehr schöner Beleg dafür , wie die Branche mittlerweile tickt .
Überdies ein wunderbares Dokument , welches Gerichte sicher gerne lesen werden , wenn sie sich mit der Frage nach dem Rechtsmissbrauch durch Massenabmahnungen beschäftigen müssen .
Außerdem eine ziemliche Gefahr für die beteiligten Anwälte .
Die behaupten nämlich immer gern , sie würden ihren Mandanten die gesetzlichen Gebühren in Rechnung stellen , so dass diese von den Abgemahnten auch tatsächlich Gebühren in dieser Höhe erstattet verlangen können .
Das Dokument spricht eine andere Sprache : Filesharing - Überwachung als Rundum - Sorglos - Paket ohne jedes Kostenrisiko .
Zwar weiß jeder , dass es so ist .
Aber schwarz auf weiß bekommt man es doch eher selten .

The 63 - year - old Pink Floyd star will be made an honorary doctor of the arts at a special ceremony next month , the Cambridge News reports .
According to the university , the honour is being awarded in recognition of his " outstanding contribution to music as a writer , performer and innovator " .
Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in 1968 and appeared on seminal records such as Dark Side of the Moon , Wish You Were Here and The Wall .
This is the latest feather in the cap of the noted Fender guitar player , who already has a CBE and countless music accolades .
Although Gilmour now performs primarily as a solo artist , he took part in what was widely viewed as one of the most memorable moments of the Live 8 event in 2005 when he reunited with his former Pink Floyd colleagues .

The man was given advice about how to scare off the cows A man walking his dog has been forced into the River Thames in Oxfordshire for more than an hour to escape a herd of cows .
He was walking along the towpath near Radcot when the cows chased him .
The man , from London , called police at 1745 BST on Tuesday to ask for help .
At one point the police helicopter was on standby to help find him .
Thames Valley Police said a Pc with cow herding experience and advised the man about how to disperse the animals .

Pc Jude Miranda said : " We 'd been talking to the control room trying to get a better location for the man and the only thing that I could think of was my father in law some years ago .
" He worked on a farm , he said that you 've got to stand up to the cows , make yourself look big , and start waving your hands in the air , and not to cower away from it . "
The police control room passed on Pc Miranda 's advice to the man who was then able to get out of the river .
He then met police officers waiting for him at the Swan Hotel , Radcot , who checked he was all right and they left him at around 1845 BST .
He had been in the river for about 20 minutes before he called the police .
Pc Miranda said : " I 've never come across something quite as strange as this before , I 've never heard of cows chasing a man into a river . "

It is a year since Bank of America came to Merrill Lynch 's rescue
Five current and former directors of Bank of America have been subpoenaed by the office of New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , according to sources .
They are likely to be asked how much they knew of Merrill Lynch 's problems and bonuses when they agreed to buy it .
Bank of America saved Merrill Lynch from collapse a year ago .
Earlier this week , a US federal judge ruled the bank would have to go to trial to settle allegations it misled shareholders about bonus payments .
District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the $ 33 m ( £ 20 m ) settlement between Bank of America and its regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Bail - out funds
Merrill executives were paid $ 3.6 bn before the deal was closed , despite the bank 's $ 27.6 bn losses for 2008 .
Bank of America has neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
It was one of the biggest recipients of bail - out funds from the US taxpayer in 2008 , needing capital injections at the height of the financial crisis .
It has been reported that Mr Cuomo 's office is planning to file charges against executives at Bank of America for withholding information from shareholders .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Congress is considering proposals to greatly expand a soon - to - expire $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time homebuyers -- potentially applying it to all but the wealthiest homebuyers .
Supporters say doing so would further boost home sales , stabilize housing prices and generate jobs .
Opponents say extending and expanding the credit would be a waste of money and only temporarily stave off further price declines .
The credit now can be claimed by anyone buying a home who has not owned one for three years and who closes the deal by Nov. 30 .
Beyond extending that deadline , some lawmakers want to make the credit available to all homebuyers who meet income eligibility requirements .
And some want to increase the amount of the credit from $ 8,000 to $ 15,000 .
Currently the first - time home buyer credit is available in full to those buying their primary residence who make $ 75,000 or less ( $ 150,000 for joint filers ) .
A partial credit is available to those making between $ 75,000 and $ 95,000 ( $ 150,000 to $ 170,000 for joint filers ) .
The case for expanding the credit
Through mid-September , 1.4 million tax returns had qualified for the credit , according to the IRS .
Some portion of those returns , which the IRS could n't specify , represents buyers who took advantage of an earlier version of the tax credit , which was only worth $ 7,500 and has to be repaid over time .
By the end of November , the credit will have been used by 1.8 million homebuyers , at least 355,000 of whom would not have bought a house without the tax break , according to estimates by the National Association of Realtors .
Mark Zandi , chief economist of MoodysEconomy.com , favors extending the current credit until June 1 , 2010 , and making it available to all home buyers regardless of income or at least to everyone except those at the highest end of the income scale .
He estimates the cost of doing so would n't exceed $ 30 billion over 10 years .
Zandi's reasoning : Foreclosures are expected to rise next year because of rising unemployment , and that will drag home prices down further .
Extending and expanding the credit will help mute that decline .
And by June , there 's a chance the job market will have stabilized .
" The most fundamental argument for the credit is that nothing works in the economy if housing is falling -- it hurts household wealth and credit becomes tight , " Zandi said .
" [ The credit ] is a good insurance policy .
It 's vital to stem the housing price declines . "
To kick start economic activity , Zandi believes lawmakers should set aside an amount of money for an extended credit and tell potential home buyers " first come first served . "
The National Association of Home Builders would like the credit extended for all of 2010 .
" We estimate that this would increase home purchases by 383,000 in the next year and help mitigate the foreclosure crisis by whittling down inventory , " NAHB Chairman Joe Robson said in a statement .
" This stimulus alone would create nearly 350,000 jobs over the coming year , which is exactly what the economy needs right now . "
A study funded by the industry - supported Fix Housing First Coalition found that the current credit helped stimulate demand for homes at the lower end of the price spectrum .
" An expansion of the tax credit would spur an increase similar to what occurred in the lower end of the market , by motivating buyers in the ' trade - up market ' to purchase a higher priced primary home , " said Kenneth Rosen in testimony before Congress .
Rosen runs the consulting group that conducted the study and is chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California in Berkeley .
The case for letting the credit expire
Opponents of extending and expanding the credit worry that such moves offer poor bang for the buck and wo n't stem housing declines .
" Everything spent on this program will ultimately have to be paid for later through higher , economically harmful taxes , " Ted Gayer , co-director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution , wrote in a Brookings blog .
Assuming there are 5.5 million home sales in 2010 , Gayer said , expanding the credit to all homeowners " is poorly targeted because it would give a credit to 5.5 million homebuyers who would have bought a home anyway . "
The current credit was estimated to cost federal coffers $ 6.64 billion over 10 years .
But Gayer notes that the cost is likely to be much higher since more people than expected took advantage of it but only about 15 % of people would n't have bought a house otherwise .
It would cost an estimated $ 16.7 billion if the credit is extended until the end of June 2010 and made available to single filers making up to $ 150,000 and joint filers making up to $ 300,000 .
Those are the parameters that Sen. Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , and Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , are proposing in an amendment they introduced to a bill the Senate is expected to take up this week .
( Please see correction . )
Another argument against an extension :
It would only temporarily boost home prices and potentially set up those using it for a fall .
That 's because home prices are likely to decline once the credit expires and interest rates ultimately trek north , according to Dean Baker , codirector of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" Temporarily propping up house prices , so that a new set of homebuyers can incur losses , is a policy of questionable merit , " Baker said in a CEPR column .
The sooner the market adjusts the better , Baker said .
He did offer one caveat : " We may want to step in to prevent prices from overshooting on the downside in a select group of markets where this is a real possibility . "
Zandi said that 's already happened in a number of markets , and that an extended credit might help turn around the deflationary psychology in those markets where buyers are worried about catching a falling knife .

Looking back , this must have been the White House health - care strategy :
Health care as a subject is extraordinarily sticky , messy and confusing .
It 's inherently complicated , and it 's personal .
There are land mines all over the place .
Do n't make the mistake the Clintons made and create a plan that gets picked apart , shot down , and injures the standing of the president .
Instead , push it off on Congress .
Let them come up with a dozen plans .
It will keep them busy .
It will convince them yet again of their importance and autonomy ....
EDIT : I just noticed that my sig link , saying ' Original ' Keezer , might lead folks to believe that I think I came up with the whole idea of using a chest freezer for a keg dispenser !
I DON'T !!!!
I did , however , decided that ' kegerator ' was not an accurate name when using a freezer , so I named it ' Keezer . '
At the time , there were no references to the term anywhere on HBT , or google , for that matter .
So , I think I actually did come up with the name , but CERTAINLY not the idea !!
Ok , so I am finally getting started with the ' Keezer ' project !
Some time ago , I saw BrewPastors gorgeous chest freezer conversion posted .
Ever since , I have been thinking about how to go about doing my own .
What I finally came up with was something along the lines of this : Looks familiar , no ?
Well , Iyou I liked his This is not exactly what the finished product is going to look like - I went with a larger freezer than originally planned so that I could get the desired number of kegs in it .
The proportions are slightly different , but you get the idea !
The Keezer will be on casters to allow for some portability , although it will be heavy enough that it can't can't be considered ' mobile .
'
In the base , there will be a cooling fan that draws air down over the sides of the freezer to draw away heat generated by the compressor .
I was not aware when I first started looking into this that todays freezers use the exterior skin to shed heat , and that placing wood directly against it would seriously shorten the life - span of the compressor .
Luckily , some sage advice was given on HBT , and a cooling fan was designed in !
It will be wired in with the compressor to the Ranco , so whenever the compressor kicks in , so does the cooling fan .
I plan on posting periodic updates and photos as the project progresses .
The ALICE flight - vehicle accelerated to a speed of 205 mph and reached an altitude of nearly 1300 feet .
Credit : Dr. Steven F. Son , Purdue University
( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research , or AFOSR , have successfully launched a small rocket using an environmentally - friendly , safe propellant comprised of aluminum powder and water ice , called ALICE .
" This collaboration has been an opportunity for graduate students to work on an environmentally - friendly propellant that can be used for flight on Earth and used in long distance space missions , " said NASA Chief Engineer Mike Ryschkewitsch at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" These sorts of university - led experimental projects encourage a new generation of aerospace engineers to think outside of the box and look at new ways for NASA to meet our exploration goals . "
Using ALICE as fuel , a nine - foot rocket soared to a height of 1,300 feet over Purdue University 's Scholer farms in Indiana earlier this month .
ALICE is generating excitement among researchers because this energetic propellant has the potential to replace some liquid or solid propellants .
When it is optimized , it could have a higher performance than conventional propellants .
" By funding this collaborative research with NASA , Purdue University and the Pennsylvania State University , AFOSR continues to promote basic research breakthroughs for the future of the Air Force , " said Dr. Brendan Godfrey , director of AFOSR .
ALICE has the consistency of toothpaste when made .
It can be fit into molds and then cooled to - 30 C 24 hours before flight .
The propellant has a high burn rate and achieved a maximum thrust of 650 pounds during this test .
" A sustained collaborative research effort on the fundamentals of the combustion of nanoscale aluminum and water over the last few years led to the success of this flight , " said Dr. Steven F. Son , a research team member from Purdue .
" ALICE can be improved with the addition of oxidizers and become a potential solid rocket propellant on Earth .
Theoretically , ALICE can be manufactured in distant places like the moon or Mars , instead of being transported to distant locations at high cost . "

Recently there has been some discussion about TDD at the Object Mentor blog .
In one of my comments I brought forth the idea in this article 's title .
It was such a nice oxymoron that I decided to elaborate here that what I mean by saying that " TDD is not test - first " .
The TDD Process
Because Test - Driven Development has the word " test " in its name , and the people doing TDD speak about " writing tests " , there is much confusion about TDD , because frankly , the big benefits of TDD have very little to do with testing .
That 's what brought about Behaviour - Driven Development ( BDD ) which is the same as TDD done right , but without the word " test " .
Because BDD does not talk about testing , it helps many to focus on the things that TDD is really about .
Here is a diagram of how I have come to think about the TDD process :
When you look at that diagram , it probably seems quite similar to traditional software development methods , even quite waterfallish .
Let 's remind ourselves what a waterfall looks like :
The waterfall model is " Specify - Design - Implement - Verify - Maintenance " .
The TDD process is otherwise the same , except that it loops very quickly ( one cycle usually takes a couple of minutes ) , it has a new " Cleanup " step , all of it is considered " Design " , and all of it is also considered " Maintenance " .
Step 1 : Specify
The first step in TDD is to write a test a specification of the desired behaviour .
Here the developer thinks about what the system should do , before thinking about how it should be implemented .
The developer focuses on just one thing at a time - separate the what from the how .
When the developer has decided that " what is the next important behaviour that the system does not yet do " , then he will document the specification of that behaviour .
The specifications are documented in a very formal language ( i.e. a programming language ) , so formal that they can be executed and verified automatically ( not to be confused with formal verification ) .
Writing this executable specification will save lots of time , because the developer does not need to do the verification manually .
It will also communicate the original developer 's intent to other developers , because anybody can have a look at the specification and see what the original developer had in his mind when he wrote some code .
It will even help the original developer to remember , when he returns to code that he wrote a couple of weeks ago , that what he was thinking at the time of writing it .
And best of all , anybody can verify the specifications at any moment , so any change that breaks the system will be noticed early .
Step 2 : Implement
After the specification has been written , it 's time to think about how to implement it , and then just implement it .
The developer will focus on passing just one tiny specification at a time .
This is the most easy step in the whole TDD process .
If this step is n't easy , then the developer tried to make a too big step and specified too much new behaviour .
In that case he should go back and write a smaller specification .
With experience , the developer will learn that what kind of steps are not too big ( so that the step would be hard ) and not too small ( so that the progress would be slow ) .
If this step is n't easy , it could also be that the code that needs to be changed is not maintainable enough for this change .
In that case the developer should first clean up and reorganize the code , so that making the change will be easy .
If the code is already very clean , then only a little reorganizing is needed .
If the code is dirty , then it will take more time .
Little by little , as the code is being changed , the codebase will get cleaner and stay clean , because otherwise the TDD process will soon grind to a halt .
Step 3 : Verify
Now the developer has implemented a couple of lines of code , which he believes will match the specification .
Then he needs to verify that the code fulfills its specification .
Thanks to the executable specifications , he can just click a button and after a couple of seconds his IDE will report whether the specification has been met .
This step is so quick and easy , that it totally changes the way that code can be written .
It will make the developers fearless in making changes to code that they do not know , because they can trust that if they break something , they will find it out in a couple of seconds .
So whenever they see some bad code , they can right away clean it up , without fear of breaking something .
This difference is so overwhelming , that it even made Michael Feathers ( in his book " Working Effectively with Legacy Code " ) to define " legacy code " as code without such executable specifications .
Step 4 : Cleanup
When the code meets all its specifications , it 's time to clean up the code .
As Uncle Bob says , " the only way to go fast is to go well " .
We need to keep the code at top shape , so that making future changes will be easier .
We can do this by following the boy scout rule :
Always check - in code cleaner than when you checked it out .
So when the developer has written some code that works , he will spend a few seconds or minutes in removing duplicated code , choosing more descriptive names , dividing big methods into many smaller methods and so on .
Every now and then the developer will notice new structures emerging from the code , so he adjusts his original plans about the design and extracts a new class or reorganizes some existing classes .
Steps 1 - 4 : Design
The specification , implementation and cleanup steps all include designing the code , although in each step the focus in designing slightly different aspects of the code .
As Kent Beck says in his book " Extreme Programming Explained " ( 2nd Ed. page 105 ) , " far from design nothing , the XP strategy is design always . "
In the specification step , the developer is first designing the behaviour of the system , what the system should do .
When he is writing the specification , he is designing how the API of the code being implemented will be used .
In the implementation step , the developer is designing the structure of the code , how the code should be structured so that it will do what it should do .
In this step the amount of design is quite low , because the goal is to just make the simplest possible change that will achieve the desired behaviour .
It is acceptable to write dirty code just to meet the specification , because the code will be cleaned immediately after writing it .
In the cleanup step , the developer is designing that what is the right way to structure the code , how to make the code cleaner , more maintainable .
This is where the majority of the design takes place , which also makes the cleanup step the hardest step in the whole TDD process .
Thanks to the automatic verification of the specifications , it is possible to evolve the design and architecture of the system in small , safe steps .
When improving the design of the system , the system will be working at all times , so it is possible to do even big changes incrementally , without a grand redesign .
Steps 1 - 4 : Maintenance
When using TDD , we are at all times in maintenance mode , because we are all the time changing existing code .
Only the first cycle , the first couple of minutes , is purely greenfield code .
This continuous maintenance forces the system to be maintainable , because if it would not be maintainable , the TDD process would grind to a halt very soon .
On the other hand , waterfall does not force the system to be maintainable , because the maintenance mode comes only after everything else has been done , which means that with waterfall it 's possible to write unmaintainable code .
Maybe this is one of the reasons why TDD produces better code , more maintainable code .
If some piece of code is not maintainable , it will become apparent very quickly , even before that piece of code has been completed .
This early feedback in turn will drive the developer into changing the code to be more maintainable , because he can feel the pain of changing non-maintainable code .
Updated 2009 - 10 - 15 :
Somebody posted this at Reddit and in the comments the appears to be some confusion about the kinds of specs that I 'm referring to in this article and which are useful in TDD .
To find out in what style my specs are written , have a look at the TDD tutorial which I have created .
To see TDD in action in a non-trivial application , have a look at my current project .
And of course the executable specs are not the only kinds of specifications that a real - life project needs .
Just as I said above , they are " a specification of the desired behaviour " , not the only specification .
TDD specs are written at the level of individual components , which makes them useful for driving the design of the code in the components .
They are the lowest level specifications that a system has .
But before diving into the code , first the project should have high - level requirements and specifications describing from a user 's point of view that what the system should do .
A high - level architectural description is also useful .
I 'm also into user interface design , so whenever the system being built will be used by human users , the first thing I 'll do in such a project is to gather the goals and tasks of the users , based on which I will design a user interface specification in the form of a paper prototype , but that would be the topic for a whole another article ...

SPRINGFIELD , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - Michael Jordan , considered by many the greatest basketball player of all time , was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Jordan joined former San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson , ex - Utah Jazz guard John Stockton , long - time Jazz coach Jerry Sloan and Rutgers University women ’s coach C. Vivian Stringer in the new class .
Unsurprisingly , Jordan was the center of attention .
“ Contrary to what you guys believe , it ’s not just me going into the Hall of Fame , ” Jordan , who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and then finished his career with a two - year stay with the Washington Wizards after taking a stab at professional baseball , told a news conference .
“ It ’s a group of us and I ’m proud to be a part of them and , believe me , I ’m going to remember them as much as they remember me . ”
He enters the Hall of Fame alongside Stockton and Sloan , who , respectively , played for and coached the Jazz team Jordan ’s Bulls defeated in the 1997 and 1998 NBA finals .
GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Jordan ’s game - winning shot against Utah to win that last championship was a major highlight in a career filled with too many outstanding achievements to count .
Asked to talk about his most special basketball accomplishment , Jordan said : “ It ’s so hard .
It ’s like asking ‘ which one of your kids is your best kid ? ’
“ I ’ve had so many great accomplishments , so many spectacular plays , big plays , game - winning shots .
It ’s hard for me to pick out one . ”
Jordan , currently the managing member of basketball operations of the NBA ’s Charlotte Bobcats and a major global advertising force , said he would never say he was the greatest player of all time .
“ People say that I was the greatest who ever played the game , I cringe a little bit .
I never played against Jerry West , I never played against Elgin Baylor , I never played against Wilt Chamberlain , ” he said .
“ Yeah , I would have loved to but to say that I ’m better than those people is not for me to decide .
He said he saw “ some resemblance ” between himself and current NBA players LeBron James and Kobe Bryant but added : “ Do n’t be in a rush to try to find the next Michael Jordan -- there ’s not going to be another Michael Jordan . ”
After applause , he clarified , saying players from every era had their own special qualities .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court has granted a condemned Georgia inmate 's request that his execution be delayed as he attempts to prove his innocence .
Troy Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail .
The inmate , Troy Davis , has gained international support for his long - standing claim that he did not murder a Savannah police officer nearly two decades ago .
Justice John Paul Stevens on Monday ordered a federal judge to " receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner 's innocence . "
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer supported the decision .
Sonia Sotomayor , who was sworn in August 8 as the newest member of the high court , did not take part in the petition .
Davis ' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs in the past year .
He was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death last fall .
A month later , the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed , but a federal appeals court then issued another stay .
The high court 's latest ruling means Davis will continue to sit on death row .
Stevens said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death " provides adequate justification " for another evidentiary hearing .
His supporters in June delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County , Georgia , District Attorney Larry Chisolm , calling for a new trial .
Chisolm is the county 's first African - American district attorney .
Davis is also African - American .
Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail .
Witnesses said Davis , then 19 , and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off - duty officer arrived to help the man .
Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled .
But since his 1991 conviction , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony .
No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman .
The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board last year held closed - door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and Davis himself .
The panel decided against clemency .
MacPhail 's mother , Annaliese , told CNN at the time , " This is what we were hoping for , and I hope pretty soon that we will have some peace and start our life , especially my grandchildren -- my grandson and granddaughter .
It has overshadowed their lives . "
After the justices in October refused to grant a stay of execution , Davis ' sister , Martina Correia , told CNN she was " disgusted " by the decision .
" It does n't make any sense , " she said .
" We are praying for a miracle or some kind of intervention .
We will regroup and fight .
We will never stop fighting .
We just can't be discouraged .
The fight is not over till it 's over . "
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas objected to the court 's decision Monday , calling it a " fool 's errand . "
" Petitioner 's claim is a sure loser , " wrote Scalia .
" Transferring his petition to the [ federal ]
District Court is a confusing exercise that can serve no purpose except to delay the state 's execution of its lawful criminal judgment . "
Ten days after the high court refused last October to intervene , a federal appeals court in Georgia granted a temporary stay of execution .
Since then , further appeals by Davis ' legal team have dragged on for nearly a year .
Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial .
Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte ; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr , Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis .

Bill Clinton Says Right - Wing Conspiracy Now After President Obama
" It 's not as strong as it was because America has changed demographically . "
Sept. 27 , 2009  -- Former President Bill Clinton says the right - wing conspiracy that attacked him during his presidency now is after President Obama .
When asked whether the " vast right - wing conspiracy " is still present today , the former president answered without hesitation , " Oh you bet . "
" It 's not as strong as it was because America has changed demographically , but it's as virulent as it was , " Clinton said today on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
" Right - wing conspiracy " was the term used by former first lady Hillary Clinton to describe the tactics her husband 's political enemies used to attack his presidency after revelations of his affair with Monica Lewinski .
" I mean they may be hurting President Obama , " Bill Clinton said of the current attacks .
" They can take his numbers down , they can run his opposition up , but fundamentally he and his team have a positive agenda for America .
Their agenda seems to be wanting him to fail , and that 's not a good prescription for a good America .
" I mean , they 're saying things about him just like when they accused me of murder and all this stuff they did , but it 's not really good for the Republicans or the country , what 's going on now , " Clinton said .
Repeat of 1994 ?
When asked to compare his administration 's unsuccessful attempt at health care reform to President Obama 's current push , Clinton said the president has been at a " terrible disadvantage in the law - making phase . "
" He has a better Congress than I did .
And he does n't have a committee chairman that I had demanding that he present a bill , " Clinton said .
" So [ Obama ] said , ' OK , I 'll let you develop the bill . '
Well , while they 're developing the bill , he 's set out certain principles and he is vulnerable to whatever anybody wants to say about any of the bills moving through Congress -- whether that 's his position or not . "
But , Clinton said , the current situation will not lead to a " repeat of 1994 " , when Democrats lost 15 seats in the House for the first time in 40 years , crippling progress on his administration 's agenda .
" There 's no way they can make it that bad , for several reasons , " Clinton said .
For one , he said , " The country is more diverse and interested in positive action .
" Number two , " he added , " they 've seen this movie before , because they 've had eight years under President Bush , when the Republicans finally had the whole government , and they know the results were bad .
" Number three , the Democrats have n't taken on the gun lobby like I did and they took 15 of our members out ... so whatever happens , it will be manageable for the president , " Clinton said .
Hillary 2012 ?
Clinton said he was content with his current life in the private sector .
" I love what I do now , " he said .
" And while I can't touch as many lives and things as I did as president , the things I do focus on , we can have a huge impact on , " he said .
Asked whether his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , would run for president again , he chuckled .
" That 's up to her , " he said .
" We 're not getting any younger .
But I 'm proud of what she 's doing now .
I think she 's doing a great job .
" I think it 's pretty thrilling that she and the president just have established the relationship they have , and I think it 's a good argument for reconciliation and remembering the good things for all the rest of us . "

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , California have confirmed the existence of the superheavy element 114 — otherwise known as ununquadium — ten years after its first observation by Russian scientists .
Containing 114 protons , this is the heaviest element detected in multiple laboratories and another step towards the theorised island of stability , the " holy grail " of such research .
The elusive element was first detected in 1998 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research , Dubna , Russia , when a plutonium target was bombarded with calcium ions accelerated in a cyclotron .
Until now no other groups had been able to confirm the Russian team 's results .
" It ’s unusual for important results like the Dubna group ’s claim to have produced 114 to go unconfirmed for so long , " said Ken Gregorich , part of the Berkeley team .
Nuclear reactions producing the element occur only rarely , and once produced it decays quickly .
The Berkeley experiment was run for eight days almost continuously and only two nuclei of element 114 were detected during this time .
Each was a different isotope , both with 114 protons but one with 172 neutrons and one with 173 .
The team had to use sophisticated gas - filled separators to find these among the many other products of the collisions .
To make sure their analysis of the data was correct , it was run through two independent computer programs written by different members of the team .
Both isotopes of 114 observed decayed to element 112 in less than a second .
The superheavy elements are typically short - lived , but theorists predict a so - called " island of stability " , a group of elements that are much more stable because they contain " magic numbers " of protons and neutrons .
According to Gregorich : " Based on the ideas of the 1960s , we thought when we got to element 114 we would have reached the Island of Stability " .
But more recent theories suggest that heavier elements may be needed .
" The work we 're doing now will help us decide which theories are correct and how we should modify our models , " Gregorich continued .
The Berkeley group 's results have been reported in the journal Physical Review Letters .

Axis of Logic Axis of Logic
Introduction
The electoral victory of center left regimes in at least three Latin American countries , and the search for a new ideological identity to justify their rule , led ideologues and the incumbent presidents to embrace the notion that they represent a new 21st century version of socialism ( 21cs ) .
Prominent writers , academics and regime spokespeople celebrated a totally new variant of socialism , as completely at odds with what they dubbed as the failed 20th century , Soviet - style socialism .
The advocates and publicists of 21cs claims of a novel political - economic model rested on what they ascribed as a radical break with both the free market neo-liberal regimes which preceded , and the past “ statist ” version of socialism embodied by the former Soviet Union as well as China and Cuba .
In this paper we will proceed by examining the variety of critiques put forth by 21cs of both neo-liberalism and 20 century socialism ( 20 cs ) , the authenticity of their claims of a novelty and originality , and a critical analysis of their actual performance .
The 21cs Critique of Neo-Liberalism
The rise of 21cs regimes grew out of the crises and demise of neo-liberal regimes which pervaded Latin America from the mid 1970 ’s to the end of the 1990’s .
Their demise was hastened by a string of popular uprisings which propelled the ascent of center - left regimes based on their rejection of neo-liberal socio-economic doctrines and promise of basic changes favoring the great majorities .
While there are important programmatic differences among the 21cs regimes , they all shared a common critique of six features of neo-liberal policies .
They rejected the idea that the market should have precedence and dominance over the state , by which they meant that the logic of capitalist class profit maximization should exclusively shape public policy .
The collapse of the market driven capitalism in the recession of 2000 - 2002 and mass impoverishment discredited the doctrine of “ rational markets ” as banks and business bankruptcies skyrocketed , the middle class lost their savings and the streets and plazas filled with unemployed workers and peasants .
The 21cs regimes condemned deregulation of the economy which led to the rise of speculators over an above productive capitalism .
Under the aegis of neo-liberal rulers regulatory legislation in place since the Great Depression was abrogated and in its place , the policies of capital controls , and financial oversight were suspended in favor of a “ self - regulated ” regime in which market players established their own rules , thus leading , according to their critics , to speculation , financial swindles and the pillage of public and private treasuries .
The predominance of finance over production was the centerpiece of the anti-capitalist discourse of the 21cs regimes .
Implicit was a differentiation between ‘ bad ’ capitalism which earned wealth without producing goods and services over ‘ good ’ capitalism , which presumably did produce value of social utility .
Related to its overall critique of neo-liberalism was a specific critique of the lowering of tariff barriers , the privatization of public enterprises at below their true market value , the denationalization of ownership of strategic resources and the massive growth of inequality .
The 21cs argued that neo-liberal regimes surrendered the economic levers of the economy to private and foreign bankers ( like the IMF ) who imposed deflationary measures instead of reflating the economy through infusions of stale spending .
The political leaders of the center - left used this critique of neo-liberalism and the implicit future promise to break decisively with neo-liberal capitalism , without committing themselves to a specific break with capitalism of another variety .
While the center - left critique of neo-liberal capitalism appealed to the popular classes , their rejection of 20cs , was directed at the middle class and to reassure the productive classes ( business class ) that they would not encroach on private ownership as a whole .
Critique of 20th Century Socialism
In a kind of political balancing act to their opposition to neo-liberalism , 21cs advocates have also put distance to what they dub “ twentieth century socialism ” .
Partly as a political tactic to disarm or neutralize the numerous and powerful critics of past socialist regimes and partly to further claims of a novel , up - to - date variant socialism in tune with the times , the 21cs make the following critique and highlight their differences with 20th century socialism .
Past socialism was dominated , by a heavy handed bureaucracy that misallocated resources and stifled innovation and personal choices .
The old socialism was profoundly undemocratic both in the way it ruled , the organization of elections and the one part state .
The repression of civil rights , and all market activity figures large in the 21cs narrative .
The 21cs conflate democracy as a system with the electoral road to power or regime change .
Changes of government resulting from armed struggle , especially guerilla movements are condemned , though all three 21cs governments came to power via elections which followed popular upheavals .
One of the key arguments put forth by 21cs regimes is that in the past socialists failed to take account of the specifications of each country .
Concretely they emphasize differences in racial , ethnic , geographic , cultural , historical traditions , political practices etc. which are now considered in defining 21st cs .
Related to the previous point 21cs emphasize the new global configuration of power in the 21st century which shapes the policies and potentialities of 21cs .
Among the new factors , they cite the disappearance of the former USSR and China ’s conversion to capitalism ; the rise and relative decline of a US centered global economy ; the rise of Asia , especially China ; the emergence of Venezuelan promoted regional initiatives ; the rise of ‘ center - left ’ regimes throughout Latin America ; and diversified markets , in Asia , within Latin America the Middle East and elsewhere .
The 21cs regimes claim that the “ new configuration of society and state ” is not a ‘ copy ’ of any other past or present socialist state .
It is almost as if every measure , policy , or institution is the design of the contemporary 21cs regime .
Originality or novelty is an argument to enhance the legitimacy of the regime before external and internal critics from the anti-communist Right and to dismiss substantive criticism from the Left .
The 21cs regimes make a point of emphasizing the fact that the leadership has no links past or present with Communism and in the case of Bolivia and Ecuador openly reject Marxism both as a tool of analysis or as a bases for policy prescription .
The exception is President Chavez whose ideology is a blend of Marxism and nationalism linked to the thought of Simon Bolivar .
Both Correa and Morales eschew class divisions , counterpoising a ‘ citizen ’s revolution ’ against a corrupt party oligarchy , in the case of the former , and a culturally oppressed Andean Indian communities against an “ European oligarchy ” .
Critique of 21st Century Socialist Regimes
While 21cs regimes have more or less clearly stated what they are not and what they reject in the past both on the Left and the Right , and have in general terms stated what they are , their practices , policies and institutional configurations have raised serious doubts about their revolutionary claims , their originality and their capacity to meet the expectations of their popular electorate .
While a number of ideologues , political leaders , and commentators refer to themselves as 21cs , there is a great variety of differences in theory and practice between them .
A critical examination of the country experiences will highlight both the differences between the regimes and the validity of their claims of originality .
Venezuela : The Birthplace of 21cs President Chavez was the first and foremost advocate and practioner of 21cs .
Though the following presidents and publicists in Latin America , North America and Europe have jumped on the bandwagon ; there is no uniform practice to match the public rhetoric .
In many ways President Chavez ’s discourse and the Venezuelan government ’s policies define the radical outer limits of 21cs both in terms of its foreign policy challenging Washington ’s war policies and in terms of domestic socio-economic reforms .
Nevertheless , while there are innovative and novel features to the Venezuelan model of 21cs , there are strong resemblances to previous radical populist – nationalist regimes in Latin America and European welfare state reforms .
The most striking novelty and original feature of Venezuelan versions of 21cs is the strong blend of “ historical ” Bolivarian nationalism , 20th century Marxism and Latin American populism .
President Chavez conception of 21cs is informed and legitimated by his close reading of the writings , speeches and actions of Simon Bolivar , the 19th century founding father of Venezuela independence .
Chavez ’s conception of a deep rupture with imperial powers , the reliance on mass support against untrustworthy domestic elites capable of selling out the country to defend their privileges is deeply embedded in his readings of the rise and fall of Simon Bolivar .
Though Chavez makes no pretext of identifying Bolivar with Marxism , he does make a strong case for the endogenous , national roots , of his ideology and practice .
While supporting the Cuban revolution and maintaining a close relation with Fidel Castro , he clearly makes no effort to assimilate or copy the Cuban model even as he adapts to Venezuelan realities certain features of mass organization .
Chavez economic practice includes extensive nationalization and expropriation ( with compensation ) of large sectors of the petrol industry , selective nationalization of key enterprises based on pragmatic political considerations including capital - labor conflict ( steel , cement , telecoms ) and in pursuit of greater food security ( land reform ) .
His political agenda includes the formation of a mass competitive socialist party within the framework of a multi-party system and the convoking of free and open referendums to secure constitutional reforms .
The novelty is found in his encouraging of local self government through the formation of non-sectarian communal councils based in the neighborhoods to bypass the dead hand of an inefficient , hostile and corrupt bureaucracy .
Chavez ’s goal appears , at times , to be the replacement of ‘ representative ’ electoral politics run by the professional political class by a system of direct democracy based on self - management , in factories and neighborhoods .
In terms of social policy Chavez has funded a plethora of programs designed to raise living standards of 60 % of the population that includes the working class , self - employed , poor , peasants and female heads of households .
These reforms include universal free medical care and education , up to and including university enrollment .
The contracting of over 20,000 Cuban doctors , dentists and technicians and a massive program encompassing the building of clinics , hospitals and mobile units criss - cross the entire countryside , with a priority to low income neighborhoods ignored by previous capitalist regimes and private medical staffers .
The Chavez regime has built and financed a large network of publicly run supermarkets that sell food and related household items at subsidized prices to low income families .
In foreign policy President Chavez has consistently opposed US wars in the Middle East and South Asia , and the entire rationale for imperial wars embedded in the “ War on Terror ” doctrine .
Critique : How Novel is Venezuela ’s 21cs ?
Several questions arise regarding the Venezuelan version of 21cs : Is it really “ socialist ” or better still does it represent a break with 20 century socialism in all of its variants ?
What is the ‘ balance ’ between past and existing capitalist features of the economy and the socialist reforms introduced during the Chavez decade ?
To what degree have the social changes reduced inequalities and provided greater security for the mass of the people in this transitional period .
Venezuela today is a mixed economy , with the private sector still predominant in the banking , agricultural , commercial , foreign trade sector .
Government ownership has grown and national social priorities have dictated the allocation of oil resources .
While the mixed economy of Venezuela resembles the early post World War II social democratic configurations in Europe , there is one key difference : the state owns the most lucrative export sector and the principal earner of foreign exchange .
While the government has vastly increased social expenditures comparable or exceeding spending in some of the earlier social democratic governments , it has not reduced the great concentrations of wealth and income of the upper classes , via steep progressive tax rates as in Scandinavia and elsewhere .
Inequalities are still far greater than existed under 20th century socialist societies and comparable to existing Latin American societies .
Moreover , the upper and upper middle levels of the state bureaucracy especially in the oil and related industries have levels of remuneration which are comparable to their capitalist counterparts , as was the case in nationalized industries in England and France .
Self - management of public enterprises , a relative new idea in Venezuela , has moved beyond the limits of German social democratic co-participation schemes but are confined to less than a half - dozen major enterprises – a far cry from the extensive , nationwide networks found in socialist Yugoslavia between the 1940 ’s – 1980’s .
The agrarian reform proposals of the Chavez regime though radical in intent and forcibly promoted by President Chavez has failed to change the relationship between farm workers , peasants and large landowners .
Where inroads have been made in land distribution , the government bureaucracy has failed to provide the extension services , financing , infrastructure , and security to land reform beneficiaries .
The National Guard has by commission or omission failed to end landlord assassinations of leaders and supporters of land reform by the hired guns of landlords .
Over 200 unsolved killing of peasants were on the books by the end of 2009 .
While publicists of 21cs have emphasized the government ’s nationalizations of oil enterprises from existing owners , they have failed to take account of the growing number of new joint ventures with multi-national corporations from China , Russia , Iran and the European Union .
In other words while the role of some US multi-nationals has declined , foreign capital investment in mineral and petrol fields has actually increased especially in the vast Orinoco tar fields .
While the shift of investment partners in oil reduces Venezuela ’s strategic vulnerability to US pressure , it does not enhance the socialist character of the economy .
Joint ventures do add weight to the argument that Venezuela ’s mixed public - private economy approximates the social democratic model of the mid 20th century .
The most questionable aspect of Venezuela ’s claim to socialism is its continued dependence on a single commodity ( oil ) for 70 % of its export earnings and its dependence on a single market , the United States , an openly hostile and destabilizing trading partner .
The Chavez regime 's efforts to diversify trading partners has taken on greater urgency with Obama ’s military pact with Columbian President Alviro Uribe , to occupy 7 bases .
Equally threatening to the mass base of the Chavez road to socialism is the skyrocketing crime rate based on the growth of a lumpen - proletariat and its links to Columbian drug traffickers and civilian and military officials .
In many popular barrios the lumpen compete with the leaders of the communal councils for hegemony , using unrest and violence to exercise dominance .
The ineffectiveness of the Ministry of Interior and the police and their lack of a close working relation with neighborhood organizations represent a serious weakness in mobilizing civil society and mark a limitation in the effectiveness of the communal council movement .
The remarkable reforms instituted by the Chavez government , and the original synthesis of Bolivarian empancipatory anti-colonialism , with Marxism and anti-imperialism mark a rupture with the predominant neo-liberal practice pervasive in Latin America over the previous quarter century and still operative under numerous contemporary regimes , who claim otherwise .
What is doubtful , however , is whether all the changes amount to a new version of socialism given the predominance of capitalist property relations in strategic sectors of the economy and the continuing class inequalities in both the private and public sector .
Yet one should keep in mind that socialism is not a static concept , but an ongoing process , and the bulk of recent measures are tending to extend popular power in factories and neighborhoods .
Ecuador
In Ecuador , President Correa has adopted the rhetoric of 21cs and it has gained credibility in association with several foreign policy initiatives .
These include the termination of US military base lease in Manta ; the questioning of parts of the foreign debt incurred by previous regimes ; the critique of Columbia ’s border incursions and military assault of a clandestine Columbian guerilla camp ; his criticism of US free trade policies and support of Venezuela ’s regional integration program ( ALBA ) .
President Correa has been identified as part of the ‘ new wave of leftist Presidents ’ by the mass media including the NY Times , The Financial Times and numerous leftist journalists , North and South .
In terms of domestic policy issues , President Correa ’s claim to be a founding member of 21cs rests on his critique of the traditional Rightist parties and the oligarchy .
In other words , his socialism is defined by what and who he opposes , rather than any social structural changes .
His main domestic achievements revolve around his denunciation of the major electoral parties ; his support for and leadership of a ‘ citizens movement ’ , and its success in overthrowing the rightist US backed authoritarian electoral regime of Lucio Gutierrez , the convoking of a constitutional assembly and the writing of a new constitution .
These legal and political transformations define the outer limits of Correa ’s radicalism and provide the substantive bases for his claim of being a 21cs .
While these foreign policy and domestic political changes , especially when taken in the context of increased social expenditures during his first three years of office , warrant his being included as a “ center - leftist ” they hardly suffice or add up to a socialist agenda especially if they are seen in the large socio-economic structural matrix .
Critique of the Ecuadorian Practice of 21cs
The most striking departure of any credible claim to socialism is the persistence and expansion of foreign private capitalist ownership of the strategic mining and energy resources : fifty - seven percent of petrol is produced by overseas petroleum multi-nationals .
Large scale , long term mining contracts have been signed and renewed giving foreign owned mineral companies ’ majority control over the principal foreign exchange and export earning sectors .
What is worse , Correa has violently repressed and rejected the long - standing claims of the Amazonian and Andean Indian communities living and working on the lands signed off to the mineral multi-nationals .
In rejecting negotiations , Correa has dismissed the 4 major Indian movements and their allies in the ecology movements as little more than a “ handful of backward elements ” or worse .
The contamination of waters , air and land leading to serious illnesses and deaths by the foreign oil companies has been demonstrated in US courts where Texaco faces a billion dollar law suit .
Despite adverse court rulings , Correa has vigorously pursued his push to make foreign led mineral exploitation the centerpiece of his “ development strategy ” .
While Correa has vigorously attacked the coastal financial agro-commercial capitalist class , centered in Guayaquil , he has vigorously supported and subsidized the Quito ( Andean based ) capitalist class .
His “ anti-oligarchy ” rhetoric is certainly not anti-capitalist – as his embrace of 21cs would imply .
President Correa ’s success in building a mass citizen electoral movement is measured by his impressive electoral victories , securing presidential majorities under multi-party competition , and over seventy percent in the constitutional elections .
Despite his popularity , Correa ’s popular backing is largely based on short term concessions , in the form of wage and salary increases and credit concessions to small business , measures which are not sustainable with the onset of the world recession .
His granting of telecommunication monopolies to private firms , his opposition to land reform , and the restrictions of trade union strikes , while not provoking systemic challenges have led to a increasing number of strikes and protests .
More important , the strengthening of capitalist , especially foreign ownership , control of strategic banking , commercial export and mineral sectors , reduces the claims of 21cs to a merely symbolic , rhetorical exercise .
What is apparent is that the basis for 21cs is rooted in foreign policy pronouncements ( which are subject to reversal ) rather than changes in class relations , property ownership and popular power .
“ 21cs socialism ” , in the case of Ecuador , appears as a convenient way of combining innovative foreign policy measures with neo-liberal ‘ modernization ’ development strategies .
Moreover , initial radical measures do not preclude subsequent conservative backsliding as is evidenced in the questioning of the foreign debt ( which caused premature leftist ejaculations of glee ) and subsequent return to full debt payments .
Bolivian Socialism White Capital , Indian Labor
The greatest contrast between 20th and 21st century “ : socialism ” is found between the current regime of Evo Morales ( 2005 - ) and the short lived Presidency of J. J. Torres ( 1970 - 1971 ) .
While the former has openly and publicly invited mineral and extractive multi-national companies from 5 continents to exploit gas , oil , copper , iron , lithium , zinc , tin , gold , silver and a long list of other minerals , under the 20th century Torres regime , foreign and local capitalist firms were nationalized , expropriated .
While billions of profits are currently repatriated both during and after the commodity boon ; under Torres , state control over capital flows and foreign trade limited the de-capitalization of the country .
While Evo Morales provides hundreds of millions in loans , export subsidies and tax incentives to the wealthiest agro exporters and expels landless Indian squatters from large estates , under President Torres land takeovers were encouraged as furthering the regimes agrarian reform policies .
There is an abundance of socio-economic data demonstrating that the socialist polices undertaken during President Torres term of office stand in polar opposition to the social liberal policies practiced by the Morales regime .
In the following sections we will outline the major social and liberal policies of the Morales regime in order to assess the true meaning of the self - declared 21cs politics in Bolivia .
The Social Changes Numerous social changes have been implemented by the Morales regime during its first 5 years in power ( 2005 – 2009 ) .
The question is whether these changes add up to any of the most generous definitions of socialism or even to transitional measures pointing to socialism in the near or even distant future , given the scope and depth of the liberal economic policies adopted .
Morales has implemented socio-political changes in nine policy areas .
The most significant domestic change is in the area political – cultural – legal rights of the indigenous people .
The regime has granted local governance rights for Indian municipalities , recognized and promoted by - lingualism for carrying out local affairs and education , given national importance to Indian religious and holiday celebrations and promoted prosecution of those who violate or persecute Indian civil rights .
Under Morales the state has slightly increased its share of revenues in its joint ventures with multi-national corporations , increased the price of gas sold to Brazil and Argentina , while increasing the share going to the national government over and against provincial governments .
Given the record prices received by Bolivia ’s agro-mineral exports between 2005 – 2008 , the local municipalities increased their revenue flow , though actually investments in productive and service sectors lagged because of bureaucratic bottlenecks .
Morales allowed for incremental increases in the minimum wage , salaries and wages , thus marginally improving living conditions .
The increases , however , were far below Morales electoral promise to double the minimum wage and certainly not comenserate with the large scale windfall profits resulting from the commodity boom .
Morales prosecution of local officials and the provincial governor of Pando province and rightist terrorists for the assault and murder of Indian activists put an end to impunity of white assaults on Indian citizens .
The regime ’s biggest boast was the accumulation of foreign reserves from $ 2 billion to $ 6 billion dollars , fiscal discipline and strict control over social spending and the favorable balance of payments .
In this regard Morales ’ practices were more in line with the IMF than anything remotely resembling the expansive economic practices of socialist and social democratic regimes .
Tripling reserves in the face of continued 60 % poverty levels for the mostly rural Indian population is a novel policy for any regime claiming socialist credentials .
Even contemporary capitalist , North American and EU regimes have not been as orthodox as the Morales ’ political cultural revolutionary regime .
Morales has promoted trade union organizations and mostly avoided repression of miners and peasant movements , but at the same time has co-opted their leaders , thus lessening the number of strikes and independent class action , despite the continued inequalities in the society .
De facto greater tolerance is matched by the increased ‘ corporatist ’ relation between regime and the popular sectors of civil society .
Morales economic strategy is based on a triple alliance between agro-mineral multi-nationals , small and medium size capitalists and the Indian and trade union movements .
Morales has poured millions in subsidies to so - called “ cooperatives ” which are in reality private small and medium size mine owners who exploit wage labor at or below standard wages of miners in larger operations .
The principle changes under the Morales regime are in its foreign policy and rhetoric .
Morales has aligned with Venezuela in supporting Cuba , joining ALBA , developing ties with Iran , and above all , opposing US policy in several important areas .
Bolivia opposes the US embargo against Cuba , the seven military bases in Columbia , the coup in Honduras and its lifting of tariff preferences .
Equally important Bolivia has terminated the presence of the US DEA and curtailed some of the activities of AID for subsidizing right wing socio-political organizations and destabilization activity .
Morales has spoken out forcefully against the US wars in Afghanistan , and Iraq , condemned Israel ’s assaults against the Palestinians and has been a consistent supporter of non-intervention , except in the case of Haiti , where Morales continues to dispatch troops .
Critique of Bolivia ’s Version of 21cs
The most striking aspect of Bolivia ’s economic policy is the increased size and scope of foreign owned multinational corporate ( MNC ) extractive capital investments .
Close to a hundred MNC are currently exploiting Bolivia ’s mineral and energy resources , under very lucrative conditions , including low wages , and weak environmental regulations .
Moreover , in a speech in Madrid ( September 2009 ) Morales told an audience of elite bankers and investors that they were welcome to invest as long as they did n’t intervene in politics and agreed to joint ownership .
Whatever the merits of Bolivia ’s foreign capital driven mineral export strategies , ( and the historical record is not encouraging ) , it puts a peculiar twist on “ 21cs ” : replacing proletarian and peasants with overseas CEO ’s and local technocrats : a novel way to practice “ socialism ” in any century but more fittingly associated with free market capitalism .
In line with Morales “ open door ” policy toward extractive capital , he has strengthened and provided generous subsidies and low interest loans to the agro - business sector , even in those provinces like the “ media luna ” where ‘ big agro ’ has backed extreme rightist politicians destabilizing his regime .
Morales willingness to overlook the political hostility of the agro- business elite and to finance their expansion is a clear indication of the high priority which he gives to orthodox capitalist growth over and above any concern with developing an alternative development pole built around peasants and landless rural workers .
On site visits to rural areas and urban slums , reinforce published reports about the unchanged nature of class inequalities .
The super rich 100 families of Santa Cruz continue to own over 80 % of the fertile lands and over 80 % of the peasants and rural Indians are below the poverty line .
Mine ownership , retail and wholesale trade , banking and credit continues concentrated in an oligarchy which has in recent years diversified its portfolio across economic sectors , creating a more integrated ruling class with greater links with global capitalist actors .
Morales has fulfilled his promise to protect and secure the traditional multi-sector economic elite , but he has also added and promoted new private and bureaucratic entrants , to the ruling class , mainly foreign CEO ’s and high paid functionaries directing public private partnership .
While most socialists ( of any century ) would agree that big landowners are hardly the building blocks to a socialist transition , Morales has in fact depended upon and promoted agro -export production over family farming for local food production .
Even worse the conditions of farm workers has barely improved ; in extreme cases several thousand Indians were still exploited via slave labor , into and beyond the third year of Morales administration .
The harsh exploitation of farm laborers is far lessar concern than the increase of productivity , exports , and state revenues to the regime .
While labor legislation facilitating labor activity has been approved , it has not been enforced in the countryside especially in the ‘ media luna ’ provinces , where labor inspectors avoid any confrontations with well entrenched landowner associations .
The few land occupations by the landless rural workers have been denounced by the government .
Any grass roots movements pressing for land reform in extensive under cultivated estates have been strongly opposed by the government , violating its own norms that only cultivated farms would not be expropriated .
Given the regimes emphasis on the “ cultural and political ” aspects of its version of 21cs it is not surprising that it has spent more time and funds celebrating Indian fiestas , song and dances , than it has in expropriating and distributing fertile lands to the malnourished mass of Indians .
The regime ’s effort to deflect attention from agrarian reform , by settling landless Indians on public lands in distant tropics was a disaster .
This “ colonization plan ” organized by the so - called agrarian reform institute , dumped highland Indians in disease ridden lands which were not cleared , without farm tools , seeds , fertilizers and even living quarters .
Needless to say in less than two weeks the Indians demanded bus transportation back to their impoverished villages , an improvement over these remote malaria ridden ill planned settlements .
To compensate for the lack of any comprehensive land redistribution program , Evo Morales occasionally organizes , with pomp , ceremony and much publicity , “ gifts ” of tractors to middle and small scale farmers , more a political patronage opportunity rather than an integral part of a social transformation .
The two most striking aspects of Morales economic and political strategies is the emphasis on the traditional extractive mineral exports and the construction of a typical corporatist - patronage based electoral machine .
Into the fifth year of his regime the joint ventures signed with foreign MNC have extracted and exported raw materials with a little of value added .
To an astonishing degree there has been a minimal degree of industrialization and final product manufacture which would generate greater industrial employment .
The same story is true of agricultural exports – most grains and other agricultural products are not processed in Bolivia , which would provide thousands of jobs for the poverty stricken mass of landless Indians .
The regime has accumulated huge reserves , but has failed to finance or foment local industry to substitute for imports of capital , intermediate and durable consumer imports .
Morales political strategy closely resembles that adopted by the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement ( MNR ) a half century ago , in which trade unions and especially peasant movements were incorporated to the dominant party – state .
In the absence of significant socio- economic changes , the government has relied on public patronage , channeled through trade union and peasant and Indian leaders , which trickles down in the form of local favors for party loyalists .
Morales style clientelism is constantly reinforced by the symbolic gestures re-affirming the “ Indian ” ethnic identity and “ solidarity ” between the giver and recipient of political patronage .
The 21cs of Morales ’ political practice is far less innovative and ’ socialist ’ and far closer in political style to 20th century corporatist predecessors .
Observers with little knowledge of Bolivia ’s past , impressionistic journalists enamored with symbolic politics and financial writers who pin the “ socialist label ” indiscriminately on politicians who even rhetorically question the free market doctrine , have reinforced the ‘ radical ’ or 21cs image of the Morales regime .
Given what we have described about the real practices of the 21cs regimes it is useful to place them in a broader historical - comparative framework to make some sense of their possible impact on Latin American society .
Comparative - Historical Analyses of 3 Cases of 21 Century Socialism Despite claims by regime publicists , the most striking aspect of 21cs regimes is what is not novel or special about their policies .
Their adoption of a mixed economy and playing politics according to the institutional rules of a liberal capitalist state , differs little from the practices of European Social Democratic parties of the late 1940 ’s to the mid 1970’s .
To the degree that the 21cs pursue nationalist politics ( and we should note that nationalization means expropriatism and public ownership ) they are a pale reflection of the measures taken between the 1930 ’s – mid 1970 ’s .
With the exception of the Chavez regime , the rest of what passes as 21cs has at best nationalized bankrupt private firms , increased shares in joint ventures and raised taxes on agro-mineral exporters .
The ‘ indigenismo ’ most forcefully expressed by two Andean regimes , Bolivia and Ecuador , resonated with the rhetoric of the ‘ indo - americanismo ’ of the 1930’s .
This was forcefully pronounced by Peruvian Marxist writer Mariatagui and APRA political leader Haya de la Torre , as well as the Chilean Socialist Party , a number of Bolivian and Mexican writers , Augusto Sandino the Nicaraguan guerilla leader , and the revolutionary El Salvadorean leader Farabundo Marti .
In striking contrast to the 21cs indigenistas , their predecessors in Central America , pursued profound agrarian reforms , including the restoration of millions of acres of confiscated fertile lands and a profound rejection of the agro- business export model .
The earlier version of indigenismo combined symbolic identification with deep substantive changes in contrast to the contemporary indigenistas who rely mostly on symbolic gestures and identity politics .
The current policies relying on joint ventures resonates with the reformist alternatives to the Cuban revolution , which found expression in JF Kennedy ’s Alliance for Progress , which was taken up by the Christian and Social Democratic counter - insurgency regimes of the 1960’s .
In opposition to the 20th century socialists and communists who favored the socialization of the economy , the Chilean Christian Democratic government ( 1964 -70 ) promoted an alternative “ Chileanization ” , which resembles Evo Morales and Correa ’s “ joint ventures ” .
In other words the economic model of 21cs is far closer to the anti-socialist US backed reformist model of the 1960 ’s than to any socialist variant of the past .
21cs and 20th Century Social Democracy
While the scope and depth of socio-economic changes pursued by 21cs does not approximate the structural changes of 20cs regime , how does it measure up to the reformist or social democratic variant ?
Three cases of social democratic regimes based on electoral politics come to mind : the Arbenz regime in Guatemala ( 1952 - 4 ) ; the Goulart regime in Brazil ( 1962 - 64 ) and the Allende regime in Chile ( 1970 - 73 ) .
All 3 past social democratic regimes pursued agrarcan reforms of greater impact , with thousands of peasant beneficiaries , than the contemporary 21cs .
More substantial real nationalizations of foreign firms took place than in two of the - three contemporary 21cs social democratic regimes ( Venezuela has expropriated a comparable number of firms ) .
In terms of foreign policy pronouncements and practices the anti-imperialist political rhetoric is similar , but the earlier social democrats were more likely to expropriate foreign capital .
For example Arbenz expropriated land from United Fruit , Goulart nationalised ITT and Allende expropriated Anaconda copper .
In contrast our 21cs have promoted and invited foreign agro-businesses and MNC mining corporations to exploit land and mineral resources .
The different foreign economic policies correspond to the different internal class composition and economic alignments between 20th and 21st century social democracy .
In contrast to conventional misconceptions , the 21cs have consummated pacts between regime technocrats , the multi-nationals , and domestic agro-mineral elites which weigh far heavier in decision making centers , than the mass electoral base of Indians and workers .
In contrast the peasant and worker movements had greater representation and independence of action within and without the 20th century social democratic regimes .
21cs Defining a New Historical Configuration or a Cyclical Political Process ?
An examination of Latin American ’s past 60 years of history reveals a consistent cyclical pattern of alternating left and right ‘ waves ’ of political regimes .
The underlying ‘ constant ’ has been the struggle between , on the one hand US imperialist projections of power either through direction intervention , military dictatorships and client civillians regimes and on the other hand , popular democratic and socialist movements and regimes .
The question of whether the latest wave of “ center - left ” regimes is simply the latest expression of this cyclical pattern or whether basic alterations in the underlying internal and external structural relations are operating to provide a more sustainable process ?
We will proceed to outline the past cyclical pattern of left / right politics in the past and follow with a discussion of some key contemporary global and regional changes which might lead to greater sustainability for left political hegemony .
Post WWII Latin American history has experienced roughly 5 cycles of left / right predominance .
The immediate period after WW II , following the defeat of fascism , witnessed the world wide advance of democracy , anti-colonialism and socialist revolutions .
Latin America was no exception .
Center - left social democratic , nationalist populist , popular front governments took power in Chile , Argentina , Venezuela , Costa Rica , Guatemala , Brazil and Bolivia between 1945 - 52 .
Juan and Eva Peron nationalized the railroads , legislated one of the most advanced welfare programs and elaborated a regional “ third way ” foreign policy , independent of the US .
A coalition of socialists , communists and radicals won the 1947 election in Chile on the promise of extensive labor and social reforms .
In Costa Rica a political upheaval dismantled the national army .
In Venezuela a social democratic party ( Accion Democratica ) promised to extend public control over petroleum resources and increase tax revenues .
In Guatemala , newly elected President Arbenz expropriated uncultivated fields of the United Fruit Company , implemented far reaching labor legislation promoting the growth of unionization and ended debt peonage of Indians .
In Bolivia a social revolution resulted in the nationalization of the tin mines , a profound agrarian reform , the destruction of the army and the formation of workers and peasant militia .
In Brazil Getulio Vargas promoted state ownership , a mixed economy and national industrialization .
The launching of the Truman doctrine in the late 1940 ’s , the US invasion of Korea ( 1950 ) , the aggressive pursuit of the Cold war entailed vigorous US intervention against democratic left of center and nationalist regimes in Latin America .
Given the green light in Washington , the Latin American oligarchies and US corporate interests backed a series of military coups and dictatorships throughout the 1950’s .
In Peru General Odria seized power ; Perez Jimenez seized power in Venezuela ; General Castillo Armas was put in power by the CIA in Guatemala ; elected President Peron was overthrown by the Argentine military in 1955 ; Brazilian President Vargas was driven to suicide .
The US succeeded in forcing the break - up of the popular front and the outlawing of the Communist Part in Chile .
The US backed Batista ’s coup in Cuba , the Duvaeier and Trujillo dictatorships in Haiti and the Dominican Republic .
The rise of the extreme right , the overthrow of center - left regimes and the bloody repression of trade unions and peasant movements , secured US hegemony , assured conformity with US Cold war policies and opened the door wide for a corporate economic invasion .
By the end of the 1950s the very extremities of US domination and exploitation , the brutal repression of all democratic social movements and left parties and the oligarchies pillage of the public treasury led to popular upheavals and the return of leftist hegemony .
Between 1959 through 1976 , leftist regimes ruled or challenged for power throughout the continent with varying degrees of success and duration .
The social revolution in Cuba in 1959 and a political revolution in Venezuela in 1958 , was followed by the election of nationalist populist regimes of Jango Goulart in Brazil ( 1962-64 ) , Juan Bosch , ( 1963 ) reinstated for a brief moment in ( 1965 ) , Salvador Allende in Chile ( 1970 - 73 ) , and Peron in Argentina ( 1973 -75 ) .
Progressive nationalist – populist military rulers took power in Peru ( Velasco ) , 1968 , Rodriquez in Ecuador ( 1970 ) , Ovando ( 1968 ) and J. J. Torrs ( 1970 ) in Bolivia , Torrijos in Panama .
All challenged US hegemony to one degree or another .
All were backed by mass popular movements , clamoring for radical socio-economic reforms .
Some regimes nationalized strategic economic sectors and implemented far - reaching anti-capitalist measures .
However , all but the Cuban revolution had a short life span .
Even in the midst of the 1960 ’s – 70 ’s left turn , the US and its military clients intervened vigorously to revert the prospect of progressive social changes .
Brazil ’s Goulart fell to a US backed military coup ( 1964 ) ; preceded by Juan Bosch ( 1963 ) and followed by the US military invasion against the restorationist revolution of 1965 / 66 ; a US backed military coup in Bolivia overthrew Torres in 1971 ; Chile ’s Allende was overthrown by a joint CIA – military coup in 1973 ; followed by Peru ’s Velasco ( 1974 ) and Argentina ’s Peron , 1976 .
The promising and deep going leftist wave was over for most of the duration of the 20th century .
Between 1976 – 2000 , with the notable exception of the victory of the Sandinista revolution in 1979 , the right was in ascendancy .
Its long rule secure through the worst continent wide repression in the history of Latin America .
The military regimes and the subsequent authoritarian neo-liberal civilian electoral regimes dismantled all tariffs and capital controls in a wild plunge into the most extreme and damaging free - market , imperial centered economic policies .
Between 1976 – 2000 over five thousand public firms were privatized and most were taken over by foreign multi-nationals ; over a trillion and a half dollars were transferred overseas via profits , royalties , interest payments , pillage of public treasuries , tax evasion and money laundering .
However , the ‘ golden era ’ for US capital during the 1990s was a period of economic stagnation , social polarization and growing vulnerability to crises .
The stage was set for the popular revolts of the early years of the new millennium and rise of the latest wave of center - left regimes in the region , which brings us back to the question of the sustainability of this new wave of leftist regimes .
Some World Historical Structural Changes
One of the key factors reversing past leftist waves in Latin America was the economic power and interventionary capacity of the US .
There is strong evidence that US power has suffered a relative decline on both counts .
The US is no longer a creditor country ; it is no longer the leading trading partner with Brazil , Chile , Peru and Argentina and is losing ground in the rest of Latin America , except for Mexico .
Washington has lost influence even in it “ patio ” , the Caribbean and Central America , where several countries have signed up for the Venezuelan subsidized petroleum agreement ( Petrocaribe ) .
Washington , as if to compensate for its lost of economic leverage , ( highlighted by the rejection of its proposed Latin American Free Trade Agreement ) has increased its military presence , by expanding 7 military bases in Columbia , backing a coup in Honduras against a social liberal president and increased the presence of the Fourth Fleet off Latin America ’s coast .
Despite the “ projection of military ” power , circumstances outside of Latin America have weakened US interventionary capacity , namely the prolonged costly unending wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and the military confrontation with Iran .
The already high levels of public exhaustion and opposition , makes it difficult for Washington to launch fourth war in Latin America .
Therefore , it relies on and finances local client military – civilian power configurations to destabilize and overthrow center - left adversaries .
The increase in global markets , especially in Asia , has allowed Latin regimes to diversify their markets and investment partners , which limits the role of US MNC and limits their possible political role as purveyors of State Department policies .
The financialization of the US economy , has eroded the US industrial base and limited its demand for agro-mineral export products from Latin America , shifting the latter ’s dependence on new emerging powers .
Moreover having suffered the consequence of financial crises , Latin regimes have imposed some regulations on capital movements , which limits the operation of US investment bank speculators , prime movers in the US economy .
While Washington talks “ free markets ” its application of protectionist measures ( on overseas leading ) and subsidies to agriculture ( sugar , ethanol ) have antagonized key Latin American countries like Brazil .
As the leading exponent of failed free market neo-liberal doctrine , the US has suffered a major loss of ideological influence in the region as a consequence of the global recession of 2007 – 2010 .
For these reasons , one of the major actors ( US imperialism ) which has been responsible for the cyclical rise and fall of leftist regimes , has been structurally weakened , improving the chances for longer duration .
Yet , the US is still a major factor acting with potent resources based on its close ties with major rightist military and economic forces in the region .
Secondly , by the very nature of the development strategies chosen by the ‘ center - left regimes ’ they are very vulnerable to crises – namely the agro-mineral export policies based on foreign and domestic economic elites and fluctuating world demand .
Thirdly , the center - left regimes have failed to resolve basic regional imbalances , to significantly lessen social inequalities and to recapture ownership and control of strategic economic sectors .
These considerations call into question the middle term durability of contemporary center – left regimes .
There are few internal changes in the nature of the state apparatus and class structure which could prevent a reversion back to neo-liberal policies .
The basic question of whether the current 21cs regimes are stepping stones toward further socialization or simply transitory regimes opening the way for a restoration of neo-liberal pro – US regions , is still open to dispute , even as evidence is accumulating that the latter outcome is more likely than the former .
Conclusion
The question of whether 21cs is better or worse than 20th cs depends on what versions of each we choose to compare and what political dimensions we select in our comparative evaluation .
First and foremost there is no single ’ model ’ of 20th century socialism , despite the facile equation of 20th century socialism with the Soviet variant .
There were essentially four radically different types of 20th century socialist regimes , which in turn were internally varied .
Revolutionary single party regimes , which includes Cuba , North Korea , China , Vietnam and the USSR .
The first four combined socialist and national liberation struggles and were consummated independently of the USSR and exhibited at different times greater and lesser degree of openness to debate and individual freedoms .
The ‘ four ’ all fought US invasions and were all subject to embargos and under intense destabilization campaigns requiring high level of security measures .
Electoral revolutionary socialist regimes include Chile ( 1970 – 73 ) , Grenada ( 1981 - 33 ) , Guyana ( 1950 ’s ) , Bolivia ( 1970 – 71 ) and Nicaragua ( 1979 – 89 ) .
Multi-party competition and the four freedoms were encouraged even at the expense of national security .
All were subject to successful US backed military intervention , military coups and economic embargoes .
Self - managed socialism was put in practice in Yugoslavia factories from the late 1940s to the mid 1980s and was briefly experimented in Algeria between 1963 - 64 .
US and European promoted separatist movements dissolved the Yugoslavia state and a military coup ended the Algerian experiment .
Social democracy based on large scale , long term social welfare program linked to state management of macro-economic policy was implemented in the Scandinavian countries , especially Sweden .
The stereotype of the Soviet model of externally imposed authoritarian socialism was applicable only to Eastern Europe ; even that was subject to changes and democratic moments such as 1968 in Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the 1980s .
Likewise there are significant variations among 21cs socialists Venezuela has nationalized major foreign and nationally owned enterprises ( oil , steel , cement , banking , telecoms ) expropriated large tracts of farmland and settled over 100,000 families , financed universal public health and educational programs and encouraged community councils and worker self - management in a few instances .
Bolivia has expropriated few if any major firms .
Instead Morales has promoted and signed public - private joint ventures , opened the door to dozens of foreign mining consortiums , supported political reform enhancing and extending civil rights to Indians and increased social expenditures for housing , infrastructure and poverty alleviation .
No agrarian reform has taken place and none is foreseen .
The third and most conservative variant of 21cs is found in Ecuador , where major concessions to mining and petroleum companies is accompanied by the privatization of telecom concessions and subsidies to regional business elites .
Rather than land reform , Correa has transferred Indian lands to mining companies for exploitation .
Major claims to socialism are found in increased levels of social expenditures , the revoking of US use of a military base in Manta and a general criticism of US military and free trade policies .
Correa retained the dollarized economy , limiting any expansionary fiscal policies .
By drawing on commonly agreed criteria for evaluating the socialist nature of both 20th and 21st century socialism we can form an informed judgment on their performance in achieving greater economic independence , social justice and political freedom .
Public Ownership
All variants of 20th century socialism – except the Scandinavian model – achieved greater public control over the commanding heights of the economy than their 21st century counterparts .
Venezuela is the closest approximation of the 20th century experience .
The comparative performance of the public , public - private and private models varies : in terms of growth and productivity , the public enterprises in the 20th century have a mixed record , of high growth tailing off to stagnation ; the mixed enterprises are subject to the vagaries of the market and world demand , alternating between high growth in times of boom and depressed output in times of low commodity prices .
In terms of social relations , the social benefits and work conditions in the public sector socialism are generally more generous than in mixed and privately owned industries , though wage remuneration may be higher in the latter .
Agrarian Reform
The 20cs were far more successful in redistributing land and breaking the power of the landlord class than any measures applied by the 21cs .
The redistributive reforms of the 20cs contrast with the agro -export strategies by most contemporary ‘ 21cs ’ who have actually promoted greater concentration of landownership and inequality between agro- business elites and peasants and rural landless workers .
The agrarian reforms , however , were poorly managed , especially in the case of Cuba and China and led to a second transformation , redistributing state farms to family farmers and cooperatives .
On the whole 20th century socialists were much more successful in reducing inequalities of income ( but not eliminating them ) than their contemporary counterparts .
Because 21st century capitalists , especially big mine owners , agro- business capitalists and bankers , still control the commanding heights of the economies , the historic inequalities between the top five percent and the bottom sixty percent remain unchanged .
In terms of social welfare , 21st century socialist have increased social spending , raised the minimum wage but with the notable exception of Venezuela , do not match the universal free public health and educational programs financed by the 20th century socialism .
While there were regional imbalances between the countryside and the city under 20th century socialism ; free medical care , social security and basic health care was available to the rural poor under 20cs and is still lacking in most 21cs regimes .
In terms of anti-imperialist struggles the record of 20th century is far superior to that of the 21cs .
For example , Cuba sent troops and military aid to Southern Africa ( especially Angola ) to repulse an invasion by the racist South African regime .
China sent troops in solidarity with Korea and secured the north half region from the US invading army .
The USSR provided essential arms and air defense missiles in support of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle and provided Cuba with almost a half decade of economic subsidies and military aid allowing it to survive the US embargo .
Today ’s 21cs with the partial exception of Venezuela have provided no material support for ongoing liberation struggles .
On the contrary , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile and Argentina continue to provide military forces in support of the US sponsored occupation of Haiti .
At best the 21cs condemn the US backed coup in Honduras ( 2009 ) , Venezuela ( 2002 ) and military bases in Ecuador and Columbia and reject a US centered free trade agreement .
The one area in which the 21cs have an apparent advantage is in the promotion of greater individual freedoms and electoral processes .
There is greater tolerance of public debate , competitive elections and political parties than was allowed in some variants of 21cs .
None the less economic democracy , or workers power was far more advanced in 20th century Chilean socialism and Yugoslavian self - management than is the case of 21cs parliamentary elections .
Moreover , in the past there was greater concern for workers ’ opinions in making policy even in the authoritarian systems than takes place in the current agro-mineral 21cs states .
The greater openness of 21cs is related to the fact that they face less high intensity military threats .
In part this is because they have not altered the basically capitalist nature of their economics .
In comparison with 20cs , the 21cs are generally more conservative , work closer with MNC are less consistently anti-imperialist and are based on multi-class coalitions that span the class hierarchy , linking the impoverished poor sectors of the middle class to the very powerful agro-mineral elites .
Though 21cs may occasionally make reference to class analysis , in times of crises their operative concepts obscure class divisions through the use vague non-specific ’ populist ’ categories .
Perhaps the radical image of the 21cs results from their contrast with the previous extremist rightwing regimes which ruled during the previous quarter century .
The socialist label pinned on contemporary regime by Washington and the western media represents a nostalgia for a past of unfettered political submission , unregulated economic pillage , and robust repression of popular movements rather than an empirical analysis of their socio-economic policies .
Even as the 21cs are less radical and perhaps distant from commonly accepted definitions of socialist politics , they still have drawn the line in opposition to US militarism and interventionism , have put a cap on control over natural resources and provide greater tolerance for the organization of social movements .

SYNOPSIS
These extraordinary times -- unprecedented in modern history -- are marked by a worldwide depression and regional wars involving all the major imperial powers .
This book exposes the roots of the crisis in the unsustainability of the United States ' military - driven empire building based on a volatile speculative economy , and influenced by Zionist policy makers committed to the colonialist state of Israel .
It offers a critical study of the collapse of the empire and a profound indictment of the
respectable and prestigious personalities either responsible for the debacle , or for its continuance .
Petras provides clear insight into how the ramifications of the world depression and regional wars that originated in Washington and on Wall Street are extending throughout the world , provoking popular challenges especially in Latin America , while reinforcing the belligerency and increasingly fascistic nature of the state of Israel .
He demonstrates how unending wars and a deepening capitalist depression have demolished the ideology of free market neo-liberalism and forced to the forefront the need for structural changes .
He points out how the collapse of the capitalist free market and the need for large - scale , long - term interventions by the state have once again raised the question of whose interests states are presently promoting , and whose interests in actuality they should serve .
Both in the United States and Latin America , center - left regimes are proposing economic reforms to try to save the capitalist system .
However the deepening crisis is raising the prospect of mass support for 21st Century socialism , which focuses on public investment , ownership and control .

VASSALBORO , Maine - Donna Goodrich drove up to the charred remains of the Grand View Coffee Shop and pressed a $ 10 bill into the palm of Amy Greenleaf , a University of Maine student who had worked as a topless waitress here before arson gutted the building behind her .
" I'm awfully sorry , " said Goodrich , 53 , a former waitress at a conventional eating establishment .
" This is just terrible what happened . "
Greenleaf , 20 , smiled as she accepted the money , which Goodrich said her husband would augment later with a $ 50 check for a rebuilding drive being conducted from a small tent in the coffee shop 's parking lot .
The coffee shop 's owner , Donald Crabtree , is pledging to rebuild , restock , and reenergize an enterprise that created a tornado of controversy in Vassalboro ; brought international attention to this small , sleepy town ; and prompted Town Meeting this week to overwhelmingly approve an ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses .
" We ain't going nowhere , " said Crabtree , who was asleep in the building and escaped with six others after the fire broke out .
" We 're going to put her back up , bigger and better .
It 's not the end of us yet . "
Just how that will happen is anybody 's guess .
Crabtree said he has $ 700 to his name , no credit cards , and no plans to own one or take out a loan .
Just clearing the site could cost as much as $ 30,000 , and Crabtree had no insurance .
For now , he is relying on the generosity of former customers and strangers who have been pulling off Route 3 just north of Augusta to stuff cash into a large collection bin next to boxes of chocolate powdered doughnuts , tall containers of coffee , and piles of Danish .
" I 've got to get the girls back to work , " said Crabtree , who spends hours inside the cab of his truck , facing a jumble of stacked , blackened debris .
Earlier this week , Crabtree began offering coffee and doughnuts from a slightly damaged room inside the building .
There , out of public view , the waitresses are topless .
Outside , other waitresses pass the time fully clothed , chatting with former customers , pouring coffee , and collecting donations from all over the Northeast and even parts of Canada .
" I love my job , " said Star Cunningham , 23 , a Grand View waitress and single mother who cares for a 3 - year - old boy and a disabled mother .
" The customers are awesome . "
The pay , nearly all through tips , has been outstanding for economically struggling mid-Maine , Cunningham said .
Each week , she recalled , the work yielded a minimum of $ 500 in cash .
Greenleaf said she had been saving money to spend her junior year of college in Britain .
If the Grand View can not be rebuilt , that plan will hit a roadblock .
NEW YORK (
The Street
) -- Bank boards did n't do their jobs , so the
Federal Reserve is preparing to do it for them
-- at least when it comes to compensation and bonuses .
Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke is not asking for permission , either .
He 's exercising the Fed 's existing powers to regulate banks and doing this in - house .
The new rules -- requiring pay plans to be approved by the Fed to make sure they do n't encourage excessive risk taking - could be completed in a few weeks and only need to be approved by the central bank 's board , according to the
Wall Street Journal
.
I feel a double dose of outrage as I ponder this unilateral move by the Fed .
First , shame on the banking boards for making this necessary by abdicating their responsibility to their companies , shareholders and taxpayers and letting things get so out of control that a government bailout became necessary and new rules became the order of the day .
Second , I 'm flabbergasted that it is apparently so easy for the central bank to do and yet the Fed never intervened before the entire system blew up .
Bernanke is clearly doing things differently than his predecessor Alan Greenspan .
There 's a new sheriff in town .
Clearly this move will rankle many Congressional leaders , who may think the Fed is overstepping its bounds .
But applaud Ben Bernanke and his team for taking action while lawmakers jawbone and pose for the cameras without getting anything done .
I 'm sure there will be a flurry of behind - the - scenes activity as the leaders of our major financial institutions try to stoke regulatory turf wars and political infighting in the hopes of creating a stalemate the preserves the status quo .

and the other big financials cling to their incentive - based pay structure .
The Fed must stand its ground on this one and President Obama should back up Bernanke .
Lawmaking wo n't get the job done because bankers are too smart to by stymied by legislation .
There 's always a loophole to be found .
If they can't incentivize their rainmakers one way , surely they 'll find another way .
It 's a different story if the scrutiny comes from the Fed , which has more flexibility in adapting its rules and is finally showing a willingness to do so .

It did n’t take long for Jerry Jones and his new Cowboys Stadium to create a buzz around the NFL .
However , it was n’t the kind of buzz that Jones could have wanted or anticipated for the $ 1.2 billion facility .
For the first half , everything went as scripted during the first game at the new stadium .
The national television audience was treated to tours of special areas while the Cowboys and Tennessee Titans played a typical NFL preseason game .
Then , in the third quarter , things suddenly got interesting when Titans ’ backup punter A.J. Trapasso bounced a punt off the giant video screen hanging above the field .
The screen , which is 60 - yards long and 25 - yards high , was only 90 feet above the playing field ( five feet higher than the league minimum ) and served as a pretty helpless target for punters .
Reportedly , several balls hit the screen during warm - ups , so it is not entirely surprising that the ball would reach the screen during the game .
The incident immediately brought back memories of Ray Guy and his booming kick that hit the video screen in the Louisiana Superdome during the 1976 Pro Bowl .
After Guy ’s kick , the screen was raised from 90 - feet to 200 - feet above the field .
Considering that early comments from Jones seemed to downplay the need to raise the screen at all , it is doubtful that he will agree to have the screen in his new stadium raised to anywhere near 200 - feet above the stadium .
However , when the games start being played for real you can bet that something will be done to ensure that video screen pinball does not become a regular part of the NFL action .
Jones has built an amazingly beautiful stadium and while he may initially be resistant , you can rest assured that he will eventually see the big picture and have the screen raised high enough that it will not be a regular factor in the game .
Intel 's upcoming Braidwood NAND flash memory module , which is aimed at giving users faster boot - ups and application launches , could undermine solid - state disk ( SSD ) demand , according to a recent report on the new technology .
The 50 - page report , " Intel 's Braidwood : Death to SSDs ? , " from research firm Objective Analysis in Los Gatos , Calif. , said that Braidwood 's flash memory is less expensive to install because it resides directly on the motherboard and will offer all the same benefits of an SSD at a lower cost .
Intel 's Braidwood technology , which is slated to launch in the first quarter of 2010 but may be delayed , is basically a NAND flash memory module that serves as cache for all reads and writes , speeding up the performance of a system .
Consumer - grade SSDs use relatively inexpensive multi-level cell ( MLC ) NAND flash memory , which is about one - eighth the price of DRAM memory typically used for cache in a computer .
Braidwood , which is expected to offer anywhere from 4GB to 16GB capacity , will only raise the cost of a PC by about $ 10 to $ 20 per system , according to Jim Handy , the Objective Analysis analyst who authored the report .
( Intel has said nothing formally about the cost ) .
According to Handy , the company plans to use higher - end , and more expensive , single - level cell ( SLC ) NAND flash memory as opposed to MLC flash .
SLC memory stores only one bit of data per cell and is natively faster and lasts longer than MLC memory .
Even so , it is one - quarter the cost of traditional DRAM cache .
" The move to NAND in PCs will boost the NAND market , soften the SSD and DRAM markets and pose problems for those NAND makers who are not poised to produce ONFi ( open NAND flash interface ) NAND flash , " Handy said .
Intel makes two of the more successful SSDs on the market today , the X25 - M and X25 - E drives , which are aimed at consumers and data centers , respectively .
An Intel spokesman disagreed with Objective Analysis ' premise that Braidwood could hurt SSD sales , saying " It 's not just the performance , but also the added reliability ... [ SSDs ] can help facilitate versus a hard drive .
We see a long life ahead for SSDs , and wo n't stop inventing a variety of other technologies that make computers faster and / or more energy efficient . "
Handy disagreed , saying that hard disk drives are very reliable and only have a reputation for hardware failures when , in fact , most crashes can be attributed to software issues .
" If you really get down to what makes consumers buy SSD , the reliability issue is not something they often cite as reason [ for ] spending extra money on an SSD , " Handy said .
The 50 - page report from Objective Analysis is an in - depth review of the market for NAND in the PC , exploring Braidwood technology , implementation costs , and expected benefits .
It also explains how those benefits compare to alternatives like SSDs , larger DRAMs , and standard PCs .
The impact of Intel 's technology will not only affect its own SSD products , but also those of NAND makers such as Toshiba , Samsung , Hynix , Micron and as well as DRAM suppliers .
" Intel has got a very good [ SSD ] product .
But , they view additional layers of NAND technology in PCs as inevitable .
They do n't think SSDs are likely to take over 100 % of the PC market , but they do think Braidwood could find itself in 100 % of PCs , " Handy said .
In HP Lovecraft 's novella " At the Mountains of Madness " an expedition from the fictional Miskatonic University uncovers the unspeakable horrors waiting in Antarctica .
One Lovecraft fan is crafting and assembling souvenirs from the ill - fated mission .
The blog Propnomicon is devoted to creating props based on Lovecraft 's mythos , and one of its ongoing projects is to assemble the specimens , tools , and field notes that might have come out of the Miskatonic Antarctic expedition .
This prop maker is hoping to be as true to the story and geological history as possible ( although in consulting experts , he finds the two sometimes conflict ) , and has included core samples and fossils in his prop set , as well as illustrations of the Elder Things , their city and , the Shoggoths , and paraphernalia from Miskatonic itself .

Oh , is there a new Dan Brown novel coming out next week ?
The frenzy may not have reached Harry Potter levels quite yet , but the marketing rollout of “ The Lost Symbol , ” Mr. Brown ’s follow - up to the international phenomenon “ The Da Vinci Code , ” is running full steam in advance of the publication date .
Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group , which is shipping five million copies of “ The Lost Symbol , ” hired Special Ops Media , a company that designs Web marketing campaigns , to start pumping out Twitter clues on June 23 .
Nobody at Special Ops has been allowed to read the book , though , so the clues are more related to Dan Brown trivia in general .
On Tuesday the “ Today ” program begins a weeklong countdown to publication , with the host Matt Lauer divulging clues to various locations featured in the book .
Mr. Lauer , one of only a handful of people who have been allowed to read “ The Lost Symbol ” in advance  and only after he signed an agreement not to reveal what ’s in it , the publisher said  will interview Mr. Brown in a segment to be broadcast next Tuesday .
Last week Amazon ’s chief executive , Jeffrey P. Bezos , posted a breathless memo to customers on the Amazon.com home page , informing them that the company was taking “ one of the most anticipated publishing events of all time ” very seriously .
“ We ’ve agreed to keep our stockpile under 24 - hour guard in its own chain - link enclosure , with two locks requiring two separate people for entry , ” Mr. Bezos wrote .
Booksellers are hoping for a much - needed surge of traffic in a week with the release of not only “ The Lost Symbol ” but also two other much anticipated titles .
Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’s memoir , “ True Compass , ” comes out on Monday ( first print run : 1.5 million copies ) , and Jon Krakauer ’s “ Where Men Win Glory , ” a biography of the former National Football League star Pat Tillman , who volunteered for combat and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan , is being published on Tuesday ( first print run : 500,000 copies ) .
Britain and US secure agreement that limits on incentives would be impossible to enforce
Britain and America won a battle to stop " unenforceable " new rules to cap bankers ' bonuses yesterday as G20 nations struggled to agree on how to keep the global economy on course for recovery .
While France and Germany had pushed strongly for a strict new system to limit payments , London and Washington argued that it would be impossible to police and disguised the greater need for banks to strengthen their finances by holding more capital .
Instead of the idea punted by Paris and Berlin , finance ministers agreed that ways would be sought to ensure bonuses were paid over longer periods – with no upfront cash payments – so they would reward long - term success rather than short - term risk - taking .
Opening the main session of the meeting in London , Gordon Brown , while determined to protect the City of London from unwanted regulation , was eager to show that he would do everything possible to end a culture of lavish and unjustified compensation packages that has angered the public .
" Pay and bonuses cannot reward failure or encourage unacceptable risk - taking , " he said .
" It is offensive to the general public , whose taxpayers ' money in different ways has helped many banks from collapsing and is now underpinning their recovery . "
The chancellor , Alistair Darling , insisted that the emphasis should be put on increasing requirements for banks to hold capital rather than imposing an international system of limits to bonuses .
If banks put aside more capital , it would place their finances on a more stable footing , encouraging them to retain profits instead of rewarding risk - taking .
Darling said the whole philosophy behind attitudes to paying staff had to change : " We are determined to take action to stop banks or other financial institutions getting themselves into a situation where their pay and reward practices actually encourage people to take risks which bring their institutions into a situation where they could be brought down with catastrophic results . "
Ministers agreed in principle that bankers ' bonuses should be paid over the long term and that there should be greater transparency about what staff actually received .
Final details of the plans will be thrashed out in the run up to a summit of G20 leaders in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , later this month .
In the meantime , the Financial Stability Board , the new global regulatory body set up by the G20 , will seek ways to improve the transparency of banks ' pay structures , and look at how bonuses can be paid over extended periods and how to claw money back from bankers whose bets backfire .
The FSB will also look at aligning bankers ' pay with the risks they take so that the sort of gambles that caused the credit crunch in 2007 cannot recur .
Brown , who believes that he can revive his domestic political fortunes if he can win credit for steering the global economy to recovery , warned that the tentative signs of upturn would be at risk if major economies repeated the mistakes of the 1930s and withdrew fiscal stimulus packages too soon .
Citing US and Japanese studies which warn that a premature move towards reducing deficits by cutting back on state spending would be " an error of historic proportions " , the prime minister said that countries must co-ordinate their " exit strategy " from recession , and put it into action only when recovery was firmly in place .
Recent indicators have suggested that countries such as Germany , France and Japan have already moved back into growth , producing domestic pressure on governments to scale back spending and concentrate on reducing burgeoning public debt .
But Brown stressed that the positive growth forecasts for 2010 now being issued by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are based on the assumption that the state support on offer in 2009 will continue to be available next year .
" The stakes are simply too high to get these judgments wrong , so to decide now that it is time to start withdrawing or reversing the exceptional measures we have taken would , in my judgment , be a serious mistake . "
In a joint communique , finance ministers heeded the warnings , agreeing that fiscal and monetary policy would remain " expansionary " until recovery was certain .

Go vote .
Gerry was right .
The Philadelphia Eagles lost sight of their moral compass enough to sign Michael Vick yesterday .
Even though the Eagles were one of the 26 teams who said they had no interest in Vick , they have clearly given up any pretension to being anything other than desperate .
The NFL Fanhouse site suggests that while this may not have been the worst choice the Eagles could make , Vick is still a very iffy proposition :
This is an experiment .
Philadelphia , which could use a third quarterback option after backup Kevin Kolb‘s MRI revealed a sprained MCL in his left knee , is kicking the tires on a used luxury car .
And the Eagles ’ mechanics better look over this carefully before they make a final decision .
It remains to be seen how the Eagles fans feel about this .
I would hope that not a single ticket sells for any Eagles game , home or away .
Professional football is a great game , but there are thugs a -plenty in the NFL already .
The last thing it needs is the poster child for such vile behavior .

Protest in iRhini against attacks on Kennedy Road shack dwellers .
By Nigel Gibson and Raj Patel
October 8 , 2009 -- Pambazuka News --
You do n’t need presidential palaces , or generals riding in tanks , or even the CIA to make a coup happen .
Democracy can be overthrown with far less pomp , fewer props and smaller bursts of state violence .
But these quieter coups are no less deadly for democracy .
At the end of September 2009 , just such a coup took place in South Africa .
It was n’t the kind involving parliament or the inept and corrupt head of the African National Congress ( ANC ) Jacob Zuma .
Quite the opposite .
It involved a genuinely democratic and respected social movement , the freely elected governing committee of the shack settlement at Kennedy Road in Durban .
And this peaceful democracy was overthrown by the South African government .
First , some background .
As South Africa prepares to host the 2010 soccer World Cup , the poorest South Africans are still waiting for the end of apartheid ’s predations .
The country is spending US $ 1.1 billion just to build new stadiums , while those who fought apartheid wait in shack settlements for running water and electricity .
Levels of human development are now lower than in 1994 , and South Africa has overtaken Brazil as the country with the widest gap between rich and poor .
But not everyone is waiting patiently , hands outstretched , for the government to drop something into their palms .
Some people , particularly those living in shack communities , have organised to bring the dividends of housing , water , education , healthcare , employment and food to their communities .
When some communities organised to protest against their government , using the freedoms enshrined in one of the most open and supportive constitutions to be found in any modern democracy , the government responded by initiating its bloody coup .
In the middle of the night on September 26 , men armed with guns , knives and even a sword , descended on Kennedy Road , a shack settlement housing about 7000 people .
These men chanted slogans of ethnic cleansing , pitting Zulu against Pondo .
With these words , they summoned an ethnic politics that was unthinkable even in apartheid ’s darkest days .
Even the 1980s battles between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC were political rather than ethnic clashes .
But under Jacob Zuma ’s South Africa , the Zulu nationalism that was once anathema to the ANC has now become its standard operating procedure .
Four people were killed .
The violence continued under the eyes of the police and local ANC officials .
Once it was over , the democratic leaders of the Kennedy Road Development Committee were arrested ( even though many were n’t in the settlement at the time of the attacks ) .
Thousands of shack dwellers have now fled the settlement and many shacks have been destroyed .
It has now become clear that the thugs were backed by the local branch of the ANC and its leaders .
Jackson Gumede , the chairperson of the branch executive committee of the ANC in the electoral ward containing Kennedy Road , has now taken over the settlement where those remaining live in a state of fear .
The ANC KwaZulu - Natal provincial government has also become a willing partner .
It has also become clear that the target of the attacks is the autonomous and grassroots democratic shackdweller organisation – Abahlali baseMjondolo – which has grown over the past four years into the largest poor people ’s movement in South Africa .
Abahlali has become a significant thorn in the side of the ANC provincial government in KwaZulu - Natal .
What particularly irks the ANC is Abahlali ’s refusal to let the shack dwellers continue to be a vote bank for the ANC at election time .
Rather than supporting any political party , Abahlali has promoted a ``No house , no land , no vote ' ' policy .
As well as rejecting the legitimacy of the local ANC councillor , Yacoob Baig , Abahlali has taken the provincial government to court over the constitutionality of the government ’s Elimination of Slums Act and spoken out against the forced relocation of shack dwellers to transit or temporary camps outside the urban areas .
Abahlali have also had successes , which have annoyed local politicians .
Through their activism , Abahlali activists have forced the Durban municipality to agree to upgrade some of their settlements .
Controls over the settlement means control over the disbursement of funds .
This is the prize that Yakoob Baig and Jackson Gumede covet .
The ANC ’s decision to destroy a grassroots poor people ’s movement has been condemned around the world .
The South Africa Council of Churches ( SACC ) has called the incident ``an attack on democracy ' ' and has issued a statement of alarm at how community leaders are being criminalised .
Bishop Rubin Phillip , the chairperson of the KwaZulu - Natal Christian Council and Anglican Bishop of Natal , who had visited Kennedy Road , was ``torn with anguish ' ' by the attack and spoke of the real social hope that Abahlali was creating .
Around the world and in South Africa statements of solidarity and outrage continue to pour in and while these pressures may give the ANC pause in its actions against Abahlali , it is also clear that the ANC is not in control of the violence that it has unleashed .
At the settlement anyone associated with Abahlali has been threatened with violence and forced to leave .
Already 2000 people have been left homeless .
S’bu Zikode , the elected chair of Abahlali , is now in hiding after receiving a number of death threats .
Writing on September 29 , Zikode understood that the attack was an attack on the voice of ordinary poor people : `` This attack is an attempt to terrorise that voice back into the dark corners .
It is an attempt to turn the frustration and anger of the poor onto the poor so that we will miss the real enemy . ''
He ends by not only calling for solidarity but asking ``for close and careful scrutiny into the nature of democracy in South Africa ' ' .
Zikode is right , of course .
This is why he has been targeted by the militia , and why his safety must be guaranteed .
And the attack augurs ill for South Africa ’s future .
The demons of ethnic hatred had no harbour in South Africa .
But once unleashed , they could very well tear the ``Rainbow Nation '' apart .
Without swift and transparent justice to right this grave wrong , the future looks grim .
History makes one thing very clear : small coups beget bigger ones .

Abahlali baseMjondolo : ` Our movement is under attack '
By the Kennedy Road Development Committee , Abahlali baseMjondolo ( AbM ) and the Poor People ’s Alliance
October 6 , 2009 -- Abahlali baseMjondolo --
We are under attack .
We have been attacked physically with all kinds of weapons -- guns and knives , even a sword .
We have been driven from our homes and our community .
The police did nothing to stop the attacks on us despite our calls for help .
Four people were killed .
The attacks , which began on the night of Saturday September 26 , were carried out by local ANC members together with shebeen [ sly grog shops ] owners from the Kennedy Road settlement .
They were saying that our movement was ``selling them '' to the AmaMpondo .
It is a fact that our movement , at the local branch level and at the movement level , has no concern for where people were born or where their ancestors were born .
We are a movement of the poor and that means that we do not make divisions between the poor .
We have always been clear about this .
This is our politics and we will stick to it .
We have been told that earlier in the day the local ANC branch had a meeting .
We are told that there they decided to take up a new operation – Siyabangena ( we are entering ) .
We are told that there they decided to kill Mashumi Figlan , chairperson of the Kennedy Road Development Committee ( KRDC ) and deputy chairperson of our movement .
We are told that they decided to cut off his head and leave it in the community hall so that everyone would see that he was dead and not missing .
When the police did arrive they only came with one car and one van .
They only took statements from our attackers and they arrested eight people linked to the KRDC .
They took no statements from us and to this day none of our attackers have been arrested .
Some of the people that they arrested had in fact been performing the imfene dance at a public performance in Claremont on Saturday night .
The arrests were clearly political and aimed at destabilising the movement in Kennedy Road .
This is not the first time that most of the Kennedy Road leadership have been arrested for clearly political reasons .
In 2007 the Kennedy Six , five of whom were elected members of the KRDC , were arrested on false charges and only released on bail after a hunger strike .
All charges against them were later dropped because the state had no evidence .
On the morning after the attack ANC officials arrived in the settlement .
There were no police to protect us while we were being attacked but many , many police came with them .
While the police and the officials were there the same people who had attacked us the night before demolished our homes and looted them .
At least 27 houses were destroyed and many more were looted .
They all belonged to people elected to positions in the KRDC or Abahlali baseMjondolo ( AbM ) .
The police did nothing to stop the destruction of houses and the looting from houses .
Supt . Glen Nayager and ANC ward councillor Yakoob Baig were personally at Kennedy while our homes were destroyed .
Baig said , on record , that ``harmony ' ' has been restored now that the ``Abahlali criminals '' were gone .
After the politicians and the police departed from Kennedy Road the settlement was left in the hands of the local ANC – armed young men patrolled and made it clear , via death threats , that AbM was now banned from Kennedy Road .
They also made it clear that independent media were also banned .
Looting and various kinds of intimidation continued .
The eviction of some of our leaders and the arrest of others was followed by the destruction of our office leaving us without access to email and telephone .
When our members arrived from other settlements to try and save our records and banners in the office they were threatened with death .
To this day none of our attackers have been arrested .
The ANC has installed them in authority in Kennedy Road ( without holding any elections ) and is presenting them to the media as ``the community '' or as ``community representatives ' ' .
Many of the ANC leaders who have spoken in the community or to the media have attacked us and lied about us while not condemning our attackers .
On September 28 Bhekisisa Stalin Mncube , spokesperson for the provincial minister for safety and security Willies Mchunu , sent out a press release on behalf of Mchunu and the provincial police commissioner Hamilton Ngidi saying that “ the provincial government has moved swiftly to liberate a Durban community ( Kennedy Road ) ” .
Mncube added a note to his email threatening that AbM president S’bu Zikode may soon be arrested .
In this statement it is quite clear that at least some people in the police and the provincial ANC have enthusiastically endorsed the violent attack on our movement .
Following the attacks on our movement Nigel Gumde , head of housing in the eThekwini Municipality , has said , on record , that the government has “ a plan to eradicate shacks ” , that “ anyone coming into informal settlements must accept that plan ” and that it will be necessary to “ jail people to get development going ” .
He is clearly trying to criminalise debate about government policy .
How can debate about government policy be banned in a democracy ?
He has also said that the imfene dance is part of the problem and must be investigated .
How can the cultural expression of a group of people be considered a problem in this way ?
Since then there have been all kinds of other attacks on our movements – we have been lied about , slandered and defamed by various people within the ANC .
We consider these lies to be a way of trying to justify what was done to us and to our movement .
We consider these lies to be a way of trying to make the victims of a terrible attack look as if they are themselves the problem .
We consider these lies to be a way to encourage further attacks .
A coup
What happened in Kennedy Road was a coup – a violent replacement of a democratically elected community organisation .
The ANC have taken over everything that we built in Kennedy Road .
We always allowed free political activity in Kennedy and all settlements in which AbM candidates have been elected to leadership .
Now we are banned .
We do not use violence to build support .
We use open discussion .
Now we are violently banned .
Our members continue to receive death threats in and outside of Kennedy Road .
Everyone knows that if you speak for Zikode or AbM in Kennedy Road you will be attacked .
And S’bu has received a number of death threats and threats to his family , including his children , via anonymous calls since he was evicted from the settlement by the ANC and shebeen owner ’s mob .
Last night five men in a white car arrived at his sister ’s place looking for S’bu and his family .
They asked where S’bu and his wife and children are staying now .
We do n’t know who they were but they were clearly hostile .
The ANC continue to attack Zikode by all means .
They say that he does n’t follow the ANC code of conduct , that he is stopping development , that he has a big house in Umhlanga .
The first one is true – that is his right .
That is the right of all of us .
We make no apology for this .
The rest is just wild defamation .
On Sunday Willies Mchunu , Nigel Gumde and others held a big meeting in the Kennedy Road Hall .
Our attackers were all sitting there .
People from the ANC in Sydenham Heights and the Foreman Road settlement were sitting there pretending to be from Kennedy Road .
All kinds of lies were told .
The Kennedy 8 are currently being held in the Sydenham Police station and will appear in court again on Thursday .
We are told that the ANC is organising across all wards to get their members to the court to demand that the Kennedy 8 do not receive bail .
This is not the behaviour of an organisation committed to truth and justice .
They should , instead , be asking for a fair and credible investigation into all the acts of violence , theft , destruction and intimidation that have occurred .
This is our demand .
They should make it their demand too .
` We are all Abahlali baseMjondolo '
At a time when the Kennedy Road settlement is being targeted all the settlements affiliated to our movement across the country say ``we are all Kennedy Road – if Kennedy Road has committed the crime of organising independently from the ANC and speaking out for justice then we are all criminals ' ' .
At a time when Abahlali baseMjondolo is under attack all the movements that we work with in the Poor People ’s Alliance , and others too , say ``we are all Abahlali baseMjondolo – if Abahlali baseMjondolo has committed the crime of allowing the poor to organise the poor for justice then we are all criminals ' ' .
At a time when threats are being made on the life of S’bu Zikode , and his family ( including his children ) and when the ANC are waging campaign of slander and vilification against him we say ``we are all S’bu Zikode – if S’bu Zikode has committed the crime of telling the truth about the lives of the poor and the realities of democracy in South Africa then we are all criminals ' ' .
We want to make some comments about the ongoing and all out attacks on S’bu Zikode from the ANC .
We elected S’bu to represent us .
He did not want to be our leader .
He never calls himself a leader – people call him a leader .
He does n’t live in a fancy house and drive a fancy car to talk about the poor on stages and in hotels .
He lives in a shack and works in the community with the community to give us courage to speak for ourselves .
Last year he wanted to step down from the pesidency of the movement .
We mobilised for two weeks to persuade him to remain as the president .
We know that two weeks before the attack Jackson Gumede , chairperson of the branch executive committee of the ANC in Ward 25 , had said that the Abahlali baseMjondolo ( AbM ) office would soon be an ANC office .
We know that at the same time John Mchunu , chairperson of the ANC in eThekwini , accused us of trying to destabilise the country .
We are not a political party .
We have never been a political party .
We are a poor people ’s movement – we are looking for justice , not political power .
We have never stood in elections .
We do n’t even vote because we do n’t care about that kind of power .
We care about building the power of the community to reduce the gap between ordinary people on the one side and the rich and the politicians on the other side .
But the politicians are ignorant .
They do n’t know what a social movement is .
They do n’t understand that there can be a politics outside of party politics .
In eShowe the Inkatha Freedom Party ( IFP ) recently attacked us for being ANC .
When we first started our movement in Durban in 2005 the ANC attacked us for being IFP .
Now the ANC are claiming that we are COPE [ Congress of the People , a recent split from the ANC led by those loyal to former South African president Thabo Mbeki ] .
The ANC have seen the huge support that we have and they fear that S’bu will stand in the local government elections .
They also fear us because we have exposed so much corruption in places like Foreman Road , Motala Heights , Mpola , Siyanda , eShowe and Howick .
They also fear us because we have stood with many other communities who are opposing injustice , such as people in Umlazi and in eMacambini .
They are embarrassed that shack dwellers , ordinary people like us , took the ANC government to the constitutional court .
And the judgment is coming this week .
The sad thing is that if we find that we have won we will have no place to slaughter a cow .
They see the good relationship that we have developed with city officials during our long negotiations from late 2007 as a threat .
They see our good relationship with the provincial HOD for housing as a threat .
We are wondering if democracy still exists
This is not the first time that we have asked ourselves this question .
We asked this question when our march was illegally banned and we were attacked in Foreman Road in 2005 .
We asked ourselves this question when people who challenged the ANC in local government elections in E - Section of Umlazi were assassinated in 2006 .
We asked this question in 2006 when S’bu Zikode and Philani Zungu were arrested , beaten and tortured while trying to attend a radio interview .
We were still asking ourselves this question when our peaceful march was shot at by the police in 2007 .
The ANC is about comradeism .
It is about order and protocol .
You must follow the mandate and the mandate always comes from above .
AbM can just say ``No !''.
The new ANC committee members that has been put in place in Kennedy Road will find that they are just expected to be puppets .
They will find that they are just expected to take orders from above .
Zikode had the strength to take the side of the people .
They will not have that strength .
Even they will realise the value of the river when drought comes .
Our movement is growing .
When the time is right we will go back to Kennedy Road .
We are prepared to go toe to toe with the ANC but we will not use violence .
We will use open and free discussion on the realities of our country .
We will counter lies with truth .
We will counter a living politics with politician ’s politics .
People who belong to prisons must go to prisons .
People who belong to Kennedy must go to Kennedy .
Accusations against the movement
At a time when we are being attacked our attackers , and those who support them , should be subject to intense public scrutiny .
However the politicians are doing everything in their power to make us , the victims of this attack , subject to very critical public scrutiny .
The most incredible lies are being told about us and our movement .
At the same time our attackers are being installed in power in Kennedy Road and introduced to the media as ``the community ' ' .
Many accusations have been made against the movement by the ANC in recent days .
Each day new accusations are made .
We will address the main accusations here but we request all journalists to please check with us before reporting any accusation made by the police or the ANC ( or people presented by the ANC and the police as ``community representatives ' ' -- these people may well be the ones that attacked us ) as if it were a fact .
We can answer any other questions at the press conference tomorrow .
1. The Safety and Security Committee .
It has been said that this is an illegitimate structure that has no right to exist .
The truth is that this committee was set up in partnership with the police at the time when the state stopped criminalising our movement and we were successfully negotiating with the state on a whole range of demands .
One of our long standing demands has been for equal and fair access to policing .
In the past we were denied this and we were all treated as criminals .
However when the state began to negotiate with us , a process that began in late 2007 , we were able to negotiate with the local police too .
The committee came out of those talks .
The committee is a sub-committee of the KRDC , which is an elected structure .
The police were present at the launch of the committee .
Supt .
Glen Nayager was there personally , and police attended its meetings .
Representatives from nearby settlements that are affiliated to the ANC also attended its meetings such as Majozi from Quarry Road and Simphiwe from Palmiet .
This is all detailed in our minutes of those meetings , and it can also be attested to by many witnesses .
It was also covered in the local press – for instance there was an article in the Weekly Gazette of Overport with a picture of the committee and Supt .
Nayager .
There is nothing unusual about an elected community organisation setting up an anti-crime committee with the police .
The government has asked all communities to do this .
In fact on the same day that we were attacked Willies Mchunu called for a ``people ’s war against crime ' ' .
The day after we were attacked he called the Safety and Security Committee an illegitimate and criminal structure .
This was a lie .
2 . The so - called ``curfew ' ' .
It has been said that the Safety and Security Committee imposed a curfew on the settlement which meant that people could not watch TV or cook after 7 pm at night .
This is also a lie .
The truth is that the committee did impose a closing time on shebeens .
They had previously been running 24 hours a day .
There had been complaints about the noise for years and some of the women comrades in our movement had also argued that alcohol abuse is linked to domestic violence .
Also , in a situation where there are so many fires , alcohol abuse can put the safety of the whole community at risk .
But the main reason for instituting closing times was that since the national election campaign there have been ethnic tensions in Kennedy Road , and in other nearby settlements too .
There have been fights and even murders .
These fights were all alcohol related and so for the safety of the community we thought that it was necessary to put limits on shebeen hours .
The police were present at the meeting where this decision was taken .
They suggested that the closing time should be 8 pm .
We suggested that it should be 10 pm and in the end it was set at 10 pm .
It is true that the shebeen owners did not like this .
But anyone who did not like it could elect new people with different views to the KRDC in the next election in November , or call for an urgent general meeting and see if there was support to recall the people on the committee and have a new election or take up the issue with the police .
Some of the ANC leaders have spoken as if setting closing times for shebeens is some sort of terrible human rights violation that justified the attacks on us .
They speak as though the shebeen owners rather than the people who have been attacked and driven from their homes are the real victims .
They speak as through the right to drink all night is more important than basic political freedoms and basic safety .
3. AbM is stopping development .
Our movement was formed to struggle for development .
We struggle for development everyday .
But development is not a neutral thing .
Some kinds of development are in the interests of the rich and against the interests of the poor .
Therefore our movement is specifically committed to struggling for development that is in the interests of the poor .
This means that we will oppose a forced removal from a well - located shack close to schools , work , health care and so on to a ``transit camp ’' ( which is really just a government shack ) in the middle of nowhere .
This does not make us unique .
Poor people ’s organisations across South Africa , like the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign in Cape Town and the Landless People ’s Movement in Johannesburg take exactly the same position .
Poor people ’s movements around the world take the same position .
Academics and NGOs around the world take the same position .
Our achievements in the struggle for pro-poor development are a matter of record .
In late 2007 the government stopped criminalising our movement and began to negotiate with us .
After more than a year of negotiations we signed a memorandum of understating with the eThekwini Municipality in February 2009 .
That MOU commits the city to provide services to 14 settlements affiliated to the movement and to explore the upgrading of three settlements where they currently are in terms of the government ’s 2004 Breaking New Ground ( BNG ) policy .
This MOU is not a secret – it has been covered in the media and we can make it available .
The MOU is a major breakthrough for pro-poor development in Kennedy Road , in Durban and in South Africa .
It is a major breakthrough for Kennedy Road because in the late 1980s and early 1990s the Urban Foundation had agreed to upgrade the settlement where it was and even started the work – this is when the hall was built .
But in 1995 the then Durban City Council cancelled the upgrade and the plan for Kennedy Road was changed to forced removal to a human dumping ground .
We won the right to the city for the residents of Kennedy Road .
The MOU is also a major breakthrough for Durban because is commits the city to developing settlements in the city instead of forcing people out to rural human dumping grounds .
It is a major breakthrough for the country because if followed up it would be the first time that the BNG policy would actually have been implemented .
Negotiations on implementing this deal were continuing right up to the attacks and in fact have continued after the attacks .
We have also been negotiating for people who cannot be included in the upgrade to be voluntarily relocated to Cornubia which , because it is near Umhlanga Rocks , will have good access to work , schools , clinics etc .
We have worked incredibly hard to achieve all these victories for the development of the people of Kennedy Road .
The KRDC and AbM signed that MOU .
The victory is ours .
It came from our blood ( when we were being repressed ) and our sweat ( when we were negotiating ) .
4. AbM has taken the government to court .
This is true .
We have often taken the government to court .
We have taken the government to court to protect our basic political freedoms such as the right to march , we have taken the government to court to prevent them from illegally evicting us and we have also taken the government to court to have the Slums Act declared unconstitutional .
It is being said that this is an attempt to stop development .
When the Slums Bill came out we read it together , line by line , and we developed a clear critique of it .
We are not alone in our critique of the Slums Act .
The Act has been widely criticised as anti-poor , even by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Housing and our actions against it have been widely supported .
We have the same right as everyone else to form opinions about government policy and legislation and to take our views before the courts for their consideration .
Taking the government to court is a basic democratic right .
It is not a crime – but killing people , chasing people from their homes and their community , destroying their homes and looting their goods and using death threats to ban a democratic political organisation from an area are all crimes .
5 . We have travelled overseas .
We do not hide anything about these discussions .
We have gone overseas recently .
We have been invited by churches to visit England and North America .
We go there to speak the truth .
That is our right .
6 . We have international support .
It is true that we have supporters in other countries .
Most of these people are the same people who supported the struggle against apartheid .
They are supporting our struggle because our struggle is clearly just .
There are also some young people who see that there is injustice in our world , see that we are standing up for justice and want to work with us .
Some have come to live in our settlements for a while to see how we make our homemade politics .
7 . We have money .
When we started our movement we had no money .
We had nothing but our will .
In recent years we have got a little support , mostly from churches .
We have always refused money when we have felt that people were trying to buy over movement .
We have never been paid to struggle .
We are elected to positions and we serve as volunteers .
We still have to work for a living .
Our movement is not professionalised .
The money that we have got in recent years is very small – before the attack we had an office but the phone was often cut off because we could n’t pay the bill .
All our records were kept in the office .
Anyone could see them at any time .
We also have a list of all the people who have supported us materially on our website .
We note that unlike us the ANC refuses to be open about its funders .
8 . We did not attend the meeting at Kennedy on Sunday .
Of course we did n’t attend the meeting at Kennedy on Sunday .
We received no proper invitation to it .
And who in their right mind would attend a meeting after receiving death threats from the same people that would be at the meeting ?
Who in their right mind would attend a meeting where the people who had just destroyed their home would be presented as ``the community ' ' ?
Who in their right mind would attend a meeting where their supporters would be too scared to attend with them and too scared to speak if they were there .
That meeting was like an ANC rally and it would have been used as a kangaroo court if we had gone there .
There were people there from Sydenham Heights and Foreman Road who were speaking as if they were from Kennedy !
At this meeting the ANC announced all the victories that we have struggled for , and worked for over so many years , as if they were theirs !
The ANC has a long history of hijacking people ’s struggles and claiming them as their own .
Our demands
1 . There needs to be an immediate restoration of democracy in Kennedy Road .
This includes :
• The right of everyone who was chased out of the settlement or displaced by the violence to return to the settlement and to be safe in the settlement .
• The right of Abahlali baseMjondolo to work in the settlement without fear of attack or intimidation or slander .
• The restoration of our office to us and a guarantee that the office will be safe .
• The disbanding of the unelected structures that the ANC has instituted in the settlement and the return to authority of the democratically elected organisation that was running the settlement before the attacks or the holding of genuinely free and fair and safe elections in the settlement .
If the democratically elected organisation ( the KRDC ) that was displaced in the coup is returned to its rightful place the next election will be in November .
2 . There needs to be a genuinely independent and credible investigation into the attacks at Kennedy Road ( including the demolition of people ’s houses , the looting , the banning of AbM from the settlement and the ongoing threats to AbM members in and out of the settlement ) that includes an examination of the role played by everyone including the police , the local ANC and the comments and actions of senior ANC people in the Municipality and the Province after the attacks .
It must include fairness and justice for the Kennedy 8 .
3 . There must be compensation and support for those who have been injured and traumatised , those who have had to flee the settlement , those whose homes and businesses have been destroyed and those who have lost everything that they own .
4 . There must be a crystal clear commitment from the ANC , from the top to the bottom , to the right of all people to organise independently of the ANC , to protest against the ANC , to challenge the ANC ’s understanding of development and to take the ANC government to court .
5 . The ANC must make a public commitment backed up with real action to ensure the safety of S’bu Zikode and all other AbM leaders .
6 . There must be genuine and safe negotiation on the way forward between the ANC and AbM .
These negotiations should be mediated by someone that we all trust .
We know that there are many democrats in the ANC and we hope that they will prevail over those who have cast us as enemies to be attacked and eradicated by all means .
Kangaroo courts are not places for real negotiations .
7 . In yesterday ’s Isolezwe the provincial housing minister said that she will provide housing for those who have been displaced .
We welcome this announcement but we demand that those who have had their homes destroyed and all their things stolen should be at the top of the list .
This includes S’bu Zikode , Mashumi Figlan and the KRDC .
Solidarity actions
Many people have contacted us asking what they can do to support us .
We want to thank all those who are supporting us – especially the church leaders and all those comrades who organised protests in London and in iRhini .
We are making the following suggestions :
1. Affirm our right to exist and our right to be critical of the government .
2. Organise in support of our demands .
3 . Support those of us who have lost their homes and all their possessions with material support .
4. Support those of us who are traumatised , including the children , with counselling and spiritual support .
5 . Organise serious discussions about the nature of democracy in our country – and include delegates from poor people ’s organisations in those discussions on the basis of equality .

Anti-Privatisation Forum : ` In defence of democracy '
October 5 , 2009 --
The first few months of the Zuma Presidency has not interrupted the war on the poor .
What took place last week in Kennedy Road , Durban , is rather signalling that the violence deployed against organisations of the poor is being escalated .
A meeting of the Abahlali baseMjondolo ( AbM ) affiliate , Kennedy Road Development Committee ( KRDC ) , on Sunday September 27 , was attacked by a militia , killing comrades Mthokozisi Ndlovu and Ndumiso Mnguni .
The office of Abahlali and fifteen homes belonging to leading members of the movement were demolished before the attack and several of the ABM ’s leaders remain in hiding .
Over a thousand , mostly Xhosa - speaking residents , were also forced to flee their homes .
According to eyewitness reports , when the police arrived on the morning after the attack started , they arrested none of the perpetrators of the violence .
Instead , they arrested eight members of Abahlali who were in Claremont at the time of the attack , for the murder of the two comrades in Kennedy Road .
It was further reported that the police then watched passively over the next several days as the militia , shouting things like ``Kennedy Road is for Zulus ” , targeted amaPondo and particularly Abahlali members .
The lives of four more people were claimed during this organised pogrom and many more residents forced to flee .
By the time the police eventually responded to the crisis on Thursday ( October 1 ) last week , the chairperson of the local ANC branch , Jackson Gumede , was in effective control of the Kennedy Road community , demanding that residents produce their ANC membership cards .
Now , over a week after the initial attack , the militia still holds Kennedy Road in the grip of terror .
Over a thousand residents remain displaced and AbM 's leadership is still in hiding .
The police have made no progress on the charges laid against the attackers .
The eight KRDC members arrested for murder will have their bail hearing this Thursday , October 8 .
AbM reports that their members will spend this week mobilising support for the liberation of their falsely accused comrades .
Returning children to school , rebuilding destroyed homes and assisting all those forced to flee will also be priorities .
It is clear to the APF that what has transpired at Kennedy Road is a patent case of politically and ethnically motivated violence designed to ``clear out ''
AbM and destroy the inclusive and active community that has been built over the last several years .
As a movement that itself has experienced the cold hand of party and state - sponsored violence and injustice , the APF admires the strength and resilience of AbM to continue the struggle and resolutely face up to their oppressors .
The support that AbM has received from academics , the Anti-Eviction Campaign in Cape Town , the Unemployed Movement , the Rural Network and various churches shows clearly that the shack dwellers are not the criminals the police and ANC councillors have so pathetically tried to portray them as .
We share the conviction that the attempts to dislodge AbM will fail .
In joining the calls already made for a complete end to the violence and intimidation as well as the exposure and prosecution of the attackers and their handlers , the APF further demands that Abahlali , along with all residents forced to flee , be allowed to return to Kennedy Road without hindrance to reconstruct their homes and lives as well as to organise freely .
Democracy is not the preserve of self - appointed elites and their lackeys .
Alongside the AbM , the APF will continue to practice and defend our democratic freedoms and fight against reactionary attempts to divide the poor and sow terror and fear .
The APF pledges its full solidarity with Abahlali .

Germans to make stand against prostitutes - with rancid butter !
Residents of one German town think having prostitutes on their streets stinks – and they ’re willing to go to smelly means to fix it !
The citizens of Vierlinden in Brandenburg have threatened to use butyric acid , which is found in rancid butter and is sometimes used to disperse wild animals , against the women .
According to the ‘ Märkische Allgemeine ’ newspaper , the town ’s Mayor Dirk Illgenstein said : “ Our territory must be completely off limits to the red light scene . ”
The community leader said he fears the image of the region , close to the border with Poland , is being damaged by the prostitutes .
And the paper also reported that community representatives from surrounding areas are just as keen to combat the street girls “ with all means at their disposal ” .
Photos will be taken of the punters and their identities published on the internet , and the stinky butyric acid will be thrown at the prostitutes !
Uta Ludwig , director of the Belladonna women ’s counselling organisation in Frankfurt which has been involved in AIDS prevention in the border region for years , is horrified .
She said : “ That is completely sick and discriminatory and reminds me of witch hunts in the Middle Ages . ”
Belladonna is now looking for talks with community representatives because “ driving away the women accomplishes nothing .
They just reappear at the next corner . ”
Around ten prostitutes from Bulgaria and Poland work everyday on Bundesstrasse 1 ( Federal Highway 1 ) between Seelow and Müncheberg and at Beeskow on Bundesstrasse 87 , where their ‘ services ’ cost around € 20 - 50 .
“ The authorities know that they ultimately must endure the streetwalkers , ” Uda Ludwig added to the ‘ Märkische Allgemeine ’ .
Whether the community will actually resort to such dramatic means is unlikely , however .
The reason – prostitution has been legal since 2002 .

IT contractors say they are being displaced by non-EU workers British IT contractors claim they are struggling to get work because large companies are using a government scheme to employ people from overseas instead .
Firms are using intra-company transfer visas to move employees from overseas bases - usually in India - to UK jobs .
BBC Radio 5 live was told people are brought to the UK to work on government IT projects run by BT and Capgemini .
Both firms say they are operating within the law .
The government said it was tightening the rules on such visas .
The guiding principle behind immigration rules for skilled workers coming to the UK , from outside the EU , is that an employer can only hire an overseas worker if no - one in Britain can be found to do it .
But intra-company transfer visas ( ICT ) mean an overseas employee can come to work for their company in the UK if they have six months ' experience , are paid an appropriate salary and do not take the job of a permanent UK worker .
About 50,000 ICT visas are issued every year and two thirds of them go to employees in IT and telecommunications .
About 70 % are given to Indian nationals .
' Very bitter ' British IT worker Anil Verma has been out of work for two years .
" A lot of the IT contractors - they 're very very bitter about it , " he said .
Capgemini has no plans to replace all of its UK contractors with overseas employees
Capgemini
" The government 's issued too many intra-company transfer visas and a lot of these guys have come over from India and flooded the IT industry .
There 's not enough jobs to go round . "
Paul used to work for global IT firm Capgemini in Telford , Shropshire , on a Revenue & Customs project .
His contract was not renewed and he left in May .
He says talented Britons are gradually being replaced by Indian workers brought over on ICTs and he , like other IT contractors , feels that they are being undercut by cheaper overseas labour .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" There 's no sense in bringing somebody from overseas to do that if it 's costing the company exactly the same , " he said .
Capgemini said it complied with all the ICT visa regulations , including those relating to pay .
" Overseas people working in the UK for any of our clients provide specific skills and are permanent employees from the global Capgemini Group , " it said .
" Capgemini has no plans to replace all of its UK contractors with overseas employees , as these local contractors are a valuable part of our flexible workforce . "
Tighter rules
The BBC also heard from BT contractors working on an NHS patient records project in Leeds .
They said Indian nationals on ICT visas were being used to fill roles once filled by British workers .
They are not filling roles that require a permanent UK presence
BT BT said no permanent staff had been replaced .
The company admitted it had tried to reduce its reliance on what it called " expensive contractors " over the past few years by re-skilling current BT employees .
It had also outsourced some IT work to Indian companies , who could then bring workers over on ITC visas .
" They are not filling roles that require a permanent UK presence , " said a spokesman .
Lin Homer , chief executive of the UK Border Agency , said the ICT visa system had been shown to " contribute to the UK 's economic prosperity by supporting international business and encouraging investment . "
However , the rules will be tightened next year and to qualify for a visa , workers will need 12 months experience with their sponsoring company and the system " will no longer lead to settlement " .
The UK Border Agency said there were strict rules on what ICT visa workers should be paid and any allegations of abuse would be investigated .

( HNN ) President Obama will introduce legislation next week that will pay off the ballooning federal deficit by 2017 .
Called the Hot Air Initiative , the proposal is an effort to raise trillions of dollars to pay for his social utopia .
The proposal is simple .
A breathing tax will tax the wealthy for every breath they take .
" Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas and it must be stopped " , according to Obama .
President Obama will introduce legislation next week that will pay off the ballooning federal deficit by 2017 .
Called the Hot Air Initiative , the proposal is an effort to raise trillions of dollars to pay for his social utopia .
The proposal is simple .
A breathing tax will tax the wealthy for every breath they take .
" Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas and it must be stopped " , according to Obama .
Many thought Obama 's Carbon
Tax would be directed at pollution spewing corporations as a way to hold them accountable to the environment .
But insiders , who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity , say that Obama scrapped those plans when lobbyists of big business and tobacco agreed to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to his 2012 reelection campaign .
Instead , Obama is poised to introduce a breathing tax on the richest 5 % of Americans .
Holding true to his own word , this tax will not affect anyone making less than $ 250,000 a year .
For all Americans above that threshold , they will be taxed based solely on their income .
As a progressive Carbon Tax Initiative , the more you make , the more you will be taxed .
As Obama said , " Anyone making $ 500,000 a year must be full of hot air .
And those making more than a million ?
Do n't get me started .
I can't even imagine how much carbon dioxide they 're spewing into the environment .
It 's time to let the poor breath clean air once again . "
On a surprise note , Obama and company said they will also introduce sister legislation that will drastically affect the lives of smokers everywhere .
As a smoker and a rich man , Obama plans to introduce the Obamarama amendment that would entitle all smokers an exemption from any Carbon Tax Initiative , regardless of income .
After promising not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $ 250,000 a year , Obama felt the time to act was now to win back the hearts of smokers that he lied to .
The medical rationale is simple .
According to Obama 's physician advisers , smokers are incapable of exhaling all their carbon dioxide with every breath .
As such , they should not be penalized with a Carbon Tax .
In fact , they should be rewarded for breathing out less greenhouse gases .
Obama was overheard saying , " The more carbon dioxide we can prevent in exhalation , the better off our air will be .
Let 's do it .
Let 's give them free cash . "
Anonymous sources have also indicated Obama 's plans for a second sister amendment that gives all first time smokers an $ 8,000 environmental carbon tax credit as a way of saying thank you for saving the environment .
They will also receive $ 4,000 in smokes for every smoking cessation aide they bring to a Walmart disposal center .
Why Walmart you ask ?
" We owe the Chinese a lot of money , " Obama was heard saying .

If you own a notebook or handheld device equipped with accelerometers , which are more common part of these PCs , the new Firefox 3.6 will be able to use that part of the equipment .
The new version of Firefox is able to take data of the orientation of the device from the built - in accelerometer and inform application executed in the browser window .
In Mozilla think that this feature is useful for early web - lab type games where the user control the movement of an object with movement of device , such as ( from “ that ” time ) Marble Madness , for those which still remember it .
Of course , not exclude the possibility of some other applications outside of games , but in this moment nothing comes to mind …

The full - wave simulation result when light is incident to the black hole ( Image : Qiang Cheng and Tie Jun Cui )
An electromagnetic “ black hole ” that sucks in surrounding light has been built for the first time .
The device , which works at microwave frequencies , may soon be extended to trap visible light , leading to an entirely new way of harvesting solar energy to generate electricity .
A theoretical design for a table - top black hole to trap light was proposed in a paper published earlier this year by Evgenii Narimanov and Alexander Kildishev of Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana .
Their idea was to mimic the properties of a cosmological black hole , whose intense gravity bends the surrounding space - time , causing any nearby matter or radiation to follow the warped space - time and spiral inwards .
Advertisement
Narimanov and Kildishev reasoned that it should be possible to build a device that makes light curve inwards towards its centre in a similar way .
They calculated that this could be done by a cylindrical structure consisting of a central core surrounded by a shell of concentric rings .
There ’s no escape
The key to making light curve inwards is to make the shell ’s permittivity – which affects the electric component of an electromagnetic wave – increase smoothly from the outer to the inner surface .
This is analogous to the curvature of space - time near a black hole .
At the point where the shell meets the core , the permittivity of the ring must match that of the core , so that light is absorbed rather than reflected .
Now Tie Jun Cui and Qiang Cheng at the Southeast University in Nanjing , China , have turned Narimanov and Kildishev ’s theory into practice , and built a “ black hole ” for microwave frequencies .
It is made of 60 annular strips of so - called “ meta - materials ” , which have previously been used to make invisibility cloaks .
Each strip takes the form of a circuit board etched with intricate structures whose characteristics change progressively from one strip to the next , so that the permittivity varies smoothly .
The outer 40 strips make up the shell and the inner 20 strips make up the absorber .
“ When the incident electromagnetic wave hits the device , the wave will be trapped and guided in the shell region towards the core of the black hole , and will then be absorbed by the core , ” says Cui .
“ The wave will not come out from the black hole . ”
In their device , the core converts the absorbed light into heat .
Quick work
Narimanov is impressed by Cui and Cheng ’s implementation of his design .
“ I am surprised that they have done it so quickly , ” he says .
Fabricating a device that captures optical wavelengths in the same way will not be easy , as visible light has a wavelength orders of magnitude smaller than that of microwave radiation .
This will require the etched structures to be correspondingly smaller .
Cui is confident that they can do it .
“ I expect that our demonstration of the optical black hole will be available by the end of 2009 , ” he says .
Such a device could be used to harvest solar energy in places where the light is too diffuse for mirrors to concentrate it onto a solar cell .
An optical black hole would suck it all in and direct it at a solar cell sitting at the core .
“ If that works , you will no longer require these huge parabolic mirrors to collect light , ” says Narimanov .

WHEN Steven Bird walked past police officers in the City Heart at 4.30 in the morning he told them : “ You 're going to want to search me . ”
The police asked him : “ Why ? ”
And he replied : “ Because of what I 've got . ”
Details of Bird 's unusual conversation were revealed in the Mackay Magistrate 's Court on Wednesday when he pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of eight LSD tabs .
The court heard that LSD , which Bird , a 22 - year - old forklift driver , referred to as “ acid ” , was not common in Mackay .
The tabs had sunflowers on them .
Duty lawyer John Aberdeen , of Legal Aid Queensland , said the drug was for Bird 's personal use and he purchased them because they were cheaper to buy that way .
Bird was fined $ 500 .
Update : 2010 Polish Festival details here !
Again this year the Polish Festival lived up to its reputation as one of the best fall festivals in Portland .
Like last year ’s festival , which also took place during a spate of fantastic weather , the crowd was huge .
By cleverly splitting up and tackling a line each , Heather and I managed to quickly acquire a pair of Okocim Porters and a combo plate to share .
Placki ziemniaczane ( aka potato pancakes ) ,
Heather ’s raison d’être , would have to wait – the line snaked half a block down Failing Street , and seemed to be barely moving ; we learned the wait was 45 to 60 minutes .
Joining us Saturday afternoon were our friends Lesley , Julie , Diane , and Karen .
Later on Jake and Laurie met up with us too .
We stood on a hillock under a shady tree to enjoy our beers and listened to the Oregon Polka Beats perform during the children ’s polka contest and then the street dance .
Later we checked out the jewelry , clothing , Polish pottery , and sundries for sale in the adjacent parking lot vendor village .
As the sun set the crowd became , mercifully , more manageable [ Note to 2010 self : arrive around sunset , stay until close ] .
The placki line was not getting any shorter , despite the dissipating crowd , so Heather endured the wait while I searched out more beverages .
Though none of my companions liked it , I really enjoyed the very sweet honey wine , Bernardynski Royal Mead .
We tried several varieties of Polish beer that were new to us – all good .
We checked out the goings on in the Polish Hall too , where the Polka Beats were playing for the rest of the evening .
I dragged Heather out onto the dance floor for a bit , though I have no idea how to polka .
Like I said , I really enjoyed the honey wine .
And I ’m really glad no one got video of my polka massacre .
We ended the night out under the big tent listening to a fantastic Portland based Eastern European punk / traditional band , Chervona .
They rocked – we ’ll be checking them out around town when we can .

According to a Google Groups post by David Percy , Geospatial Data Manager at Portland State University , the manager of catering at the Oregon Convention Center has mentioned that OSCON will be back in Portland .
[ HTML2 ] Loose lips sink ships — or let you know that big O’Reilly open source conferences like OSCON are returning to Portland .
Now while we ’ve heard rumors swirling about this for quite a while — including talk that Portland Mayor Sam Adams is lobbying for the conference fairly heavily — it ’s rapidly moving into the 99 % sure category .
Today , that rumor got a little closer to reality .
According to a Google Groups post by David Percy , Geospatial Data Manager at Portland State University , the manager of catering at the Oregon Convention Center has mentioned that OSCON will be back in town , July 19 - 23 , 2010 .
Andy ( @thesethings ) all but confirms it , as well .
Now , I ’m reticent to post this as a for sure thing .
Especially given that the O’Reilly site does n’t reflect any location or dates for OSCON as of yet .
But it ’s looking fairly certain that we ’re going to have two major open source conferences in Portland this summer , with Open Source Bridge and OSCON .
Stay tuned .

After an insurance industry report said that premiums would rise sharply with the passage of comprehensive health care legislation , Jon Gruber , a health care economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said he evaluated the report Monday at the request of Senate Democrats and found it deeply flawed .
The industry report , prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers , was released Sunday evening by America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the major industry trade group , and has sparked a furor , drawing angry responses from the White House , Congressional Democrats and other supporters of the legislation .
Mr. Gruber , who helped Massachusetts with its effort to provide universal health insurance coverage , said that the industry report failed to take into account administrative overhead costs that he said will “ fall enormously ” once insurance polices are sold through new government - regulated marketplaces , or exchanges .
And Mr. Gruber said that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report failed to take into account government subsidies that would be provided to help moderate - income Americans purchase insurance .
PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in its report that it did not factor in the effect of those subsidies .
As a result , Mr. Gruber reached the opposite conclusion of the insurance industry .
He said that premiums would actually decline for individuals purchasing and families purchasing insurance , either with or without the government subsidies .
Mr. Gruber ’s analysis did not look at employer - sponsored plans or group plans .
“ If you literally take the data from the Congressional Budget Office you can see that individuals will be saving money in a nongroup market , ’’ he said .
But the findings by Mr. Gruber , a prominent health economist , seemed unlikely to diminish the partisan firefight that has erupted in recent days , with Republicans citing the insurance industry report as evidence of their belief that the Democrats ’ health care legislation would lead to higher taxes and higher costs .
The insurance industry report seeks to predict what will happen to insurance premiums across the entire industry , which is a very broad approach .
And the reality is that it is virtually impossible to predict the impact that the proposed legislation will have on insurance premiums .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which has thoroughly analyzed all of the major legislative proposals in Congress , has said that it cannot forecast what would happen to premiums because so many uncertain variables come into play .
Generally speaking , health insurance premiums are expected to rise .
For example , the federal Office of Personnel Management recently said that health insurance premiums for federal government employees would rise an average of 8.8 percent in 2010 , and in the most popular Blue Cross insurance plans the premiums would increase 15 percent for individual coverage and 12 percent for family coverage .
Whether premiums will increase more or less than otherwise would have been expected as a result of the overhaul depends on innumerable factors , including the specifics of the legislation , which has yet to be approved , and the specifics of individual policies , which could change based on the specifics of the legislation .
In addition , the legislation could lead to other unexpected changes in the health care system that could drive overall prices up or down in the short term .
Mr. Gruber also disputed an assertion in the insurance industry report that some plans meeting the minimum requirements in the proposed legislation , so - called “ bronze plans , ” would be so costly that they would be hit by a proposed excise tax on high - priced or “ Cadillac ” insurance policies .
Mr. Gruber called that claim “ completely implausible ” and said that the industry report overstated the cost of a bronze plan , even in a state with extremely expensive insurance prices .
Here ’s his analysis :
The Senate Finance Committee Proposal Lowers Nongroup Premiums
Jonathan Gruber , M.I.T .
Oct. 12 , 2009
The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes health insurance and delivery system reforms , new options , premium assistance and other proposals to improve quality , affordable health care for all Americans through state - based exchanges .
The premiums that individuals will face in these exchanges are , according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office , considerably lower than what they would face in the existing nongroup insurance market , due to the market reforms put in place by the S.F.C. plan and the market economies of new exchanges .
This report , and the attached slides , illustrates this point by relying solely on analysis available from C.B.O. , as well as the details of the premium assistance available through tax credits in the Senate Finance plan .
[ 1 ]
In addition , following the usual assumption in my model I assume that health insurance premiums grow at 6 percent / year .
The analysis focused on two types of individuals and a family : a 25 - year - old , a 60 - year - old , and a family of four where the family head is 45 years old .
I examined these family types at four different income levels , where they would be getting four different tax credits for premiums .
The impact is for 2016 , the first fully - phased in year of the reforms , although income is expressed in $ 2009 for ease of interpretation .
The analysis compares what they would pay if they are currently insured in the nongroup market versus what they will pay in the exchange .
Under the Senate Finance Committee proposal , the average estimate premium changes would mean :
* Sizeable premium savings for young .
An individual aged 25 at $ 19,000 in income ( 175 percent of poverty ) would benefit from tax credits and would save , on average , $ 685 .
A higher income young person could always buy a “ bronze ” plan without tax credits for a savings of $ 230 .
Moreover , they could qualify for a catastrophic policy – also known as a “ young invincible ” policy .
This policy would cost on average only $ 1,190 , saving them $ 585 at all income levels .
* Even larger premium savings for older individuals .
A person age 60 with income at $ 19,000 ( 175 percent of poverty ) would save , on average , $ 7,890 .
A person at age 60 with income at $ 40,600 ( 375 percent of poverty ) would continue to benefit from tax credits and would save , on average , $ 4,100 .
Even at a high enough income level to not benefit from tax credits , older persons purchasing a bronze plan would save about $ 2,800 .
* Also large premium savings for a family .
A family with income at $ 38,000 ( 175 percent of poverty ) would save , on average , $ 8,550 .
That same family with higher income could buy a “ bronze ” plan without tax credits at a savings of $ 2,430 over current nongroup prices .
Conclusion :
The nonpartisan analysis based on information from the C.B.O. shows clearly that for those facing purchase in the nongroup market , the S.F.C. bill will deliver savings ranging from several hundred dollars for the youngest consumers to over $ 8,500 for families .
This is in addition to all the other benefits that this legislation will deliver to those consumers – in particular the guarantee , unavailable in most states , that prices would not be raised or the policy revoked if they became ill .
[ 1 ] The C.B.O. reports that a typical nongroup single plan is projected to cost $ 6,000 in 2016 .
For the family plan for a family of four , I assume the premium is 2.7 times the single premium , as with group insurance .
I assume that there is a 5:1 ratio between premiums for 25 - and 60 - year - olds in the existing nongroup market .
The C.B.O. also reports that a silver plan ( with an actuarial value of 0.70 ) would cost on average $ 5,000 in 2016 .
The Bronze plan has an AV of 0.65 , so the price is 93 percent as high .
I assume that the premium for a 25 - year - old is half that amount and for a 60 - year - old is twice that amount for a total age band of 4:1 .
For the catastrophic premium , I assume and actuarial value of 0.5 .
For a family plan , I assume that the premium is 2.7 times the single premium .

The motto of the Republican Party these days seems to be this :
If you ’re not getting traction opposing something the Obama administration is doing , then make shit up and oppose that .
This was the approach to health care reform and it ’s the approach to cap - and - trade legislation ( which had been the Republican , market - based approach to dealing with climate change until Democrats came on board . )
The Republican and right wing opposition to net neutrality provides yet another example of this .
It ’s not that there are no legitimate grounds to oppose these and other Obama administration positions – libertarians and paleoconservatives have found many – it ’s just that the Republicans and right wing media figures opposing it choose instead to pretend that what is being proposed is some fantastical evil scheme .
In this case , they are pretending that net neutrality is ( a ) a radical change rather than a preservation of the internet as it is ; and ( b ) would create an “ internet czar ” who would “ police content ” and force conservative bloggers and website owners to put liberal content on their websites .
This is not even close to being true !
Network neutrality is an essentially conservative principle – meaning that it seeks to preserve a core principle of the status quo .
( SavetheInternet – a pro-net neutrality group – has a good FAQ page if you ’re unfamiliar . )
Internet service providers ( the companies you pay to be able to get onto the internet ) in seeking to find new ways to make even more money want to not only charge you to get onto the internet , but to charge companies with websites to be able to reach you ( or to be able to reach you quicker . )
Doing this would radically undermine the internet as it is and could easily lead to the entrenchment of any big company willing to pay to best its opponents rather than the company with the best idea .
Net neutrality was a fairly uncontroversial idea as late as 2006 – attracting broad bipartisan support in Congress .
A libertarian / conservative group – the Internet Freedom Coalition – did oppose it – on the theory that the internet already was regulated enough and no further laws were needed ; but the Republican - controlled House Judiciary Committee still passed the 2006 net neutrality bill 20 votes to 13 .
Last summer though , things began to change .
I wrote a piece about how money had begun to flow into John McCain ’s campaign as well as other Republicans as the cable companies and other opponents of net neutrality began to try to gin up some opposition .
McCain himself seemed confused though his campaign had issued a definitive statement saying he was against it ( coincidentally right around the time he started to get money from net neutrality opponents . )
McCain said in an interview to Brian Lehrer after this statement that he went “ back and forth on the issue . ”
In the interview , he seemed genuinely confused as to what the issue even was .
But as the money began to go to various Republican candidates , and as progressives and liberals began to defend net neutrality , the issue became polarized .
Republican and former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell , claimed that net neutrality could lead to the regulation of political speech on the internet , calling it a ‘ Fairness Doctrine for the Internet , ’ which is clearly a Conservative Strawman , as anyone who bothered to do any research about what the meaning of net neutrality was would quickly find out .
Even the Internet Freedom Coalition declines to make this exaggerated claim .
Now , the issue has broken into the news again as the FCC is considering writing rules officially adopting net neutrality rather than invoking it on a case by case basis as it has in the past .
( Unfortunately , I ’m a bit unclear on the distinction being made between guidelines relied upon by the FCC and rules enforced by the FCC . )
And of course , Republicans , having been duly bought and paid for , are now opponents of net neutrality – as rather than conservatively seeking to preserve the structure of the internet , they seek to allow big corporations the freedom to undermine it in any way they find profitable .
John McCain who was so confused by this issue just last year now is a leading opponent , introducing a bill this week to prohibit the FCC from protecting net neutrality or any of the other basic principles underlying the internet as it exists now .
Marsha Blackburn , a House Republican , has officially taken on the role of the Sarah Palin for the net neutrality debate , as she pushes the limits of public dialogue by demagoguing net neutrality and regurgitating the wacky talking point that net neutrality is the “ Fairness Doctrine for the Internet . ”
Perhaps in this storyline you can see what it takes to unhinge the public debate from reality : an interest group with money to burn to concentrate the benefits of government policy and disperse the costs .

THOUSANDS GATHERED at Knock Shrine , Co Mayo , yesterday hoping to see an apparition of Our Lady .
There were ripples of applause from a crowd estimated at more than 5,000 as some people believed they could see the sun shimmering , changing colour and dancing in the sky .
Some people were rapturous afterwards .
Others were highly sceptical .
“ It ’s an optical illusion , pure and simple , ” one sceptic , who did not wish to be named , said .
“ Anybody looking at the bright sun long enough would begin to imagine things . ”
But other pilgrims were adamant that something supernatural , possibly life changing , had occurred .
John Tunney , from Islandeady , Castlebar , said : “ I ’m 53 years old and I never seen the sun go like that before .
I witnessed the sun go all different colours , yellow , red and green .
Then it completely darkened and began shimmering .
Sometimes the sun emitted a clean , bright light , then it would darken again . ”
Mr Tunney ’s wife , Nina , said : “ The sun was spinning in the sky .
I experienced a feeling of total happiness .
It is a feeling I would love to experience again .
It was amazing .
I felt marvellous . ”
Yvonne Rabbitte , from Dunmore , Co Galway , showed other pilgrims a photograph she had taken on her digital camera which showed vivid rays radiating downwards from the sun at the time the image was taken .
Maggie Ahern , from Castlebar , had no doubt that the happenings in Knock were due to “ heavenly intervention ” .
Earlier in the week Dublin - based clairvoyant Joe Coleman predicted Our Lady would appear at the old parish church – scene of the 1879 apparition – at 3 pm .
Quite a number of those present were members of the Travelling community .
The crowds waited in the open air despite an invitation on loudspeaker at about 2.30 pm from Knock parish priest Msgr Joseph Quinn that those in the grounds enter the adjacent Basilica to participate in ceremonies to mark the annual Dominican pilgrimage .
Msgr Quinn was not available for comment last night .

Avi Levy is keen to remain as discreet as possible
By Tim Franks
BBC News , Jerusalem
HAVE SEX , NOT WARS People who work to bring Jews and Arabs together often neither seek nor gain glory .
The projects grind on , in the shadows , on the margins , with little reward .
But Avi Levy 's self - proclaimed work on co-existence is not just handsomely rewarded , it also could not be more out there .
Mr Levy , 49 , is a pornographer .
Eight years ago , along with some business partners , he set up the website Parpar 1 - literally butterfly in Hebrew , but also slang for swinger .
In a saturated market , he believes he has identified a niche : Israeli men and women having " real sex " , as he describes it .
People on the streets get along fine ...
We 're intertwined .
The problems are caused by the leaders , by the extremists .
Our lives are together .
Why not have sex together ?
Avi Levy
Send us your reaction
And , better still , he says , the website offers Arabs and Jews having sex together .
It is at this point in our conversation that the unremarkable Mr Levy , in shorts and flip - fops , on the sofa in his living - room , becomes particularly animated .
He wants to show , he says , " that there are not only wars here , but also love and sex and affection .
People think we walk around with guns all day , but we also make love . "
His own large house is set back from a quiet , leafy road in the city of Raanana .
" If you walk around this city , or ( the nearby predominantly Arab town of ) Umm - al - Fahm , " he continues , " the people on the streets get along fine .
We work with each other ; we eat at each other 's restaurants .
We 're intertwined .
The problems are caused by the leaders , by the extremists .
Our lives are together .
Why not have sex together ? "
His is a small operation .
A website designer by trade , he now also directs and shoots his own films .
The actors are , he says , all willing amateurs : " doctors , engineers , secretaries " .
Mr Levy denies that he is degrading and objectifying women .
" I do n't make anyone do something they do n't want to .
They 're over 18 .
They 're not drug addicts .
It 's their choice .
Many people come not because of the money , but because they 're exhibitionists . "
But there is , clearly , money to be made .
Mr Levy has a spacious and comfortable house , in a posh area of Israel .
Outside , sits his four - wheel drive car .
He will not say how many subscribers he has , nor what the annual turnover is .
He wants to remain as discreet as the website 's billing on credit card statements , which appears as " petrol supplies " .
RUNNER -UP , AGAIN Avi Levy insists that Israel is misconceived abroad .
" We 're seen as an ultra-religious society , with people walking around with guns .
It 's not true .
Go to Tel Aviv. People are normal . "
His words , strangely , chime with those of one of Israel 's prouder exports , the novelist Amos Oz .
For the umpteenth time in recent years , Mr Oz was seen as one of the favourites for the Nobel Literature Prize , which was announced last Thursday ( and which , once again , he failed to win ) .
The day after I spoke to Avi Levy , I listened back to the interview I had had with Amos Oz , five months before , in his house in Arad .
" Israel is often conceived in a very uni-dimensional way , " he said .
" When you watch Israel on the world media , you see 80 % fanatic settlers , 19 % cruel soldiers at the road - blocks , and 1 % wonderful intellectuals like myself who criticise the government and struggle for peace .
" But the truth of it is that Israel is essentially a country of 80 % secular , middle - class , hedonistic , noisy , passionate people who live on the coastal plain and have nothing to with the occupied territories . "
Avi Levy would probably agree with that .
This is a selection of your comments on the diary .
It 's nice to see an article that represents a big chunk of our society .
As an Israeli who often travels abroad , I am amazed at the conception and opinion that people hold of Israel .
It 's usually between a country full of sand and camels and bombs , or religious fanatics - who are an extremely small minority within a population of six million .
We are not a violent culture and we want peace just as much as the families living in Gaza .
Shaul del Monte , Tel - Aviv , Israel
The noisy , passionate middle classes have nothing to do whatsoever with the society they are part of and the government they elect .
Mr Reader , London , UK Israelis are just like other diaspora Jews , open , liberal , creative and fun-loving , Israel is a very sexy country and the society is vibrant creative and very passionate .
Most non-Jewish visitors who go to Israel are shocked at the beauty of the people and the place .
Unfortunately anti-Israeli propaganda and anti-Semitic stereotype images of Jews have painted a false picture of what we Jews are really like .
We are much more Hollywood than Holy - land !
Anonymous I think it 's a great idea !
I often lament our world where death , violence and nationalism are more readily acceptable than universal love , sex and affection .

In 2005 , Jamie Leigh Jones was an employee for a private contractor in Iraq .
She was drugged and brutally raped by her co-workers .
When she reported the crime to her employer , she was imprisoned in a shipping container .
Given no food , water , or medical treatment .
24 hours later , US Embassy agents rescued her .
Her employer destroyed evidence so that she could not file criminal charges .
They claimed that the contract she signed with them meant that she could n't even take them to civil court .
In 2009 , the Senate voted to not fund companies which force their employees to forfeit their rights to sue for sexual assault or harassment .
Thirty Senators voted against this amendment .
All of them republican .
A voice from the floor on illegal immigrants : ' You lie '
One of the most persistent conservative concerns about health care legislation is that it will provide health care to illegal immigrants -- and the heated claim spilled onto the floor of President Obama 's address to a joint session of Congress this evening , where one Republican member called the president a liar for denying it .
" There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants .
This , too , is false - the reforms I 'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally , " President Obama said .
A loud voice from the Republican side of the hall answered , " You lie ! " -- my colleague Glenn Thrush reports it was Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) -- drawing a second " It 's not true , " from Obama and a shake of Nancy Pelosi 's head .
The bill is designed to exclude those immigrants , though some Republicans have called for more explicit bans on funding for illegal immigrants and have claimed the bill will funnel money to illegal immigrants .
FactCheck.org described those claims as " false " and noted that one version of the legislation already includes an explicit bar on federal funding for illegal immigrants ' health care .
BEIJING  A Tibetan exile group in India says that the Chinese authorities have executed four people convicted for their roles in the riots that convulsed Tibet last year .
According to the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy , the four were put to death on Tuesday , more than six months after they were tried and convicted of starting fires in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , that killed seven people .
At least 18 people died in March 2008 during violence that was directed at Han Chinese migrants , whose growing presence in the region has angered many native Tibetans .
Since then at least 84 people have been convicted during trials that rights groups say are opaque , cursory and unfair .
The executions were not announced by the Chinese news media , and a woman who answered the phone at the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People ’s Court hung up when asked to confirm the accounts provided by the exile group .

Hi all , is my first Android application .
It is a proof of concept implementation of a flaw in Windows Vista , which is so far unpatched ( although Microsoft are due to start distributing the patch any moment now ) , that allows a user to send a Blue Screen of Death to that computer over the network .
To test your home , office or clients ' machines , or even just to have some fun with your friends , all you need to do is connect to their network via WiFi , enter in their hostname ( either IP or actual hostname will work ) , and press Execute ! : the target Vista machine ( though most people have it turned on these days ) This is a fun little application I created yesterday and have been having playing with my friends ' computers on their home network and showing them the Windows flaw .
As I said , it will be patched soon , so anyone who has Windows Updates enabled will be immune to it within the next 72 hours or so.can be downloaded from the Android Market ( just search for BSODroid ! ) or alternatively you can download the APK directly from my website : http://www.dereenigne.com/

I 'm so torn right now between being shocked and being incredibly impressed .
Seriously , these guys were damn good at what they did .
They were fast , they were organized , and they were prepared .
They brought enough people to clean the place out fast , they knew exactly how to grab the equipment , they shattered the window and poured in quickly , grabbed , stacked , and left .
How can you NOT be impressed ?
It does n't matter how criminal the act was , they 're still masters of an art .
They also managed to prove Apple 's continual focus on style over substance ( I 'm referring primarily to their displays and not making a commentary on their devices , themselves ) is ill - placed .
It works when the worst thing you risk is a guy in the middle of the day grabbing a single computer and making a run for it .
But clearly a store made of nothing but glass with computers not locked down is now a sure bet for getting your ENTIRE STOCK stolen .
I can all but guarantee there will be copycats , and a lot more will be lost .
So my hats off to human ingenuity and planning , even if sadly placed in a malicious and criminal act .
Wish people like this had better options with which to user their skill and determination .
Students at Boston Arts Academy in Boston use their T - Mobile Sidekicks in February .
On Monday , T - Mobile said owners of Sidekick phones may have lost all the personal data they stored on the phone , including contact numbers , because of a failure of servers operated by Microsoft .
Credit : Charles Krupa / Associated Press .
T- Mobile said today that Sidekick cellphone owners who experienced a significant and permanent loss of personal content will receive a $ 100 customer appreciation card .
The card can be used toward T - Mobile products and services , or a customer ’s T - Mobile bill .
This will be in addition to the $ 50 credit that ’s been given to all Sidekick data customers , the company said .
A server failure last week resulted in a loss of contact numbers , calender entries , to - do lists and photos for some Sidekick users .
The outage affected customers who were enrolled in the Sidekick 's data service provided by Danger , a subsidiary of Microsoft Corp .
“ A subset of Sidekick customers appear to have lost data , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We do not have an exact number , but we believe it is a minority of customers . ”
T- Mobile voice and text services were not affected during the Oct. 2 outage .
Krista Berlincourt , a T - Mobile spokeswoman , said the company told customers last week that there was a temporary data outage and advised them not to reset their phones , remove their battery or let their battery drain completely .
If they did , they were at risk of losing their data , she said .
Sales of Sidekicks were temporarily put on hold , Berlincourt said , even though “ virtually all data services are operational , ” the company said .
“ We have made significant progress this past weekend , restoring services to virtually every customer , ” T - Mobile said in today ’s statement .
“ Microsoft / Danger has teams of experts in place who are working around - the - clock to ensure this stability is maintained . ”
Customers who are looking for updates and more information on the outage are encouraged by T - Mobile to visit the Sidekick Forums online .

Some of the strongest support for health care cooperatives ' place in the national effort to reform the nation 's health care system comes from those who experience a co-op 's care every day : doctors and patients .
Co-op patient Norman Nistler says he did n't even realize he was a part of a health care co-op .
Co-ops are non-profit organizations , so any money that is earned goes back to be used on patients and other costs .
Patients also elect a governing board , which is in stark contrast to operations under private health insurance plan .
Proponents point to two co-ops as evidence they are an alternative in the health care reform debate : HealthPartners in Minneapolis , Minnesota , and Group Health Cooperative in Seattle , Washington .
HealthPartners has been in business for half a century and served more than a million people in Minnesota and Wisconsin .
Some decades - long members said they did n't know they were with a co-op .
" I watch a lot of it on television now .
There 's a lot of talking about co-ops , but I did n't realize this was a co-op , " said patient Norman Nistler .
The co-op was able to save millions , officials note , by switching to generic drugs and cutting tobacco use among its members by double the Minnesota state average because doctors help patients to quit .
Darla Andrews , a patient at the co-op , said she and her doctor have easy access to her records .
" It 's all digital , so it works out good for me .
It 's more convenient . "
Dr. Eric Seaver , who works at Group Health .
" We can communicate with patients through secure e-mail for routine questions or concerns that in the private world physicians often are n't able or wo n't do because there 's just no motivation to do that .
There 's no reimbursement .
...
Here with Group Health 's model , it 's all about providing patients the care that they need when they need it in a form that works best for them . "
Group Health lists Microsoft and Starbucks as organizations that use its system .
" I have great contact with the doctors , " said Group Health member Dave Jacobs .
" I 'm treated like a person , not a number . "
" My care has been absolutely exceptional .
And that 's because I believe I 'm going to a private medical facility , dealing with doctors one - on - one and not a bureaucrat , " he said .
" Part of the great value in that structure is that our patients are actively engaged , not just in the organization and governance but actively engaged in finding ways to engage themselves in their care itself , " said Scott Armstrong , president and CEO of Group Health Cooperative .
" We all know that an engaged patient leads to a better health outcome .
So much of health care is actually the responsibility of us as individuals . "
Aaron Katz , of the University of Washington Health Services , says the group health model could be viable nationally , but only if there are tougher restrictions on insurance companies .
The reason co-ops are successful , he says , is because they employ their own doctors , specialists , pharmacies and can reduce the amount of tests and procedures that drive up costs .
Seaver says his co-op emphasizes evidence - based medicine and making decisions in patient care based upon " the best evidence that we have available for what 's effective and what is ineffective . "
" I think what we 're finding in this model is doing the right thing for the patient is the best thing not just for the patient but also for the system as a whole , " he said .
" I feel like I 'm able to practice medicine the way I had envisioned back in medical school . "
Working at Group Health " has been a breath of fresh air for my career , " he said .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Ed Hornick , Lesa Jansen , Chris Welch and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report .

The Option Arm Armageddon was supposed to strike in the spring of 2009 .
Across the country , option adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) were set to detonate and start a new wave of foreclosures .
But it never happened .
We made it well past when this chart from Credit Suisse showed the option ARMs were supposed to begin to hit .
And the crisis did n't come .
Why not ?
Well , when interest rates dropped to historically low levels as the Fed fought the financial crisis , the wave of resets was held off .
Unfortunately , low interest rates wo n't last forever -- they 'll now likely strike next year and continue well into 2011 .
Many borrowers who now have the option of making payments so low that they do n't even cover the interest are seeing their original loan balance grow , even as their home values continue to fall or remain flat .
The chart below shows that the option ARM reset problem is comparable to the subprime problem , and will likely last for quite some time .
Armageddon may have been forestalled but it has n't been overcome .

Women of Hezbollah is a 50 - minute film directed by Maher Abi Samra .
It takes place between 1996 and 2000 .
Ten years after the last Israeli aggression ( and defeat ) in south Lebanon , reviewing this documentary may sound anachronistic .
But sometimes distance helps to get a more accurate insight about Hezbollah–a major political actor that is unjustly demonized most of the time .
Getting a rational insight , not from experts but from real actors–women who are members of Hezbollah–offers revealing conclusions about the organization ’s true orientations .
In this associative social network of solidarity , women are not simply users or victims –they very often run things .
According to the Lebanese journalist Walid Charara ,
“ women are playing a key role in the Hezbollah since the beginning .
The goal of Hezbollah was not only to create a movement of resistance but also a society of resistance .
It implied to run schools , dispensaries , hospitals , institutes dedicated to the surviving families of martyrs , etc. ” [ sic ]
Abi Samra tells the story of two women , Zaynab and Khadije , whose personal narratives meet the narrative of resistance .
He explores the social aspect of Hezbollah ’s project through the lens of personal stories .
He explains his film started with the meeting of a Zaynab :
“ When I met Zaynab for the first time in 1996 , she was 27 and had an impressive faith .
Her husband Hadi was a fighter of the Hezbollah .
From this meeting , sprung the desire to understand how this movement succeeded within a few years to capture people ’s conscience .
In 1996 , Hezbollah had 12 deputies in the parliament .
This religious party stemmed from the Shia community , one of the 17 communities that made up the Lebanese mosaic .
Its legitimacy was mostly based on its resistance to the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon . ” [ sic ]
Zaynab is the mother of three boys .
The film - makers noticed her willingness to speak her mind freely , “ far from a male ’s official discourse . ”
He follows her in her daily activities with children , through their both serious and funny conversations .
She also shares general reflections about life , most of them being very accurate moral reflections .
She has a strong sense of duty .
When she is asked about how she would react if her husband dies , she remains calm and offers dignified responses , perfectly conscious of what she is bearing on her shoulders .
This aspect of the film contradicts a very common prejudice about how Islamist movements relate to women : as male aggressors towards passive victims .
In this documentary , women are actually empowered by their adhesion to Hezbollah .
They are not afraid of their oppressors ( the Israelis ) and they keep up the resistance .
Khadije tells a memory :
“ I led the demonstration to the prison camp of Al - Ansar , the guardian asked us why we were there .
He asked us : ‘ What are you doing here ? ’
I replied with the same question : ‘ What are you doing here ? ’ (…)
It was really a word of truth in face of a tyrant .
This man was talking to me surrounded by tanks and with 13,000 Israeli soldiers on Lebanese soil .
Of course , I said it and ran away immediately because he starting shooting at us and there was no reason to stay there to die , but deep down I felt an indescribable happiness and I felt very strong . ”
Khadije is the first woman to have been imprisoned in an Israeli camp , which is where she met the director of the film .
One of the first memories she tells is of her mother , who left the house after her father married a second wife .
The children and their mother moved to Beirut , and Khadije–at the age of 10 – had to go to work in a textile factory , from six o’clock in the morning to six o’clock in the evening .
As a consequence , she grew up under three oppressions : patriarchal , capitalist , and colonial ( the expansion of Israel in south Lebanon ) .
“ Before arriving to Beirut , I had never realized that there were Muslims and Christians ” she says .
She adds , “ I only used to distinguish between Jews and Arabs , ” alluding to the context of colonization .
Khadije understood the difference between Muslims and Christians when she heard a neighbor say : “ She ’s a beautiful girl , it ’s a pity she ’s a Muslim . ”
The passage in the film when Khadije finds the factory of her childhood after so many years is simply devastating .
She is walking in the streets of Beirut with her son ( who died as a martyr in 2006 , may Allah bring peace to him ) and when they see the door after so many years , she starts laughing .
But this laughter is mixed with tears and she ends up crying .
The compassion for the poor child she was probably overwhelmed the incredibly dignified woman she became .
It ’s important to keep in mind the centrality of fight against social injustice in these women ’s experiences .
Both of them are from rural and / or working - class backgrounds .
Charara explains :
“ The main objective of Islam is to establish social justice .
In this perspective , the Islamic state is a regulative idea , not something Hezbollah wants to impose to Lebanon .
Taking power from the state comes from a very recent conception , this of a European modern state .
While in Islamic history , you always find a mistrust of theologians who were close friends of the ruling class . ”
This film astutely mixes individual ( and sometimes , very intimate ) memories with Hezbollah ’s regional history .
In this perspective , the personal is definitely political and vice versa .
For example , Khadije describes the experience of her first marriage as an aggression .
“ Suitors came in the village , I faced the fact I had to get married , leave school , work and all the rest , ” she says with a melancholy smile .
The separation of Khadije with her first husband in the late 1960s also coincides with her adhesion to the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , when south Lebanon started to become the theater of confrontation it still is for Palestinian refugees , Lebanese people , and the Israeli army .
Watching this film reminded me of the documentary Flickering Flame , another political film directed by Ken Loach about a dockers ’ strike in Liverpool .
It was subtitled as “ a lesson of morality . ”
One of the dockers ’ wives , maybe the most shy among them , looked right on the eyes of a corrupted trade - unionist and simply said : “ Please do n’t insult the intelligence of the working - class . ”
Zaynab and Khadije ’s testimonies are teaching us the same lesson of dignity that keeps up the fight against social injustice–from a Muslim woman ’s perspective .
At least two stolen dogs were found in an operating room used for dissections at the medical school of South America 's oldest university but its dean has denied hiring dognappers to collect specimens for classes .
Peru's University of San Marcos does not have access to enough human cadavers for its students , so they sometimes cut open dogs instead .
Carmen Valverde 's dog Tomas was stolen by two men while she was walking in the working - class Brena district of Lima and a friend who works at the school 's teaching hospital spotted him by chance in a surgery room where dogs are dissected .
Ms Valverde donned a lab coat and snuck into the hospital to rescue Tomas .
Video her friend shot a week ago , aired on local television , shows the dog sedated , splayed , and strapped to a stainless steel table moments away from the knife .
After local newspapers published the story , other people with missing dogs rushed to the hospital 's door and one owner found her dog , Chico .
" The University of San Marcos still has n't apologised for what it has done , " Ms Valverde said .
Ricardo Rubios , dean of the medical school , acknowledged that stolen dogs had wound up in the surgery room but he said the school only uses strays for classes .
" I assure you we would have returned the dog , " he said .
" All our experimental surgeries are done to dogs that do n't have owners . "
Romila Briones , a member of ASPPA , a Peruvian animal rights group , said the law does not protect strays .
" In Europe , they do n't kill animals for education , they use dummies , " she said .
" Unfortunately , animals are just property in the eyes of the law here , like furniture . "

Reader Lars H. sent this photo of a spectacular crash in Denmark involving a Tesla Roadster .
He did n't provide any details , so we can't tell you what happened or how any of the drivers fared in the collision .
If anyone 's got info , please pass it along .
We 've asked Tesla Motors if it knows anything and will update you if we hear anything .
UPDATE : 7:30 p.m. Eastern : Tesla spokeswoman Rachel Konrad sent us this e-mail :
This was a customer car but the customer was not driving or in the car at the time .
The driver stopped at a red light behind a truck and was hit from behind by a VW Touareg driving at 80 km / hour at the time of impact .
The Roadster driver walked away with minor bruises .
As reader dougdirac notes in the comments below , there 's a thread at Tesla Motors Club and a couple of pictures on Flickr .
According to the information on those two sites , the silver car – a Toyota Avensis – allegedly hit the Touareg , forcing it into the Roadster .
The photo was posted on Flickr by skagman .
UPDATE : 11 p.m. Eastern time :
Got an email from Doug at Tesla Motors Club who says that 's definitely a Toyota Prius , not an Avensis , in the pic .
( Commenters made the same observation . )
The latest word is the Prius allegedly hit the Roadster , pushing it under the Touareg , and Doug notes there a piece of the Roadster jammed under the rear bumper of the Touareg .
We 'll keep you posted if we hear anything more .
I would n't want to be thought of as an unconstructive critic .
I like to think that , while I have been known to liken games to dirty pants , I can always suggest methods of fixing the dirty pants issues .
Like laundering , say .
That would be a good start .
But there 's rarely enough time in a video to pull down every pair of dirty pants on a game and run them through a spin cycle , so here we are again in Extra Punctuation to fill in the blanks .
I had a lot to say about Call of Juarez : Bound in Blood 's frustrating ' showdown ' minigame , so I would like to challenge myself with the question : what would I have done to fix it ?
To be honest , I like the idea , and I appreciate the effort .
It must have been very tempting to just stick in a Quick Time Event .
Wild West showdowns are probably as close to a real - life Quick Time Event as you can get , especially if anyone ever had to pull the trigger of a Walker Colt several times in order to push something heavy .
But no , showdowns in Call of Juarez are practically a science .
You sidestep back and forth to keep the baddie in the centre ( because otherwise your crosshair is n't centered when you draw ) , move your hand with the right analog stick so it does n't touch the holster ( why are n't we allowed to keep our hand on the gun while we wait ?
Bloody cowboys making it difficult for themselves ) , then when a bell rings , move your hand onto the gun and hit ' fire ' when the crosshair travels up to the baddie 's scrotum .
For a while the minigame works and I can even sort of understand having it instead of a boss fights ; in other Western games I 've always had trouble accepting an evil cowboy who can take fifty shots to the face .
What I do n't like is the fact that they use it for every boss fight .
In every single chapter .
It 's not just that it 's repetitive ; with difficulty curves being what they are each one has to be harder than the last , and the only way to do that is to make the baddie draw faster .
By the end of the game they 're doing that whole Gene Wilder in Blazing Saddles thing and you 'll fail over and over again until you memorize the timing .
The other thing is , these are main story baddies .
We hate each other .
They 've spent the entire game chasing us , ruining our lives , sending wave after wave of black - hats to gun us down and cut our throats , and we 've offloaded enough lead in their direction to replace a church roof .
At any other point in the game , we would have killed each other without a second 's thought .
But at the end of each chapter , as predictable as the tides , out comes baddie du jour making up some excuse about how his gammy leg 's hurting and he'd like to do a showdown now .
And I 'm trying to pull the fucking trigger all while he 's talking but my characters have come down with cutscene stupidity .
MANY dour writers have already christened the decade to 2009 a lost one , based on the more or less flat performance of the median household income over that time .
Increasingly , economists are suggesting that there may be another decade yet where that came from .
Not long ago , researchers at the Kansas City Fed wrote a paper ( PDF ) comparing past recessions in America and other rich countries with a particular emphasis on the labour market experience in recessions that occur with financial crises .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , they find that employment declines are deeper in crisis - led recessions and recoveries take significantly longer .
Based on 1 ) the severity of the current American recession and the associated crisis , 2 ) the distressingly rapid rise in the unemployment rate , and 3 ) the fact that labour market recoveries have taken longer in recent recessions , the authors conclude that the unemployment rate may stay elevated for a decade or more .
They envisage scenarios in which unemployment may not dip below 7 % until 2016 .
Now , Stephen Greenhouse , writing at the New York Times , notes that a pair of economists at Rutgers are suggesting the labour market may not fully recover until 2017 .
They point out that in the decade to 2001 ( for many a very prosperous period ) the American economy added around 2.15 million jobs per year , on average .
Applying that rate to the current labour force ( which may be too bold given that from 2001 to 2007 only 1 million jobs were created per year ) , the economy will finally work off its job deficit in late 2017 .
This is troubling stuff .
It is a rare economic expansion that persists for a full 8 years , which means that by the time labour markets are approaching full employment , the business cycle will have once again turned to contraction .
It will be difficult for worker wages to rise with so much persistent slack in the system for so long .
The distressing conclusion seems sure to be that incomes for many workers will stagnate , more or less permanently .
That 's an extremely pessimistic forecast .
I do n't know that I can bring myself to believe it ; the American economy is quite resilient , and the progress of technology continues , constantly creating new growth industries which might one day employ millions of people .
Still , it has been a long time since the American job engine really hummed .
Concern , at any rate , is certainly warranted .

I ’m sure Focus on the Family , the Mormons , and anyone else who supported Proposition 8 ( banning gay marriage in California ) will be thrilled about John Marcotte ‘s amusing petition to get the 2010 California Marriage Protection
Act on the ballot .
The act would ban divorce in the state .
People who supported Prop 8 were n’t trying to take rights away from gays , they just wanted to protect traditional marriage .
That ’s why I ’m confident that they will support this initiative , even though this time it will be their rights that are diminished .
To not support it would be hypocritical .
I do n’t get it … none of the Christian groups are supporting this .
Someone please explain .

Paolo Beltrame from Italy sent us this amazing montage of images he took of space shuttle Discovery docked to the ISS on September 1 , 2009 .
See the incredible details visible of the space station and docked shuttle !
Paolo is with the Circolo AStrofili Talmassons ( Amateur Astronomers Club in Talmassons , or CAST ) who have an impressive observatory ( take a look at Paolo ’s website ) .
He took these selected images from a 2 - minute movie taken with a Tourcam Pro webcam .
As impressive as Paolo ’s astrophotos are , however , he says his real passion is viewing the night sky with the naked eye .
His motto is “ Lasciate che i fotoni vengano a me ! ” ( Let the photons come to me ! )
See a close up of Paolo ’s best shot of the ISS / shuttle below , as well as images from other astrophotographers of Tuesday evening ’s pass of the shuttle and ISS as they flew in tandem after Discovery undocked from the station on Tuesday afternoon .
There ’s also video from the shuttle ’s flyaround .
Below is Kevin Jung ’s image of the ISS and shuttle as they flew in tandem over Grand Rapids , Michigan :
Kevin made it home just in time to take this image , and he said the pair of spacecraft went just below Lyra , and you can make out some of the other things in the field , as well .
Click the image to see more of Kevin ’s handiwork .
And here ’s my feeble attempt to image the tandem flyover from my yard in Illinois :
Can anyone guess what the star in the picture might be ?
Finally , enjoy some video of the shuttle ’s fly - around of the ISS following undocking .
This video just shows the the shuttle due to the lack of Ku band downlink availability .
Video of the station from the orbiter was not available , but we ’ll post it here later if it becomes available .

Monopoly Looms on Electronic Voting
While we ’ve been concentrating on the healthcare debate , the economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , another story important to American democracy has gotten inadequate attention : a single company is poised to monopolize the counting of over 75 percent of the nation ’s votes .
Email
Printer friendly Earlier this month , Election Systems & Software ( ES&S ) , which counted roughly 50 percent of the ballots in the last four major U.S. elections , purchased Diebold ’s electronic voting unit , Premier Election Solutions , which controls roughly a third of the voting machine market .
The merger of these two companies has set off alarm bells , and not just in the voting activist community .
Hart InterCivic , a competitor in the voting machine market , has filed a lawsuit seeking a federal court injunction to block the merger as an antitrust violation and a threat to “ the integrity of the voting process in the United States . ”
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - New York , wrote Attorney General Eric Holder requesting that the Antitrust Division review the deal for possible violations .
Schumer ’s letter referenced a Congressional Research Service report from 2003 which indicated that having a diversity of systems and vendors might decrease the likelihood of widespread election fraud .
The cloistered nature of the electronic voting industry also is underscored by the fact that Diebold Election Systems was once run by Bob Urosevich , who in 1979 along with his brother Todd founded American Information Systems , which was later renamed ES&S .
Though Diebold took the brunt of the criticism for voting machine problems in recent years , other vendors also faced serious challenges , including ES&S .
In 2007 , Deborah Bowen , Secretary of State in California , sued ES&S for $ 15 million for selling uncertified voting machines to several California counties .
( Bowen accepted a $ 3.25 million settlement from ES&S last January . )
Yet , because Diebold ’s brand was so tarnished with revelations of serious bugs in its voting software , the company carved out its voting unit and renamed it in hopes of distancing the brand from the voting problems .
But Diebold continued to lose money and faced several lawsuits over voting matters .
The sale transfers future liability to ES&S , a move that won praise on Wall Street .
A Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst sent a letter to clients saying the sale was “ long overdue ” and a “ huge relief . ”
Still , the concentration of the industry -- represented by ES&S 's purchase of Diebold 's election unit -- raises other concerns for the American public , including an increased potential for nationwide voting manipulation .
Many people still have the impression that counting votes by computer makes it harder for people to commit voter fraud .
That ’s simply not true because the computer is n’t counting your votes ; a programmer is .
A computer ca n’t have a bias .
But a programmer , being human , can , and does .
Traditional ballot box stuffing requires a number of people to produce election - altering results .
But , theoretically at least , rigging a national election electronically would require only a few people if a single company controls nearly three - quarters of the counting .
And no matter what you see on the voting screen when you tap on your favored candidate , the computer ’s memory can be storing something completely different .
Indeed , without a paper trail and effective auditing , you really have no way of knowing if your vote was recorded accurately .
For this reason , voting on “ Direct Recording Electronic ” ( DRE ) machines , usually presented with touchscreen ballots , is a dangerous idea .
Other proposals for voting by phone or over the Internet would introduce even more unaccountability into the electoral process .
That ’s why Rep. Rush Holt , D - New Jersey , has proposed legislation that would require not only paper ballots , marked and verified by the voter , but also a manual audit — a handcount of 100 percent of the paper ballots in some randomly chosen precincts — to verify that the machine count accurately reflects what was recorded by the voters on paper .
Without a paper record that is not only stored , but examined , there is no way to know if the votes have been counted as cast .
Election 2000 in Florida , where George W. Bush emerged as the declared winner despite a plurality of Floridians casting ( or trying to cast ) their ballots for Al Gore , pointed out the problems with using punch - cards for ballots .
But the cure may have been worse than the disease .
At least with punch - cards , there was something to recount .
With an electronic , i.e. , digital , record , all you will find is what the programmer wanted you to find , be it accurate or inaccurate .
And digital records can be altered after the fact , sometimes undetectably .
So American democracy appears to be facing a serious crisis , as a single company puts itself in position to count the majority of America ’s votes while safeguards still do n’t exist to protect against computer manipulation that could swing an election .
But wait .
There ’s more .
It ’s not just a monopoly .
It ’s a partisan monopoly .
In 2003 , The Independent ran an article by Andrew Gumbel titled “ All the President ’s Men ” which opened with this warning : “ A quiet revolution is taking place in US politics .
By the time it 's over , the integrity of elections will be in the unchallenged , unscrutinized control of a few large — and pro-Republican — corporations . ”
The article outlined the problems with trusting elections to corporations , and ended with a quote from voting rights activist Roxanne Jekot : “ Corporate America is very close to running this country .
The only thing that is stopping them from taking total control are the pesky voters .
That 's why there 's such a drive to control the vote .
What we 're seeing is the corporatization of the last shred of democracy . ”
Remember that Diebold ’s former president Wally O’Dell became famous for a remark in which he pledged to do all he could to give Ohio to George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election .
Was Bush ’s favorable showing there a coincidence ?
We were not given the opportunity to verify that result because the Republicans blocked recount demands .
Diminishing democracy – or even public faith in democracy – can have a ripple effect through all the other issues that confront the nation .
If we lose our vote , we ca n’t address healthcare in a way that meets the interests of most Americans .
If we lose our vote , no one will care what we feel about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
If we lose our vote , there is also little hope that we will get it back because we lack a strong enough independent media to fight for democracy .
That is why the clock is ticking for passing significant election reform legislation .
The 2010 midterm elections are right around the corner .

1. Library of Ages at Central California .
The fog settled in after another nice sunset along the central California coast .
The rock layers which record the geologic history of Montana De Oro State Park just south of Big Sur , can be read like books in an ancient library .
A long exposure isolated the rock by smoothing the large surf .
Indeed , the photos is very naturally magnificent .
2. Big Sur , Portal of the Sun .
This photo is a winner in the 2009 Nature ’s Best Ocean Views competition .
A print will hang in the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC for a year !
This sea arch opening in a cliff face at Pfeiffer Beach in Big Sur allows large waves to come through at high tide before a big storm .
The waves often fill the entire portal to the top , and the portal becomes a giant water shotgun !
The Tufoni formations in the rock are incredible and should be seen in person .
3. Maelstorm Kauai at Hawaii .
The lava - ledge is 20 feet above the sea , and the incoming wave is twice that height .
This is not the Sprouting Horn near Poipu and it is not Queen ’s bath !
It is called the Mokolea Lava Pools and this is indeed a near - death experience for the photographer .
Solute !
4. Shores of Eternity at Big Sur , California .
This timeless place was begging for the long exposure treatment .
This little cove is one of many dozens of lesser - known and hard to reach places along the Bug Sur coast .
It is heavily guarded by steep cliffs , and lots of poison oak , which produces a bad skin rash to those that are allergic to the oils in the leaves and stems .
This wallpaper is very well - done .
5. Bird Rock at Point Lobos California .
Being close to the “ Library of the Ages ” , the Bird Rock is just another stunning nature attraction for the tourists and also photographers .
6. Trade Winds at Isla Mujeres , Mexico .
On this stretch of coastline on Isla Mujeres , the trade winds blow constantly , sending clouds and storms from Africa and keeping temperatures moderate .
These rocks were under the sand until hurricane Wilma scored a direct hit on this area with wind gusts exceeding 200 mph .
Aww scary .
7. La Jolla – Sandstone and Sky .
The sun rises over La Jolla California .
The symmetery of the stones is adding harmony to the wallpaper .
I love this wallpaper .
8. Pigeon Point Evening Lighthouse .
Evening comes to the Pigeon Point Lighthouse , on the San Mateo count coast near San Francisco .
Pigeon Point is home to large numbers of pelicans year round .
It really should be called Pelican Point .
9. Needles and a Haystack at Cannon Beach , Oregon .
Canon Beach in Northern Oregon is an exceptionally wide , long and flat beach with a number of large rock islands and sea stacks offshore .
Low tide is often the best time to see it because you can get closer to the rocks and the sand is glossy and smooth both for walking and for photography .
For two short minutes , the sun illuminated this scene against a dark sky .
This is indeed a very rare moment for photographers .
10 . Trinidad Surf at Humboldt Country California .
When the wave hits the rock , the whole beach echoed with the sound of monsterous entity .
I really wished that the photo will come together with the sound .
11 . Ray of Light at Mount Diablo California .
A final ray of light burst through the clouds on Mt. Diablo , 20 miles inland from San Francisco .
A mid-winter storm provided some much needed rain and some much needed atmosphere too !
12 . Yosemite National Park .
It is amazing how this scene is just handed to you on a silver platter .
The green is so significant that the photographer can’t avoid to take a shot on the landscape .
13 . Maui Red .
The red sand beach is just outside of Hana and is rather difficult to get to at high tide , especially in the dark before sunrise .
The old path was washed away by a landslide and the waves at high tide make it difficult to run across the beaches between waves .
14 . Point Lobos , Pinnacle Rock .
Point Lobos , at the north end of Big Sur just south of Carmel , California could keep a photographer busy for months or even years .
The sun peeks under the fog deck at sunset to illuminate the sea .
It is a peninsula that has been sculptured by large Pacific waves over millions of years and the results are stunning .
This is one of the western - most points of rock and is probably 50 feet tall at high tide .
Sometimes waves wash over the entire rock .
15 . Big Sur , Garrapata Surf .
Large waves were rolling the cobblestones on the shoreline of Garrapata State Park , Big Sur , California .
Too bad photographs cannot capture sound as an extra element .
The cobblestones made quite an impressive sound as they rolled around in the large surf .

The movie A Beautiful Mind contains a memorable transition : the mathematician John Nash ( played by Russell Crowe ) rides his bicycle in an infinity sign , which slowly solidifies into part of a mathematical formula from the next scene .
Watching the movie the other day , there occurred to me another way to effect this transition .
Imagine John juggling the basic three ball pattern .
Then the balls in this pattern automatically trace an infinity sign ...
Hit your escape key if you are sick of seeing me juggle ( Firefox and IE ) .
It would have been natural for John Nash to be attracted to juggling : in real life many mathematically inclined people find the pure and tight patterns of juggling as irresistible as those of mathematics .
In fact , it is likely that the majority of readers of Plus magazine know how to juggle three balls , and that quite a few can juggle at a semi-professional level .
As with any real mathematician , John sees mathematics everywhere .
We see him drawing on library windows , and trying to capture the mathematics of real - life scenarios : the feeding patterns of pigeons ; a mugging ; dating .
Let 's imagine what John might have discovered about juggling if observing that infinity had led him to ponder further .
Juggling numbers
John juggles to a regular beat , with his left and right hands taking turns catching and tossing at most one ball on a given beat .
Each tossed ball travels for a certain number of beats before returning to hand .
Then , since juggling patterns eventually repeat , recording these beat numbers produces a periodic sequence .
For example , the basic three ball pattern above has sequence ... 3,3,3,3,3 ... , or simply 3 .
By comparison , three balls juggled in a circle has sequence ...
5,1,5,1,5,1,5,1 ... , or simply 5,1 .
Mathematical jugglers refer to strings of numbers such as 3 and 5,1 asor .
Juggling sequences are for juggling what musical scores are for music .
There are a number of excellent , freely available computer programs , which can juggle any conceivable pattern .
Below is an incarnation of the Java based simulator Juggling Lab by Jack Boyce .
Choose a sequence from the list on the left , and then watch a virtual juggler perform it for you .
( Click on the juggler to stop and start the animation .
Moving the mouse around while clicking on the juggler will rotate the view of the juggler . )
All the juggling sequences mentioned in this article , and many more , are listed .

I recommend playing with this simulator for a while before reading on .
A standalone program , with many more features , can be downloaded here .
To discover what is possible in terms of simulating multiple jugglers manipulating chainsaws while riding unicycles in 3D , have a play with JoePass ! by Wolfgang Westerboer , or Jongl by Werner Riebesel .
Back to John , who 's trying to figure out whether his favourite sequence 5,0,1 is a juggling sequence ( " favourite " because John is also a " 501 darts " fan ) .
To do this he draws a diagram — on a library window , of course .
This diagram consists of a row of equally spaced dots , representing the beats on a timeline , and labelled with the corresponding throw durations .
A dot labelled with 0 means no ball is thrown on that beat .
From each dot with a positive number he draws an arc , extending that number of dots to the right .
This is a juggling sequence .
There is now a simple test of whether the diagrammed sequence is a juggling sequence : on every beat either nothing happens , or exactly one ball lands and is then tossed again immediately .
Also , for a juggling sequence , the arcs join to form exactly as many curves as there are balls being juggled .
This all tells us , for example , that 5,0,1 is jugglable and that we need two balls to juggle it .
Next , John checks whether 1,2 is jugglable .
This is not a juggling sequence .
In order to juggle 1,2 , John would have to catch two incoming balls in one hand on every second beat .
Moreover , John would need to have balls mysteriously materialise and vanish .
None of this is possible within our simple juggling formulation , and therefore 1,2 is not a juggling sequence .
An algebraic juggling detector
Is 100000 , 1,1 a juggling sequence ?
Fancy drawing gazillions of dots and arcs ?
Obviously , nobody but a mathematician such as John would really care whether this monster sequence can ( in theory ) be juggled .
However , there is a very good point to asking this kind of question .
By taking things to extremes it is often possible to uncover shortcomings in ones understanding of what is going on .
In this case , John 's graphical method turns out to be inadequate for dealing with extreme sequences .
Not satisfied , he digs deeper and succeeds in distilling the essence of his graphical method into a very simple algorithm .
Suppose we want to determine whether 4,4,1,3 is jugglable .
We create a second sequence , by adding 0,1,2,3 to the elements of the first sequence .
This gives 4 , 5 , 3 , 6 .
Then ( buckle your seat belts ) , we form a third sequence whose elements are the remainders of the elements of the second sequence when divided by the length of the original sequence .
Our sequence has length 4 , and so the new sequence is 0,1,3,2 .
It turns out that the original sequence is a juggling sequence exactly if this final sequence consists of distinct numbers .
That is true for the sequence 0,1,3,2 , and so 4,4,1,3 really is a juggling sequence .
The monster 100000 , 1,1 is as well , as you can check .
( You can find out why this works in the articles and books listed below ) .
Also , it turns out that the number of balls necessary for juggling a sequence is simply its average .
So , we need ( 4+4+1+3 ) / 4 = 3 balls to juggle 4,4,1,3 , and it takes 3334 balls to juggle the monster .
Usually jugglers write 4413 instead of 4,4,1,3 .
This makes sense , as long as it is understood that all the digits stand for different throws .
To be able to record throws of greater than nine beats it is common to let A stands for 10 , B for 11 , and so on .
Of course , to a playful mathematical mind this immediately invites one to check whether their name is jugglable .
In fact , people have checked all the words in the dictionary for jugglability .
It turns out that very few real words are jugglable , though curiously both " theorem " and " proof " are .
Which do you think is harder , to come up with a conjecture for a theorem or to prove it ?
Well , our virtual juggler thinks that " proof " is harder than " theorem " , because it takes 23 balls to juggle the first word , whereas " only " 21 are required to juggle the second .
A graphical juggling generator
A juggling state diagram .
After making these discoveries ( and cursing fate that his name is not jugglable ) , John has been spending countless hours practising , and analysing juggling patterns .
He can now juggle any three ball sequence , as long as it only contains throws of at most 5 beats .
He has also figured out a neat way to generate all of these sequences , based on the following " simple " ( for him ) .
Time for some more graffiti on those remaining library windows ...
The diagram above contains all three ball juggling sequences with throws that last at most 5 beats .
Here is how we extract them .
Starting at any of the rectangles , we follow any path of arrows , recording the numbers in the orange circles along the way .
Once we return to the beginning rectangle , the string of recorded numbers is a juggling sequence .
For example , beginning at the brown rectangle and walking along the red , green , and purple loops produces the juggling sequences 3 and 4,4,1 and 5,5, 1,5,0,5,3,0 .
We can also combine the red and green loops into a longer loop that visits the brown rectangle twice , giving the juggling sequences 4,4,1,3 .
Importantly , even if you are familiar with the two patterns 4,4,1 and 3 , the combined pattern 4,4,1,3 will look and feel completely different .
Peeking into a beautiful mind
Why does this work ?
Let 's rewind , to the moment when John gains the inspiration for his diagram .
We see him practising an incredibly complicated three ball pattern , when suddenly a heckler shouts " Is that all you can do ? "
This triggers a brainstorm similar to the one in , when the beautiful blonde enters the bar .
Time stands still , in between two beats , and we see the three balls suspended in the air .
With the balls suspended , John is muttering to himself , trying to determine his throw options for the next beat .
" There are three balls in the air , and they are scheduled to land in 1 , 3 , and 4 beats from now .
This means that on the next five beats there are scheduled to be 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 balls landing .
So , I am currently in the juggling state 10110 . "
" On the next beat I catch the red ball , corresponding to the first 1 .
This means that on the following five beats there are 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 balls scheduled to land .
Consequently , if I want to avoid collisions , I can only choose between throws of 1 , 4 , and 5 beats duration , corresponding to the positions of the 0s in this last sequence .
If I decide on a 4 beat throw , then I have to replace the 0 in the fourth position by a 1 and my new juggling state becomes 01110 .
If I go for a 1 beat throw , my juggling state changes to 11100 , and if I perform a 5 beat throw my state becomes 01101 . "
Brilliant !
This calculation demonstrates the connection between the original state 10110 and the three arrows leading from it to the states 01101 , 11100 and 01110 .
Repeating the same for all possible states gives the complete juggling state graph .
It should be clear that by juggling along the arrows of this juggling state graph , on each beat either nothing happens or exactly one ball lands and is immediately tossed again .
This is exactly what we want to ensure .
Only if we complete a loop , can we be sure that we can repeat the numbers we come across over and over again , which is necessary for a sequence of numbers to be jugglable .
In fact , it is fairly easy to see that all the three ball juggling sequences that John can juggle correspond to loops in his state graph .
So , constructing the state graph for a given number of balls and given limits on the duration of throws is a completely automatic task and can be performed easily by a computer .
Similarly , finding loops in graphs is a routine exercise for a computer .
To infinity and beyond
What John has discovered so far is all he 'll ever need to recognise juggling patterns , communicate juggling patterns effectively , come up with complete lists of juggling patterns satisfying various real - life constraints , and even program one of these amazing juggling simulators .
So , does he stop here ?
No , for our mathematician there still remain many intricate and unanswered questions , going well beyond the immediately applicable .
Let 's see what might happen if he follows his mathematical nose .
Consider John 's three ball jugging diagram above .
There are infinitely many ways to choose a loopy journey in the diagram , corresponding to infinitely many ways of juggling three balls .
However , there are only 26 loops that visit no rectangle more than once .
Examples are the red , green and purple loops highlighted earlier .
Similar to the manner in which numbers factor into primes , all possible loopy journeys are composed from these 26 prime loops .
For example , the juggling sequences 3 , and 441 are prime , but 4413 is not .
In the later part of A Beautiful Mind , John Nash is working on the Riemann hypothesis which is one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics today .
It is all about the distribution of prime numbers .
It would have been great fun if the film makers had John make progress towards this difficult problem , by discovering a connection between prime numbers and prime juggling sequences .
This is not as far - fetched as it may sound .
It turns out that the mathematics of juggling really has many exciting connections with other areas of mathematics .
This includes the theory of knots , combinatorics , linear algebra , and permutation groups .
Back on Earth
At this point we leave our fictitious hero John to his musings and wrap up with a few remarks that connect our story with juggling reality .
The earliest historical evidence of juggling is a 4000 year old wall painting in an ancient Egyptian tomb .
In real life , juggling sequences were developed independently by at least three groups around 1985 .
Juggling state graphs were discovered in 1988 by Jack Boyce who is also the author of Juggling Lab featured above .
This article is only intended to be an introduction to the basics of the mathematics of juggling .
In particular , there are ways of juggling multiple objects with one hand , and with both hands simultaneously .
It is even possible for a number of jugglers to pass props back and forth between them .
They can even juggle themselves while they are doing so , by moving around in intricate patterns .
All these more complicated scenarios can be investigated with extensions to the simple mathematical model presented here .

Telstra 's fixed line revenue is dropping
The Australian government has strengthened its demand for the country 's biggest telephone company , Telstra , to break up .
Telstra is being asked to split its retail operations from its wholesale network .
The government says this would help in the roll - out of a national broadband network worth A$ 43bn ( $ 30bn , £ 20.9 bn ) .
The government has been warning of a major regulatory shakeup of the telcoms industry .
" It is the government 's clear desire for Telstra to structurally separate , on a voluntary and cooperative basis , " said Communications Minister Stephen Conroy .
Telstra has not yet responded to the demand .
Cable tangle
Telstra was a state - owned monopoly before it went mostly private in 2006 .
It owns the country 's aging copper telecommunications network .
This could be made redundant as the government pursues its plan for super - fast broadband across the country .
Roll - out of this new network would go faster if existing telecommunications providers folded into it .
Legislation underpinning the network was unveiled by Mr Conroy and is to be submitted to parliament .
It gives stronger powers to Australia 's competition watchdog and bars Telstra from additional wireless spectrum until separation is completed .
The plans will also force Telstra to sell off its cable network and interests in pay TV arm Foxtel , and prevent it from acquiring additional mobile spectrum .
Telstra shares slumped shortly after the announcement .
Profits drop
Last month , the new chief executive of Telstra , David Thodey , downgraded earnings targets despite a 10 % rise in profits over the year to June .
Telstra 's mobile operations have been doing well but profits on fixed line business is dropping .
Mr Thodey said in August that Telstra was " engaging constructively " with Canberra on the new nationwide network plan .
But he added that Telstra also had a duty to look after shareholders .

Many of the fraudsters use internet cafes
Nigeria 's anti-corruption agency says it has shut down some 800 fraudster e-mailers and arrested those behind 18 high - profile " cyber crime syndicates " .
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said it has been working with the computer giant Microsoft to crack down on the scammers .
EFCC head Farida Waziri said her agency was now using " smart technology " rather than raids on internet cafes .
Correspondents say Nigeria is seen as a centre for web scams and spam e-mails .
It will take Nigeria out of the top 10 list of countries with the highest incidence of fraudulent e-mails
EFCC head Farida Waziri
Cyber crime has remained a big challenge to Nigeria 's security agencies despite efforts made in recent years to counter it .
The con tricks - known as " 419 scams " after the penal code that outlaws them in Nigeria - are often run by well - organised gangs .
According to an EFCC statement , Ms Waziri said the new operation , called " eagle claw " , would be fully operational within six months .
" It will take Nigeria out of the top 10 list of countries with the highest incidence of fraudulent e-mails , " she said .
Speaking at her weekly press conference just off the House floor moments ago , Speaker Nancy Pelosi made her most impassioned argument in weeks , for including a public option in comprehensive health care reform legislation , arguing against the idea , favored by some conservative Democrats , of mandating that people buy health insurance , and then throwing them into what she called the " lion 's den " of the private insurance industry .
In so doing , Pelosi came closer than any member of the Democratic leadership has thusfar to suggesting that the individual mandate should be conditional on the inclusion of a public option .
Although it 's been clear for months that the House health overhaul bill would likely include a public plan , its design remains unsettled .
However , the stronger version favored by liberals — one that would use reimbursement rates to providers based on Medicare rates — appears to be gaining favor .
Pelosi favors that version though she said a final decision had n't been made .
Our Speaker also has some words for the folks who egged on the " Town Hall Tantrums " :
She also said the House was now considering adding to its health care bill a $ 6.7 billion - a - year fee on insurance companies that is part of the Senate Finance package .
" There are some things we'd like to see happen to the insurance companies that they might not like , " Pelosi said .
The AP article notes the various " compromises " being weighed by Reid and his RepubliCrat masters , and while Pelosi will not comment on supporting or opposing ( note how the AP article muddles up the syntax : " out or in " ) it seems fairly clear that her intent is go full - bore so as to bend the final legislation as much towards a robust public option as the House possibly can .
That is about as much as we could hope to expect from the House , and it's a good sign that this is where the goalposts will be set .
" I want to send our conferees to the table with the most muscle for the middle class , " she said .
Amen to that .
“ If you wander around anywhere in Japan for a little bit , ” writes blogger Cabel Sasser , “ you will come across something interesting .
Providing even more evidence for the veracity of that statement , as if more were needed , is the Kashiwa Mystery Cafe in southern Japan .
What ’s so unusual about this restaurant ?
Well , I ’ll let Cabel Sasser explain it : “ At this cafe , you get what the person before you ordered .
The next person gets what you ordered . ”
What a wonderful , bizarre idea ( especially if you ignore the unresolved question of what the first customer of the day receives . )
When you order , say , an ice cream and coffee , you pay for them and find a seat .
In a few minutes , you ’re called to the counter where you pick up , you guessed it , not an ice cream and coffee .
You receive whatever the person before you in line ordered .
% Gallery - 6477 %
So what ’s to keep people from ordering an inexpensive item and hoping the person before them was a high - roller ?
Well , I guess shame .
Also , the cafe has a few rules .
Among them :
Treat the next person .
What to treat them with ?
It ’s your choice .
No buying twice in a row .
Please enjoy what you get , even if you hate it .
( If you really , really hate it , quietly give it to another while saying , “ It ’s my treat … ” )
Like the long tables at German beer halls where sitting with strangers is expected , this is an idea that Sasser says “ encouraged communication between total strangers or , in this case , members of the Kashiwa community and a couple of weird guys from Oregon . ”
He says it “ forced one to ‘ let go ’ , just for a brief moment , of the total control we ’re so used to exerting through commerce .
It led you to taste something new , that you might not normally have ordered .
It was a delight . ”
Read about the experience here .
Justice John Paul Stevens , who will turn 90 next year , has given a hint that this Supreme Court term will be his last , potentially clearing the way for a second appointee from President Obama next summer .
Stevens , like most of the justices , hires new law clerks a year in advance , and he confirmed that he had hired only one for fall 2010 , not the usual contingent of three or four .
Retired justices have one clerk .
Stevens has not said he will step down next year , and he could hire extra clerks in the months ahead .
But his early hiring plans , which were first reported by the Associated Press , set off speculation that he had already decided to retire .
This year , the first clear hint of Justice David H. Souter ’s retirement came in the news that he had not hired a full set of law clerks .
Advertisement
Stevens , a Chicago native and an appointee of President Ford , has been the leading voice of the court ’s liberal wing for nearly two decades .
In the 1980s , he argued in dissent for ending the death penalty for defendants who were mentally disabled or under age 18 at the time of their crimes .
He eventually won majorities for both views .
He also was an early champion for gay rights , and he played a key role in a 2003 decision that struck down state laws that criminalized sex between gays or lesbians .
Stevens , the court ’s last veteran of World War II , also was instrumental in four decisions that rejected President George W. Bush ’s prison policy at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and gave detainees there a right to plead for their release before a federal judge .
Stevens is the second oldest justice in the court ’s history .
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. retired just two months short of his 91st birthday .
Stevens turns 90 in April .
Advertisement
But there is no outward sign that Stevens has slowed or can no longer keep up with the work .
On the contrary , he is one of the few justices who writes a first draft of all his opinions and dissents , instead of relying on clerks .
And in the courtroom , he asks probing questions of the lawyers .
If Stevens were to retire next summer , the ideological balance would probably not change .
Obama could select a nominee to replace Stevens with the confidence that Democrats have a solid majority in the Senate .
In May , the president interviewed Judge Diane P. Wood from Chicago , U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano before choosing Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
Another possible candidate for a Supreme Court seat would be former University of Chicago and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein , who was chosen by Obama to head a regulatory affairs office in the White House .

How did the Belarusians come to rebellion against the dictatorship by Pramen
Report from 8th General Assembly of Autonomous Action
Russian libertarian communist organization
The setting of the assembly
Earlier this year , Anarkismo.net decided to send a delegate , as an observer representing the organizations which run the Anarkismo project , to the 8th annual conference of Autonomous Action ( AD ) , a libertarian communist organization with branches across Russia , Belarus and the Ukraine .
Present at the conference were delegates from 12 different branches of AD , together with observers from the Union of Autonomous Youth and the youth wing of the Siberian Federation of Labour .
The conference was held at a secret location in the Ural Mountains where a campsite was set up from resources laboriously carried uphill over a 6 - hour hike .
This was a necessary precaution police attention and in addition provided economical conference accommodation in a country were poverty is widespread .
Report from 8th General Assembly of Autonomous Action
This year I was privileged to attend the 8th annual conference of Autonomous Action , an anarchist group with branches across Russia , Belarus and the Ukraine as an observer representing the Anarkismo project .
The conference was held at a secret location in the Ural Mountains where a campsite was set up from resources laboriously carried uphill over a 6 - hour hike .
This was a necessary precaution police attention and in addition provided economical conference accommodation in a country were poverty is widespread .
The campsite was beautiful ; nestled in unspoilt conifer forest teeming with wildlife , much of it unfortunately of the insect variety .
The comrades were the most fantastic hosts , going out of their way again and again to make me feel welcome , introduce me to people , find me translators , put me up in their homes before and after the conference and generally take very good care of me during my stay .
During the lengthy journey to the campsite the comrades were able to explain something of the recent history of Russian Anarchism to me which I found very interesting .
After having been totally crushed by the Bolshevik movement following the Russian Revolution , Anarchists in Soviet Russia faced the task of rebuilding a movement from scratch in the 1980s when Mikhail Gorbachevs policy of Perestroika once again permitted political opposition .
This was no easy task given that the number of living anarchists in a country larger than Europe could literally be counted on one hand .
The first task of anarchists in the eighties was therefore propaganda initiatives to inform others of the anarchist philosophy .
As in other countries , the anarchist movement has been influenced by sub cultural movements such as punk .
The environmental movement has also been a large influence .
In particular the Rainbow Keepers , a Russian equivalent of Earth First active in the 1990s was influenced by anarchist ideas and organisational principles and has been instrumental in popularising anarchist ideas amongst activists .
Coordination of groups leading to the formation of Autonomous Action began around 2000 , as an attempt to organise the diffuse elements of anarchist activity into a federation capable of defending itself and coordinating in a more organised way .
Autonomous Action now has around 120 members .
12 branches sent delegates to the General Assembly representing Tyumen , Ufa , Nizhni Novgorod , Moscow , Irkutsk , Magnitogorsk , Novosibirsk , Barnaul , and Minsk .
In addition two new groups based in Cheboksary and Kazan were admitted to the federation during the assembly and an individual member attended from St. Petersburg .
Also attending as guests were the Union of Autonomous Youth , the youth wing of the Siberian Federation of Labour , a syndicalism union with approximately 6000 members , mainly in air traffic control , healthcare and public transport .
48 individuals were present in total .
Within the Autonomous Action , individuals and groups must agree to abide by the manifesto and organisational principles .
A proposal passed during the conference also requires members to refrain from publicly voicing opinions that contradict agreed AD positions .
Beyond this , groups have a large degree of autonomy to adapt their activity to local conditions .
Joint projects and Campaigns are decided through conference but participation by local groups is not compulsory .
Resolutions on joint activity have the status of recommendations .
The conference resolved several joint projects including the publication of a how to activist guide and a national campaign against the Centre for the Prevention of Extremism , a national police initiative targeting activists .
Decisions are made on a national level in three ways : by a vote or the reaching of consensus between group delegates , by conference or by a referendum of members .
Delegates councils are held every two weeks using the internet .
Each group is expected to meet regularly in order to discuss the agenda and mandate a delegate .
The delegates council have limited powers compared to the conference , for example they are not able to change any rules , or admit collective members or expel members .
Conference makes decisions by consensus if possible and by 2 /3rds vote if not .
Members not present can send mandates .
The referenda of members allows decisions to be taken on any important issues that come up between conferences .
They can be initiated by any group and decided within one month .
As with conference consensus is sought first .
The period allowed for attempting to reach a consensus is one month after which a 2 /3rds majority vote is accepted .
This period is shorter than previously as the spread of the internet across the region has now reached the point where all groups have at least one member who is able to obtain internet access .
This is improving the efficiency of decision making .
The conference began each morning with physical training .
Im ashamed to say I never found out what this involved , considering that the hike up the mountains on the first day was quite physical enough and preferring to spend my mornings dipping my feet lazily in the river .
The programme then continued with discussion on various subjects often lasting well into the night .
Topics included Anti Fascism , Anarchist Black Cross , the economic crisis and training in how to deal with the police .
There was also decision making on national proposals .
These were mostly of an administrative nature but also included a proposals for a shared programme of action .
There was also discussion of strategy and the direction Autonomous Action should take in the future .
A large amount of the conference was given over to reports from each group on their activity and the situation in their region , followed by discussion and suggestions .
This provided an extremely interesting overview of activity and an insight into the working culture of Autonomous Action .
I was impressed by the respectful and comradely tone of discussions and the willingness of participants to listen to constructive criticism .
The overwhelming majority of the groups gave significant time in their reports to an account of antifascist and Anarchist Black Cross Activity .
The fascist movement in the region is very large although the exact numbers are obscure as many fascists are organised in a decentralised fashion into street gangs .
The neo nazi movement adopts a radical rather than a parliamentary approach and aims at establishing superiority on the street and crushing political opposition as a precursor to seizing state power .
The popular slogan  Russia for the Russians is given effect by regular attacks on migrants .
The existence of these movements clearly necessitates a militant response from the anarchist movement .
Comrades reported that violence is escalating , frequently involving the use of knives where previously only fists had been used .
Nationally , 9 comrades have been killed by fascists in the last few years : Nikolay Girenko , Timur Kacharava , Aleksandr Ryukhin , Stanislav Korepanov , Ilya Borodaenko , Fyodor Filatov , Stanislav Markelov , Anastasia Baburova and Ilya Dzhaparidze .
Of these , Timur Kacharava and Ilya Borodaenko and Anastasia Baburova were anarchists , and Ilya and Anastasia also members of Autonomous Action .
There is a great deal of racism in wider society against people from the Caucasus and central Asia which the fascists are able to exploit .
One comrade told me that more people would probably be involved in fascist movements were it not for the fact that the soviet years had engendered a sense of cynicism towards political expression of any sort !
Only a few groups were able to report superiority on the streets or progress in preventing the fascists from organising .
The more common anarchist experience is of being outnumbered locally by fascists .
The level of state attention on anarchists is also high .
The movement has political prisoners and many groups had experienced harassment from the Centre for Prevention of Extremism .
This partially reflects on the militant tactics employed by antifa but is not wholly explained by this .
Although the delegates from Ufa reported that general political activism is distinguished from militant anti fascism and is tolerated locally this experience is unrepresentative and in any case is only a recent development there .
Unsurprisingly therefore , participation in the Anarchist Black Cross is a very popular activity for members of Autonomous Action .
Anarchist Black Cross activities include collecting money for lawyers fees , collecting and publishing information about prisoners , educating activists in basic legal rights and tactics when dealing with the police and supporting resistance by prisoners .
Anarchist Black Cross activity is coordinated over the Autonomous Action email list .
This is apparently not wholly efficient and some difficulty was reported in obtaining accurate information .
A proposal was made to delegate responsibility for some tasks to named individuals but this was decided against on the basis of wishing to avoid the creation of an elite of ABC activists and in favour of generalised responsibility shared by all .
Apart from Anti Fascism and the ABC , groups reported a large range of other activities including , animal rights campaigning , environmental campaigns , propaganda production and movie clubs , food not bombs initiatives and attempts to organise factory workers and tenants and student unions and to campaign on bread and butter issues such as the price of public transport .
Anarchists , particularly in Ufa are also involved in LGBT issues , Russia is quite socially conservative and the rights of LGBT people are not always respected .
For example a Gay Pride march in Moscow was subject to a counter demonstration by members of the Russian Orthodox church amongst other reactionaries .
Anarchists appear to have achieved the greatest public support for environmental campaigns , understandably so as many of the projects opposed are harmful to local people as well as to the environment more generally .
It would be fair to say , however , that the pursuit of social organising and campaigning work is often overshadowed by the pressing need for survival and self defence .
This is not to criticise Autonomous Action , which struck me as successfully maintaining a decent organisation under tremendous pressure .
One delegate , in a particularly beleaguered region reported that  All we do is just hang banners and fight for survival . 
Other delegates commented on increased organisation challenges facing their groups as a consequence of repression from police or neo nazis .
For example groups may find that membership suffers as individuals become dissuaded from remaining in the movement .
This prompts a need for greater recruitment activity and a relatively high turn over of activists , leading to a greater requirement for internal education and training .
Autonomous Action appears capable of responding effectively to these challenges although solidarity from abroad is of course always welcome !
The conference gave the impression of a small movement but one which is focused and well organised .
One comrade commented that although membership had been steady at around 100 people for the last few years but that the quality of participants had increased terms of serious and self discipline .
All in all a fantastic bunch of comrades !
I can only end the report by thanking them all for their hospitality over an inspiring and informative week .

During its war with Hamas , the Israeli military pursued a strategy of deliberately blasting crowded buildings — including a school and a hospital — with incendiary white phosphorus rounds .
It was part of a concerted effort to scorch hideouts in and around Gaza City , Human Rights Watch senior military analyst Marc Garlasco tells Danger Room .
" The attitude was :
When in doubt , burn it down , " says Garlasco , who spent weeks in Gaza after the fighting to conduct forensic research .
Of all the controversial things the Israeli military did during the conflict , firing off white phosphorus
( WP ) may have been the most divisive .
When exposed to oxygen , phosphorous catches fire , throwing up thick clouds of smoke — which makes it both good for illumination and for concealing troop or tank movements .
But WP can also burn people , quickly and horribly , sticking to the skin as it singes .
So firing phosphorus weapons carelessly in a civilian area is problematic , at best — and possibly illegal .
Garlasco says the Israeli Defense Forces were more than careless with WP , however .
Troops repeatedly targeted Hamas hideouts in crowded urban areas where civilians would almost certainly get caught in the cross - fire .
It was part of a larger Israeli effort to use maximum force to protect its troops during the Gaza campaign .
Amnesty International called the Israeli use of WP in Gaza a " war crime " ; the Israeli human rights group B'tselem was only marginally more careful , saying it was " impossible to use in a legal sense . "
In response , the Israeli Defense Forces at first denied it used WP .
Then it defended its phosphorus use as proper — while launching an internal investigation into potential abuses .
On Thursday , Human Rights
Watch is set to just released the most comprehensive report to date on how the Israeli military ( and , to a lesser extent , Hamas ) employed phosphrous rounds .
[ UPDATE : Read it here ; we 'll pull details , shortly . ]
Garlasco says the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) used the munitions in three ways , broadly .
First , the troops fired rounds in rural areas , possibly to set off mines or improvised bombs .
Second , the IDF used phosphorus one the edges of cities — to screen its movements , perhaps .
But a third — and definitely most troubling — set of cases involved the Israeli military shooting air - burst WP rounds into crowded urban areas .
Time and time again , when the IDF found what it felt was a Hamas outpost in a big building , troops blasted phosphorus overhead .
A school , a hospital and a UN building in Gaza City were all hit .
To Garlasco , it was part of a deliberate initiative to burn down any sites of resistance .
The problem is , many civilians were in the way .
Dr. Nafez Abu Shaban , head of the burn unit at Gaza City 's Sifa
Hospital , says he treated dozens of white phosphorous cases .
Other doctors made similar reports .
What makes it all the more troubling to Garlasco , a former chief of High Value Targeting on the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is that he could n't find a clear reason * why * the
Israeli military was using WP in this way .
The WP shots did n't accompany large - scale maneuvers , so the purpose could n't have been to screen those troops ( besides , air - bursting the rounds only increase the incendiary effects , while minimizing the smoke . )
The buildings hit with WP were big — too big to " send in a shell , to take out booby traps , " Garlasco says .
" It still boggles my mind , what the military utility was . "

Forty years ago , Richard Nixon declared " all - out war on drugs " , and enlisted the support of global allies .
Since then the war on drugs has cost the United States US $ 1 trillion , drugs are cheaper and more available , the profits for trading them greater than ever and the violence of the entire culture of prohibition escalating .
By all of its own criteria , the " war " has failed utterly .
So why on earth are we still fighting it ?
While Australia is still an enthusiastic front - line ally , many countries have beat a hasty retreat .
Mexico and most South American nations have recently abandoned the policy .
Earlier this year , US Senator Jim Webb introduced a bill seeking to reform the entire criminal justice system , saying the nation is " wasting billions of dollars and diminishing millions of lives " on ineffective strategies such as the war on drugs .
The bill has the backing of a growing band of police dissenters .
One such group , Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , believes the policy is a disaster for law enforcement in the US .
One of LEAP ’s key advisors is former Police Chief Norm Stamper .
After 34 years fighting and losing the war on drugs — three of them as chief of police in Seattle — Stamper left the force .
He now blogs on Huffington Post and travels extensively , making LEAP ’s case for legalisation .
He calls the war on drugs " the most devastating , dysfunctional , harmful policy since slavery " .
Stamper was in Sydney to speak at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas alongside fellow contrarians Germaine Greer and Christopher Hitchens , but I caught up with him in the tiny auditorium at the NSW Users and AIDS Association in Surry Hills .
I asked Stamper why , given its catastrophic failure , the war on drugs still has overwhelming political support .
Almost all US States have become addicted to federal money to fight drugs , Stamper told me .
" The toughest nut to crack will be the prison industrial complex — especially the private ones .
You get paid per prisoner per day .
Why would you want to reduce crime ? "
And the public prison system is also invested in the status quo .
" Powerful unions have strong memberships in the prison system .
They tend to present any policy that reduces incarceration as a threat to job security and their own survival . "
No wonder the United States , with 5 per cent of the world ’s population , has 25 per cent of the world ’s prisoners .
Of these , 500,000 are in prison on drugs charges — 1200 per cent more than in 1980 .
Before you shake your head and mutter " only in America " , the situation in Australia is appalling , too .
The Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation conservatively estimates the annual costs of our drug war at $ 6.7 billion .
Official stats are hard to come by , but according to Drugs and Law Enforcement ( Spinney Press ) , in the decade to 2006 at least 50,000 people a year were arrested for drugs , the vast majority of which were for marijuana .
In what should be an embarrassment to Australian law enforcement , 84 per cent of marijuana arrests in 2004 - 5 were for consumption .
It was one such petty bust that made the penny drop for Stamper .
Like fellow officers , he ’d accepted that possessing a joint was a felony , and that getting promoted meant racking up his arrest sheet .
" I ’m not proud of it , but the power went to my head , " he confessed .
Then he kicked down the door of a 19 - year - old kid and , " snatching the weed out of his flushing toilet " , busted him .
" Taking him down the station for a felony charge , I suddenly saw this kid as a fellow human being , and I ’m busting him when I could be out solving real crime . "
Stamper came to understand he was playing a role in the deadly narrative established by the prohibition policy of the 1920s and 30s .
" Prohibition created the culture of violence .
It invented Al Capone and the industry of dealing in illicit products for which there is unstoppable demand .
Drive - by shootings , overdose deaths , massive profit and the violent defence of that profit against competitors .
The whole framework got started with prohibition . "
Stamper sees the horrors of the Mexican drug cartels — who have recently taken to leaving their beheaded victims in public places — as the latest extension of this violence and intimidation .
The cartels and their members are now in 230 cities across the US — and everywhere they set up , cops are soon dealing , extorting and kidnapping , just like the cartels .
Some nations are tired of this spiral .
After going along with America ’s war on drugs for decades , Mexico , Argentina , Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia have all backed away from a policy of interdiction .
All are moving towards decriminalisation in attempts to free up funding and police to deal with the violence and to relieve prison systems bursting at the seams .
They ’ve done it quietly , so as not to offend the United States .
Stamper feels it bodes well that the US did not stand in the way of this .
But he believes decriminalisation , while a useful first step that stops user arrests jamming the system , must be replaced with legalisation .
" Only legalisation gets to the heart of the issue ; it stops the trafficking , the violence and the corruption , by regulating and taxing the whole process .
Then you can truly begin the process of harm minimisation . "
It ’s hard to fault the man ’s determined optimism .
But what about the pharmaceutical industry , I ask him , which is a fierce supporter of the war on drugs ?
Stamper concedes their power , but is sure " their opposition will dissolve once they see there ’s a place for them at the table of a regulated market " .
I also put to Stamper the commonly expressed fear that legalisation will just result in more users .
" There ’s a sustained production of misinformation about the real issues , the reason for the violence and corruption , " he told me .
" We need a massive education strategy to bring the truth to the mums and dads . "
In Australia , the Drug Law Reform Foundation and the NSW Users and AIDS Association are recognised leaders on drug policy , education and management .
Generally , the approach of drug advocacy groups is to fly under the radar .
The Medically Supervised Injecting Centre ( MSIC ) in Kings Cross is a perfect example .
Opened amid a media storm of scare - mongering and conservative moral panic in 2001 , it has quietly become established .
Why ?
Because it works .
Staff have dealt with 2557 overdoses without a single death .
Rather than encouraging drug use , MSIC has enabled health officials to build an accurate picture of drug use in Sydney .
This allows them to devise policy based on facts instead of moral positions based on fantasies .
It saves lives and saves money .
Tragically , shock jocks and church leaders still pipe a seductive tune for the unthinking — and political leaders remain too meek to confront them .
This moronic tune needs to become the real target for anyone , politicians included , interested in ending our outrageously expensive and utterly failed attempt to prohibit drugs .
In the US , Stamper readily accepts that change will be incremental , but with " 75 per cent of all Americans believing the war on drugs has failed , we have the critical mass of public opinion .
It ’s getting the leaders who whisper their support to speak out " .

GUANTANAMO BAY , CUBA–An apparent snub by the Canadian government has dismayed officials on the Obama administration 's task force who are working to resettle dozens of detainees here and close the prison , a high - ranking administration source told the Star .
Various foreign governments have offered refuge to prisoners that the Pentagon has cleared for release , including France , Portugal , Ireland and smaller nations such as Bermuda and Palau .
Dozens more are now negotiating with the task force , answering U.S. President Barack Obama 's call for help .
But the official , who has intimate knowledge of the negotiations and who spoke to the Star on the condition he not be named , said Canada abruptly stopped talks earlier this year .
He said the task force was surprised to learn of Canada 's decision through a press release .
" I just found it puzzling , " there were no phone calls or diplomatic meetings , the official said .
" A public rejection was odd . "
Canada 's position is in contrast to other countries eager to curry favour with the U.S. administration by helping Obama 's apparent Sisyphean task to close Gitmo .
Various foreign governments have stated that accepting detainees is " the right thing to do " after years of criticism about the offshore prison .
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's press secretary told the Star that Canada 's position under both the Bush and Obama administrations had been consistent .
" We 're not interested in bringing detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Canada , " said Dimitri Soudas .
" In the case of other detainees who are not Canadian citizens and do n't have a connection to Canada , there is no justification for us to bring any such individuals to Canada . "
Toronto - born Omar Khadr , accused by the Pentagon of throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan in 2002 , is the only Western detainee left in Guantanamo .
He appeared at a hearing here Wednesday alongside two new Washington attorneys .
U.S. prosecutor John Murphy said Khadr 's fate – whether he will be tried by a military commission or before a Washington civilian court – would be announced within the next six weeks .
Canada 's refusal to advocate on Khadr 's behalf was condemned by the Federal Court of Appeals , which ordered Harper to intervene .
The Supreme Court will hear the government 's appeal of that ruling next month .
The Khadr case undoubtedly complicates negotiations to resettle other Guantanamo detainees , the administration source conceded .
But since Khadr faces terrorism - related charges , and the Pentagon has cleared other detainees for release , the official argued that the cases should be viewed as distinct .
" We 're still hoping Canada will help , " he said .
" We ca n't do this alone . "
That was the message Obama 's Guantanamo czar tasked with closing the prison brought to Ottawa this spring .
There had been earlier negotiations under the Bush administration about Canada accepting Uighur detainees – Chinese citizens from a Muslim minority group facing persecution in China .
But those talks broke down reportedly over concerns of Chinese government reprimands .
The official told the Star the Canadian government was keen to keep quiet the meeting that U.S. Special Envoy Daniel Fried had this spring .
Various options for the detainees were discussed and Obama 's task force was told that the meeting had been " promising . "
But only a week later , Harper 's office told journalists that Canada would not accept any Guantanamo detainees – surprising the task force , the official said .
Advocacy groups have argued that Canada 's position on Guantanamo has stained its international reputation as a leader in the field of human rights .
" The Obama administration is trying to do the right thing , the very thing Canada was asking the United States to do for so long .
It 's pathetic that Canada now wo n't lift a finger to help , especially since so many other NATO allies are doing their part , " said Tom Malinowski , Washington director of Human Rights Watch .
Algerian Djamel Ameziane is one detainee who has been pushing for resettlement in Montreal , where he once lived and has relatives who are Canadian citizens .
His lawyers say he would be a logical candidate .
" He lived and worked there for years , is fluent in French , has family there who are citizens , and has church - backed sponsorship for his resettlement , " said his New York - based lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei .
" His country ties , support system , and capacity to integrate could n't be stronger . "
Only 20 of the remaining 223 detainees have left this prison under the Obama administration , and only half of those men have been settled in third countries ( others returned to their countries of birth ) .
The Pentagon plans to prosecute as many as 80 terrorism suspects in U.S. military or criminal courts and return others to their homelands , a group that could include the nearly 100 Yemeni detainees .
Like adoptive parents , foreign country delegates are coming here almost weekly to meet and interview detainees , who are not considered a risk but cannot be sent home due to fears that they will be tortured .
It has created a bizarre lottery system where both detainees and foreign delegates are vying for the best match .

" The detainees get a little bit hyper because they want to control where they go , " said the prison camp 's deputy commander , Gen. Rafael O'Ferrall , in an interview last week .
Most sought after are European destinations due to their proximity to the Middle East and Asia and the likelihood of diaspora groups from their native homeland .
O'Ferrall said the uncertainty over the slow pace of resettlements has led to various uprisings inside the prison camps .
Guards are bracing for protests if Obama 's Jan. 22 deadline to close the detention facility is not met – which is appearing increasingly likely .
Foreign governments are also jostling for position – hoping to be offered the most amenable detainees .
While the Uighur detainees were seen as the lowest threat to security , few countries wanted to incur the wrath of China who has demanded their return .
Four Uighur detainees were sent to Bermuda this summer and another group is expected to soon depart for Palau , although the South Pacific island is seen only as a temporary home for the men .
But hanging over any negotiations is the fact that there is one country where it appears detainees will not settle – or at least not unless they 're behind bars .
U.S. House and Senate leaders agreed this week that detainees could be tried on U.S. soil , but refused to allow the transfer of those prisoners not considered a risk .
So why should other countries help when the U.S. administration wo n't help clean up its own mess ?
Although careful not to criticize Congress 's position , that undoubtedly makes the task more difficult , the administration source conceded .
The official would not speculate whether Canada 's apparent snub would hinder relations between the two countries .
But Gar Pardy , the former head of Canada 's consular programs , said he would be surprised if it did n't create a chill .
" The administration is saying , ' Look , we 've inherited all this stuff .
We 're looking for a solution here and we would expect getting some help from our friends and we 're not getting any . ' "

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) -
The destruction of hundreds of schools during fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban militants has left more than half a million children with little hope of education , the United Nations said on Wednesday .
The army offensive against militants in North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) resulted in one of largest internal displacements in recent times .
About 2.3 million people fled their homes , most after fighting intensified in April .
But as displaced families leave the shelter of camps and host communities to go home , they are finding many of their children ’s schools in ruins .
“ The impact of the fighting has been quite dramatic on schools and students in NWFP , ” Luc Chauvin , deputy representative for the U.N. Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) in Pakistan , told Reuters AlertNet in a telephone interview .
“ Some of the girls ’ schools were blown up by the Taliban before the fighting , while other schools were destroyed during the active conflict , ” he said .
Chauvin said about 230 schools had been “ completely flattened , ” while about 410 schools had been damaged with collapsed walls and roofs caused by mortar fire , rocket - propelled grenades or bombs .
The Taliban , who oppose female education , blew up girls ’ schools when they controlled the Swat area for about two years .
They attacked other empty schools because soldiers often used them as camps .
Chauvin said more than 4,000 other primary and secondary schools also needed to be renovated .
Many had been converted into shelters to accommodate people fleeing the fighting .
“ Lots of schools need to be cleaned up , repainted and refurnished after so many people have been living there and things have been stolen or furniture burned as firewood , ” he said .
TARGETING SCHOOLS
Humanitarian workers , who are assessing how to help war - ravaged areas such as the Swat valley , say schools are amongst the worst - hit infrastructure .
Despite areas being declared safe , militants are still operating and have been carrying out revenge attacks by burning down more schools and attacking students .
Chauvin said a lack of schooling for more than half a million children would be a devastating blow to people desperate to get back to normal life .
“ When children go to school it creates a sense of normalcy and this is what returning populations need , ” said Chauvin .
“ But this is impossible if the schools no longer exist . ”
Aid workers say it is imperative to invest in poverty alleviation and development projects in NWFP , which has become a fertile ground for recruiting militants , but the humanitarian community in Pakistan is struggling to find funds .
The United Nations has only received 3 percent of the funds required to restore basic services such as water and electricity systems , and hospitals and clinics .
Chauvin said schools were also being neglected with donors only funding 17 percent of the $ 23.2 million required .
“ There seems to be consensus that education is key but when it comes to action , education is sometimes the forgotten child . ”
From the ' People In Glass Houses ... ' files :
Linux vendor Red Hat sure does n't seem to like Microsoft much .
Red
Hat is now alleging that Microsoft is not committed to the path of peace with open source software vendors .
I have n't had direct contact with Microsoft ( yet ) , but given the conversations I 've had with them over the years ( especially with the ever so articulate Sam Ramji ) , this is a claim they will vehemently dispute .
Red Hat 's latest attack on Microsoft comes on the heals of the disclosure that the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) that Red Hat supports , acquired 22 patents formerly held by Microsoft .
For the record , OIN was less than forthcoming with me , though they did respond to me late yesterday and they did issue a press release at 4 PM yesterday as well .
Red Hat blogged that the patents acquired by OIN were being marketed by Microsoft to
patent trolls .
" It also used marketing materials
that highlighted offensive uses of the patents against open source
software , including a number of the most popular open source packages , " Red Hat blogged .
" This looked to us like a classic FUD effort .
To unleash FUD , you
assemble a lot of patents of uncertain value , annotate them with a
roadmap for the companies and products to be targeted with the patents ,
put the lot in the hands of trolls schooled in patent aggression , and
then stand back and wait for the FUD to spread with its chilling
effect . "
The only problem with Red Hat 's assertion though , is that according to a comment I got late yesterday from the OIN , they did n't think the actual patents were all that strong or that open source software actually infringed on the patents .

Cells in Abu Ghraib
Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison has been set alight during a riot .
The jail became notorious after prisoner abuse was discovered there after US forces took over .
Wardens had been searching for drugs and banned items such as mobile phones when three inmates started a fire by burning a mattress .
The fire injured three wardens but not prisoners , who began rioting .
That injured three inmates .
The Iraqi army responded and US helicopters assisted .
The decision was later taken to evacuate the jail to other prisons around Baghdad .
Iraqi media had claimed that there were fatalities , but this has been denied by authorities .
According to a US military spokesman , the initial scuffle was an apparent escape attempt .
There have also been reports of inmates being upset at conditions , although the justice ministry says it is now a model prison , under its new name of Baghdad Central Prison .
Abu Ghraib , however , was not always a model prison .
Under Saddam
Hussein the jail was used for mass detention and murder of politically inconvenient people , and US soldiers have been caught torturing and sexually abusing prisoners , sparking public outrage and helping fuel the insurgency .

“ There is nothing special about David Cerny ’s art , other than that he is more visible than other artists and talented at marketing , ” Mr. Knizak said .
“ But artists like Cerny who are in headlines today will be forgotten tomorrow .
His work is destined for the amusement park and wo n’t stand the test of time . ”
Mr. Knizak , whom Mr. Cerny once depicted inside the same towering sculpture of a rectum where he placed his other nemesis , Mr. Klaus , may not be the most objective critic .
In a 2003 work titled “ Brown - nosers , ” museumgoers were asked to climb a ladder and peer into a hole in the huge white rear end , where a video showed impersonators wearing rubber masks of Mr. Klaus and Mr. Knizak , feeding each other slop to the tune of “ We Are the Champions . ”
Mr. Cerny is so contemptuous of Mr. Knizak , whom he accuses of fawning on the establishment , that he once refused to enter the National Gallery to accept an award .
“ It was hate at first sight , ” he said .
Mr. Cerny first drew attention in May 1991 , when , at 22 , he was arrested after painting a giant Soviet tank pink , transforming a memorial to the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army in 1945 into the sculptural equivalent of a large pink toy .
Recalling his hooliganism , for which he spent a few days in prison , Mr. Cerny said the tank had been a symbol for him and his generation of the Soviet - led occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and a monument to decades of Russian oppression .

Tiger ’s Year , a Failure ?
by The Man No One Came To See in Uncategorized
0 majors , WHAT ?
NO top fives in any of the majors , how could he possibly still be the best player in the world ?
These are the expectations of Tiger Woods these days .
The biggest fault in Tiger Woods ’ game is his own dominance .
There are only a handful of athletes in the world who command the same expectations , and these guys get dogged .
Lets look at the misery that has been Tiger ’s 2009 .
Tiger has played in a total of nine tournaments this year , eight being typical stroke play events .
Of those eight stroke play events , he has finished in the top 10 every time .
Of those eight , he has won 3 , or 37.5 % of them .
Use this for reference , if you hit .300 in baseball you get a hit 30 % of your at - bats and you are considered one of the greatest to ever play the game .
But no Tiger wins more than 30 % and it is a down year for him .
Come on , give him a break !
Another fun fact about Tiger ’s disappointing season , the one match play event , The World Golf Classic , Tiger placed 17th and won $ 95,000 .
Some may think , How could Tiger finish in 17th ?!?
I think $ 95,000 , damn for 17th !
Just to give a little perspective ,
Tiger made $ 95,000 for playing less than 36 holes of golf , which equates to about $ 2,639 dollars per hole !!!
That is failure for Tiger though .
Oh and by the way , $ 95,000 is more than 82 % of Americans make in a year and he got that for about 10 hours of work .
In Tiger ’s mom ’s birthplace , Thailand , thats 38 peoples salaries for a whole year
Despite his miserable choke jobs in majors though , somehow Tiger has defeated his complete lack of skill to win three tournaments this year and about $ 4.5 million .
Tiger has played a total of 576 holes ( courtesy of ESPN ) and when you divide that by his total prize money he is making more than $ 7,900 per hole he has played this year .
Tiger ’s Life :
My Life :
The man once described as the Indiana Jones of economists arrives for our interview in a bit of a shambles , which is n't the kind of entrance one associates with Indiana Jones .
Steven Levitt has just left his suitcase in the back of a New York taxi , and now his container of apple juice is leaking all over the Manhattan office of his collaborator , journalist Stephen Dubner .
" Do you think I 'll ever get it back ? "
Levitt wonders absently , in a tone that suggests no personal investment in the outcome , while Dubner mops up the puddle .
To be fair , of course , the action - hero analogy was never intended to describe Levitt 's personal bearing : it was a reference to the swashbuckling spirit of the two men's bestselling book , Freakonomics , which took economics into uncharted territory , explaining such riddles as why sumo wrestlers deliberately lose matches , why estate agents do n't get the best deals for their clients and why crack dealers , instead of growing rich , end up living with their mothers .
Somewhere , no doubt , there are statistics on the fate of items abandoned in New York City cabs ; Levitt , one of his generation 's most ingenious economists , could presumably use them to ferret out proof that more suitcases get returned in sunny weather , or at Christmas , or when the taxi driver is the oldest child in his family .
Haughty academic colleagues , poring over unemployment rates and balance - of - payments deficits , accuse Levitt of cutesiness .
He has no big unifying theme , they say , and nothing to say about the world financial crisis : he would rather spend his days showing how winning the Nobel prize seems to increase your longevity , or explaining the changing price charged for oral sex by prostitutes on the streets of Chicago .
Picking a fight with Levitt is a dissatisfying business , though , because he tends to agree with his accusers .
" To have a unifying theme , you need to be a big thinker , and that 's just not the way I think , " says the 42 - year - old , who speaks with a slight lisp .
" I think small . "
When Dubner , 46 , interviewed him for the New York Times article that led to their collaboration on Freakonomics , which has now sold more than 3 m copies worldwide , Levitt was even blunter .
" I just do n't know very much about the field of economics , " he said .
There is plenty more cutesiness – as well as much that 's genuinely fascinating – in the sequel to Freakonomics , published this month , which labours under the title of Superfreakonomics : Global Cooling , Patriotic Prostitutes , and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance .
But there are also arguments that promise to expose its authors to a new kind of controversy .
Levitt and Dubner may have nothing to say about the financial crisis , but they have much to say about climate change , and why , in their analysis , economics shows that trying to change people 's polluting behaviour is utterly pointless .
The real solution , they maintain , involves pumping large quantities of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere through an 18 - mile - long hose , of which more later .
" We could end this debate and be done with it , " Levitt says , with a sigh , " and move on to problems that are harder to solve . "
People will object to this , they acknowledge , just like they objected to the claim , in Freakonomics , that the legalisation of abortion in the 1970s was the reason for the precipitous drop in crime levels in America in the 1990s .
( Unwanted children , according to this theory , are more likely to turn into criminals , so when they do n't get born in the first place , crime falls . )
But to Levitt and Dubner , such objections are pure emotionalism .
Their job , as dispassionate analysts , is to take a cold - eyed look at how things really are , not how we would like them to be , and to deliver difficult truths with no regard for hurt feelings .
" The data , " they write , in the kind of phrase that recurs throughout Superfreakonomics , " do n't lie . "
Prostitutes , suicide bombers and swimming - pool deaths
Thus in the new book we learn , for example , that more deaths are caused per mile , in America at least , from drunk walking than drunk driving – so when you drive to a party and get plastered , it 's not necessarily a wise decision to leave the car and walk home .
We discover that female emergency - room doctors are slightly better at keeping their patients alive than male ones , and that Hezbollah suicide bombers , far from being the poorest of the poor , with nothing to lose , tend to be wealthier and better - educated than the average Lebanese person .
There 's an artful takedown of the fashionable " locavore " movement : transportation , Levitt and Dubner argue , accounts for such a small part of food 's carbon footprint that buying all - local can make matters worse , because small farms use energy less efficiently than big ones .
And we learn that at some point in the last 80 years , the cost of a blowjob from a Chicago prostitute went from being more expensive to less expensive than vaginal sex , as the societal taboo against oral sex – which gave it scarcity value – declined .
( The average price of each , in case you were wondering , is currently $ 37.26 versus $ 80.05 . )
Levitt had a thing for statistics long before his passion made him a tenured professor of economics at the University of Chicago at just 36 , and won him the prestigious John Bates Clark medal , awarded to the best American economist under 40 .
" I was an odd child , " Levitt says , and perhaps some kind of oddness was to be expected : his mother is a psychic , his father the world 's leading expert on the science of farts .
" My favourite thing to do was always just to go play in my room by myself , and it was always data - related . . .
Every day , when my father came home from work , my job was to report the correlation coefficients between various baseball statistics . "
As a Harvard undergraduate , he wrote a computer program to help his classmates decide how to pair off into groups of roommates , though it turned out that everybody disliked the same people – " and so the optimal thing to do was to put all the people who were hated together , even though they hated each other worse than everybody else did . "
He made an academic name for himself with quirky studies on crime , sports and politics , identifying useful patterns in mountains of data that nobody had bothered to examine .
Economic analysis , as a pastime , even seemed to provide him with a measure of solace in the face of the most searing loss .
Shortly after he came to Chicago , he and his wife Jeanette lost their first child , Andrew , to pneumococcal meningitis at the age of one .
They joined a support group for bereaved parents .
Levitt was surprised by the number of attendees whose children had died in swimming - pool accidents , and became absorbed in a new research project , which revealed , when completed , how much more dangerous it is to have a swimming - pool at your home than a gun .
Such findings caught the media 's imagination .
When publishers began to pressure him to write a mass - market book , he said he would only do so if he wrote it with Dubner , a magazine journalist with two book - length memoirs under his belt , whose 2003 piece on Levitt had convinced him that not all journalists were destined to misunderstand and misrepresent his work .
Their mission to explain the world through numbers alone can give Superfreakonomics an oddly detached feel : major social issues are addressed , then instantly reduced to a statistical parlour game .
An interesting section on the transactions between pimps and prostitutes , for example , shows that working with a pimp confers great financial advantages : they 're much more helpful to prostitutes than estate agents are to house - sellers , for a start .
But it neglects to consider the notion that there might , just possibly , be some negative aspects to the pimp - prostitute relationship .
( The authors , apparently aware that they have made it look as if selling sex is the business plan to beat all others , add a helpful clarification : " Certainly , prostitution is n't for every woman . " )
Based on interviews with a pseudonymous source in the British banking industry , they also suggest that a mathematical algorithm could be developed that would identify " potential bad guys " in advance , with reference to certain behavioural and demographic characteristics .
Those arrested on charges of terrorism , they explain , are disproportionately likely to rent their home , have no savings account or life insurance , be a student , and have both Muslim first and last names .
Superfreakonomics makes no mention of the possibility that the police might simply be targeting Muslims disproportionately , and Levitt seems genuinely baffled that anyone might object , on civil - liberties grounds , to targeting all those who fulfilled the relevant criteria .
" Is n't everyone in favour of that ?
How could you not be in favour of that ?
I 'm not saying we should lock them up , " he says .
" But would it not make sense for MI5 to take a close look at those people ?
Of course , it 's a slight inconvenience to those innocents who have MI5 scrutinise them .
But economics is all about trade - offs . "
Incidentally , this is why , according to the book 's subtitle , " suicide bombers should buy life insurance " : it does n't pay out in cases of suicide , so buying it would help evade suspicion .
Self - interest : an uncomfortable fact
Despite the lack of a unifying theme , there 's an underlying message to both books , according to Levitt and Dubner , which is that " people respond to incentives " .
Fundamentally , we 're self - interested .
This does n't necessarily mean that we 're always greedy and selfish : our self - interest can include a desire for the warm glow of acting in a moral or charitable way .
But people , they write , " are n't ' good ' or ' bad ' .
People are people , and they respond to incentives .
They can nearly always be manipulated – for good or ill – if only you find the right levers . "
Or , as Levitt puts it : " You could put Mother Teresa in a situation where she might not act altruistically , and you could put Charles Manson in a situation where he might act altruistically . "
The problem with trying to reduce carbon emissions , they argue , is that the incentives are all wrong .
Too many of the benefits are " externalities " , from which the people making the sacrifices will never benefit – and the whole history of economics demonstrates that such completely unself - interested behaviour is impossible to implement on a large scale , especially when so many people suspect that their sacrifice would not , in fact , make a significant difference to the outcome .
" Behaviour change is hopeless , " Levitt says .
" It 's just completely pointless to think that you 're going to get six billion people , the poorest people around and the richest people around , to work together , when every individual person has no impact on the problem .
That 's a fundamental issue that economists have thought about , and recognised the hopelessness of , for hundreds of years . . .
One thing we know is that I 'm not going to sacrifice , materially , my own life , to help an anonymous person in Bangladesh who might not even have been born yet , when I know that there will be no help for that person anyway . "
Calling on people to reduce their carbon emissions , the authors write , " is a noble invitation .
But as incentives go , it 's not a very strong one . "
This , of course , is desperately tricky territory .
My immediate personal response is that Levitt 's view is irresponsible defeatism , which I find repugnant .
The Superfreakonomics response to that , though , would be to ask about the source of my repugnance .
Is it really because I have any hard data to suggest that such massive behavioural change might be feasible – that it would n't , in other words , entail a historically unprecedented transformation in human nature ?
Or is it just because I do n't want to confront the fact that people are the way they are , which is to say fundamentally self - interested ?
Sulphur dioxide : the quick fix for global warming
A large chunk of Superfreakonomics is given over to what Levitt and Dubner present as a simple , cheap alternative to all this depressing futility .
They profile Nathan Myhrvold , the former chief technology officer of Microsoft , whose company , Intellectual Ventures , is exploring the possibility of pumping large quantities of sulphur dioxide into the Earth 's stratosphere through an 18 - mile - long hose , held up by helium balloons , at an initial cost of around $ 20 m .
The chemical would reflect some of the sun 's rays back into space , cooling the planet , exactly as happened following the massive 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo , in the Philippines .
The primary objection to this plan , as with other " geoengineering " schemes , is that there 's no predicting the unknown negative effects of meddling in such a complex natural system .
And it 's strange , given how much is made in both Freakonomics books of the law of unintended consequences , that they do n't mention this in the context of Myhrvold 's plan .
Still , it 's hard to object to the authors ' argument that this kind of potential solution should have more profile , among politicians and in the media , than it currently does .
It certainly feels wrong to deal with pollution by polluting even more .
But what , Levitt and Dubner would ask , is the hard , empirical basis for that feeling ?
Is n't it just more emotionalism , more wishful thinking ?
" When you read the actual scientists ' reasoning for how this could work , and might need to work , " says Dubner , " it 's really hard not to come to the conclusion that it 's idiotic to discount it .
Not to say that it 's a slam - dunk to do it , but idiotic to discount it entirely . "
" It 's just common sense , " Levitt says , with the faint exasperation of a man who sees the world in the harsh light of data , and can't quite understand why everyone else does not .
" Much of economics is just common sense .
What 's so surprising is that it is so rarely actually applied in daily life . "
SuperFreakonomics by Steven Levitt & Stephen Dubner is published by Allen Lane , price £ 20 .
Levitt and Dubner will be speaking at the LSE , Peacock Theatre , London on Monday 9 November at 6.30 pm .
A day in the life of Steven Levitt
6.30 am : Get up , sneak in a little bit of work .
Then I take my kids to school around 8 .
We live just a few blocks away , and my office at the university is right across the street from the school .
I 'll have some coffee .
9am : More or less spend the rest of the day working at a computer , analysing data , or sitting around with my research assistants , reviewing what they 're doing and figuring out what to do next .
If I 'm lucky , I 'll get to sneak off for a little session at the driving range .
I 've become a golf nut .
6.30 pm : I made a deal with my wife , when we moved two blocks from the university , that I 'd be home by 6.30 .
My wife often plays high - stakes online poker in the evenings , which frees me up to do email and work , as well as putting the kids to bed .
My other hobby is betting on horse racing , so I spend some reviewing the day 's racing .
11 pm : Bed .
A day in the life of Stephen Dubner
5.30 am : Awake , pour coffee .
Because my nine - year - old son usually races out between 6:00 and 6:15 to talk about the previous night 's sporting events , I use this early time to read some news , answer some overnight emails , and moderate comments on our blog .
7am : Go for a run , reluctantly , in Central Park .
8.30 am : Walk across the street to my writing studio .
8.35 am-11 am : Write .
No phone or internet during this time .
11 am : Catch up on morning phone calls and e-mails .
11.30 am : Lunch !
Am starved by now since I wake up early and do n't eat breakfast .
If I make the mistake of eating breakfast , I want to go back to bed and / or eat again immediately .
12.30 pm- 3 pm : Write .
3 pm -6 pm : Catch up on emails , phone calls , reading , do some blog writing .
Call my wife to see if everyone is still alive and well , that no fires have been set , that my children have n't earned any suspension notices at school .
6.05 pm : Home for dinner with the family , a bit of homework , a boardgame or some catch , and then the four of us read together in bed for a while .
If the day 's writing has been particularly good or particularly bad , a glass of scotch will be involved .
I am usually ready to sleep soon after the children doze off .
While in the middle of writing a book , I have a hard time reading other books for pleasure .
Now that Superfreak is done , I 've begun again and found it wonderful .
9 pm : Program the coffee machine . . .
In his first interview after being released from prison last week , former congressman James Traficant let the cat out of the bag about the strangle hold that the Pro Israel Lobby has over Washington DC .
Traficant says that he was the number one target of American Israeli Public Affairs Committee " and the Justice Department .
He goes on to say that " he believes that Israel has a powerful stranglehold on the American government .
They control both members of the House , the House and the Senate .
They have us involved in wars in which we have little or no interest .
Our children are coming back in body bags .
Our nation is bankrupt over these wars .
And if you open your mouth , you get targeted .
And if they do n't beat you at the poll , they 'll put you in prison . "
He says " Israel gets approximately $ 15 billion a year from the American taxpayers .
That $ 15 billion is $ 30,000 for every man , woman and child .
And people in my district are losing their pension benefits . "
Greta asks " Are you an antisemite , " James replies , " what I am is an American .
You see , I think America comes first .
And we have a one - sided foreign policy in the Mideast , and we 've alienated Arabs who have no way of fighting .
So , what they 've done -- and I predicted this on the House floor -- is they would export violence to America .
And they have .
They have no other way to fight . " .
Traficant talked about his controversial defense of John Demanjuk , who was accused of Nazi war crimes , and was facing execution by Israel .
Traficant 's used the freedom of information act to prove he was innocent and who the real individual was .
A rulling by Israel 's supreme court released him but Traficant 's role angered the Jewish Establishment in America .
Demanjuk is now facing trial in Germany , despite being found innocent by Israel .
Unlike most convicted politicians who are sent to country club prisons , he was not given any special treatment .
He said he spent time in solitary confinement and was put in danger in a prison full of many illegal immigrants , being a staunch opponent of illegal immigration .
He talks about how his experience in prison has changed his entire outlook on the justice system and that he now believes no one should go to prison for non-violence offenses and that he wishes he did more to right the war on drugs when he was in congress .
Traficant expressed interest in running for congress again saying it is a 50/50 % chance .
Whether he gets back in office or not he is a needed Populist Constitutionalist voice against the powers that control our government .

The celebrity chef James Martin – the Yorkshire one off Saturday Kitchen who puts butter in everything – has incurred the wrath of cyclists including Bradley Wiggins after writing a cyclist - baiting article in the Mail on Sunday .
Martin , who moonlights as a motoring correspondent for the paper , wrote this weekend of his hatred for " herbal tea - drinking , Harriet Harman - voting " cyclists ( surely we Guardian types have copyright on such insults ? )
He was fed up , he said , of the " city - boy ponces in fluorescent Spider - Man outfits , shades , bum bags and stupid cleated shoes " who pedal around the lanes near his country residence " with their private parts alarmingly apparent . "
So far , so predictable .
But in a review of the Tesla electric car this Sunday , he went further , gleefully describing how he had utilised the speedy and silent approach of his test vehicle to sneak up on a pack of weekend cyclists , honk his horn and drive them off the road .
" The look of sheer terror as they tottered into the hedge was the best thing I 've ever seen in my rear - view mirror , " he wrote .
Yesterday , the cycling community launched a counter attack .
Tour de France sprinting ace Robbie McEwen urged everyone to " either key [ Martin's ] car or punch him in the face " ; Taylor Phinney , the US world champion , called him a " douche bag " .
Most bruisingly of all , Bradley Wiggins , the Olympic gold medallist , tweeted that he had always preferred rival cooking show Something For The Weekend anyway .
Tesla , which loaned Martin the car , was n't happy either .
" In this case , we 're not even using it [ linking to the review from our site ] .
It is really odd .
I have to sadly admit this is not the first time a journalist in the UK has brought up this issue of wheatgrass - eating hippies riding bikes .
[ But ] this is definitely the most extreme version of it , " Rachel Konrad , Tesla 's communications manager , told the FredCast cycling podcast .
Before long , Martin's Wikipedia entry had been hacked , the Daily Mail website had removed the facility to comment on the story so that no one else could call him a moron and cyclists ' organisation the CTC had waded in , urging the cyclists terrorised by Martin to contact the organisation 's accident line .
An inevitable Facebook group was formed , with over 1,000 people signing up to declare I Hate James Martin , and dozens of angry cyclists began to bombard his agent and publisher with emails .
Wiggins ' wife , Cath , announced she had written to the Press Complaints Commission and urged everyone else to do the same until Martin apologised .
She might have some success : when the Times columnist Matthew Parris fantasised about decapitating cyclists with piano wire a few years back , he was forced to say sorry by angry readers .
When the Guardian contacted Martin yesterday , he declined to comment , but a source close to him said he was only joking – it was " a humorous piece like Clarkson and caravans " apparently .
I must admit I quite like Martin .
I got his book on puddings for my birthday the other year – the pear tart is a winner – but picking on cyclists is pretty lazy way to get a laugh .
Did you find it funny ?
Should cyclists stop taking themselves so seriously and not take the bait for once , or were Martin 's views " both offensive and dangerous to cyclists " , as the CTC suggests ?
• 4.45 pm Update : James Martin has published an apology on his website .
It reads :
Regarding the The Tesla Roadster Article ...
May I take this opportunity to apologize [ sic ] for any offence I have caused through the article in last weekend 's Mail on Sunday .
It was never my intention to offend the many cyclists who share our roads across the country .
What was intended to be a humorous piece was clearly misjudged .
Further more I do not condone any form of reckless driving .
Once again , I am sincerely sorry for any upset caused in relation to this article .
James Martin
• This article was amended on Wednesday 16 September 2009 .
We said Matthew Parris was forced by the Press Complaints Commission to apologise for an article about decapitating cyclists with piano wire .
In fact the commission said its code had not been breached by the article .
This has been corrected .

Oh : sto battendo la Rete e l'Ansa da un'ora , ma non ho ancora trovato delle scuse .
Mica chiedo molto : li abbiamo votati , ci dovrebbero rappresentare , invece erano a spasso , almeno ci chiedano scusa .
Ci chieda scusa Franceschini , a nome di tutto il partito : il segretario è ancora lui - almeno formalmente , tipo Romolo Augustolo - quindi dovrebbe avere le palle di esporsi e chiedere scusa a nome di tutti , che magari è più difficile che piantare un tricolore sul Pd ma è pure un filo più importante .
Ci chiedano scusa D'Alema e Bersani , che in aula non c'erano perché troppo impegnati a contare le tessere , e tra pochi mesi ci chiederanno il voto per il partito che avranno messo in cassaforte .
Ci chieda scusa Antonello Soro , che ha fatto un bell ' intervento contro il paradiso fiscale in cui hanno trasformato l'Italia , ma poi non è stato capace di mettere insieme il gruppo di deputati di cui in teoria sarebbe il capo .
E ci chiedano scusa uno per uno i 51 parlamentari che non erano lì a fare il lavoro per cui sono stati eletti , per cui milioni di persone li hanno mandati a Montecitorio .
Non è che vi chiedo di dimettervi , di rinunciare alle poltrone e agli stipendi , al barbiere gratis o alla passeggiata in Transatlantico .
Basterebbero delle scuse .
Ne sarete capaci ?

When I first heard about the oily monstrosity known as KFC ’s Double Down sandwich , it seemed like a practical joke , or an Onion story that made it into the pop-culture bloodstream and was mistaken for fact .
Surely even the sick fucks at Kentucky Fried Chicken , the mad scientists of fried poultry behind occasional A.V. Club contributor Patton Oswalt ’s beloved Famous Bowl , would not be deranged enough to make a sandwich that substituted thick , greasy , deep - fried chicken - breast patties for buns .
Sure enough , the Double Down quickly attained the status of an urban legend .
As its reputation grew , rumors spread that it was a chicken sandwich that stuck a chicken breast in between two chicken - breast “ buns ” for the gastronomic grease - orgy to end all gastronomic grease - orgies .
Amazingly , the actual Double Down is even more disgusting and less healthy than the fried - chicken ménage a trois of the public imagination .

Instead of the expected chicken filling , the Double Down sticks two different kinds of cheese — pepper jack and a mystery variety created by the devil himself to win souls and punish humanity by inciting a massive wave of gluttony - induced heart attacks — bacon ( yes , bacon ) , and something called “ The Colonel ’s Sauce ” between two fried , breaded chicken - breast patties .
( The Colonel ’s Sauce , incidentally , only sounds like a crude euphemism for ejaculate . )
[ Editor ’s note :
The mystery second cheese claims to be Swiss . ]

I was fascinated .
And horrified .
I honestly did not believe such an abomination existed , even in God ’s United States , a country devoted to the culinary concept of more , more , more , where fast - food establishments routinely test the outer limits of mindless excess .
So I was simultaneously disturbed and excited when I drove past a KFC in beautiful Providence , Rhode Island with a sign advertising the Double Down .
The Double Down is only being tested in two markets : Providence and Omaha , Nebraska .
So it was a curious bit of kismet that I happened to be visiting my delightful driver / photographer / girlfriend in Rhode Island when this fast - food evil was being unleashed .
If a relationship can withstand the Double Down , it can withstand anything .

Stumbling unexpectedly upon the Double Down in its natural habitat was like encountering a rare and repugnant animal in the wild — call it the Greater New England Grease Chicken Bacon Toad .
We entered the Double Down ’s sanctuary and were content to merely gaze in awe as an affable fellow ordered a Double Down .
He explained that he had just gotten back from buying groceries at Whole Foods , and figured he was entitled to treat himself to the most repulsive - sounding greaseball in Christendom .
Advertisement
My curiosity was piqued , and since Patton Oswalt did n’t happen to be in Providence at the time , I figured I would venture into the very mouth of madness and eat one of these hellspawns myself .
I should probably mention that I have the feeble stomach of an old man .
I begin every day by popping Prilosec , then help myself to a Cherry Tums chaser .
That ’s just how I get down .
I was battling a cold — my aging body is disintegrating rapidly — so I did n’t have much of an appetite to begin with , but I was going to choke down a Double Down if it killed me or made me violently ill .
It nearly did both .
Feeling fearless in a fearful sort of way , I ordered the Double Down combo—a Double Down sandwich , an overflowing order of potato wedges , and an ice - cold Mountain Dew — then sat down to ponder this unholiest of creations .

The Experience : My first impression of the Double Down , curiously enough , was that it seemed strangely small .
How wrong could I be ?
Though two chicken patties buttressing an unsightly aggregation of multiple cheeses , fried pig meat , and sauce looked surprisingly modest , even slight , I felt as if I had eaten an entire bucket of fried chicken after only a few bites .
Advertisement
My first bite was deceptive .
“ Hey , this is n’t so bad , ” I thought as I sunk my teeth into the good Colonel ’s succulent white - meat chicken , fortified with his trademark blend of special herbs and spices .
I fucking love KFC .
I dig their chicken breasts , wedges , and mashed potatoes with gravy .
Some of my favorite memories of my time in Madison revolve around an annual institution known as Chicken Bowl , a chicken - eating contest / Super Bowl party organized by A.V. Club founder and all - around great guy Stephen Thompson .
We ’d consume mass quantities of KFC chicken and mashed potatoes , drink beer , and watch the Super Bowl .
It was all kinds of awesome .
The Double Down was like a one - man Chicken Bowl , minus the camaraderie , competition , good vibes , and football .
Pretty much all that was left was overeating and the nauseous feeling that accompanies pushing yourself to consume more fried chicken than any one human being rightfully should .
Advertisement
Taste : Like grief , the Double Down is experienced in stages .
First comes the deceptive sense of relief that the Double Down is n’t as terrible as it initially appears .
As I devoured my first bite , I embarked on a Proustian reverie that ushered me back to all the happy moments I ’ve shared at various KFCs .
Have I mentioned that I fucking love KFC ’s white - meat chicken ?

It was n’t long before reality sunk in .
The Double Down comes in a paper napkin holder designed to keep hands relatively grease - free .
But it also has a secondary purpose ; aesthetically , the Double Down is the ugliest thing in the world .
I was surprised that the cheese was n’t melted when I got my order .
I soon found out why ; partially congealed cheap - ass pepper - jack cheese looks disconcertingly like putrefied , runny mucus .
Every time I looked down at the giant gob of grease , meat , and cheese in my hands , I felt sick .
My stomach began to feel like a brick .
I wanted to quit after a few bites but I soldiered on , ignoring my increasingly intense stomach pain .
The Double Down did to my gastrointestinal system what Sherman did to the South , leaving a scorched - earth trail of destruction in its wake .
After the initial flavor burst of herbs and spices faded , I was left with a series of stomach - turning pairings , the most horrifying being really bad pepper - jack cheese — school - lunch cheap and school - lunch nasty — and odious bacon .

God clearly did not mean for humans to eat chicken , bacon , and low - quality , gelatinous cheese at the same time .
I was suddenly struck with a strange urge to keep kosher .
Each bite became a grueling endurance test , as the cheese and grease began to override the chicken breasts , and the sandwich grew more revolting - looking with each bite .

I began to feel sick .
Merely looking at my beloved potato wedges made me queasy .
Who could possibly devour two chicken breast patties , greasy bacon , and two slices of cheese , and still have room left over for fried potato wedges and a soda ?
For that matter , who would want to simultaneously eat two cheese - and - bacon - addled chicken - breast patties ?
What began as a pleasant surprise quickly devolved into a nightmare .
I struggled to keep the sandwich down .
I felt defeated , lost , overwhelmed .
I like cheese , I like bacon , and I like chicken breasts , but the combination was too much of a greasy thing .
I left that KFC a shattered man .
I had finished the Double Down .
Or had the Double Down finished me ?
So consider me your fast - food Paul Revere , sending out a warning throughout the land : The Double Down is coming !
The Double Down is coming !
Be afraid , dear reader .
Be very , very afraid .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) warned Texas Instruments ( TI ) today not to pursue its baseless legal threats against calculator hobbyists who blogged about potential modifications to the company 's programmable graphing calculators .
TI 's calculators perform a " signature check " that allows only approved operating systems to be loaded onto the hardware .
But researchers were able to reverse - engineer signing keys , allowing tinkers to install custom operating systems and unlock new functionality in the calculators ' hardware .
In response to this discovery , TI unleashed a torrent of demand letters claiming that the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) required the hobbyists to take down commentary about and links to the keys .
EFF represents three men who received such letters .
" The DMCA should not be abused to censor online discussion by people who are behaving perfectly legally , " said Tom Cross , who blogs at memestreams .
net .
" It 's legal to engage in reverse engineering , and its legal to talk about reverse engineering . "
In fact , the DMCA explicitly allows reverse engineering to create interoperable custom software like the programs the hobbyists are using .
Additionally , TI makes its software freely available on its website , so there is no connection between the use of the keys and unauthorized distribution of the code .
" This is not about copyright infringement .
This is about running your own software on your own device -- a calculator you legally bought , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick .
" Yet TI still issued empty legal threats in an attempt to shut down discussion of this legitimate tinkering .
Hobbyists are taking their own tools and making them better , in the best tradition of American innovation . "

Hi , I 've read the document said that " Tiny C Compiler Reference Documentation3.2 ISOC99 extensions
TCC implements many features of the new C standard : ISO C99 .
Currently missing items are : complex and imaginary numbers and variable length arrays . "
It 's been so many years , maybe it is time for us to complete the support for C99 , since there 're projects that follow the C99 syntax .
Thanks ,

CAMBRIDGE , Mass .
( AP ) — Construction workers putting support for a new deck at a Cambridge home dug up the concrete floor of a shed and found a skeleton buried there with a gun that appears about 100 years old .
Police spokesman Frank Pasquarello says an investigation the items found Thursday afternoon appear old and may be from a market on the property .
Forensic examinations are expected to reveal the age and gender of the skeletal remains found at the 149 - year - old home on Cambridge Street .
Homeowner Rosalie Foster says the discovery was “ unbelievable at first , and then it gets a little shocky and then you go ‘ Wow , I got a body ! ” ‘
Foster says police said she may claim the antique gun later on because it was found in her property .
One of the coolest things to happen at last year ’s Lost panel was Hurley Guy : a large , scruffy , longish - haired guy coming up to the Q&A mike wearing a green shirt .
The producers were as amused as the audience , and his prize for asking his question was a tub of Dharma ranch dressing .
I caught sight of him again on Friday afternoon of this year ’s con , dressed this time in a yellow “ I ( heart ) my Shih Tzu ” shirt and pajama pants with a plaid bathrobe .
I hung around him , waiting to ask for a picture , as he talked with his friends about when they planned to get to the line the next morning .
The consensus was 4 a.m. , which I found ridiculous .
Later , after giving up on the picture , I learned that people were already camping that night .
Even more ridiculous .
But for the kind of panel that this year ’s , the final Lost panel , was , I can see how they ’d decide it was utterly worth it .
I arrived on the Plaza Park lawn as soon as the 8 a.m. shuttle could get me there .
No one noticed I was dressed to resemble Kate , and Hurley Guy was nowhere in sight to beg for a photo .
The doors opened at about 10:30 for the 11:00 panel , and on the way in we were handed pencils and fliers for “ Lost University ” ( and I also got the “ 9 ” card being handed out as a promo for 9 ) .
We found out what that was all about at the beginning of the panel , when a clip advertising the website ( lostuniversity.org ) was played .
I have n’t looked at the site , so I do n’t know if it ’s another ARG or another fan - gathering site .
But with “ test ” questions and “ schedules ” involving polar bears and hunting boars , it ’s bound to be at least slightly funny .
I believe this was also where there were some clips played of “ things that might happen ” in an altered world of Lost .
I ca n’t remember precisely where this bit was , because I was a good fan and did n’t take pictures of any of the videos .
The lineup included a commercial for Mr. Cluck ’s featuring Hurley , who had apparently bought the company and had nothing but GOOD luck since winning the lottery .
The restaurant was featuring “ Australian ” combos to commemorate his return from his walkabout trip .
Then there was a segment from a “ Most Wanted Fugitives ” show , letting us know that Kate was still on the run .
Apparently , instead of killing her stepdad in the explosion , she ’d actually killed the underling he ’d sent back to the house to collect his tools .
The panel itself started with Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof saying that they planned to make this mostly Q&A , to give back to the fans .
And although they wanted to give out gifts to everyone who asked questions , like they had last year , the network had n’t given them the budget , so they ’d just brought one gift that would go to whoever said the secret word .
But everyone was to follow the standard rules and keep it to one question .
This was followed by a montage of the best fan videos found on the web , including the infamous “ Brokeback Island ” and some Robot Chicken - style stuff with action figures .
I ’d have liked to have a list of those , to look up later and watch in full .
The first question was about how a fan had heard season 6 would be reminiscent of season 1 , and how was that going to work ?
Apparently they ’re bringing back the unpredictability that ran rampant at the beginning .
To that end , they said that they ’re often asked if they ’re making it up as they go along , and insisted that they ’re not .
Just to prove it to us , each took from a “ secret hiding place ” one sheet of paper , and proclaimed them to be the last two pages of the series - finale script .
They located a stapler somewhere , stapled the sheets together , and put them into a double - locked box , each taking a key .
The box , they explained , would be taken by someone else to an undisclosed location after the panel , and on the night of the finale it would be brought to the Jimmy Kimmel set , where they ’d open it and read the script , to prove that the pages did indeed contain what had just been shown .
Gimmicky , but all is well and good .
Next , a guy comes up who ’s apparently well - known for doing wacky stuff ( not Bob Stencil , some other dude ) and presents the producers with a wrapped gift .
He opens it for them : a black velvet painting of the two of them with a polar bear .
The guy also plugged his website : damoncarltonandapolarbear.com .
( They repeated it back to him as “ damonANDcarltonandapolarbear , ” and he and the rest of us took great glee in correcting it . )
Again … have n’t dared to look .
They did accept the painting .
I believe that a bit after this is where the winner of the theme - song contest was announced .
I had n’t even known there was a contest … made me feel like a very bad fan .
The crew had mocked up a credits sequence to the winning composition , which , sadly , was n’t very clearly audible from where I was sitting .
But the sequence was cool .
So then , Hurley Guy took the mike .
Only , it was n’t Hurley Guy .
It was Jorge Garcia .
Wanting to know , apparently , if having the bomb plan succeed meant the previous five seasons would have all been for nothing , because that would seem like a huge cheat .
The producers explained that he ’d just have to trust them .
“ Yeah , ” he said , “ but the last time I trusted you guys you said Nikki and Paolo were gonna be awesome . ”
Then he asked whether it being the final season meant everything was going to be answered .
Like , when Jack and Sayid were torturing Sawyer over Shannon ’s inhaler , but he did n’t have it … where exactly was the inhaler ?
Oh JEEZ , Jorge … ” What happened to one question per person ?? ? ”
At that point , the cheering from the front got waaaay too loud to just be about the witty banter …and soon , Michael Emerson appeared on the screen , needling Jorge about the question , his character , and everything in general .
He was very much in character as Ben , and when Jorge brought this up , saying he himself was acting when playing Hurley , he responded with , “ Acting .
Is that what you do . ”
It went on for what seemed like quite a while , but I ca n’t remember much , except how a comment about how Hurley was played “ broadly ” got a general condemnatory “ oooooooouw ” from the audience .
Jorge accused him of being jealous over not having won the role of Hurley , and he protested that he ’d never tried out .
And then , of course , an “ audition tape ” was played , during which both actors migrated to the stage .
Bob Stencil made his appearance after this , with a variation on the time - loop question , and pretended to get very confused about it and get a nosebleed .
“ Oh… gotta find my constant ! ”
The producers had been expecting him and had a custom T - shirt ready for him .
He was thrilled .
A fan asked the eternal question : “ Does Nestor Carbonell wear eyeliner ? ” Cuse and Lindelof said they get this all the time ( and they do ; I was headdesking as best I could with a program booklet ) , and that Nestor was in the back right now getting ready so they ’d just go to the video feed so he could answer it .
The video was of him at a makeup mirror talking to himself and applying eyeliner .
After ample laughter time , he looked at the pencil and said , “ This is Charcoal .
I never use Charcoal . ”
And went into what I presume is a Christian - Bale - style rant at one of the ( probably imaginary ) staff .
When the lights came up , he was at the front table with the others .
The real Hurley Guy came to the mike after this , both to ask a question and to thank Jorge and the show for giving him a character he could identify with .
At that point , Cuse and Lindelof decided it was time to give us clues about the secret word , which no one had yet said .
“ Think …blonde .
Pregnant . ”
The audience of course started yelling “ Claire ” but we were reminded that it could only get you a prize at the mike .
Surprisingly , the next question asker did n’t work it in ; I guess he really wanted to ask the question he wanted to ask .
But the next guy did it , and cleverly .
His prize was a seagull statue , to commemorate the bird that Claire had been interacting with in one episode .
There was one final guest to bring out , and we would get a clip intro for a clue .
Jack ?
Kate ?
Nope , Sawyer .
Audience just about melted .
( And with good reason , if you fancy him ; the clips were calculated for their hotness factor . )
Josh Holloway came out and sat next to Lindelof , and started up what sounded like an innocuous conversation about their “ making it up ” bit with the box .
Then he pulled out a small object and said , “ You know what this is ? ”
“ Looks like a taser , ” says Lindelof .
“ Yeah !
Wanna see if it works ? ”
He shoves the thing into Lindelof ’s shoulder , and the sound system plays a buzzing noise … about two seconds after the spasming act is over .
So then , after grabbing the key , he threatens Cuse with the taser , saying he ’ll meet the same fate as his friend JJ Abrams .
“ That ’s not JJ Abrams .
That ’s Damon Lindelof . ” “ Lindel … Linda who ? ”
And he stuck Lindelof ’s hand in the pitcher of ice water .
Of course , Josh gets both keys and extracts the script pages from the box , with plenty of Sawyer - style nicknames and snark , then stands there and looks at the pages in confusion .
“ You ca n’t read ! ” crows Cuse , and Emerson grabs the pages and puts on Ben - like glasses .
“ Sylar and Parkman stand beneath the big top … ”
Half the audience is confused ; the other half , including me , is laughing too hard to hear much .
“ You have to go on , Parkman … you ’re the last Petrelli . ”
“ What the f**k is this ? ”
Finally , they played an “ In Memoriam ” montage of a bunch of characters who ’d died over the course of the show , starting with the guy who got sucked into the engine ( forgot his name ) and ending with a rather long bit about Charlie .
Having heard what had happened at the Flash Forward panel on Thursday , I began to get suspicious and got my camera ready .
Sure enough , surprise !
Dominic Monaghan came out onstage .
He was there for all of 30 seconds and did n’t get to say anything ; and of three pictures I managed to take , one ’s blurry , one does n’t let you see who he is , and in the third he ’s behind Josh .
Figures .
( I picked the blurry one . )
But I ’m not complaining .
If they wanted to give a gift to the fans , this panel was a good one .
Thanks , guys .

India intends to harness the passion - killing properties of late - night television to help to control a potentially catastrophic population explosion .
Ghulam Nabi Azad , the Health and Family Welfare Minister , has called for the country to redouble its efforts to bring electricity to all of its huge rural population .
The introduction of the electric light and television sets to those vast areas that still did not have them would discourage procreation , he argued .
“ If there is electricity in every village , then people will watch TV till late at night and then fall asleep .
They wo n’t get a chance to produce children , ” Mr Azad said .
“ When there is no electricity there is nothing else to do but produce babies . ”
He added : “ Do n’t think that I am saying this in a lighter vein .
I am serious .
TV will have a great impact .
It ’s a great medium to tackle the problem . . . 80 per cent of population growth can be reduced through TV . ”
India ’s population has trebled since independence in 1947 to about 1.2 billion after an agricultural revolution , which helped to banish famine , and developmental progress extended life expectancy .
The country , whose population is growing by about 1.6 per cent a year , accounts for about 17 per cent of the world ’s people but occupies less than 3 per cent of its land area .

The Democrats ’ newest quote machine was in fine form Thursday , suggesting that former Vice President Dick Cheney is a vampire .
Speaking on Hardball , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) denounced Cheney ’s attacks on President Barack Obama , who posited that Obama was “ dithering ” in failing to endorse a troop surge .
“ I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes , because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he ’s talking , ” Grayson quipped .
“ But my response is this :
He ’s just angry because the president does n’t shoot old men in the face .
But by the way , when he was done speaking , did he just then turn into a bat and fly away ? ”

Matthews , somewhat aghast , replied : “ Oh God — we gotta keep a level here .
Let me ask you this :
Do n’t you have any Republican friends ? ”
Grayson laughed .
“ Some of my best friends are Republicans , ” Grayson answered .
On Wednesday , Grayson offered another quote that made the rounds , saying , “ Fox News and their Republican collaborators are the enemy of America .
They ’re the enemy of anybody who cares about health care in this country , the enemy of anybody who cares about educating their children , the enemy of anybody who wants energy independence or anything good for this country .
And certainly the enemy of peace , there ’s no doubt about that .
They are the enemy . ”

MOGADISHU , Somalia 
Fierce fighting exploded in this capital city on Friday night and Saturday morning , and witnesses said at least 10 people had been killed in the past two days , possibly including a Somali - American who had joined the insurgents .
One battle began on Friday after soldiers from Somalia ’s transitional government attacked an insurgent base with mortars and machine guns .
“ Soon after breaking fast , ” said Fatima Elmi , a Mogadishu resident , referring to the evening Ramadan holiday ritual , “ we heard strange noises of weapons and we ran into a concrete building nearby . ”
The government forces pushed back the insurgents , who belonged to an extremist Islamist group called the Shabab .
But by Saturday morning , witnesses said , the Shabab had recaptured the territory and once again remained in firm control of most of Mogadishu .
The hair has also run into trouble , with critics decrying a preference for long and straight over short and frizzy .
A So In Style hairstyling set that allows girls to straighten their dolls ' hair completely has alarmed observers , who say it will fuel the " beauty issues " that many black girls have .
On Monday Lady_Aleena posted her first ever module for D&D fans .
Today in the CB , herveus told us about his module Weaving : : Tablet which generates patterns for a weaving machine .
I thought that was pretty cool , so I tried look up other hobbyist related modules on CPAN .
I did n't have much luck with crossstitch , needlepoint , knitting or even pattern .
The last however just had too many hits to go through .
purl pulled up a few hits , but they were n't exactly games .
I had a bit more luck with baseball , football ( N.B. that was by a soccer fan , not an American football fan ) , soccer , tennis and basketball .
I even found hits for blackjack .
music also turned up a lot of interesting modules ( +300 ! ) .
In addition to reams of modules for various music file formats , there were modules to retrieve Yahoo music ratings , compose music using gestalts , fetch lyrics , and track distribution history .
Under games I found several modules for fans of cards , chess , checkers , bingo , various adventure games , SuperMario ( TM ) , and of course , modules that implement the traditional on - line games from my computer " childhood " - worms , hunt the wumpus , and rogue .
I have a feeling there are lots more out there .
So what hobbiest modules do you know about ?
What is your favorite ?
Have you written one ?
Did you publish it ?
Why or why not ?

Hey , what do you know , Acer just kicked out its first Android handset into the mystical kingdom of donuts and Snapdragons .
Liquid , a rebranded ( and slightly restyled ) A1 , brings a 800 x 480 WVGA capacitive touchscreen upon which you 'll watch Android 1.6 ride that peppy Snapdragon processor .
It 's presumably tuned to 1GHz ( or higher ) and not 768MHz as listed on the eXpansys Germany spec- sheet -- a trick that 'll make this the fastest Android handset on the planet .
Of course , what would Android be without some tweaking ?
Acer promises a bevy of unique features such as improved power management , a new UI with tight entertainment and web integration , geo - tagging , a " Spinlets " application for access to streaming video and music , and full address book integration with Facebook , Twitter , Flickr , and other social media houses .
Unfortunately , that 's all the detail that Acer 's willing to spill at the moment ; dates , real specs , and prices when we get 'em . [ Via ElectricPig and SlashGear

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A top Taliban leader in Pakistan is buying and selling children for suicide bombings , Pakistani and U.S. officials said .
Children are shown at a training camp in this video footage shot by the Taliban .
Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud has been increasingly using the children in attacks , the officials said .
A video released by Pakistan 's military shows the children training for the task .
In the video of a training camp , children can be seen going through exercises .
Mehsud has been selling the children , once trained , to other Taliban officials for $ 6,000 to $ 12,000 , Pakistani military officials said .
Watch more about the child bombers »
Some of the children are as young as 11 , the officials said .
" He has been admitting he holds a training center for young boys , for preparing them for suicide bombing .
So he is on record saying all this , accepting these crimes , " said Major General Akhtar Abbas , spokesman for the Pakistani army .
The young suicide bombers may be able to reach targets unnoticed , the military said .
" If he is approaching on foot , there is a possibility he will bypass security , " Abbas said .
" In certain areas , there is a possibility in the population centers everyone can not be checked physically , so he can create havoc there . "
Pakistan has launched an offensive against the Taliban , started in the Swat region of the North West Frontier Province .
The Taliban have countered with a spate of suicide bombings , including a July 2 attack in Rawalpindi , in which a suicide bomber on a motorcycle struck a Pakistani Defense Ministry bus .
At least one person was killed and 29 others were wounded .
Pakistan 's army said it is hunting Mehsud in the hopes that the supply of suicide bombers will dry up after the Taliban leader is captured .
Meanwhile , a suspected U.S. drone attack killed at least 12 people and wounded five others in northwest Pakistan Tuesday , Pakistani officials said .
The missile strikes in South Waziristan targeted a suspected Taliban hideout at a madrassa , or Muslim school , in Zangarah , according to intelligence officials .
The attack near the border with Afghanistan involved a pair of missiles shot from an unmanned drone , local resident Janbaz Mehsud told CNN .
He said all the dead and wounded were Taliban .
A local government official , who asked not to be named , said the madrassa was a training center for the Taliban and belongs to Baitullah Mehsud .
That official put the death toll at 14 , but said the number of dead could rise .
The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone attacks .
However , the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely .

Why are we asking this now ?
A report released yesterday by the UK Drug Policy Commission paints a worrying picture of Britain 's drug market .
Among the key findings is the fact that nine out of 10 police and law enforcement agencies questioned said it was " unlikely " that UK drugs markets would be eradicated in the near future .
The report also says that drug dealers are becoming better at avoiding having their operations shut down .
It says that , even when drugs are seized and arrests made , the drug market is " quick to adapt " .
The report suggests moving drug dealers from residential neighbourhoods to different areas where they would cause less harm could help solve the problem .
And it discusses the idea of the police opening up a dialogue with drug dealers .
How bad is Britain 's drug problem ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The report follows on from figures released by the Government which revealed that the number of cocaine users in Britain has risen by 25 per cent in a year to almost one million .
The figures showed that one in 10 people admitted trying the drug – three times as many as 15 years ago .
More than 10 m people in Britain – about 15 per cent of the population – have tried cannabis although the popularity of that drug has fallen in the past 15 years .
Although there is no way of knowing how many drug addicts there are in the UK – since only those who seek help are accounted for – the number of people taking methadone or similar substances in England is about 131,500 .
What is wrong with taking drugs ?
Many people who take drugs will claim that it is their own choice and , if they are not harming anyone , what is the problem ?
The issue is that , even if the person taking the drugs is not committing any further crimes , there is a very clear link between drugs and organised crime .
In the UK , the profits made by drugs gangs allow them to channel their energies and money into more lucrative criminal enterprises , be that simply buying larger amounts of drugs or other activities such as people trafficking or firearms dealing .
It also funds terror overseas .
Much of the cocaine in Britain , for example , is made by south - American rebel groups who use the profits from the drug to commit further crime in their own countries .
Much more immediately though is the crime that drug addicts create in search of money to fund their habit .
This will manifest itself in acquisitive crime such as theft and burglary .
Many violent crimes too are carried out by those high on drugs .
The latest Government figures show that 17 per cent of violent crime is committed by people under the influence of drugs .
The crime factor aside , drugs are not good for the health .
Cocaine is cut with various chemicals which can not be good for the body .
It is also said to increase the risk of heart problems if used frequently , while sustained use of cannabis has been linked to symptoms of psychosis .
How are the police faring in tackling the problem ?
The detection rates for drug offences in the UK have always been very high .
In 2008/09 , for example , of the nearly 250,000 drug offences that were committed in the UK , 95 per cent were solved .
Compare this with the fact that only around 14 per cent of criminal damage offences are solved and it appears that the police are winning the war on drugs .
This is misleading , though , because while criminal damage offences will be reported by the victim and then the police attempt to solve the case , drug offences , which are mainly possession , never come to light until a victim is apprehended .
Therefore police both discover and solve the crime at the same time .
But it is the problems that drug addiction causes police that is more worrying – the increase in theft and other acquisitive crime .
What measures are being taken to alleviate drug - related crime ?
A scheme has been running in three health districts of the UK – Maudsley in south London , Darlington and Brighton – where heroin addicts can go to a clinic and have a free shot of heroin injected .
It has been running for three years and the organisers have hailed it a success .
It not only means that drugs are administered in medically controlled surroundings , but that users being given free drugs have no need to steal to fund their habit .
Critics say it is legalising drugs .
So should we legalise drugs ?

Many have suggested doing so , saying that it would eliminate the organised crime that thrives on the money created by drug networks .
But critics of the suggestion say that , without the threat of a criminal record , drugs would become socially acceptable and legalisation would encourage more people to take them .
Relocating drug dealers was portrayed in the TV series The Wire .
Would it work here ?
Series three of the US television series The Wire deals with the problem of drug abuse in the city of Baltimore .
The sheer number of drug markets in the city means that neighbourhoods are destroyed by the trade .
As a solution , drug dealers are moved to " free - zones " – areas of the city where no one lives , where they can deal drugs without the threat of arrest .
The UK Drug Policy Commission report does not explicitly suggest the creation of " free- zones " , but does recommend " seeking to displace a market to another area , where it will have less impact ... for instance by displacing a market from a residential area to an industrial estate .
Thus the focus is not so much on reducing the amount of drug dealing but rather on reducing the harms associated with the way dealing operates in this particular area . "
Such a move would certainly be desirable , especially to those living in areas blighted by drug use .
But it would not provide a solution ; people would still be selling and taking drugs , creating money for criminals .
In fact it could exacerbate the problem – opening up a dialogue with drug dealers and moving them to another area could give them the impression that drug dealing in the new area is allowed .
Should the police talk to drug - dealers ?
The UK Drug Policy Commission report cites the example of the Boston Gun Project , which saw police officers in the American city hold meetings with violent gangs .
When they gave them , according to the report , " a direct , explicit warning that further violence would bring a swift and heavy response , a dramatic reduction in violent incidents was achieved " .
The suggestion is that if British police met with drug dealers to warn them that they are known and will be prosecuted if they continue , a reduction in drug dealing would materialise .
The problem is that drug dealers clearly already know that they face the threat of prosecution and a lengthy prison sentence if caught , yet they persist .
Why would an explicit threat from a police officer make them stop ?
It also raise the slightly cynical question , if the police already know who the main drug dealers in their areas are , then why not concentrate on arresting them , rather than just warning them ?
Would a dialogue with dealers help to reduce drug - related offences ?
Yes ...
* Moving drug - dealers into uninhabited areas would reduce the crime that drugs bring to neighbourhoods
* Telling drug dealers that they are known to the police could force them to desist
* The approach used so far is not working .
A new tactic could be no worse than the current strategy
No ...
* Drug dealers know the risks .
They will continue selling drugs regardless of any explicit threat
* Putting drug - dealers and users in a pre-designated area is giving them tacit approval to deal and take drugs
* The police 's job should be to arrest criminals , not to make their illegal enterprises easier

In a mixing bowl pour in 1 cup lukewarm water ; sprinkle with 1 tsp sugar and the yeast .
Let proof for 10 minutes in a warm place .
Whisk in the remaining water , oil , sugar and salt .
Stir in flour 1 /2 cup at a time to make a stiff dough .
Knead for 4 or 5 minutes or until smooth , satiny , elastic and bounces back when pressed lightly with a finger .
Consistency of an earlobe .
Wipe bowl lightly with oil , drop in dough and turn to coat .
Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in warm location ( oven with light on works well ) till doubled , 1 - 1 1/2 hours .
Punch dough down , divide into three , and shape into loaves .
Put loaves in lightly greased pans , cover , and return to oven for another hour .
Remove loaves , keep covered , and pre - heat oven to 400 F. ( 200 C ) .
Put bread in for 15 minutes at 400 , then 15 more minutes at 375 .
Remove and turn loaves out on to counter / cooling rack .

Wait for loaves to cool a bit , then slice and enjoy .
Baking your own daily bread is something you can do with a minimum of equipment , ingredients and knowledge .
Doing so will improve your diet , and your life .
It a wondrous tactile experience making it , and an odoriferous delight baking it .
Kneading a warm blob of dough for 5 meditative minutes is the antidote for a busy world , and fresh loaves on the counter are better than dollars in the bank .
No wonder ' dough ' and ' bread ' have been slang for money .
Bread 's importance as a food staple over thousands of years makes a comparison with cash warranted .
It is as important a part of our diet today as it ever was , and is referred to as ' the staff of life ' for good reasons .
This staff sustained millions of poor through the Middle Ages , caused riots and uprisings , and has been mentioned repeatedly in writings across the ages .
Having our daily bread means we are able to work on improving ourselves and the world around us .
Without our ' bread ' we are reduced to survival .
Providing this basic food source for yourself and your family has the potential to be a powerfully satisfying activity .
Baking your own bread fits with the trend toward eating as locally as possible .
If you are lucky enough to have a nearby source of wheat your baking becomes a sustainable activity that will eliminate problems associated with buying industrial bread transported from away .
Seven years ago I decided to try my hand at baking bread .
I was not satisfied with dollar per loaf bread , and the more substantial loaves I liked were expensive .
They also had ingredients I would never add myself , such as glucose - fructose , calciumtartaric acid esters of mono and , vegetable , sodium - 2- , and the list goes on , and on , and on .
Some of the additives used in industrial bakeries allow a faster baking time and the use of lower grade flours .
Other additives make sure the bread does not go bad during shipping .
It wo n't do that until you buy it and take it home .
I bought my first 10kg ( 20 lb ) bag of flour , and started channelling my grandmother 's legendary baking skills .
When I was a child , my grandparent 's visits were anticipated for a variety of reasons .
Prime among them was that a visit meant shortly after arrival , our kitchen would be covered from top to bottom with a bounty of baked goods .
Grandma would whip into our kitchen and take over .
She assembled equipment and managed ingredients with military precision .
" She does n't even need any recipes , " I marveled as I looked on through a flurry of flour and activity .
I watched her pummel large heaps of dough .
It looked like the folds of skin that swung gently from her strong arms , in time with her kneading .
She may of been attacking the dough with vigor , but her demeanor was calm , and she hummed quietly to herself as she worked and created her magic .
She was content and relaxed , and smiled a little smile .
It was cold outside .
The kitchen was warm .
Before long baking odors would be eliciting generous amounts of drool in little mouths .
Our eyes would be as big as plates as we viewed the sugar - encrusted donuts , bread , dinner rolls , cinnamon rolls , cakes and pies scattered over every available surface .
Twisted donut creations , the name and recipe of which grandma may have taken to the big bakery in the sky when she ' rose ' to that lofty position , were family favourites .
My personal preference was the bread , though .
Puffy , golden crust , white , moist crumb ( the inside bits ) .
Before long a loaf would be sliced open , steamy , yeasty , and fresh .
We would mix butter and honey in equal parts and spread that on the still warm slices .
I have since learned that the basics of bread making are easy to learn . , like chapati or tortillas , are simply flour and water .
You may already make pancakes , another of my favourite bread products .
Add a bit of yeast , oil , sugar , salt , and water to flour and you can make beautiful , basic loaves .
A slightly different mix , a few tablespoons of olive oil and you have an amazing pizza crust .
Pita bread , raisin bread , cinnamon rolls , biscuits , burger buns ...
Once the basics are learned anything is possible .
With wholesome ingredients you can't go wrong .
I have not had a failure in seven years .
I have had a few projects that needed to be re-branded , though .
For example , a heavy bread that did n't rise as much as anticipated became ' bagel bread ' .
Tasted great .
After a few times you can begin to play and add your own creative touches .
It is easy to feel child - like with your hands deep in dough .
Kids love baking bread , and since it is very straight forward activity , they can participate fully .
There is the promise of a yummy food at the end , plus the rewards of doing it yourself .
This promise holds whether you are a kid , or a kid at heart .
Does baking your own bread save money ?
Short answer - yes .
I have not done a detailed accounting because I firmly believe that time spent baking is not deducted from your lifetime total .
It may even prolong your lifespan , and that is just for the baking part .
If you are baking whole wheat bread there are added benefits in the eating .
The fiber is like a - rooter for you digestive tract , and healthy inside means healthy outside .
The following lists everything I made with one of my recent bags of flour ( 10kg ) : A quick and rough estimate of how much it would cost to purchase these products - made came to about $ 170.00 dollars .
Before the global economic crisis a bag of flour cost me about $ 5.00 dollars .
During food riot time that same bag was $ 12.00 .
That was about a year ago , and for some reason the baking area of my grocery store often looked like there had been a riot just before I got there .
I grabbed my flour and ran .
Things appear to have settled down since then and now a bag of whole wheat flour is about $ 6.00 and I can walk to the till .
But even at the most expensive , it still looks to me like a bargain .
And you can't put a price on the enjoyment of manipulating ingredients to create a staple , wholesome , life - sustaining food such as your daily bread .
My basic whole wheat bread recipe ( makes 3 loaves ) : 3 cups lukewarm water 750ml1 tsp sugar 5 ml2 tbsp dry yeast 25 m l 1 / 2 cup vegetable oil 125 m l 1 / 2 cup sugar 125m l1 tbsp salt 15 ml9 cups whole wheat flourAll in all I spend about 20 minutes from start to first dough rising .
Punching down , forming loaves , greasing pans and back in oven for second rising takes about another 20 minutes .
By this point the bulk of work is done .
After the second rising all that is left is the baking , the cooling , and the eating .
Clean up is wiping the bread pans lightly with a damp , warm cloth , letting them dry and putting them away .
Good luck , and have fun .
May you find enjoyment in the meditative pace that a day of baking provides .
Learn with your kids .
What a wonderful skill to pass on to them .
Eat better , and reduce your impact at the same time .
Learn to bake your own daily bread .
Your ancestors did it .
You can do it .
10 Field Trips
Remember the pleasure of getting to miss a day of school to goof around with your friends while not listening to a weirdo museum tour guide go on about some crap you ’re not going to be tested on ?
I do .
Now the closest thing I get to a field trip is forcing myself to eat an extra Taco Bell Chalupa on my lunch break so I can spend the next hour of work taking a shit .
9 You were bigger and better than somebody
The hierarchy that existed within middle schools is the only social system that has ever made sense to me .
Whenever life got you down or someone was giving you a hard time , there was an entire grade of kids younger and smaller than you to take it out on .
This safety net was enough to make the humdrums and hardships of middle school life tolerable .
Now , when your boss yells at you , you turn around and bitch out your intern .
The intern calls his dad , who knows your boss and you get yelled at again .
Something here is messed up .
8 You could still be anything you wanted
Remember being told that you could grow up and be anything you wanted ?
The parents of our generation filled our heads with this idealistic propaganda that the world was a place of opportunity .
On my block alone there were three astronauts , two rock stars , five presidents of the United States , 12 profession athletes and one tattoo artist ( Timmy was a bit odd ) .
The inveterate concept and all likelihood of being able to be anything you want slowly washed away as the tide brought in more practical prospects .
Now you ’re 24 , working at a Chuck E. Cheese and throwing a fit because some little bastard kid beat your high score on Time Crisis III .
Your mom , instead of telling you that you can be whatever you want , is telling you to move out of her basement and the closest you get to being an astronaut is getting blazed out of your skull from an eighth of this new hydroponic shit that just came in from Canada sold to you by old neighbor Timmy .
7 Pranks and sexual harassment were still acceptable
In the old days a good , elaborate prank went a long way .
Whether it was something like a whoopee cushion or peeping in the girls locker room , it was guaranteed good fun .
Try and pull a stunt like that in the office and you ’re guaranteed a lawsuit .
For example , a colleague of mine , or should I say former colleague of mine , got fired for turning his pockets inside out , whipping out his dick and pretending to be an elephant .
It ’s just not fair .
6 Girls Were n’t Ruining My Life
In middle school all you had to do was treat a girl like dirt and she would stick to you like mud .
If that did n’t work just have your friends do all the talking .
They did n’t care how much money you made , because no one made any .
Every girl was a virgin , no one had STDs , and shooting blanks was the most effective contraceptive .
A girl ’s body was still uncharted waters and unexplored territory rather than that neighborhood that used to be nice , but started to wear down a bit ; now cops do n’t go there and there is a hooker on every block .
Those were the days .
I do n’t know why I wasted them begging my older brother to buy me playboys … there were way better porno mags to be had .
5 You were able to eat anything
Fresh off my latest coronary , I long for the days when ice cream was a meal , candy was a snack and pussy was n’t too laced with mercury to eat .
4 You did n’t need alcohol to have fun
Remember when you are a kid and you could have fun without the help of drugs and alcohol ?
Imaginary force - fields , crayons , sticks , spinning around in circles and thumb wars were just a few of the things we used to find thoroughly entertaining .
Now , I ca n’t even imagine sitting down to a family dinner without at least 3 drinks in me .
It ’s gotten so bad that I ca n’t even go to the movies anymore because by the time the previews are over I am not even high anymore .
3 Summers meant something
The first large chunk of our existence on this planet was spent crossing off calendar days until summer arrives .
You used to relentlessly look forward to flipping all your teachers the bird and entering those golden days ; the days where it was socially acceptable to play your Alice Cooper CD on repeat and fulfill every human being ’s dream of doing absolutely nothing .
Now , if anything , summers mean back sweat , swamp ass , getting your ball sack stuck to your leg and dick stuck to your sack .
Summers mean weekends at your girlfriend ’s parent ’s house and getting weird looks from people because you ’re an overweight , balding man running after an ice cream truck .
No worries , only about 14,479 days left until retirement .
2 People were proud of you for things
There was a time when parents , teachers and friends used to shell out vast amount of praise for even the most pedestrian of accomplishments .
Shit , we had it so good people were even proud of us for flat out failing at certain tasks .
Whether it was doing some god awful performance at a talent show , striking out 3 times in a row in a little league game or making fun of the foreign kid ’s glasses , we were rewarded with applause , ice cream and high fives .
Now , no one is proud of you for anything , there ’s just different degrees of disappointment .
1 Energy
Remember the days before energy was served exclusively in a can and our bodies just produced it naturally ?
It ’s hard to believe that as a kid we actually had too much energy , so much so that our parents refused to serve us certain foods .
Now , regardless of what I am doing , where I am or who I am with , I am pretty sure I could fall asleep on command .
I need about three red bulls , two mountain dews and a line of cocaine just to finish a game of Madden .
Presented by : The Ultimate Hatelist
The fanatical group Islam4UK has ­announced plans to hold a potentially ­incendiary rally in London later this month .
And it is calling for a complete upheaval of the British legal system , its officials and ­legislation .
Members have urged Muslims from all over Britain to converge on the capital on October 31 for a procession to demand the full implementation of sharia law .
On a website to promote their cause they deride British institutions , showing a mock - up picture of Nelson ’s Column surmounted by a minaret .
Plans for the demonstration have been ­delivered to the Metropolitan Police and could see up to 5,000 extremists marching to demand the controversial system .
The procession – dubbed March 4 Shari’ah – will start at the House of Commons , which the group ’s website describes as the “ very place where the lives of millions of people in the UK are changed and it is from here where unjust wars are launched ” .
The group then intends to march to 10 Downing Street and “ call for the removal of the tyrant Gordon Brown from power ” .
The march will then converge on Trafalgar Square where protesters expect it “ will gather even more support from tourists and members of the public , making clear in the heart of London the need for Shari’ah in society ” .
The group declared : “ We hereby request all Muslims in the United Kingdom , in Manchester , Leeds , Cardiff , Glasgow and all other places to join us and collectively declare that as submitters to Almighty Allah , we have had enough of democracy and man-made law and the depravity of the British culture .
“ On this day we will call for a complete upheaval of the British ruling system its members and legislature , and demand the full implementation of Shari’ah in Britain . ”
Last night politicians and fellow Muslims condemned the group ’s incendiary comments , which come in the wake of recent violent incidents in towns and cities like Manchester , Birmingham and Luton , Beds .
Conservative MP and ex-Army officer Patrick Mercer said : “ It is extremely distasteful and is stoking the fires of fear within the British public .
“ If anyone thinks that those views are a step forward in society they are seriously deluded .
They are repellent and repulsive . ”
The group was also attacked by Tory MP Philip Davies who said : “ This march is clearly a deliberate and provocative attempt to incite racial tension and disrupt community cohesion .
“ The simple solution is for these people to move to a country which already has sharia law . ”
A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Britain said : “ 99.999 per cent of Muslims despise these people .
This only serves to fuel racial ­tensions . ”
And Tory MP and Daily Express columnist Ann Widdecombe , said : “ You cannot have two legal systems side by side and the one we have now works and the British people are perfectly happy with it . ”
The rally has not yet been given final approval .
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said : “ We have received an application for the march but we have yet to meet with the organisers . ”
A Home Office spokesman said : “ Everyone has the right to express their view so long as it is done sensibly , without violence and does not incite religious hatred . ”
Plans for the march are revealed on the website Islam4UK , which is fronted by preacher Anjem Choudary who has also called for all British women to wear burkhas .
Explaining the Nelson ’s Column mock - up he said that under sharia law the construction and elevation of statues or idols is prohibited and consequently the statue of Nelson “ would be removed and demolished without hesitation ” .
At the base of the column the friezes would be replaced with Islamic decoration and giant urns would be filled with gold coins for the poor .
They are the last survivors : all that 's left of a once - vibrant civilisation which created its own religion and language , and gave special names to everything from the creatures of the rainforest to the stars of the night sky .
Just five people represent the entire remaining population of the Akuntsu , an ancient Amazonian tribe which a generation ago boasted several hundred members , but has been destroyed by a tragic mixture of hostility and neglect .
The indigenous community , which spent thousands of years in uncontacted seclusion , recently took an unwelcome step closer to extinction , with the death of its sixth last member , an elderly woman called Ururú .
Considered the matriarch of the Akuntsu , and shown in these pictures ( which were taken in 2006 , and are the most recent images of the tribe ) , Ururú died of old age , in a hut built from straw and leaves , on 1 October .
News of her death emerged last week , when the tribe was visited by human rights campaigners , who have spent the past decade campaigning to preserve their homeland from deforestation .
" I followed the funeral , " says Altair Algayer , a local representative of Funai , the Brazilian government agency which protects Indian territories .
" She died in a small house .
We heard weeping and rushed over , but she had already died . "
Ururú 's death means the entire population of the Akuntsu now consists of just three women and two men .
All of them are either close family relations , or no longer of child - bearing age – meaning that the tribe 's eventual disappearance is now inevitable .
The slow death of this indigenous community is far more than an unfortunate accident , however .
Instead , it represents the long - planned realisation of one of the most successful acts of genocide in human history .
And the fate of the Akuntsu is seen by lobby groups as an object lesson in the physical and cultural dangers faced by undiscovered tribes at so - called " first contact " .
Much of the Akuntsus ' story is – for obvious reasons – undocumented .
For millennia , they lived in obscurity , deep in the rainforest of Rondonia state , a remote region of western Brazil near the Bolivian border .
They hunted wild pig , agoutis and tapir , and had small gardens in their villages , where they would grow manioc ( or cassava ) and corn .
Then , in the 1980s , their death warrant was effectively signed : farmers and loggers were invited to begin exploring the region , cutting roads deep into the forest , and turning the once verdant wilderness into lucrative soya fields and cattle ranches .
Fiercely industrious , the new migrant workers knew that one thing might prevent them from creating profitable homesteads from the rainforest : the discovery of uncontacted tribes , whose land is protected from development under the Brazilian constitution .
As a result , frontiersmen who first came across the Akuntsu in the mid-1980s made a simple calculation .
The only way to prevent the government finding out about this indigenous community was to wipe them off the map .
At some point , believed to be around 1990 , scores of Akuntsu were massacred at a site roughly five hours ' drive from the town of Vilhena .
Only seven members of the tribe escaped , retreating deeper into the wilderness to survive .
Those seven were not formally " contacted " until 1995 , when Funai investigators finally made it to the region and were able to have a 26,000 - hectare area of forest protected for them .
They included the late Ururú , who was the sister of the tribe 's chief and shaman , Konibú .
" We know little of what Ururú 's life was like , " says Mr Algayer , who was among the Funai team that first discovered the tribe .
" In the 14 years that we have been with her , she was a happy , spontaneous person ...
She recounts that she had four children who were all shot dead during the massacre .
We do n't know who her husband was or how he died . "
One other member of the group of seven , known as Babakyhp , was killed in a freak accident in 2000 , when a tree blew over in a storm and landed on her hut .
The others , who still survive , are Pugapía , Konibú 's wife , who is roughly 50 years old , their daughters , Nãnoi and Enotéi , who are around 35 and 25 respectively , and a cousin , Pupak , who is in her forties .
Evidence of their suffering is visible in bullet wounds which both Konibú and Pupak showed to cameramen making a documentary about their struggle – Corumbiara : they shoot Indians , do n't they ?
– that was filmed over the last 20 years and has just been released in Brazil .
It is also evident in a simple fact : on its own , the Akuntsu gene pool cannot allow it to survive another generation .
Since tribal custom will apparently not allow outsiders to marry in , it is therefore effectively doomed .
The Akuntsu story is not unique .
Even if they escape persecution , communities that have never encountered the outside world often face tragedy .
Typically they lose between 50 and 80 per cent of their population in a matter of months , since they have no immunity to common diseases .
Ancient ways of life are also frequently corrupted by the arrival of outsiders .
Though indigenous tribes rarely have much interest in material possessions , and often do n't understand the concept of money , their traditional clothes and rituals are vulnerable to change .
Campaigners now hope the fate of the tribe , which will be publicly highlighted by Ururú 's death , will persuade the Brazilian people to further strengthen government protections for indigenous people .
Stephen Corry of Survival International , a human rights organisation that has been working with Funai , said : " The " Akuntsu are at the end of the road .
In a few decades this once vibrant and self - sufficient people will cease to exist and the world will have lost yet another piece of our astonishing human diversity .
" Their genocide is a terrible reminder that in the 21st century there are still uncontacted tribes in several continents who face annihilation as their lands are invaded , plundered and stolen .
Yet this situation can be reversed if governments uphold their land rights in accordance with international law .
" Public opinion is crucial – the more people speak up for tribal rights , the greater the chance that tribes like the Akuntsu will in future survive . "

Because the word itself means that there are too many people per unit of area .
That would bring a whole spectrum of problems for humans , not to mention for nature .
Also , inherent to the problem of overpopulation is that most recourses will become scarce .
If nothing is done against overpopulation the problem will solve itself naturally and that will not be a pretty sight .
So why do you not fear it ?

Sick Iraq war veteran dies after being given smoker 's cancerous lungs in transplant
Death sentence : Corporal Matthew Millington was given cancer
An Iraq war veteran died after a hospital transplant gave him a pair of cancerous lungs donated by a smoker .
Matthew Millington , 31 , a corporal in the Queen 's Royal Lancers , had the operation to save him from an incurable lung condition .
But the donated organs - from someone who smoked 30 to 50 roll - up cigarettes a day - gave him cancer .
Papworth Hospital in Cambridge , which carried out the transplant , said early X - rays on the organs did not find any sign of cancer .
In fact it had been missed .
The tumour was discovered only after six months .
Drugs to ensure Mr Millington 's body accepted the new organs actually sped up its spread .
The soldier from Stoke - on - Trent was given radiotherapy but finally died at home in February last year .
Mr Millington served in the Army from the day of his 16th birthday , but while in Iraq in 2005 he began to struggle with his breathing .
In 2006 he was found to have a serious condition and was told he would die in two years unless he had a transplant .
The soldier was relieved when a donation became available in April 2007 - but it turned out to be a further death sentence .
His widow Siobhan said : ' All he wanted was another set of lungs .
He said , " They 've given me a dud pair . " '
At an inquest , North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith recorded Mr Millington had died from ' complications of transplant surgery ' .
Papworth defended its use of smokers ' lungs in transplants and said all organs were screened rigorously .

A 24 - hour guard ?

Two locks ?

Honda has created a new Segway like robotic mobility device called U3 - X .
This device is small , lightweight and can be easily carried when not in use .
It works basically like a seat with a wheel that responds to your weight movement .
U3 - X features balance technology developed through the robotic research of ASIMO and uses an incline sensor to sense weight shifts and movement .
It also uses the HOT Drive System ( Omni- directional driving wheel system ) .
This is the world ’s first wheel structure to enable movement in all directions .

What Actually Bothers Me ...
The Case Against Sugiyama
The Whole Foods Controversy
Coda
A discussion erupted on popular gaming forum NeoGAF late yesterday morning .
A user named Coins posed the simple - sounding question , " Should we boycott ?
" The question sounds simple , but the issues behind it are complicated .
It 's salient because the game is derived from the fiction of Orson Scott Card , and Orson Scott Card is a political campaigner against gay rights .
Card sits on the board of directors of the National Organization for Marriage , an organization " founded in 2007 in response to the growing need for an organized opposition to same - sex marriage in state legislatures , " according to its website .
When you visit the site , a pop - up ad appears which contains a video defending ex-Miss California Carrie Prejean , who lost her crown amidst controversy about her opinions on the topic .
Everybody knows that same - sex marriage is one of the most politically - charged issues of the day .
Proposition 8 's passage last November was a defining moment in the SSM fight ; the battle has only intensified as victories for both sides of the argument continue to unfold across the country .
Before I continue with the piece , I should up - front say two things .
The first is : I 'm gay .
The second is : the purpose of this piece is not to advance the SSM cause .
While I feel passionately about the issue -- it 's a matter of public record on my personal blog , Twitter , and Facebook , which are all read by members of the industry -- it has nothing to do with " The Art & Business of Making Games " , which is Gamasutra 's mission and motto .
What does , however , is an examination of a boycott of a game , arising because some members of the gaming community feel strongly that one of the creative talents behind it is too strongly linked to a political cause .
Whenwas announced , I personally was torn .
I 'd already long since made the conscious decision to not support Orson Scott Card directly with my money .
I also would like nothing more than to play a new game developed in the vein of some of my personal favorites -- and , the game 's two biggest influences .
I did n't have to hem and haw very much , however , as Chair Entertainment sent me a download code for the game .
Not everyone is so lucky , however .
GayGamer offers up an interesting suggestion toward compromise in its thoughtful analysis of the issue : buy the game , and donate to a gay - positive charity to offset any profits that might funnel to Card .
While Card established the universe , along with Chair , that the game resides in , he did n't work directly on the title .
Dialogue was handled by Peter David , a comic book writer who GayGamer describes as " straight but extremely gay - friendly .
" Games are made by teams of individuals , and the scope of their contributions can widely vary .
This is where things get murky for the politically - minded gamer .
Boycotting Card 's books is a simple and easy decision .
But Card is n't nearly as in control of , nor benefiting as much from .
Further , the politics of the rest of the development team are not a matter of public record .
The issue became even more complicated for me , personally , yesterday .
Prior to my discovery of the brewing controversy , I spent an hour speaking to Chair 's creative director , Donald Mustard , and his wife and PR rep Laura aboutOver coffee , toast , and fruit , we chatted about the couple 's upcoming vacation to Paris -- which they can finally take now thathas shipped .
I made suggestions on what to do in the city and talked about my desire to return there with someone special for a romantic getaway .
I also mentioned that I 'm going to see my boyfriend , who lives in Michigan , over Labor Day weekend .
The Mustards were warm and open throughout the conversation , and Donald and I bonded over our shared love ofand , in an interview I 'm extremely excited to share with Gamasutra 's readership in the near future .
After the interview , I walked back to the Gamasutra offices , sat down at my desk , and signed on to AIM -- only to find out that something was brewing withon NeoGAF .
What 's most striking to me is the naivete of the discussion on NeoGAF , at least early on .
The thread was locked by moderator duckroll eight minutes after its creation , with the message , " The world was not created by Orson Scott Card , it was created by Chair Entertainment .
He is simply the author they are working with to create novels set in that world .
Please do better research before starting stupid threads like this in future .
" Duckroll reopened the thread 11 minutes later after conferring with another mod .
He later said , " I hope that what we generate here is actual discussion that is meaningful .
" That did n't happen quickly .
What bothers me is not that so many users are going to purchase .
What bothers me most is not , as you might assume , that some gamers who understand the issue will decide to buy the game to show support for Card , either as an artist whose work they enjoy or even as a political figure whose views they respect .
To argue against that would be childish ; that 's their right .
No , what bothers me is people who suggest that it's a non-issue because the topic of discussion is a game .
" Holy crap , it 's just a game , " says user intheinbetween .
" Do n't judge a picture by its painter , " suggests Lagunamov .
" Remember back when we were kids and we just enjoyed games ? " asks Wizman23
Yes , I do .
But we are not kids anymore .
I'm of the NES generation .
Born in 1977 , the same year as the Atari 2600 , I was 10 for the release of , 16 for the release of , and 20 for the release of , the touchstone games that inspired .
I was 32 on the day it became available for download on Xbox Live Arcade , and my life , it 's safe to say , has changed drastically .
I can't approach things the way I did as a child .
That 's not me being self - righteous ; I mean that Icannot do this .
Again , the crux of what I 'm getting at is not thatshould be boycotted .
I leave that for you to determine .
What I am attempting to examine is that there is a fundamental distinction between those who hold views and those who are board members of organizations that operate political action committees with specific agendas ; authors who write essays espousing political viewpoints .
That may be the relevant distinction .
Card has made waves with quotes like , " Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down . "
That is the kind of writing that can push a lot of people 's buttons for more than one reason .
And what I am wondering is -- as we age , as an audience , and as creators , and as we begin to understand the world more fully and hold views which have deep seated meaning to us , does that fundamentally affect our relationship to the medium ?
This is almost entirely new territory for games .
But it 's not entirely new .
Though it 's so far very rare , there 's another , similar controversy .
Koichi Sugiyama , the composer of the music in all nine of the primary installments of theseries , has his own political agenda .
That this series is generally regarded as the most popular franchise in the Japanese market -- the latest title , , has sold 3.64 million copies in four weeks makes it even more interesting .
Sugiyama is a right wing Japanese nationalist who denies the Rape of Nanking .
He 's not shy about it , either ; he was a signatory to an ad run in the Washington Post called " The Facts , " which publicly denies the generally accepted historical record .
" Where the Nanking ' Massacre ' and the comfort women are concerned , the facts are on our side , " says the advert .
Obviously , Sugiyama 's position is n't doing a hell of a lot to hurt the sales ofin the game 's home territory .
Most gamers are likely unaware or unconcerned that the series ' composer holds these views ; the games themselves , in fact , have extremely lighthearted and humanistic tales in which cities are much more likely to be bespelled by mysterious magic than sacked by desperate soldiers .
At least one user on NeoGAF has made theconnection and made a decision based on it .
Josh7289 says , " I personally boycott theseries because the composer , Koichi Sugiyama , denies the Japanese Empire 's guilt in the Nanking Massacre , and he publicly advertises / advocates his position .
"
The situation withmirrors another , much larger controversy taking place right now .
John Mackey , the CEO of the supermarket chain Whole Foods recently penned an op -ed for the Washington Post coming out against Obamacare .
Until that moment , I think most people had an unconsidered assumption that Whole Foods was a liberal organization -- because it sells bulk grain , tofu burgers , and organic spinach .
This is , in a word , naive .
Business is done by businessmen ; Whole Foods is successful because it caters to a lucrative market niche , not because it espouses an ideology .
While the company does carry different products than many more typical supermarket chains , presuming a politically liberal ideology on the part of the company on an unrelated issue was , obviously , a mistake -- but it 's one many made .
On political blog , The Daily Dish , a reader nails it on the head : " Are Mac users afficianadoes [ sic ] solely because of the software platform ?
Do Whole Foods shoppers patronize the chain solely because they like organic fruits ?
They 're lifestyle brands ; they connote status and priorities .
" But while I can both recognize that and still call Whole Foods boycotters naive for assuming the company was any more liberal than Wal - Mart -- which incidentally pulled its ads from Glenn Beck 's program on Fox News this week , making it look more liberal than Whole Foods , when you take the narrow view -- there 's a relevant distinction here .
Whole Foods sells organic vegetables .
Whole Foods arguably sells a lifestyle to Prius - owning suburbanites .
Whole Foods has , however , a limited capacity for advancing an ideology directly to its customers -- it 's limited to marketing materials and product selection .
A game , however , absolutely has that capacity . , by all accounts , has a rich narrative .
That story is based on the work of Orson Scott Card , who set out the foundations of the universe in his 2006 novel Empire .
According to Wikipedia , Empire 's plot is set in motion when " A radical leftist army calling itself the Progressive Restoration takes over New York City and declares itself the rightful government of the United States .
" I 'll let you read the " Literary significance and reception " section of the Wikipedia article if you like .
The short version is that it makes the book sound pretty right - wing .
That 's the funny thing about narrative art ; it can and does easily espouse ideologies .
When it comes toitself , NeoGAF poster Stumpokapow says , " if your objection is going to be based on in - game content , you 're in the clear . "
Though I 've not gotten far enough in the game yet to have my own take on its narrative ideology , signs from those who have point to Peter David and / or Chair showing restraint on the political overtones .
One friend told me " it subverts the Empire universe severely , " which is a funny twist on the whole controversy , if true .
I feel strongly about this medium , no matter how boneheaded the content can be -- and games likecan be pretty dopey , at least as far as I played it .
Not everybody in the audience cares about this ; hell , not everybodygames cares about this .
Whether you do or not , games are maturing and changing in meaningful ways .
I remember that Ulf Andersson , on his press tour for , honestly described the film the game was based on as " cool . "
I would describe it as vapid .
But the medium of film is not devalued by Wanted .
The medium of games is intrinsically capable of the heights of meaning and emotion that film is ; our discourse must rise to that level as well .
And that 's why it 's acceptable to talk about this .
That 's why it 's okay to skip buyingor .
If we can have meaningful political discussion in other media , we can have it in games .
And even ifitself does n't espouse views about same - sex marriage , in some way the product funds Orson Scott Card .
He may be best - known and loved as the author behind Ender 's Game , but he 's also a political activist .
He has become fair game .
I do n't know what Donald Mustard or any of the people at Chair who worked hard onthink about same sex marriage .
And even beyond that , I do n't know what ballot measures they support or reject .
I do know that when I was done talking to Mustard this morning , over an hour after I had initially mentioned it , he wished me well in my long distance relationship with my boyfriend in Michigan .
" It worked for us , " he said , referring to himself and his wife Laura .
For the first two years of their relationship , she lived in New York and he in Utah , he explained to me .
As I shook Mustard 's hand , wished him well , and thought about how much I wanted to get home and play , no political thoughts were in my mind .
That human connection -- that warmth -- means more to me than any political position .
Or I like to think it does .
As with anyone else , my desire to make a life for myself in this world absolutely irretrievably informs my political positions .
Same - sex marriage , then , is a crucial part of my own personal viewpoint .
And that 's the distinction that we 're now facing .
Are we " just gamers " , or are we adults ?
The NES generation has grown up .
Games have come a long way .
We can now tell stories ; we can now make statements .
And it 's not just the developers who have that power .
Uncovered :
The world 's only colour pictures of Germans ' World War Two surrender ... taken by a clerk hiding behind a tree
The only colour photographs of the German surrender of World War Two have emerged 64 years after being taken by a lowly clerk who hid behind a tree .
Crafty Ronald Playforth covertly captured one of the most historic events of the 20th century after sneaking into a clump of trees overlooking the scene of the surrender .
With his camera , he snapped Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery greeting the highest ranking officers of the remains of Hitler 's Third Reich outside his HQ tent .
War is over :
This distant colour snapshot from behind a hedge records the moment the German high command came to surrender to Montgomery in the spring sunshine on Lunerburg Heath on May 3 , 1945 signalling the end of the war
Although defeated and just days after the Fuhrer 's suicide , the never - seen - before photos show the German officers looking immaculate yet menacing in their long overcoats and jackboots .
Until now the only images of the momentous occasion in existence are the official black and white ones held by the Imperial War Museum .
Mr Playforth kept hold of his pictures along with a handwritten speech Montgomery wrote in March 1945 to rouse British soldiers ahead of a final push into Germany .
The historic items have remained in Mr Playforth 's family ever since but have now been made public for the first time as they are being sold at auction .
Andrew Aldridge , of Henry Aldridge Auctioneers of Devizes , Wilts , said : ' Playforth knew he was about to witness one of the most important events of the 20th century .
' He was of too low a rank to be present so he crept into the trees and bushes on the perimeter of the HQ tent and took four photographs using colour slides .
' As far as we know these are the only colour photographs to capture this historic event , all the others are black and white .
' Being in colour they add a third dimension to the event and bring it alive . '
In 1944 Ronald Playforth was a staff sergeant major and became Montgomery 's clerk and was at his side from D - Day until the end of the war .
In May 1945 he was stationed at Montgomery 's HQ at Luneburg Heath , near Hamburg , when the Nazi high command arrived to sign the papers for the surrender of the German armies in Europe .
Under cover : Ronald Playforth secretly took four unique colour slide pictures as the Nazi officers , who at well over 6ft tall , all towered over their adversaries as they agreed terms
SSM Playforth made himself scarce and darted into the woods just 30 yards from the men .
His pictures show Admiral Hans Georg von Friedeburg , the most senior member of the delegation , General Eberhard Kinzel , chief of staff of the north west Germany army , and Major Friedl , a 6ft 6ins Gestapo chief .
They depict the Nazis being received by Montgomery , who was wearing his customary black beret and army uniform , before they entered the tent to sign the surrender forms .
The day before Montgomery had laid down the terms of unconditional surrender to the same delegation at the same place .
Black and white :
The surrender at Luneburg Heath , the historic moment when leaders of the German forces in northwest Europe surrended to Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery
When the Germans tried to negotiate , he reportedly gave them a ' tongue lashing ' about the bombing of Coventry and the horrors of Belsen .
The delegation reported back to their HQ and Admiral Karl Doenitz - Hitler 's successor - and were given permission to sign the surrender papers , which they did the next day , May 4 .
When it was all over Montgomery is said to have leaned back and said simply : ' That concludes the surrender . '
Two of the German delegation - Kinzel and Friedeburg - committed suicide weeks later by taking cyanide while Friedl died in a car accident .
After the war SSM Playforth left the army and worked in local government before working in a managerial role at ICI .
He died 15 years ago aged in his 70s .
The four photographs and the handwritten speech were handed down through his family .
Part of the rousing speech , published in Soldier Magazine in 1945 , read : ' By no possible conceivable chance can Germany win this war .
Victory for the Allies , absolute and definite victory , is certain .
' We are fighting on German soil and we have entered the ring for tha last round , there is no time limit for this round , we shall continue until our opponent has had enough . '
It was handed by Montgomery to SSM Playforth who kept hold of it after typing it out .
Mr Aldridge said : ' We are expecting a lot of interest in these items , from private collectors to military museums . '
When I first met Michael Moore more than 20 years ago , he was showing a half - finished documentary to a few dozen people in a classroom in Ann Arbor , Michigan .
It was funny and poignant and had a powerful message .
He had taken a second mortgage on his house – equipment for filmmaking was a lot more expensive back then – and raised some money from like - minded locals for a long - shot venture .
We all loved what he showed us but thought he would be lucky if a few thousand people got to see it .
But the film , Roger and Me , about the irrationality and human cost of the destruction of America 's auto industry , was a smash hit and Moore was on his way to become America 's most influential documentary film - maker .
Twenty years later , he has produced his most radical work , which was greeted with rave enthusiasm when I saw it at the world 's oldest film festival in Venice .
As the old saying goes , you either blame the victim or blame the system .
Moore is making an appeal to blame it on the system , big time .
You know this film is going to be subversive when it opens with clips depicting actual bank robbers – caught on security cameras in the midst of their heists – grabbing their loot with Iggy Pop 's cover of Louie Louie ( a special version for the film ) blasting away in the background .
Moral equivalence for the titans of the financial industry , and their political protectors , is just around the corner .
Capitalism : a Love Story does n't just go after the seamy side of the American economy , although that is captured neatly in the scenes of " condo vultures " feeding on Florida 's housing bust , alongside the corporations ( including Wal - Mart and Amegy Bank ) which take out insurance policies on their employees and cash in big when they die young .
These ghoulish derivatives go by the charming name of " dead peasants " insurance – which says it all , really .
But Moore has bigger targets in his sights : he is questioning whether the whole incentive structure , moral values and political economy of American capitalism is fit for human beings .
Although this will not seem so radical in Europe , where most countries have had governments in the post - second world war era that at least called themselves socialist , or in most of the developing world , where socialist ideas have popular appeal , it 's pretty much unprecedented for something that can reach a mass audience in the US .
But you do n't have to be a revolutionary to appreciate this film .
Indeed , it can be seen as a social democratic treatise , with Franklin Roosevelt 's proposed " second bill of rights " – an " economic bill of rights " that included a job with a living wage , housing , medical care , and education – as its reform program .
Roosevelt is shown proposing this now forgotten program back in 1944 .
As in his previous films , Moore combines the grief and tragedy of the victims – people losing their homes and jobs – with hilarious comedy , cartoonish film clips from the 1950's , and sober testimony as needed .
And there are victories , too – as when workers occupy their factory in Chicago to win the pay that they are owed .
As an economist who operates in the think - tank world , I have to appreciate this work .
He gets the economic story right .
How is it that Michael Moore 's father could buy a house and raise a family on the income of one auto worker , and still have a pension for his retirement ?
And yet this is not possible in the vastly more productive economy of today ?
The answer is not complicated : in the first half of the post - War era , employees shared in the gains from productivity growth ; since 1973 , most of them have hardly done so at all .
( Productivity growth has also slowed . )
Moore also explains the structural changes , such as Ronald Reagan 's rollback of union and labour relations to the 19th century , that helped bring about the most massive upward redistribution of income in US history .
( Moore even includes graphs and charts to back up the main points with data . )
From an economic point of view , the only thing missing was a look at the stock market and housing bubbles of the last decade .
The current recession , like the last one , was primarily caused by the collapse of a huge asset bubble – an $ 8 trillion housing bubble in 2006 , and a similar size stock market bubble in 2000 - 2002 .
This is something that most of the media has not really understood .
Asset bubbles are as old as capitalism , and since this is a movie about capitalism and the current Great Recession , it would have been nice to see some of this in the movie .
But I can't fault Moore too much for not taking on something that most economists and the press missed – and still do n't talk about .
It 's a film , not a textbook .
Moore also wins my vote by getting his facts and numbers right .
This is worth emphasizing because Moore 's last documentary , Sicko – which was quite careful with the facts – drew attacks from CNN and a smear campaign from the insurance industry .
Both attempted – unsuccessfully - to impugn its accuracy .
One former vice president of corporate communications for a health insurance company , and the author of several memos attempting to discredit Sicko , recently admitted to Bill Moyers on camera that Moore " hit the nail on the head with his movie . "
The new love story also targets the big boys who made our current Great Recession possible : Alan Greenspan , Robert Rubin , and Larry Summers ( the three smugly depicted in that 1999 Time cover of the " committee to Save the world " ) , and Tim Geithner .
Rubin , who came from Goldman Sachs , helped deregulate the financial industry and got rich at Citibank from the results .
Larry Summers , who came from academia , also made millions from the deregulated , government - guaranteed casino that he helped fashion when he ( like Rubin ) was President Clinton 's Treasury secretary .
It 's a bipartisan hall of shame , tracking the havoc wreaked by a burgeoning , parasitic , and increasingly politically powerful financial industry , through the Reagan , Bush I , Clinton , and Bush II presidencies .
In a heart - warming contrast to the age of greed , we see Jonas Salk , the man who discovered the vaccine for polio in 1955 , saving millions from the crippling and often fatal disease and refusing to get rich off his work by claiming patent rights .
He only wanted that it be as available as possible .
" Could you patent the sun ? " he asks .
And the Catholic Bishop of Detroit , when asked what Jesus would think of capitalism , replies that Jesus would not want to participate in such a system .
It 's all part of Moore 's plot to make democratic socialist values as American as apple pie .
Which is a tough sell – but if anyone can do it , it 's a boy from America 's heartland , the Midwest , the kind that Garrison Keillor writes about when he says that it 's " the dummies who sit on the dais , and the smart people who sit in the dark near the exits " .
As the son of a Flint autoworker , Moore does n't forget which side he is on .
Twenty years later , he does n't seem to have been changed very much by fame and success .
Moore 's last film was a devastating indictment of the US health care system , an excellent introduction to the battle for healthcare reform .
This one could be a prelude to the anger and disillusionment that is only beginning to swell .
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the official unemployment rate will remain near 10 % through next year .
If we add in the underemployed ( involuntarily part - time ) , dropouts from the workforce and other uncounted unemployment we are looking at a number nearly twice as high .
Even if the economy were to begin its recovery soon , it wo n't feel like one for quite some time .
This film will have an audience that is ready for it , in the US and elsewhere .

Conservation groups based in Alaska have accused the Obama administration of repeating the mistakes of George Bush after it gave the conditional go - ahead for Shell to begin drilling offshore for oil and natural gas in the environmentally sensitive Beaufort Sea .
The Minerals Management Service , part of the federal Interior Department , yesterday gave
Shell the green light to begin exploratory wells off the north coast of Alaska in an Arctic area that is home to large numbers of endangered bowhead whales and polar bears , as well as walruses , ice seals and other species .
The permission would run from July to October next year , though Shell has promised to suspend operations from its drill ship from late August when local Inuit people embark on subsistence hunting .
Environmentalists condemned the decision to allow drilling , saying it would generate industrial levels of noise in the water and pollute both the air and surrounding water .
Rebecca Noblin , an Alaskan specialist with the conservation group the Centre for Biological Diversity , said : " We 're disappointed to see the Obama administration taking decisions that will threaten the Arctic .
It might as well have been the Bush administration . "
Whit Sheard , the Alaskan expert with the environmental group Pacific Environment , accused the US Interior Department of " again trying to implement an overly aggressive Bush - era drilling plan in one of the riskiest areas on the planet to drill " .
The question of offshore oil drilling in the Arctic was one of the controversial environmental issues that confronted the Bush administration .
Its permission for exploration in the Beaufort Sea , widely condemned by environmentalists , was struck down last year by a federal court on grounds that it had failed sufficiently to consider the impacts on bowhead whales and the subsistence activities of Inuit populations .
The ruling was later set aside and Shell withdrew its drilling plans .
According to the National Marine Fisheries Service , there are between 30,000 and 50,0000 bowhead whales in the world , with up to 9,000 of them feeding in the Beaufort Sea .
The whales migrate twice a year through the area and are crucial to the subsistence economy of the Inupiat people .
Whale experts warn that the bowhead stocks are sensitive to noise and could be driven further off shore by the disruption of drilling .
That in turn would have an impact on their chances of survival , which have already been harmed by early side - effects of global warming .
There are also fears that any drilling could lead to oil spills which would be impossible to clean up amid the Arctic 's broken sea ice .
Shell must now satisfy the authorities that it has met air and water quality standards and safeguards for whale protection before it can begin drilling .
The oil company 's head in Alaska , Pete Slaiby , said objections had been taken into account .
" We sincerely believe this exploration plan addresses concerns we have heard in the North Slope communities which have resulted in the programmes being adjusted accordingly , " he said .
October 16 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
In my last post I discussed why I thought that retributive theories of punishment should best be seen as aiming at a sort of ‘ communication ’ , and that this might make them seem queer compared to other theories .
I realised that it might be worth saying more clearly what sort of communication I take retribution to be .
In essence , the conversation I think is imagined to go like this : person X performs action A , and in doing so ‘ says ’ that action A is a reasonable to do ( for them , on that occasion , at least ) .
But !
Action
A is in fact ‘ bad ’ , perhaps because it makes someone else die .
Consequently person X ’s initial ‘ statement ’ is false .
By punishment , we do something ‘ bad ’ to person X ( forcing them to become aware of some ‘ badness ’ ) , and present this as directly tied to action A – so they now ‘ perceive action A as bad ’ .
This account may seem very sloppy , but I do n’t think it ’s sloppier than the reality – the key concept here , after all , seems to be ‘ bad ’ , which is not known for its precision .
We can certainly attempt a critique of this , and I will in just a moment .
But first , notice how subtly different sorts of motivation can be very close to each other here .
The punisher is motivated by a desire to ‘ reaffirm ’ that action A was bad , but this can be for a range of reasons .
It might be out of concern for ‘ moral law ’ in the abstract , or for divine law .
But it also might just be about personal status .
Say action A is a form of ‘ disrespect ’ against me .
The statement being made then ( setting aside ambiguities of interpretation ) is that I am not worthy of respect .
The motivation to ‘ punish ’ would then be not so much ‘ moral ’ as just a desire to affirm that I am worthy of respect .
This is sometimes said pretty much literally : “ I ’ll teach you a lesson ! ” What lesson ?
“ Nobody messes with Alderson Motherfucking Warm - Fork ! ”
Is this motive ‘ better ’ or ‘ worse ’ ?
An entirely open question – for the circumstances that make someone feel disrespected are so varied .
But let ’s get to the point .
Does this idea of the retributive ‘ lesson ’ , which seeks to communicate to person X that ‘ action A was bad ’ by making it the cause of suffering for X , does it make any sense ?
Should it be endorsed ?
There is an obvious point of internal critique , that is , criticism on its own terms .
On the one hand , it must aim to have X actually believe that A was a bad action – for what else can be the goal of ‘ communication ’ ?
But on the other hand , its method is to make X suffer as a result of A , as a kind of ‘ substitute ’ .
But the two are largely independent – not only can you have one without the other , but they may at times even undermine each other .
We might put it like this : the relation between action A and its being bad is a logical relation – the nature of the action makes it a wrong action ( yes , I am assuming a robust moral realism – at least for the sake of argument ) .
But the relation between action A and its punishment ( and the ‘ badness ’ of that ) is a causal one .
If you have the former – if X is conscious of how wrong A was , and feels terrible , and is sincerely committed to atoning , etc … .
– does the punishment add anything ?
Perhaps it adds reassurance – for protestations of remorse could always be insincere ( even if they are meant sincerely ) .
And perhaps for certain actions there could rarely be ‘ adequate ’ remorse – if I maim someone so that they are blind for the rest of their lives , I ’d have to be super - human to feel as bad about this as they do for all that time ( or perhaps if I did , it would leave me so pathologically , incapacitatingly , life - destroyingly miserable that punishment would be superfluous ) .
But if we set aside these cases – in the abstract , it ’s certainly arguable that punishment here is unnecessary .
And conversely , if we do n’t have that remorse and recognition of ‘ the moral truth ’ , does punishment get us it ?
Perhaps in a few cases , perhaps hypothetically , but on all the evidence , clearly ‘ no ’ .
Indeed , punishment often does the opposite – ‘ hardens ’ person X , reinforces their alienation from society , ‘ teaches ’ them nothing but how to avoid getting caught .
So it seems , then , as though punishment ’s retributive function must aim at an actual ‘ communication ’ which punitive methods are generally highly ill - suited to acheive .
That does n’t paint it in a good light .
Why , then , does it have such popularity – why do even I feel certain retributive intuitions ?
I think to answer this , we would need to look again at different forms of punitive motivation – different sorts of ‘ badness ’ that punishment aims to communicate .
Consider again the badness of disrespect – the desire to ‘ teach ’ someone that “ you do n’t mess around with Alderson Mother - Fucking Warm - Fork ” .
What is it about that this Bad - Ass Dude that demands respect ?
Partly it ’s that he is a rational animal , a liver of a life , and deserves respect simply as such .
But also , it ’s his Bad - Assery , his command of the situation , his complete knowing - what - he ’s - doing – in a word , his power .
And now , things start to make a bit more sense .
This kind of ‘ punishment ’ , avenging a personal slight , makes much more sense – because its content does n’t just demand remorse but also fear , and material punishment can certainly instil that .
I said that an action ’s wrongness follows from it logically , and its punishment only causally : but ( given certain assumptions ) respect for my power follows logically from that causal link – you will respect me because I am capable of punishing you .
In short , retributive punishment makes a lot more sense when the ‘ badness ’ that is to be punished involves the disrespect of someone ’s power .
Of course , the ‘ moral ’ element is still needed – because what is more delicious than to exercise power over someone with a clear conscience ?
But where respect is demanded both for moral legitimacy and for actual power , retributive punishment can avoid its own internal contradictions .
Who demands respect for both legitmacy and also power ?
The usual suspects spring to mind – the state , God , parents , and the various other positions of authority set up in this patriarchal world .
So they might be expected to value retributive punishment more than would be warranted by its shaky coherence ( though of course things are not always quite this simple ) .
But is it only them ?
I do n’t think so .
The opposite people , those with the least power , might also be expected to demand more of it .
In this case it might even be stronger , because there may be less ‘ cultural support ’ for them to simply believe and assure themselves that what was done to them was in fact wrong – it may be that society itself disagrees and tells them they deserve no better .
Remaining confident in , for instance , the knowledge that the man who battered you for years is a wicked and contemptible person , might take a lot of effort if all around you people are explaining it away or directly justifying it .
More broadly , remaining assured that the people who robbed you of what little you had left were disrespecting your profound human dignity may be harder when all around society is ‘ saying ’ implicitly that you have no dignity and are worth very little .
On the other hand , a good beating with a baseball bat is real and tangible .
It does n’t take mental effort to keep believing that it happened – once you ’ve delivered it , it just exists .
And if your rapist is never going to be punished any other way , nor show remorse or attempt to make reparations , that may be the best that ’s available .
A bandage over the open wounds of an unjust world .
The reason I bring this up is to temper the overall evaluation I want to give of retribution .
I do n’t want to say that each and every retributive impulse is illegitimate .
I do n’t want to say that nobody should ever act vengefully – am I going to come down from the heights of blog - cloud - land and tell everyone who ’s been wronged to always give up the hope of revenge ?
Perhaps I could do that if I thought that all wrongs will be righted somehow , without retribution , in another life , but I do n’t .
But I do want to say that retribution as a phenomenon is undesirable – that we should aim at a situation where universal forgiveness became not merely an abstract demand but a real possibility .
We certainly should n’t take retributive ‘ justice ’ as an eternal principle , something that must be maintained throughout all changes in society or projected onto the supernatural being .
So that is my limited defense and limited critique of retribution .
In my next post I ’ll try to look at it what sorts of things might affect or contribute to changes in society ’s collective vengefulness .

It ’s time to talk about Pando , the world ’s largest alive thing :
“ Pando ( or The Trembling Giant ) is a clonal colony of a single male Quaking Aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) tree located in the U.S. state of Utah , all determined to be part of a single living organism by identical genetic markers , and one massive underground root system .
The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000 tonnes ( six million kilograms ) , placing it as the heaviest known organism in existence .
The root system of Pando is estimated to be the oldest known living being in existence at 80,000 years of age .
Pando is thought to have grown for much of its lifetime under ideal circumstances : frequent fires have prevented its main competitor , conifers , from colonizing the area , and climate change , transitioning from a wet and humid weather pattern to semi-arid , has obstructed widespread seedling establishment and the accompanying rivalry from younger aspens .
During intense fires , the organism survived by its root system , sending up new stems in the aftermath of each wildfire .
Due to its age , the climate into which Pando was born is markedly different from that of today , and it may be as many as ten millennia since Pando ’s last successful flowering , according to an OECD report :
“ Clonal groups of P. tremuloides in eastern North America are very common , but generally less than 0.1 ha in size , while in areas of Utah , groups as large as 80 ha have been observed ( Kemperman and Barnes 1976 ) .
In the semi-arid western United States , some argue that widespread seedling establishment has not occurred since the last glaciation , some 10,000 years ago ( Einspahr and Winton 1976 , McDonough 1985 ) .
Indeed , some biologists feel that western clones could be as old as 1 million years ( Barnes 1966 , 1975 ) .
It has been claimed that a single clone , nicknamed “ Pando ” ( Latin for I spread ) , covers 43 hectares , contains more than 47,000 stems and weighs in excess of 6 million kg , making it the largest known organism ( Grant et al. 1992 , Mitton and Grant 1996 ) ”
The clone encompasses 43 hectares ( 107 acres ) and has around 47,000 trunks , which continually die and are renewed by its roots .
The trunks are connected together by its root system .
The average age of Pando ’s trunks ( or technically , stems ) is 130 years , as deciphered by tree rings .
… In comparison to Pando ’s most widely held total age of 80,000 years , the most accepted view among current anthropologists is that Homo sapiens first migrated out of Africa to Eurasia and Oceania only 40,000 years ago , and finally to the Americas 10,000 years ago . ”

An update appears at the bottom of the post :
The American Academy of Microbiologists ( “ the world ’s oldest and largest life science organization ” ) , just issued a major report on antibiotic resistance which , among many recommendations , calls for decreasing or eliminating the use of antibiotics in animal production .
The report adds more support for the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act ( PAMTA ) , Rep. Louise Slaughter ’s ( D - N.Y. ) bill before Congress that would end sub- therapeutic doses on antibiotics for livestock .
However , if the industry website Meatingplace is any indication , Big Meat really wants you to ignore that particular detail .
What stood out in their reading was this bit ( sub. req . ) :
“ There are no scapegoats , ” states the report , Antibiotic Resistance : An Ecological Perspective on an Old Problem , which is based on a colloquium convened by AAM in October 2008 .
“ Responsibility is partly due to medical practice , including patient demand ; veterinary practice ; industrial practices ; politics ; and antibiotics themselves .
Ultimately , resistance development is founded in the inevitability of microbial evolution . ”
The report states further that antibiotic resistance is essentially uncontrollable .
Nonetheless , the colloquium stressed the importance of “ deliberate efforts ” to contain and minimize transmission of resistant organisms as well as antibiotic use .
Actually , the report says that resistance is inevitable , not uncontrollable .
Resistance is , of course , a function of evolutionary natural selection and has roots that go back billions of years .
But the whole report is indeed about coping with and managing resistant strains as well as reducing the risks to public health .
But the report is very specific when it comes to farm practices .
It explicitly endorses Denmark ’s successful livestock antibiotic ban as a example of Europe ’s “ effective models for improving farming practices . ”
And do n’t forget the big finish where the report not only praises Europe ’s ban “ on the use of growth promoters ” — a reference , no doubt , to using antibiotics as well as artificial hormones as growth promoters — but it also says this :
On the farm , the use of antibiotics should be improved and more extensively controlled .
Europe has banned the use of growth promoters , but this is only a part of needed improvements in veterinary medicine , including promotion and implementation of prudent use of antibiotics , quality of animal housing , biosecurity , and vaccinations .
A global effort is essential .
Every country should revise animal production practices with responsible use of antibiotics ; the amounts used currently must be decreased or eliminated .
Get that ?
“ Decreased or eliminated . ”
So go ahead , Big Meat , run around touting this report .
You might just do the good guys a favor .
UPDATE : Philip Brasher of the Des Moines Register spoke with FDA Comissioner Margerat Hamburg after she testified before the Senate yesterday in reference to the possibility that the FDA would restrict the use of antibiotics in livestock without waiting for Congress to act .
Here ’s what Hamburg said :
[ The ] FDA is “ examining the issue with other partners ” in government and studying how to target antibiotic usage “ for therapeutic need . ”
She said antibiotic resistance “ is one of the most pressing public problems of our day . ”
The tell is the use of the phrase “ therapeutic need , ” i.e. when an animal is sick .
Even under Denmark ’s antibiotics ban , that kind of use is allowed .
Hamburg ’s response certainly leaves one with the impression that the FDA will indeed act on antibiotics soon if Congress does n’t .
Stay tuned .

If afternoon teas had started in the Oligocene Epoch , instead of the seventeenth century , we are convinced that evolution , far from discarding that useful appendage , the tail , would have perfected it .

I know very well that I am in a minority here .
But still , how can you call yourself a true tea - lover if you destroy the flavour of your tea by putting sugar in it ?
It would be equally reasonable to put pepper or salt .
Tea is meant to be bitter , just as beer is meant to be bitter .
If you sweeten it , you are no longer tasting the tea , you are merely tasting the sugar ; you could make a very similar drink by dissolving sugar in plain hot water .

It is very strange , this domination of our intellect by our digestive organs .

It dictates to us our emotions , our passions .
After eggs and bacon , it says , " Work ! "
After beefsteak and porter , it says , " Sleep ! "
After a cup of tea ( two spoonsful for each cup , and do n't let it stand more than three minutes ) , it says to the brain , " Now , rise , and show your strength .

Sadly deceive themselves .
For now I know the Way of Tea is real .

Ah ! but I could take no more !
I only feel the breath of the cool wind that raises in my sleeves .
Where is Elysium ?
Let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither .

In nothing is the English genius for domesticity more notably declared than in the institution of this festival — almost one may call it so — of afternoon tea .
Beneath simple roofs , the hour of tea has something in it of sacred ; for it marks the end of domestic work and worry , the beginning of restful , sociable evening .
The mere chink of cups and saucers tunes the mind to happy repose .
~ George Gissing , The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft , 1903

Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence ....

Ignore the things I have to do ,
And just enjoy a cup or two .

Now stir the fire , and close the shutters fast ,
Let fall the curtains , wheel the sofa round ,
And , while the bubbling and loud - hissing urn
Throws up a steamy column , and the cups ,
That cheer but not inebriate , wait on each ,
So let us welcome peaceful ev'ning in .

I put up a petition , annually , for as much snow , hail , frost , or storm of one kind or other , as the skies can possibly afford .
Surely everybody is aware of the divine pleasures which attend a winter fireside — candles at four o'clock , warm hearth - rugs , tea , a fair tea -maker , shutters closed , curtains flowing in ample draperies on the floor , whilst the wind and rain are raging audibly without .
Most of these delicacies cannot be ripened without weather stormy or inclement .
Start at the first week of November : thence to the end of January , you may compute the period when happiness is in season , — which , in my judgment , enters the room with the tea -tray .
For tea , though ridiculed by those who are naturally coarse in their nervous sensibilities , or are become so from wine - drinking , and are not susceptible of influence from so refined a stimulant , will always be the favourite beverage of the intellectual ; and , for my part , I would have joined Dr. Samuel Johnson against any impious person who should have presumed to disparage it .

An endangered pink banana enjoyed by Asian elephants becomes a landmark species today , marking the first milestone in an international project to create a Noah 's ark of the world 's seeds .
The banana , Musa itinerans , is the last of 24,200 species to have its seeds collected , dried and stored in Kew 's millennium seed bank , which has , after 17 years of work , collected and preserved seeds from 10 % of the world 's plant species .
Conceived after the Rio Earth summit in 1992 , the seed bank was opened in 2000 to try to ensure the survival of the estimated 200,000 seed - bearing plant species threatened by human development and climate change .
The seeds of the pink banana join 1.6bn other seeds inside super - cooled vaults under a complex of low - lying modern buildings at a country estate in Sussex .
Professor Stephen Hopper , director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , said : " The success we are celebrating today is extraordinary and on a scale never before contemplated in global biodiversity conservation .
In a time of increasing concern about loss of biodiversity and climate change , Kew 's millennium seed bank partnership provides a real message of hope and is a vital resource in an uncertain world . "
The seed bank has already led to real - life resurrection stories .
The Australian wildfires that killed dozens of people earlier this year also eliminated the only known populaton of a shrub known as the shiny nematolepis , 60 miles east of Melbourne .
Seeds banked at Kew in 2007 have since seen 150 plants grown from seed and cuttings planted in a new home near the shrub 's original site .
The seed bank has achieved its 10 % target 14 months ahead of schedule and under budget , said Paul Smith , the head of Kew 's millennium seed bank partnership .
" The reponse from botanists and institutions around the world - from the US and Europe to Australia and Africa - has been bigger than we expected , " he said .
Smith warned that previous estimates of 60 - 000 - 100,000 species in danger have been revised upwards to 200,000 to take into account the impact of a likely 2 - 4C rise in temperature this century caused by global warming .
Alpine and island species are particularly under threat from melting glaciers and rising sea levels .
The total number of known seed - bearing species has risen from 240,000 to 300,000 since the project began .
The most pressing threat to many plant species is not climate change , but expanding human developments , such as new roads and railways , industry and housing .
To prioritise the species in urgent need of protection , the seed bank uses Google Earth to map the locations of new developments and habitat loss , including the annual loss of 13 m hectares of forest and the commercial logging of the jungle habitat in which the pink banana lives .
The next phase of the seed bank project is an even more ambitious target of collecting a total of 25 % - about 75,000 - of the world 's plant species by 2020 .
In the future it also hopes to preserve the tens of thousands of non-seed bearing plants such as moss and ferns .
Smith is confident the project 's momentum will ensure it meets the next goal , with China ( 10,000 species ) and the US ( 14,000 ) both seen as key regions .
Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , said : " Reaching this 10 % target is a remarkable achievement .
Kew 's millennium seed bank partnership has harnessed the resources and ingenuity of more than 120 institutions and I would like to congratulate all involved in this truly global effort and its continued success as it works towards the targets for 2020 . "
Into the seed bunker
The bank is based at Wakehurst Place in Sussex because of fears that Kew , in west London , would be vulnerable to flooding .
It is a truly international project , which relies on botanists across the world to donate everything from the seeds of rare flowers in Lebanon to roots from Bostwana .
Once the specimens arrive at the bank , they are cleaned and counted .
Ideally the plant - hunters will have collected 20,000 seeds for each type of plant , but they also have to ensure they do not take so many seeds that they endanger a species .
Seeds are then left to dry before being stored in airtight containers at a constant temperature ( anything down to - 25C ) and humidity .
Researchers annually germinate a selection of the seeds - which theoretically are viable up to 1,000 years – to confirm they are still alive .
How marriage helps men off the dole and back into work
Being married is more important than education or having a mortgage in helping the unemployed get back to work , a study revealed yesterday .
It found married men are 33 per cent more likely to find a job after being made redundant than those who are single or divorced .
And it revealed being married was more important to finding work than having A - levels , which improved chances by 22 per cent , or a degree , which increased chances by 27 per cent .
Dole queue :
The married unemployed have 33 % more chance of finding a job
Having a mortgage also improved chances by 27 per cent .
The study , by the Office for National Statistics and published in Economic & Labour Market Review , looked at the work histories of 2,368 men between 1991 and 2006 , which were recorded in the British Household Panel Survey .
Researcher Katy Long said marriage increased the employer ’s perception of a job candidate ’s reliability .
The study comes on top of evidence that married people are wealthier and healthier than those who are single or divorced .
Previous - research has also shown their children tend to be healthier , do better at school and avoid the pitfalls of crime and drugs .
Some politicians and academics have dismissed the importance of marriage , arguing it appears to be influential only because it tends to be well - educated high - earners who choose to marry .
But Jill Kirby , of the centre - Right think - tank Centre for Policy Studies , said : ‘ The fact that marriage is ahead of all other factors shows that the commitment involved is very important .
It is clear we need to do more to support marriage . ’
Remember the time you heard about the Nithari killings and almost threw up – the kids went through stuff that we , thankfully , cannot even imagine .
Remember the Mira Road case – where a man raped his daughters on the advice of a Tantric to get rich .
Remember those times when you read about a 3 year old being raped and killed and looked up into the ceiling and yelled at the Heavens and said – you do n’t exist because you let things like this happen to kids .
Child Sex Abuse – is stuff that is n’t supposed to happen .
But it t happens to kids and screws up their today and all their tomorrows .
The acts that make kids wonder , for ever , what they have done wrong .
The stuff that we all skim through if , and when , the media reports it .
The stuff which rarely gets to court – yet , sentences the victim to life .
Rahi – a NGO working “ working towards prevention and intervention in the area of incest and child sexual abuse ” tells us that
53 % of children in India are sexually abused .
72 % of these children do not talk about it and suffer in silence .
A majority of these children have been abused by people known to them 64 % of Incest Survivors were abused between the age of 10 - 18 years 32 % of Incest Survivors were abused between the age of 2 - 10 years 87 % of the Incest Survivors were abused repeatedly 19 % of the abused were currently living with at least one of the abusers
We may say it happens elsewhere – but it happens here ( wherever here maybe ) .
I am sure that most of you will want to hang the perpetrators by their privates as a deterrent – but the system does n’t allow us to do that .
Maybe you can do something :
Rahi a Delhi based NGO is raising funds for protecting vulnerable children .
It ’s using the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon as one of the methods of raising awareness and funds .
This is where the funds will be used
disclosure – I am not attached in any way with Rahi – i am just very glad that someone is standing up for abused children .
Clampdown on media increases need for United Nations observation role
( 6 July 2009 ) With as many as two thousand individuals , including more than two - hundred prominent personalities , under incommunicado detention in Iran , serious concerns for their health and safety are growing .
There are increasing reports of extensive use of solitary confinement and torture against the detainees .
While the Iranian Judiciary has announced a directive to criminalize cooperation with satellite television programs and “ opposition ” internet communication , authorities have continued to detain individual journalists , including Masoud Bastani , who was arrested on 5 July as he inquired about the whereabouts of his wife , Mahsa Amrabadi , a pregnant journalist arrested on 14 June , according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
The life of another detainee , Saeed Hajarian , a prominent politician and journalist who is paralyzed , is in danger .
For the past ten days , his family have not been able to verify his condition .
He may be in critical condition and hospitalized .
Since his detention on 15 June , his wife has been able to see him only once for ten minutes .
The Campaign called on the Iranian government to immediately and unconditionally release more than a thousand detainees who have been arrested since the 12 June election .
“ In view of the inhumane conditions in Iranian detentions centers and prisons , Mahsa Amrabadi ’s health and that of her unborn child are at grave risk , ” said Aaron Rhodes , a spokesperson for the Campaign .
“ Although no one has specific information about Mahsa , being held in incommunicado detention for this long is stressful enough to hurt her and her baby , not to mention possible interrogation and even torture . ”
“ Hajarian ’s physical conditions and his health were already deteriorating before detention .
It is cruel and inhumane to hold these individuals in detention , let alone incommunicado detentions , ” he said .
Other journalists are being arrested in what appears to be an intensified effort to shut down independent information sources .
On 28 June , journalist Mojtaba Tehrani , of the Etemad e Melki Daily , was arrested .
On 30 June , Kambiz Nouroozi , legal secretary for the Journalists Association , was arrested , and on 5 July , authorities arrested Issa Saharkhiz , a journalist , founding member of the Journalists Association and the former director of the press department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance .
According to information received by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , more than 20 journalists have been arrested and remain in jail since the presidential election results was announced on 23 June 2009 .
Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi -Shahroudi , the head of Iran ’s Judiciary , has issued a directive calling for the prosecution of individuals cooperating with satellite television networks and or active in “ organizations entrenched in Internet sites , ” according to the Hamshahri newspaper .
He requested all provincial judiciary officials to allocate special branches to review these cases and to initiate criminal cases on the basis of articles 498 , 499 , 500 , 504 , 508 , and 510 of the Islamic Penal Code .
According to this directive , the distribution of any piece of information or news through Internet or satellite networks would be considered a crime .
“ As the government takes steps to silence journalists and cut communications with the outside world , it is all the more important for the United Nations to send envoys to observe the situation and to hold the Iranian government accountable for its legal human rights obligations , ” Rhodes said .
For the United States , the movement creates opportunities as well as risks .
With the Obama administration focusing its fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan , a shift of fighters and some leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to strike a lasting blow .
But in the tribal areas of Pakistan , Qaeda and Taliban forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom they have deep familial and tribal ties .
A move away from those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal , while communications among militants in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen have created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication devices shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid detection .
A senior Obama administration official attributed some of the movement to “ the enormous heat we ’ve been putting on the leadership and the mid-ranks ” with Predator strikes , launched from both Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Mr. Obama ’s strategy so far has been to intensify many of the strikes begun under the Bush administration .
“ There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are starting to see the tribal areas of Pakistan as a tough place to be , ” said an American counterterrorism official .
“ It is likely that a small number have left the region as a result .
Among these individuals , some have probably ended up in Somalia and Yemen , among other places .
The Al Qaeda terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of Pakistan are predominantly foot soldiers . ”
Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on their way out of the tribal areas .
But American officials say there is evidence of a shift .
One senior American military official who follows Africa closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years .
Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives and confederates in Pakistan , Yemen and Somalia had stepped up communications with one another .
“ What really has us worried is that they ’re communicating with each other much more  Al Qaeda in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen , ” the senior military officer said .
“ They ’re asking , ‘ What do you need ?
Financing ?
Fighters ? ’ ”
The potential for nuclear staff or soldiers with militant sympathies to collude in a Taliban or al - Qaeda attack was a cause for greater concern , he said .
The army has been Islamicised in the past and has senior officers who are known to be anti-Western and anti-American .
" No screening programme will ever be able to weed out all Islamist sympathisers or anti-Westerners among Pakistan 's military or civilians with nuclear weapons expertise , " he said .
Father - to - be misses birth of his son after being arrested for grabbing nurse 's breasts on way to delivery room
Police said Adam Manning had first tried to touch the nurse 's neck before launching the sex assault
A father missed the birth of his first son after being arrested for groping a nurse on the way to the delivery room .
Police said Adam Manning sexually assaulted the nurse as she wheeled his wife into the delivery room .
The 30 year old had told the nurse she was " cute " then reached round to grab her breasts .
Police in Ogden , Utah , were called to the hospital and arrested Manning on charges of forcible sexual assault .
When later asked about his actions he said he had no idea why he carried out the assault .
Police confirmed that he missed the birth of his son .
Ogden Police Lieutenant Lt. Loring Draper said Manning had looked the nurse ' up an down ' after arriving at the McKay - Dee hospital and made a comment about her appearance .
' He commented on how attractive she was , how cute she was , ' Draper said .
Police said Manning had first tried to touch the nurse 's neck before launching the sex assault .
' After the second time , the nurse asked what he was doing , ' Draper said .
' The wife responded that he was just drunk . '
Draper said it is unclear whether Manning drove to the hospital intoxicated or if he was taken there by someone else .
Officers said Manning had looked the nurse ' up an down ' after arriving at the McKay - Dee hospital and made a comment about her appearance
On May 9 , 1951 , on a coral atoll in the Pacific , scientists ignited what they hoped would be the first man-made thermonuclear reaction , the basis of the hydrogen bomb .
A fireball rose 1,800 feet .
But the explosion alone , awe - inspiring though it was , was not enough to convince one eyewitness , Edward Teller , considered the father of the H- bomb , that thermonuclear fusion had indeed occurred .
For that he had to wait for the results of a test devised by two young fellow physicists who worked with him at Los Alamos , N.M. , where the first atomic bombs had been built .
At 5:30 the next morning , one of those colleagues , Louis Rosen , told Dr. Teller the exhilarating news : yes , fusion had been achieved .
Dr. Teller promptly raced out to pay off a $ 5 bet .
He had bet against himself , wagering with a colleague that fusion would not occur .
Dr. Rosen died on Aug. 15 in Albuquerque at the age of 91 ; his granddaughter , Ambyr Hardy , said a subdural hematoma was the cause .

Man who both approved and covered - up government slaughter of 76 people , including 20 children , will lead move to establish international model of law enforcement
Paul Joseph Watson

Monday , October 12 , 2009
UN and Interpol officials will meet today to discuss the formation of a “ global police force ” that would enjoy access to a worldwide database of DNA , biometric and fingerprint records .
The effort will be spearheaded by a man known as “ The Enforcer ” who helped federal authorities both conduct and cover up the murderous Waco siege which killed 76 people in 1993 .
“ Interpol and the United Nations are poised to become partners in fighting crime by jointly grooming a global police force that would be deployed as peacekeepers among rogue nations riven by war and organized crime , officials from both organizations say , ” reports the New York Times .
The emergence of a global police force is of course something that people like Alex Jones have been warning about for well over a decade .
The global police force , just like the world army , is a key centerpiece of the march towards a dictatorial global government .
Those who were once called paranoid conspiracy theorists for claiming that the plan all along has been to centralize law enforcement into a global body run by the world government under the auspices of the UN and Interpol have been proven right once again .
For a taste of what Americans who are n’t so favorable to taking orders from foreigners on home soil can expect , consider the fact that the secretary general of Interpol , and one of the men at the forefront of setting up the global police force , is none other than Ronald K. Noble .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Noble , who is known as “ The Enforcer , ” has been instrumental in working with Chinese authorities to provide policing in the Communist country for major national events .
However , his most notorious role was in ordering and then , in his position as Undersecretary for Enforcement of the United States Department of the Treasury , whitewashing the actions of the BATF following the federal government ’s murderous siege on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco which killed 76 people including more than 20 children and two pregnant women in April 1993 .
As Carol Moore writes , “ Noble had approved the decision to go ahead with the raid , ” and therefore , “ had little interest in issuing a report that either would challenge significantly the BATF ’s investigation or modus operandi or would admit these led to crimes against the Davidians . ”
Noble ignored in his report more than a dozen eyewitness reports , along with photographic and video evidence , of a BATF helicopter firebombing the Waco church during the siege .
He also ignored David Koresh ’s July 1992 invitation to the BATF to inspect the Waco compound , which if it had gone ahead could have prevented the siege and the murder of 76 innocent people altogether .
The 1993 Waco Siege .
“ During the hearing , Friend - of - Bill Webster Hubbell denied repeatedly that he and Clinton had discussed the Waco situation informally , and improperly .
However , an Associated Press article claimed Hubbell had revealed he was giving Clinton updates on Waco .
And House staffers discovered a memorandum in which then - Treasury official Ron Noble asserted Hubbell would take the matter up with Clinton if the Treasury Department ’s review did not downplay BATF errors .
Clearly , Noble condones covering up government crimes against citizens , ” writes Moore .
Noble was picked directly for the position of secretary general at Interpol by fellow Waco siege accomplice , former Attorney General Janet Reno .
During his September 2005 secretary general re-election acceptance speech in Berlin , Noble attributed Interpol ’s ‘ rebirth ’ to the events of 9/11 , saying that the terrorist attacks allowed the organization to go from being treated as largely irrelevant to setting it on the path to becoming an international police force .
Noble told the New York Times that one of the main roles of the global cops would be to stop people to check their identities against a global database .
“ The police will be trained and equipped differently with resources , ” Mr. Noble said .
“ When they stop someone , they will be consulting global databases to determine who they are stopping . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
As we previously reported , Interpol is setting up a huge biometric facial scan database of international travelers so they can cross-check everyone against a database of terror suspects , international criminals and fugitives .
The database will hold the records of every citizen who has ever traveled in and out of the virtually every country in the world , representing intelligence agency style bulk interception of information .
According to the NY Times report , Interpol agents would be given special electronic passports that would allow them to speedily cross international borders .
“ With the meeting of justice ministers on Monday , which coincides with a general assembly of Interpol police members , the group is expected to debate the global police issue and to craft a declaration that would lead to an action plan for international police peacekeeping within 12 months , ” reports the Times .
The danger of having a global police force conducting law enforcement on U.S. soil under the control of Interpol and the UN is self - evident .
Global cops who do not have to swear an oath to uphold the Constitution have no obligation to follow it .
Operating outside of the realms of the U.S. legal system , global cops will have carte blanche to snatch , grab and intern citizens without recourse .
A highly centralized system of policing guarantees hardly any liability whatsoever and therefore encourages rampant illegality and police brutality .
With many experts predicting a Soviet - style collapse of the United States within the next few years , the prospect of U.N. peacekeepers and Interpol global cops ordering Americans around is a harrowing possibility .
The fact that this move is all being spearheaded by a man known as “ The Enforcer ” who was instrumental in ordering the killing of 76 innocent people at Waco , including 20 children , and then covering it up , should send shock waves through the liberty movement and lead to intense scrutiny on Noble ’s position at Interpol and his agenda to head up a global police force .

Comment on this article
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain ’s economy contracted in the third quarter of this year , quashing hopes the downturn was ending and instead marking the longest recession on record .

Sterling plunged more than a cent against the dollar and government bonds surged as traders and analysts bet the Bank of England was more likely to expand its quantitative easing program of buying up debt market assets to secure a recovery .
Friday ’s figures are also a blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s Labour government , trailing in opinion polls and hoping for recovery to take hold well before an election due by next June .
The Office for National Statistics said British gross domestic product fell by 0.4 percent between July and September , meaning the economy has contracted for six successive quarters for the first time since records began in 1955 .
This was much worse than analysts ’ expectations of a 0.2 percent rise .
Not a single analyst out of the 35 polled by Reuters before the data had predicted a negative reading .
“ Third quarter GDP is awful , with no positive news within the report , ” said James Knightley , economist at ING .
“ More worryingly from sterling ’s perspective is the fact that the UK may be the only major economy to have contracted in the third quarter . ”
Japan , Germany and France all pulled out of recession in the second quarter and economists expect the United States to have returned to growth in the third .
The data will pose a major challenge for the BoE when it reviews its growth and inflation forecasts in early November and analysts remain divided over whether the bank will expand its 175 billion pound ( $ 287 billion ) quantitative easing scheme .
August ’s forecasts showed the BoE would meet its inflation target over the medium term , but this was based on an annual economic decline of only 4.6 percent in Q3 .
Friday ’s figures show a 5.2 percent fall , only marginally better than the record 5.5 percent annual fall registered in the second quarter .
“ It ’s fair to say that these figures might be an argument that the Bank of England will be using to expand QE ...
It clearly tilts the balance in favor of those who wish to expand the program , ” said Commerzbank economist Peter Dixon .
“ WORST RECESSION IN 60 YEARS ”
British finance minister Alistair Darling said he still expected growth to return by the turn of the year , reiterating a forecast made in the budget in April .
Darling will update that forecast in the pre-Budget report due in the next few weeks .
“ We ’re facing the worst global financial crisis and recession in 60 years , ” he said .
“ That ’s all the more reason to continue the action the government is taking .
To remove it now would be madness . ”
But Darling ’s Conservative counterpart , George Osborne , said Germany and France ’s better economic performance showed government policy had failed .
“ We now know that Gordon Brown ’s recession plan has not worked , and this news has destroyed Labour ’s claim that Britain was better placed than other countries to weather the storms . ”
The ONS said there had been a peak - to - trough GDP fall of 5.9 percent during the current recession , compared to 6.0 percent between the second quarter of 1979 and the first quarter of 1981 -- a period when there were some quarters of growth .
The quarterly decline between April and June was unrevised at 0.6 percent .
Analysts had been pinning their hopes for recovery on months of survey evidence that had pointed to a sharp rise in confidence and activity in the services sector , which makes up three quarters of Britain ’s economy .
But services contracted by 0.2 percent over the quarter , with the distribution , hotels and catering sub-sector leading the decline with a 1.0 percent quarterly drop .
Economists had already expected industrial output to be weak , following a sharp monthly drop in August , and the GDP data bore this out .
Industrial production fell by 0.7 percent over the quarter , taking its annual decline to 10.4 percent .
Just a few months after being slammed by a Texas federal judge for infringing on the patent of a Canadian company , a similarly critical lawsuit has , in this instance , gone Microsoft 's way .
Earlier this week a Rhode Island judge overturned a Singapore company 's $ 388 million victory against the Redmond - based software giant .
MS Accused of Piracy , using Antipiracy Software
First filed in a Rhode Island federal court in 2003 , the case involved Singapore - based Uniloc , which accused Microsoft of illegally incorporating its antipiracy technology with Windows operating system ( OS ) and Microsoft 's Office productivity suite .
Uniloc won over a jury earlier this year , capturing record damages for a case of this kind .
Unsurprisingly , Microsoft appealed the decision and the $ 388 million in damages awarded to Uniloc ( which had originally sought an astounding $ 560 million ) .
Uniloc Vows to Fight On
It 's not yet clear exactly why Rhode Island U.S. federal judge William Smith overturned the decision for Uniloc , but the company promises another appeal .
" Uniloc will continue to protect its intellectual property and appeal the Judge 's decision to override the jury 's verdict to the US Court of Appeals , " a company spokesperson said .
" We are confident that Uniloc will ultimately prevail . " ( Source : informationweek.com )
Microsoft , which is currently fighting to have the number of patent cases like this one reduced through the Patent Reform Act of 2009 , is obviously pleased with the new decision .
In an email to the media on Tuesday night , the company announced that it was " pleased that the court has vacated the jury verdict and entered the judgment in favor of Microsoft . "
A See -Saw Case
Uniloc 's antipiracy tools were designed to prevent users from installing software on more than one PC .
According to them , a member of their company demonstrated the technology for Microsoft sixteen years ago with the understanding that the larger software firm would not rip them off .
Microsoft contended that the patent was " obvious " and that it used a different method in implementing the technology .
This is n't Microsoft 's first win in the matter , since in 2007 it won a summary ruling that was soon after appealed by Uniloc , resulting in the huge award in April of this year .

Paul Mason weighed 50 stone ( 317kg ) when this picture was taken in 2006
Health bosses in Suffolk have been trying to find a way to transport a " super- obese " man to another county for life - saving treatment .
Paul Mason , from Ipswich , weighs about 70 stone ( 445kg ) .
He needs to travel from his home to a hospital in Chichester , West Sussex , for life - saving specialist treatment .
A spokeswoman for Suffolk Primary Care Trust said the man will probably be taken by road in a specialist ambulance .
A final decision has not been taken and a number of travel options , including an airlift , have been considered , she added .
In the picture taken in 2006 Mr Mason weighed 50 stone ( 317kg ) .
In 2002 when he needed hospital treatment Mr Mason had to be taken from his home by forklift through a window which had been removed .
( CNN ) --
A motorized parachute crashed into a crowd at a Labor Day festival in Hooper , Utah , injuring at least six people , including children , authorities said .
Spectators scatter as a motorized parachute plummets Monday in Hooper , Utah .
The parachute was operated by a man and his son who were on the aircraft , but neither was injured when it dropped to the ground amid spectators .
Scores of people had gathered Monday for what was to have been a candy drop from the motorized parachute , according to Lt. Lonnie Eskelson of the Weber County , Utah , Sheriff 's Department .
Video from the incident showed the small craft in the air , approaching the crowd , when it quickly lost altitude and came down as spectators ran for safety .
Spectator Damon Martin said the crowd was waiting for the scheduled candy drop when the wind picked up .
Watch vehicle slam into crowd »
The motorized parachute " gets just over the field , they start dropping the candy and all of a sudden he starts to descend real quick .
He guns it to get it back up and goes straight down into the crowd , " said Martin , who shot video of the incident .
The crowd parted " like the Red Sea , but they just could n't move fast enough , " he said .
Six people were taken to area hospitals , including two sisters , 4 and 5 years old , authorities said .
The 5 - year - old was being treated Monday night at Primary Children 's Medical Center in Salt Lake City , Utah , for a leg fracture , Eskelson said , while her sister was treated and released .
A 3 - year - old also was being treated at the center Monday night .
The other injured spectators were treated and released , Eskelson said .

If Bernake Does n’t Raise The Fed Interest Rate Very Soon There Will Be BIG Trouble
The debate about whether it was Alan Greenspan ’s “ fault ” will continue for generations , the “ other side ” summed up their position nicely in a quip that came up in the debate about whether to let the Fed have more power , “ That ’s like buying your teenager a sports car after he wreaked the family saloon ” .
Greenspan did point out at one stage that with $ 100 trillion of debt created by the private sector of which $ 20 trillion was “ manufactured ” between 1998 and 2007 by securitization of assets in USA , something that the Fed had , or elected to have , no control over , what the Fed did or did not do to with the base rate was largely irrelevant .
But the Fed did have a mandate to ensure financial stability , what just happened was not “ stability ” .
Even if they did not perhaps have the tools or the authority , they should have either got the tools or got out of the kitchen , in other words if Greenspan “ saw ” what was going to happen he should have made a fuss , got the tools , done something , or resigned .
In that context his best defence is that he “ did n’t know or did n’t understand ” , because if he did know and wilfully did nothing , he should be shot .
He famously said more than once , “ you ca n’t tell if you are in a bubble when you are in one ” .
That ’s baloney and I proved it , that ’s how for example I could predict in January 2009 that the S&P 500 would bottom the day it passed through 675 ( that happened on the 6th March ) , and in May that the Dow would go up to 10,000 without a serious reversal ( it hit that last week ) .
That was n’t luck ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article14234.html ) .
The logic behind the “ Too Big To Fail ” bailouts was that the banks in USA that created the problem , by creating a bubble in securitized debt ( that ’s what a bubble is , when the price that assets ( RMBS ) sells for is wildly more than what they are worth , that ’s a bubble , the pop is when people realise they are not worth that ) , was that the economy needs debt to function .
There is a logic there , although as the credit crunch clearly demonstrated , if the debt is used for speculation , that is lunacy ;
Ty Andros dug up a prescient quote on that ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article14313.html):
“ Cheap money is a stimulant , also an intoxicant .
If the dose is large enough , a substantial temporary effect can be brought about , but headaches follow .
If the matter really were that simple , everybody could be an economist , and only the perversity of central banks would keep us from endless prosperity .
Merchants and manufacturers will not be induced to increase borrowings , since interest on money borrowed is only one small factor in total costs .
But if merchants and manufacturers will not use cheap money , speculators will ” .
Benjamin Anderson , Chief Economist of Chase National Bank , New York Times , April 1930
The money that got pumped into the US economy by the Fed over the past year did n’t get anywhere near “ merchants and manufacturers ” or small businesses that are now the backbone of the US economy , and it ’s nothing to do with the interest rate ; if you are a bona fide business in USA right now you will pay through the nose for debt .
It went to the banks , in part to create some sort of illusion of capital adequacy , although until there is a market , a real market with real buyers and sellers for that $ 20 trillion of dollar denominated securitized debt that is clogging up the gullets of the financial sector both inside USA and abroad , that ’s just Alice in Wonderland .
And what did they do with it ?
They speculated , they borrowed at 0 % plus or minus short term and bought 10 - Year and 30 - Year Treasuries , that ’s speculation , pure and simple ; if the yield on those instruments goes up which sooner or later , and my view is sooner rather than later , the “ Too Big To Fail ” will need another shot in the vein to cover their losses .
There is a suspicion that they are “ playing ” , or more likely “ gaming ” the stock market with part of that money , and now it looks like they are getting ready to create a bubble in oil prices ( anything above $ 80 now is a bubble ) .
That would be ironic , the US taxpayer advances money to speculators so they can game the oil market so the US taxpayers pay more for oil , talk about having your cyanide - laced cake and eating it .
It is the JOB of the Fed to ensure financial stability , what they are doing now is trying to create bubbles to get themselves and their “ constituents ” , i.e. the lobbyists who prowl the halls of Washington , out of the hole that they dug together , by creating bubbles .
Gold is a bubble now ( do n’t believe me , I said target $ 600 a month ago – have a look at http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article14336.html), long term Treasuries are a bubble , the yield has to go up that is nothing to do with perceptions of inflation , that ’s just supply and demand , and the housing market cannot be inflated now , that ’s impossible .
Right now America is wounded , deeply wounded , and those wounds are the results of foolishness and cronyism that occurred over the past ten years .
Right now the Fed is trying to get the patient to jump up and play in the NFL Final by pumping it full of steroids and painkillers .
That ’s not just foolish , that is wilfully irresponsible , what America needs right now is time to heal , bed rest , and tender loving care .
Raise the rate Ben , do n’t try to get the patient to run before it can walk , or you will risk causing it far more damage than you ever imagined .

07 Aug 11 , 18:55 Dollar destruction
Bernake is going to totally destroy the dollar .
What did we expect ?
Bankers are not Mother Theresa .
Over the past year taxpayers have given them half a trillion pounds in cash , loans , shares , lucre , dosh , quantitative easing , whatever , with not a string or condition attached .
We knew , or at least some of us did , what they would do next .
They would not give the money back .
They would certainly not lend it to collapsing manufacturers or high street retailers , whom the government had refused to help .
Instead they would pay off the gambling debts they had run up from money previously entrusted to them by the public as depositors .
They would spend the rest on bonuses , houses , Porsches , yachts , brothels ( says the Guardian ) , Cotswolds farms , commodity shares , bonuses , bonuses and yet more bonuses .
After a while , you just can not get rid of the bloody stuff .
So who is the bigger fool , the bankers or the rest of us ?
Over the past year we have doled out what the Economist estimates as " the biggest peacetime fiscal expansion in history " .
A little was taken off VAT , but every other brass farthing went to a banker , with not a jot of regulation to control how it was disbursed .
Ministers certainly pleaded .
Brown said last October that " the heart of the problem of averting recession " lay in ensuring that bank lending to the private sector was sustained .
The objective was clear .
Not a week passed without Alistair Darling insisting , cajoling , begging , threatening and stamping his foot .
Lending was the be all and end all of his subsidies .
His officials phoned banks daily to plead for more lending .
They refused .
Lending to a crashing private sector is hardly wise , especially with interest rates plummeting .
Shopping streets and centres became like bombsites .
Unemployment soared .
Money in circulation stuttered to a halt .
As the economist Tim Congdon pointed out , Darling 's action in October 2008 " did not protect against a recession .
On the contrary , it accelerated and intensified its onset " .
The requirement of both Keynesianism and monetarism , that demand somehow be stimulated in a recession , was denied by a chancellor who deflated as ruthlessly as had Thatcher in 1980 - 81 .
By the end of this summer , the Bank of England reported " net flow of lending to businesses " falling faster than ever since records began , indeed by £ 15bn in July alone .
Taxpayers ' money was being locked up in bank balance sheets .
When Britain should have been spending , it was forced to save .
This explains the eccentric financial news .
Indicators for output , trade and employment remain gloomy while those for shares , houses and commodity futures are booming .
Banks suddenly have lots of money – our money – and nothing to do with it but speculate , this time under the cover of an implicit government .
While personal incomes are relatively static , returns to gambling are soaring .
That is why bankers are making such large bonuses , with no one to stop them .
As if to reward them , the government is this week planning to give Lloyds another tranche of £ 5 bn to underpin its balance sheet .
None of this will leak into demand .
It will be hoarded to cover bad losses .
It is hard to think of a policy fashioned by so few that has cost so much to so many .
It is plain daft .
Throughout the past year there has been not a whiff of remorse , let alone a change in policy .
Downing Street has appeared baffled .
Advisers are said to be at a loss to explain why pleas to banks from the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have fallen on deaf ears .
They pondered the Vince Cable option of nationalising domestic deposits and leaving so - called investment banking to default – but could not think how to do it .
They pondered the " helicopter option " , employed in China and Taiwan to good effect , of showering money not on banks but directly on consumer demand through vouchers , tax cuts or make - work schemes .
To Britain it seemed populist and crude , except when directed at the car industry .
Quite why cars were considered good demand but other forms of consumption bad was never explained .
Nothing was explained .
It was merely asserted as axiomatic that banks should not fail .
The lack was not of political courage but of ideology and intellect .
The idea of nationalising and deconstructing a bank , though it was done de facto in the war and in other countries , seemed beyond the tolerance of a Labour government .
Saving private deposits – guarding the cash machines – but letting the spiv side of a bank go bust , offended a prime minister who had spent much of his time in office courting spivs .
Instead , a gigantic fudge was concocted , that rescuing a bankrupt bank was the way to rescue the entire economy .
Subsidies would trickle down from the greedy to the needy .
The American financial guru , Pippa Malmgren , reflected on the Today programme yesterday that it was hard to imagine the financial world would really be a worse place today if a few dud banks had been left to fail .
Their asset base would at least be unencumbered with bad debt , and public money would not be guaranteeing rubbish .
Meanwhile the mind can only boggle at the debt burden now saddling taxpayers for the rest of their lives .
Why did the government not support demand when the economy entered recession ?
Why did it bail out banks and car firms but not Woolworths , white goods , the DIY sector , hair salons , hotels , restaurants – anywhere that kept people in work ?
Why did it not give money to pensioners and the poor , who for sure would not do what banks do and merely save ?
Students of the Watergate school of journalism were taught one lesson : " Just follow the money . "
It was Deep Throat 's one message to the Washington Post reporters from the depths of his underground car park .
I have long followed this maxim , especially since first trying to understand the credit crunch last year .
What motivated those in charge of Britain 's financial policy ?
Why were they so obsessed with saving bankers and nobody else ?
The answer must lie in their personal circumstance .
Those advising Brown and Darling in Downing Street , such as Lord Myners , Lady Vadera , Lord Turner and John Kingman , were all past or present bankers , or friends of bankers .
When they leave public life they are likely to work for a bank .
They are the castlist of David Hare 's admonitory dialogue , The Power of Yes , at the National Theatre .
To them , City banking is like the apostolic succession to the Vatican , or the Royal Navy to Churchill .
It is the defining institution of the state .
Economic policy in the 1970s was directed at saving steel , coal , cars and ships .
It is now directed at banks .
Without a shred of evidence or justification , they are asserted to be too big to fail .
For this indulgence , the British people are now to pay an enormous price .
At the end of a year that has seen a prosperous economy brought to its knees , there has been no ministerial apology , no political resignation , no court case , not so much as an inquest .
We have only spin doctors combing the landscape looking for green shoots .
They are there , but only in a few well - padded back pockets .
David Cross started doing stand - up in his late teens , and — like most comics — struggled for years , trying to find his voice .
He got his break writing for The Ben Stiller Show , but he did n’t earn his lifetime pass until a couple of years later , with Mr. Show — a half - hour HBO sketch - comedy show co-created with Bob Odenkirk .
The now - legendary ( among geeks , anyway ) Mr. Show was a brilliant distillation of its creators ’ styles : Cross ’ direct sarcasm and Odenkirk ’s more restrained , not - quite - straight - man act .
After the show ’s demise — it was n’t particularly popular when it was on — Cross wandered , taking bit acting roles in stuff like Men In Black , Ghost World , and Scary Movie 2 .
The growing Mr. Show legend kick - started Cross ’ stand - up career , and he took to the stage with a vengeance in the late ’90s and early ’00s , honing an act that took shape on the brilliant double CD Shut Up , You Fucking Baby !
At its best , Cross ’ stand - up rides the line between viciously funny and pointed — he can go from a simple goof to a tirade about 9/11 in no time , and make it all work .
Cross ’ next peak came with the Fox sitcom Arrested Development , on which he played the clueless Dr. Tobias Funke , a role key to the show ’s tone .
This fall , he ’ll hit the stand - up circuit for the first time in ages , playing much larger venues than in the past .
The tour is timed with the release of Cross ’ first book , I Drink For A Reason , a collection of short pieces that range from a thoughtful , heartfelt examination of a breakup to a list of “ videos with babies in them that I have not seen on the Internet but most likely exist . ”
( Example : “ A baby sitting in the toilet while rednecks laugh at it . ” )
He also abides no bullshit , taking to task lazy critics who think he ’s bigoted , Pitchfork contributors who have wild theories about his comedy , and his arch - enemy , Jim Belushi .
In other words , Cross is unrivaled in the comedy world at calling bullshit on the world ’s crassness and stupidity , which is part of the reason he himself caught some shit — mostly from anonymous Internet geeks — for taking a role in Alvin And The Chipmunks .
He defended that decision by being bluntly honest , as usual :
He did it for the money , so he could put a down payment on a house a few hours outside his home base , New York City .
Cross recently spoke to The A.V. Club about the Alvin “ squeakquel , ” his reputation as a condescending douchebag , and his upcoming projects .
The A.V. Club :
In the interest of journalistic thoroughness , I TiVoed Alvin And The Chipmunks this weekend and fast - forwarded through it .
I did n’t realize your role was so huge — you ’re practically the star .
Have you still not watched it ?

David Cross : I have n’t watched it , but I have n’t not watched it out of some moral or ethical stance .
I just have n’t had any interest .
If it ’s on a plane , then maybe I ’ll watch it .
But that ’d be kind of weird , would n’t it ?
If I had kids , I ’m sure I ’d have to watch it three dozen times , as everybody is quick to tell me .
AVC : Do kids recognize you from it ?
DC : Oh , yeah .
Tons .
AVC : Are they scared of you because you ’re sort of the bad guy ?
DC : If they ’re really young , they ’ll go , “ You ’re mean ! ”
But that ’s it !
I ’m really surprised by that .
I suppose things are vastly different than they were when I was growing up , when you could only see a movie in the movie theater , and then there were a couple channels and some UHF channels on TV .
You were n’t bombarded with all this stuff where that actor goes on Dancing With The Stars and then you see him on TV at the baseball game or whatever .

AVC : Are you sure they are n’t saying you ’re mean because they read your book ?
DC : [ Laughs . ]
As much as I think we ’ve really progressed and have advanced as a society and are light years ahead of the most literate society on Earth , I doubt it .

AVC : It was sort of funny how your character was mocking the same kind of assholes that you mock in your act .
DC : It ’s a universal , ubiquitous character to have be the villain in those types of movies .
You ’re right , but it ’s a universally reviled and easy type of character to do , the sleazy exploiter - of - talent guy .

AVC : You probably understood why you got shit for doing that movie .
People felt like they were calling bullshit on the guy who calls bullshit a lot .
DC : Yeah , I get it totally .
It ’s nice to be freed of those shackles .
It ’s very liberating .

AVC : Do you feel freed of them now ?
Are you going to do Dancing With The Stars and feel no shame ?
DC : Totally .
No . I would n’t do that .
But I have no hesitation doing children ’s movies .
Zero .
And I do n’t even have kids .
I have n’t even made that turn , like , “ You know , now that I look into those innocent angels ’ faces , they deserve a laugh . ”
It ’s not about that either .

AVC : Have you closed the door on having children ?
DC : Do you mean biologically ?
How dare you !
How dare you .
I ’m not that old .
No , not at all .
Of course if I find the right person , the time is right .
It ’s not that I do n’t have kids for some personal reason outside of , I just have n’t had kids .
And I have n’t met someone who wanted to , as far as I know .
And perhaps I ’m attracted to women who are n’t ready to make that commitment just yet .
Advertisement
AVC : I was n’t sure if you ’re from the school of “ the world is too terrible to bring life into . ”
DC : No , that ’s silly .
I ’m of the mindset that most people who have kids are , which is , “ Hey , I want another me .
I like me .
I ’m pretty cool , and I ’ve got really great ideas , and the way I think is the right way to think .
Let ’s put another one of me out there . ”
So I ’ll have kids one day .
I think I ’d be a really good dad .
So perhaps I ’m doing society a disservice by not having as many kids as possible .

AVC : What was the impetus for doing a book at this point ?
DC : Like so many worthwhile projects I get involved with , it was not my idea at all .
I got a call from an agent I did n’t even know existed , a literary agent at my agency , who said , “ Hey , what do you think about writing a book ? ”
And I said , “ Why not ? ”
He says , “ Okay , let me set up some phone calls .
Let me patch you through to these guys , and I ’ll stay away from it from here on out , but you still give me 15 percent .
That sound good ? ”
“ That sounds great .
Business as usual . ”
So yeah , the guy conference - called me and I never heard from him again , but hopefully he ’s enjoying his upstate house .
Advertisement
AVC : So it was n’t any sort of deep literary aspiration ?
DC : No. Zero .
Not at all .
But I ’m happy I did it .
I ’m happy with it .
I like the idea of something tangible .
As much as I enjoy doing stand - up , and I ’m happy with my CDs and all that stuff , this feels — there ’s literally and figuratively weight to it .
You can feel the weight in your hand , which I kind of liked .
Advertisement
AVC : How did you approach it ?
It seems like you took some of it very seriously and crafted it , and other bits are more “ Here ’s some funny shit . ”
Advertisement
DC : That ’s totally 100 percent exactly what it was .
I would write , for lack of a better word , headier or weightier pieces , more thoughtful pieces , and then after you do three of those , you ’re like , “ Fuck this , I just want to do something goofy and silly . ”
So then I ’d write a list .
Like that thing about the quirks [ “ A free list of quirks for aspiring independent filmmakers ” ] …
I was tired of writing about the right wing or Jews or religion , so I ’d put it down for a bit .
It ’s just like having a refresher , like having a cold beer and sitting on the porch .
“ All right , I ’m just going to be goofy now , ” and then I ’d write a list of dumb T - shirts .
And those things were n’t all written in one sitting .
It was like , “ Okay , enough .
I hate Jesus , let ’s move on .
Let ’s go back over to fun and silly . ”
So it was a way to not get bogged down creatively and just have some fun with it .
AVC : Did the more thoughtful pieces scratch an itch you did n’t know you had ?
DC : I ’ve certainly approached similar if not the same subject matter onstage , but it ’s a totally different form of expression .
Onstage , you need to be a little more economic .
You have tone and cadence and gesticulations and all kinds of things at your disposal , and you ’re also very conscious of where the laughs are or are n’t .
With this kind of stuff , you ’re able to spend more time descriptively .
I ’d say almost 50 percent of the book is stuff that I ’ve talked about onstage , but it ’s just a different approach to a similar opinion .
Or maybe it ’s a constant itch , and this was less of a scratch and more of a cortisone shot that will last a lot longer and allow me to get back in the game and keep playing .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : Do you plan on doing another ?
There ’s a great chapter where you talk about possibly writing a memoir .
DC : Yeah , I ’d like to .
I have n’t taken any sort of serious approach to it yet .
I was very , very busy for about 16 months , and then had very little work over the summer , which has been great , and I ’m about to start work pretty heavily again .
So when that starts winding down , maybe I ’ll start thinking about writing again .
And by then , I ’ll know if people are interested in what I have to write , which will also kind of dictate where I want to spend my time .
Advertisement
AVC : You write really briefly about having a pretty fucked - up childhood , which you do n’t tend to touch on in your stand - up material .
Is that something that you need to approach with caution ?
DC : Well , everyone in my family is still alive .
It ’s out of respect , I guess .
I talk about my little sister , but that ’s mostly just about making fun of her being kind of a dumb redneck , which is different .
I have talked about some of those things , but in very intimate settings that were not about stand - up .
It was more like alternative L.A. Un - Cabaret - type settings , where you ’re encouraged to be more personal and not really tell jokes .
And people who know those stories and have seen those sets will encourage me to write them down .
Advertisement
AVC : How does your sister react to you talking about that stuff onstage ?
Was she cool with being teased ?
DC : I do n’t even know if she ’s seen that stuff .
I know that whenever she ’s mentioned it , she kind of enjoys it .
And I do n’t think she comes away with the same understanding .
I think we view her actions much differently , Julie and I .
I do n’t have any anger or bitterness toward her at all .
And I think it ’s her attitude that allows me to continue doing it .
Because there ’s some fucking gold .
Like every four months , there ’s just pure gold and another story I can tell .
And if I thought that she was really upset , then I would n’t be able to do it .
I have to temper how I say it onstage with how I might relay the story to you or a friend , or something like that .
I have to watch my language and descriptions , because I know she ’ll have access to it .
Advertisement
AVC : Are you ever envious of her sort of carefree reaction to life ?
DC : No. Never .
Never .
AVC : You never wish to be blissfully ignorant ?
DC : You know , I think a lot of people , almost everybody who does n’t know me , has a misconception that I ’m bitter and angry and I ’m a prick and garrulous and I ’m just a douchebag .
And that ’s not the case .
I ’m pretty happy .
I obviously have complaints about things , but for the most part , I ’m on the above - average side of happy people .
Advertisement
AVC : Does that surprise people when you tell them that ?
I mean , it ’s sort of your bread and butter — what a lot of people know you for is cultural criticism , to put it in a hoity - toity way .
Advertisement
DC : [ Laughs . ]
I ’ve never thought of myself as a hoity - toity cultural critic .
It ’s a mix of Garrison Keillor , Dick Cavett , and P.G. Wodehouse all rolled into one .
Look , this is n’t to imply that I ’m never in a bad mood , or short with somebody .
But people pretty much never include their own approach or attitude into the mix .
It ’s always like , “ Yeah , man , I fucking went up to that guy , David Cross , and was like ‘ Yeah man , I know you , who are you ? ’
And he gives me his first name like trying to be too cool for school .
And then I was like , ‘ Dude , come on , do n’t try to be so cool . ’
And then he ’s like , ‘ David Cross . ’
And I go , ‘ Yeah , you ’re in movies , right ? ’
And he goes ‘ Yeah . ’
And I ’m like , ‘ What movies you been in ? ’
And he goes , ‘ A lot . ’
And then he fucking walks away and talks to his friend he was talking to when I came up .
That guy ’s a total dick . ”
And there ’s plenty of those people who just do n’t see that equation and factor it in .
Some people have said that .
Also like reporters , too .
When I ’m doing an interview , they ’ll say , ‘ Oh , well , I gotta say , I was a little worried , because you kind of have a reputation as being a bit of a dick , but you were very nice to talk to ! ”
Oh , well thank you .
AVC : Do you then ask them where that reputation comes from ?
DC : Yeah , from the reporter ’s friend .
They read some shit online .
[ pagebreak ]
AVC :
In the book , you directly address some of those criticisms .
Do you think that ’s a fruitful thing to do ?
Advertisement
DC : I honestly do n’t care if it ’s fruitful or not — it is the most satisfying thing to do .
Now if I were going to do that onstage …
I ’m not going to charge you $ 35 a ticket to watch me respond to shit that people have written about me .
I would never do that .
But with the luxury of prose , with setting the whole thing within a context and writing about it , I think it ’s interesting , and I also value that opportunity to address anonymous people .
The hypocrisy and the double standard of an anonymous person posting a comment about how I ’m lame because I make fun of easy targets like religion and politics , and just making sweeping generalizations …
I would n’t call it necessarily cowardly , but there ’s no courage in what they ’re doing .
And I do n’t think they ever expect to be called on their shit .
I think that only happens twice in the book , though , right ?
AVC : Yeah .
The SFist piece that calls you a bigot , and the Pitchfork thing .
DC : There you go .
It ’s not like I did a whole book about that , but it was very satisfying to do , and I will keep on doing that .
Especially when they get stuff wrong .
That ’s what ’s infuriating .
They get shit wrong , they post it , then the immediate assumption is that they ’re right , so you have to address this thing quickly , and it ’s a no - win situation , because then you look like kind of a self - absorbed , anxiety - ridden neurotic going like , [ Adopts shaky voice . ]
“ Hey , that ’s not true what you said ! ”
But it ’s important .
You do n’t want these lies to sit there .
All you gotta do is post it once and watch the comments add up afterward , and they all assume that anonymous blogger ’s comments have validity .
They just assign them with validation and fact when it ’s just not .
It ’s lazy and infuriating and wrong .
Advertisement
AVC : As you get more and more well - known , is it even possible to respond to all the bullshit ?
It seems like most people just give up at some point and hope that their message is louder .
DC : You can hope that .
And I have n’t responded to anything …
Whatever the last thing was , the Alvin thing or SFist , that was literally like two years ago .
So I have n’t responded to any of that shit since then .
And I think it was a mistake , but a mistake that I do n’t necessarily regret , because I learned a valuable lesson about never reading that shit .
I recognize that it ’s a no -win situation .
You ’re damned if you do and damned if you do n’t .
But I did learn a lesson to just not let it bother me .
Those people will always be there ; they ’ll always have that thing to make them self - important .
And maybe that ’s in part why I ’m happier now than I was two years ago .
I ’m still very surprised that I have become a person who actually prefers being up in this small town and hanging out and not being in that scene .
I love that I can go back to the city and I always have that available .
But I spend a majority of my time up here .
And I ’m still , and probably will be for a while , surprised by that .
But I ’m happy up here .
Advertisement
AVC : Is there any criticism that you ’ve actually taken to heart ?
A couple times in the book , you bristle at the word “ condescending . ”
Is that one you ’re just going to learn to live with ?
It ’s valid , in a way , but it ’s also not the whole picture of what you do .
Advertisement
DC : I agree with that .
I think it is valid .
I do n’t think condescending is a good way to be .
If I come off as condescending , then I guess I am .
I do n’t like being condescended to , and I get hyperaware of it , and it turns me off when I feel like people are doing that .
I did this interview with The Believer , and we had a fan interview me , and then a guy who did n’t like me interview me , and put the interviews side by side .
And that guy brought up condescension , and we talked about it .
That was another guy who expected me to be an asshole .
[ Laughs . ]
I do n’t know if I will be even remotely successful at it , but it ’s something that I am trying to be conscious of , not being condescending .
And not to say that it ’s going to take my edge away or my anger at the things I ’m angry about …
It ’s just that if I appear condescending , I do n’t like it myself .
So I need to figure out a way to not be like that , or so much like that .
And I hope it makes my stand - up a little more enjoyable .
I ’ll still be saying the same things , but I ’m just going to improve myself as a person .
I have a very good friend , we ’re very close , and 80 percent of what we believe in politically , and about culture and society , is completely opposite .
He ’s very well - informed , well - read , and we argue constantly .
We try to be very civil about it , but I can hear myself being really condescending .
It ’s out of impatience sometimes .
As much as I would probably start off trying not to be condescending if I were talking to somebody who had just come out of a town - hall meeting about health care , and were spouting the five or six emotional talking points that the insurance companies want you to say so that we do n’t have a public option …
I would very quickly become condescending , I think .
And I do n’t know where I was going with that , but I decided to end that sentence right then and there .

AVC : On your upcoming tour , you ’re playing much bigger venues than you have before — 3,000 - seat theaters instead of 1,000 - seat clubs .
Is that going to be different for you ?
Are you going to be less able to do personal material ?
DC : No .
Why ?
Because people are sitting down ?
AVC : Because the proximity makes the vibe different .
DC : But there ’s more focus , would n’t you say ?
AVC : People will be quieter and paying more attention , at least in theory .
DC : I ’ve done comedy clubs , and then I went out of comedy clubs and did music clubs , and then I went back to comedy clubs to record the second album .
The one thing I ’ve never done is small theaters , so I figured I ’d try that .
Advertisement
AVC : I ’m mostly curious about whether it changes how you perform , or the type of material you do .
DC : I doubt it .
I do n’t think so .
I was n’t planning on it .
Now you ’ve got me worried .
What should I be doing here ?
I should have a marching band .
Advertisement
AVC : Fart jokes are best for reaching the back of the theater .
DC : What if I just hire a guy , like a local comic , who can play to the back six rows from the balcony , and just do fart jokes ?
Advertisement
AVC : I think that ’s what the radio - contest winners will want .
I was just wondering how playing to a thousand David Cross diehards at the Metro is different than playing to three times as many people who maybe are n’t all diehards , and are like , “ Oh , I ’m gonna see the guy from Alvin And The Chipmunks : The Squeakquel do stand - up . ” I guess you got some of that playing in rock clubs — I ’ve seen you upset people at shows .
DC : Hopefully people are upset for the reason I want them to be upset .
Even when I was doing open mics , 20 - some - odd years ago — wow , it ’s been a long time — I ’ve always had people upset .
I ’ve never been the consummate crowd - pleaser .
I hope they ’re not upset because they ’re familiar with me and think I suck now , like 20 percent of the audience says , “ Tell more jokes about politics and religion , ” and then another 20 percent is like , “ Tell less jokes about politics and religion , ” and then 20 percent of the audience is , “ You ’re crude ! ”
If it happens , it happens .
I ’m going to go out there and do the material I know works in other spaces .
I ’m certainly not going to be winging an hour .
This is all stuff that I ’ve done that works well in other capacities .
So I ’m assuming it ’s going to translate into a theater as opposed to a rock club .
Advertisement
AVC : Will there be as much political material now that the dark years are , in theory , behind us ?
DC : I have way less about Obama than I did Bush .
It ’s really not heavily political at all .
Let me look at my little board here .
I ’ve been trying to lay out the set and how it would flow .
There ’s definitely a lot of religious stuff , for sure .
There ’s stuff about …
There ’s date rape : date - rape postcard .
Junkies .
Prop. 8 — that ’s Mormons .
I ’ve got some real goofy stuff .
A thing about Whole Foods .
Advertisement
AVC : Have you had any sort of scary post - show encounters with so - called patriots or religious types ?
Advertisement
DC : Not in 15 years .
Well that ’s not true .
I did a show at St. Louis University , which is a Jesuit school .
Two of the students picked me up at the airport , and I was like , “ What kind of school is it ? ”
You know , just asking regular questions to get an idea of where I ’m going and the audience .
And they were like , “ The school ’s about this big , and it was founded this , and da - da - da , and it ’s a Jesuit school , da - da - da . ”
And I was like , “ Wait , it ’s a Jesuit school ? ”
And then I think I said — and I do n’t think my voice could have gotten any higher —
“ Have you seen my act ? ”
And they had n’t .
They knew me from Just Shoot Me .
And so I was like , “ Well , I do a lot of religious stuff , ” and they ’re like , “ Oh , that ’ll be fine . ”
So I get to the gig , and it ’s a big , high - ceilinged , almost banquet - hall kind of thing , with a little makeshift stage , a table with some water on it , and about 600 metal folding chairs that had kind of an aisle between them .
And everybody came in , and I started my set , and within 10 minutes , as I ’m doing jokes about Jesus or religion or God or whatever , the physics of the situation got really messy very quickly .
Most people walked out .
And because there was only this one aisle and the one set of double doors in the back , everybody started cramming there , and they were talking .
It was really awkward and weird , and you could hear chairs scraping .
There were about 150 people who were excited , and they all moved up to the front and were very encouraging , but it was really difficult to get past all the people who were leaving .
And because there were only two doors , it took them a while to actually get out .
And then I had a guy come up onstage and look at me threateningly and take my water and drink it all and then drop the bottle and walk off .
Angry Catholics , because I made fun of their best friend .

AVC : How long ago was this ?
DC : It was about a week before 9/11 , something like that .
That was the last time .
I ’ve never had the “ How dare you make fun of America ? ! ” argument .
Maybe I will now , because I ’m going to make fun of those people .
Advertisement
AVC : I ’m a little surprised by that .
Maybe people are just more prone to flee .
DC : The negative side of performing in a space that has 900 diehard fans is , you ’re not going to get that .
That ’s why , when I recorded the second CD [ It ’s Not Funny ] , I went to a comedy club .
I did it in Washington , D.C. purposely , really hoping and expecting to have some of that .
You know , I ’d say 20 percent of the room has no idea who I am .
They paper the shit out of those things , and people win contests and whatever .
I was hoping for more of that , which did n’t really happen .
But it could happen .
My first show on this tour is in San Francisco , and I notoriously have problems with San Francisco with a lot of PC people , who get upset and hiss and yell .
It happens quite a bit .
I ’m not saying it ’s going to happen — it did n’t happen the last time I played there , and I ’ve had a lot of great gigs there .
But there have been a good handful that just were …
You know , you ca n’t say the word “ retarded ” or “ Jewish ” or “ Mormon ” or whatever without people just shutting down and not hearing the joke .
So there ’ll be some of that .
Advertisement
AVC : You ’ll upset a retarded Jewish Mormon ?
DC : Well , I think if you ’re a Jewish Mormon , that makes “ retarded ” a little bit redundant .
Advertisement
AVC : What else do you have coming up ?
You mentioned in e-mail that you ’re working on a British show , The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret , that you ’re really excited about .
DC : I ’m really , really happy with it .
It ’s a show I did for Channel Four .
The pilot will definitely air , and I should know within the next two or three weeks whether they ’re going to pick it up and see if it goes to series , which will be six episodes .
It ’s not an ongoing , open - ended story ; it has a beginning and an end — it ’ll be 12 episodes if everything goes to completion .
It ’s funny and it ’s interesting and it encompasses a lot of different types of comedy .
It ’s about a guy who mistakenly is perceived by this other idiot to be a really good salesman .
He ’s actually a temp at this office in Portland , Oregon who ’s never been outside of the country , who lies his way into this job where he ’s sent the next day to London to head up a satellite office of this conglomerate .
He ’s in way over his head .
The story is really big and crazy .
In fact , the first scene you see , before the credits , is a magistrate reading this list , and he ’s chained up , and there ’s armed security behind him , and this magistrate is reading this crazy list of crimes , like terrorism and harboring fugitives and possession of a rape kit .
And the guy ’s beat up and he ’s got this thousand - yard stare and it pulls back and the court is screaming , “ Lock him up !
Kill him ! ”

AVC : What else is on the horizon ?
I ’d probably be lynched if I did n’t ask about the state of the Arrested Development movie .
DC : I have n’t heard anything in months , really .
My main source of information is Jason [ Bateman ] , and he has n’t said anything .
Usually he ’s very quick to get on the phone and go , “ Hey , man , here ’s what ’s going on . ”
Who knows ?

AVC : There ’s no script yet ?
DC : Not that I know of .
I know a script was due .
But those guys are notorious for being late .
So I dunno , I have n’t heard anything .
Everybody wants to do it .

This interview got slightly off track as we began talking about movies featuring retarded characters .
Talk quickly turned to The Other Sister , starring Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi as young mentally challenged people who fall in love .
In this audio clip , Cross describes his favorite scene in what I contend is one of the most offensive ( and hilarious , for all the wrong reasons ) movies ever made .
Soldiers are quoted saying they opened fire at any " suspect places "
A human rights group founded by Israeli veterans has collected what it says are damning testimonies from soldiers who took part in the offensive in January against Hamas fighters in Gaza .
BBC correspondent Paul Wood looks at the anonymous claims presented by Breaking the Silence .
Standing by the ruins of his home in Gaza , Majdi Abed Rabbo explained how Israeli troops had used him as a human shield .
" The Israeli soldiers handcuffed me and pointed the gun at my neck , " he said .
" They controlled every step . "
In this manner , Mr Abed Rabbo said , he was forced to go in ahead of Israeli soldiers as they cleared houses containing Palestinian gunmen .
This same incident was described by one of the Israeli soldiers who spoke to Breaking the Silence .
Israel 's military is now looking into Majdi Abed Rabbo 's claims " A Palestinian neighbour is brought in , " he says .
" It was procedure .
The soldier places his gun barrel on the civilian 's shoulder . "
If true , that was a clear breach of the international laws of war - which say soldiers have a duty of care to non-combatants - and of Israeli law .
The Israeli Supreme Court outlawed the so - called " neighbour policy " , of using Palestinians to shield advancing troops , in 2005 .
Until now , the Israeli army always had a ready answer to allegations that war crimes were committed during its offensive in Gaza .
Such claims were , they said , Palestinian propaganda .
Now , though , the accusations of abuse are being made by Israeli soldiers .
Testimonies collected
The common thread in the almost 30 testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence is that orders were given to prevent Israeli casualties , whatever the cost in Palestinian lives .
Writing the report 's introduction , the Israeli lawyer Michael Sfard says : " All the witnesses agreed that they received a particular order repeatedly , in a way that did not leave much room for doubt , to do everything , everything , so that they - the IDF ( Israel Defence Forces ) soldiers - would not be harmed .
" The soldiers tell in their testimonies how this unwritten message , which came from brigade , battalion , and company commanders in morale - building conversations before entering Gaza , translated into zero patience for the life of enemy civilians . "
Israel denies its soldiers broke the laws of war
The lawyer adds : " Violations of the laws of war are liable to be war crimes . "
Here are just a few quotes which give a flavour of the soldiers ' testimony .
The accumulation of detail is convincing and , in the eyes of Israel 's critics , damning .
" Things are happening in his battalion of which he ( the commander ) has no idea .
There are people who deserve to go to jail ...
" When your company commander and battalion commander tell you , ' Go on , fire ! ' the soldiers will not hold back .
They are waiting for this day , the fun of shooting and feeling all that power in your hands ...
" Fire power was insane .
We went in and the booms were just mad .
The minute we got to our starting line , we simply began to fire at suspect places .
You see a house , a window , shoot at the window .
You do n't see a terrorist there ?
Fire at the window .
In urban warfare , anyone is your enemy .
No innocents . "
GAZA REPORT Breaking the Silence report on Operation Cast Lead [ 469KB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Israeli military spokeswoman Lt Col Avital Leibovich dismissed the testimonies as anonymous hearsay , designed to embarrass the army rather than lead to serious investigations .
She questioned why Breaking the Silence had not handed over its findings earlier , before the media were informed .
" We are investigating many of the requests from NGOs and other groups , " she said .
" But when you have a report that is based on hearsay , with no facts whatsoever , we can't do anything with it . "
In the past , says the Israeli military , some allegations of wrong - doing in Gaza have turned out to be second or third - hand accounts , the result of soldiers recycling rumours in the battalion rather than describing what they themselves witnessed .
Credible record But Breaking the Silence has a long - and to many , credible - record of getting soldiers to talk about experiences which might not reflect well on the Army .
The group is funded by the British , Dutch and Spanish governments , as well as the EU .
It says the testimony is anonymous because of orders to Israeli soldiers not to speak out publicly .
Some of the collected testimony is highly specific .
In the case of Majdi Abed Rabbo , the Israeli military police have now opened an investigation , lending at least some credibility to the soldier who said the " neighbour policy " was in widespread use .
The military maintains it went to extraordinary lengths to ensure civilians were not harmed in Gaza .
The soldiers ' testimony does describe in detail how leaflets were distributed in areas they were about to enter - warning people to leave .
But it is what happened after that , says Breaking the Silence , which calls into question the morality of the Israeli army 's actions .

This post could be rather short because as of today ( 23rd of September 2009 ) none of the 4 main mobile phone operators doing business in Ireland have an Android device on offer … not one !
You can get the latest Nokia N97 , the iPhone 3GS , any flavors of BlackBerry even a couple of Windows Mobile devices but no Android .
We have a problem …!
The problem is that the only way to use an Android device is to buy it unlocked from abroad , once fitted with a Sim - card and configured with the correct APN settings , they are working just fine .
However , that means you ca n’t get it subsidised .
You have to pay the full price for a new or try toÂ grab one second hand .
While some ( like me ! ) will prefer ( and can afford ) to have an unlocked handset , lots of people will not have the funds to buy new mobile phone this way and have to rely on the subsidised from their mobile phone operator .
The second issue is with the Android Market .
From Ireland you can only see and install the free applications and none of the paid apps .
I would assume that it is so because “ officially ” there are no - one using an Android phone in Ireland .
I am only speculating here by the way as there are no indications anywhere of how it is decided , if anyone knows , feel free to add a comment .
There are few other issues , like getting support for your unlocked device .
Even if this is a problem with the network , the mobile phone operator will quickly blame the unsupported device .
It is also difficult for mobile devices developers based in Ireland , they ca n’t be motivated to develop for a platform that virtually no - one is using at home , nonetheless few ( http://www.mercurygirlinc.com or http://business.loudervoice.com/android-reviews/) are trying , fair - play to them !
Why ?!?
I ’ve tried to figure out why Ireland is so far behind … and it does not make sense .
We have a strong Google presence in Ireland ( EU Headquarters ) and a good part of the employees ( nearly 2000 it seems ) , if not all of them , got a G1 ( lucky they are ! ) .
I am not sure if Google Ireland has an agreement with an operator or if each employee is free to use whomever they wanted though …
If someone knows , please share with a comment .
There are few Irish companies developing Android applications and they need support , in other words they should be able to sell locally their applications .
The technology used for the networks is the same as in many other countries ( GSM , UTMS , HSDPA , EDGE , … ) , nothing fancy or old .
Proof is that my HTC
Hero is working just fine .
While this is a small country , there are plenty of subscribers ( 4,809,857 in June 2009 ) .
If the iPhone managed to be successful with just one operator ( O2 ) and very unattractive contracts ( minimum is 45 euro per month for only 1 GB ! ) .
I am sure any Android devices from HTC , Samsung or Motorola will do just great !
Also you can get Android devices on smaller markets ( Malta for example , roughly 10 times smaller than Ireland ) .
The cherry on top … 3 of the 4 operators are large groups operating in other countries : Vodafone , O2 and Three .
In these countries , they are “ offering ” Android devices ( see Table below ) !
One of the excuses they will give when asked about introducing new devices , is that they have not been approved for the network …
How come an HTC Magic that is working in 12 countries for Vodafone ( a member of the open handset alliance by the way ! ) , can not be introduced TODAY on the Irish market …
No technical issues , no language issues ( already available in English in UK ) …
So why ?!
If anyone from Vodafone ( or any other operator ) can answer , please feel free !
While doing some research for this post I found this article from one year ago …
“ Asked last week if Vodafone would be considering launching with its own version of the HTC Dream , Vodafone Irelandâ€™s chief executive , Charles Butterworth said : â€ œThe answer is yes , over time .
Iâ€™m sure we will , but without getting into the specifics of which market and how.â€  ” , Â so I guess they got the specifics wrong for Ireland !
Also it seems that even the new HTC Tattoo will be launched in October on Vodafone UK , nothing about it on Vodafone Ireland :-(.
I hope that the situation will change soon so that I will be able , like many other users , access all the apps in the market and reward developers by buying the labour of their work .
I also hope that soon many Android devices will be available for a moderate cost for anyone to buy as they are simply great devices loaded with an exciting platform .
From what I have read on different blogs and forums , Ireland is not alone in the Android devices desert … please share your feeling if you have the same issues in your country .

I am beta testing a new sense .
My new sensory organ is a small anklet strap with a LiPo battery and circuit board attached to an electronic compass on the anklet ’s side .
Inside the strap are eight small buzzers , up against my skin .
As I sit here typing , the buzzer on the very left side of my left ankle is gently informing me which way is north .
The anklet is called a Northpaw .
My new sense is perfect direction .
The Northpaw is based on the Feelspace , a project organized by the Cognitive Psychology department of Universität Osnabrück in Germany .
The principle is simple and elegant .
The buzzers signal north to the wearer .
The wearer gets used to it , often forgetting it ’s there .
They just start getting a better idea of where they are through a kind of subconscious dead reckoning .
It started as a university experiment .
They got the data , wound it up , and never intended to commercialize it .
Adam Skory liked the idea so much he wanted to make one for himself .
He teamed up with some friends at the San Francisco hackspace Noisebridge and built it .
In the process they decided that they might as well sell kits so others could make it more easily .
Skory gave me version 1 , and set me loose in San Francisco .
I think of myself as having a good sense of direction , and I do , in a way .
It ’s just wrong most of the time .
My north drifts quite far from magnetic north .
But it ’s a consistent wander , still useful for navigation , if patently untrue .
The Northpaw is n’t perfect , this early version has the occasional bug and misplaced buzz , but it ’s better than I turn out to be .
I had wrong assumption I did n’t know about , my confidence in my cognitions misplaced .
It does n’t work while driving because the compass does n’t like being turned on its side , as it is when you work car pedals .
Magnetic fields mess it up ( of course ) and I can feel it circling my foot on escalators or seeming to vacillate directions randomly as I rest my foot on the floor of the subway .
But that ’s interesting too — to feel the specific places where infrastructure interferes with the Earth ’s magnetic field .
I returned home to Washington DC to find that , far worse than my old haunt San Francisco , my mental map of DC swapped north for west .
I started getting more lost than ever as the two spatial concepts of DC did battle in my head .
Eventually , the Northpaw won , and the NW / NE / SW / SE on DC street signs started making a whole lot more sense .
My relationship with the Northpaw is still shaky .
It passes in and out of my integrated experience .
When it ’s at its best , my awareness is not of the touch from the Northpaw , it ’s the awareness of north from the Northpaw .
I make it dance around by spinning my office chair , but it does n’t keep up .
I get nauseous and dizzy much quicker wearing the Northpaw than I do spinning without it .
My world ’s Euclidian consistency is becoming questionable .
The Northpaw experience has been more about realigning my reality than about its being useful .
It tells me more about the world , rather than giving me immediately practical information .
But then , I have more a Google Maps than compass lifestyle .
Skory told me that in the time he was wearing his Northpaw he found that hiking trails were much more twisted that he thought they were .
But even straight things are n’t that straight .
I find roads and paths drifting in ways I never noticed .
Not always , not a lot , but just enough to be unsettling .
My world ’s Euclidian consistency is becoming questionable .

Recycling Atomic Waste Nuclear Materials Stored In Siberian Parking Lots
A French documentary has revealed that radioactive materials from nuclear power plants are being being stored in containers in a Siberian parking lot .
Meanwhile the largest power company in Europe , France 's EDF , which sent the materials there , says it is not responsible .
PHILADELPHIA — Officials in Philadelphia are removing trash cans and even greasing up utility poles in anticipation of revelry if the Phillies clinch the National League Championship Series tonight .
The defending champion Phillies can earn their second straight trip to the World Series with a victory over the Dodgers at home in Game 5 .
The game starts at 8:07 and will be broadcast on TBS .
City workers were coating poles , trees and bus stop shelters with slippery goo to discourage celebrating fans from climbing them .
The city also removed new solar - powered trash cans from the street and asked publishers to remove unsecured newspaper boxes .
Police Lt. Frank
Vanore says state troopers will patrol on horseback and officers on bicycles while commanders monitor live footage from the city ’s 100 - plus surveillance cameras .
After the World Series last fall , fans in South Philly toppled a traffic pole and set off firecrackers .
In Center City , a luggage store was looted , planters and taxicabs were damaged and some small fires were set .

Tall story : Scarlett 's Magic , an 18 - month - old Savannah cat , holds the Guinness world record as the tallest domestic cat at 17.1 inches from shoulder to toe
Cat 's whiskers : Savannahs are becoming increasingly popular as pets in California , thanks to their unique markings and playful nature
With her beige coat and dramatic auburn and black spots , 18 - month old Scarlett 's Magic is also awaiting the result of a second nomination as the longest ( tip of the nose to tip of the tail ) domestic cat .
' We are absolutely thrilled , ' said owner Kim Draper , a Savannah breeder who also owns the Californian - based Savannah Cat Shoppe , with husband Lee .
' The Savannah is the most intelligent , loving and beautiful animal companion a family could wish for . '
According to Mrs Draper , Savannahs are becoming increasingly popular in California due to their unique appearance and learning abilities .
' They are active animals , they like to play , they like to be near their owners and family , she said .
' Savannahs are for people who want a really unique pet and this is as close to a wild cat as you can get in the state of California . '
John Aravosis at AmericaBlog had a great post the other day exposing an online sales scheme hatched at the Republican National Committee 's website whereby you could search for goods on an " Obama Card " and come up with all kinds of goodies .
So Aravosis did searches for such words as " Jew , " " Latino , " " Bondage , " " Escort " and " Anal " and got some very interesting responses .
Many of them are hilarious , actually .
But the one that caught my attention most was the search for " Jew , " which you can see above .
Among its responses , as Aravosis notes , is " The Jews and Their Lies . "
But in the second spot for this search is the video Jud Süß .
This was the vicious anti-Semitic film created by the Nazis and used as propaganda to advance the Holocaust as it was occurring in Germany .
The other stuff is incredibly hypocritical , but this material is downright disturbing .
Whoever was responsible for compiling the material for these searches had deeply questionable tastes .
No wonder the RNC promptly discarded the whole thing .
( CNN ) --
The love - triangles , family feuds and paternity mysteries of Brazil 's telenovelas have commandeered the nation 's airwaves for decades and generated a fortune for Globo -- the powerful TV network that produces many of the genre 's most popular shows .
Brazilian actress Carolina Dieckmann 's portrayal of life with lukemia prompted 23,000 marrow donations after the show was aired .
But aside from lining the pockets of television executives , evidence is emerging that the telenovelas have had a surprising impact on the fabric of Brazilian society .
From declining fertility rates and a growing proportion of divorcees , to an increasing awareness of social issues and taboo medical conditions -- it is claimed that the colorful dramas are responsible for a wave of ' social merchandising ' that has helped significantly alter Brazilian values over the years .
Despite a religious culture that condemns modern family planning methods , birth rates in Brazil have decreased from 6.3 children per woman in 1963 to 2.3 in 2000 .
This drop is of a similar scale to that seen in China , where the government has played an extensive and controversial role in controlling population numbers .
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .
See more from the show »
Although such a change could be attributed to a range of factors , a new study reveals that there is a direct correlation between the availability of the Globo TV signal and low fertility rates across Brazil .
This is accompanied by a similar pattern of increasing divorce rates , as well as the ( albeit less remarkable ) tendency for parents to name their children after popular characters .
Novelas depict the " small , healthy , urban , middle and upper - class consumerist family , " says Alberto Chong , one of the study 's authors .
" They have been a powerful medium through which the small family has been idealized . "
The changing trends certainly resonate with an analysis of 115 Globo novelas aired between 1965 and 1999 .
It showed that 72 percent of the main female characters had no children , and 21 percent had only one child .
The influence of TV is particularly strong in countries like Brazil .
Joseph Potter , a University of Texas sociologist who has studied the relationship between fertility and television in Brazil explains in a report : " It 's not a literate society , it 's not a place where there are books and newspapers outside the upper 10 percent -- and television fills that space . "
But as well as fashioning lifestyle choices , the novelas contribute to an increasing awareness and tolerance of difficult social issues .
Bruno Gagliasso is the star of one of the most popular novelas in Brazil .
In it he plays Tarzo , a recently diagnosed schizophrenic fighting not only himself but the stigmas of mental illness .
" We 're showing a disease that people ignore , " he tells CNN .
" And we 're able to expose it to society as a whole . "
Finding opportunities to insert health themes into novelas is described by some in the industry as ' social merchandising ' and its effects are quantifiably real .
Globo executive Luis Erlanger says that one episode , which featured a young girl in tears as her head is shaved in preparation for chemotherapy , prompted 23,000 bone marrow donations in the month after it first aired .
Despite this , Erlanger is quick to assert that Globo 's priority is always with entertainment and that social issues will never dictate plot .
However Manoel Carlos , writer of novelas since 1978 , sees the inclusion of health themes and information as a personal responsibility .
" Novelas are used to sell cars and freezers , " he tells CNN .
" So why not sell some good information ? "

Many of those calling for a housing bottom seem to ignore the state budget problems that are already showing up in California ’s finances .
State revenues are collapsing .
This is important to focus on because it will leave the state with a few options in remedying the deficit .
It can either raise taxes or cut spending further .
Both are bad for the overall housing market .
And housing prices have not boomed like some have claimed .
475,000 notice of defaults will be sent out in 2009 , a record breaking number .
California is battling gaps in revenue even though it has some of the highest taxes in the country .
Let us first take a look at the California balance sheet :
Nearly 50 percent of the revenue for the state comes from personal income tax .
Another 34 percent comes from sales taxes .
Over 84 percent of all revenue comes from sources that are affected heavily by economic downturns .
Those in Sacramento have decided to simply ignore the problem until we reach another situation where we are printing IOUs .
Yet even with the current cuts in spending we are still over historical trends :
The above chart shows how the total budget exploded during the boom times .
With the bubble , there were billions in profits that should have never been there .
You had high school graduates pushing Alt - A and option ARMs receiving commissions of $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 for falsifying documents on a loan that ultimately will implode .
The state enjoyed collecting those high tax revenues and turned a blind eye to the practice .
Plus , many of these people blew all their money and the state then collected more money on sales taxes .
Each home that sold had a new higher appraisal .
How many industries do you think really had no chance of viability without the housing bubble ?
We are now finding out .
California has boosted its sales tax in the past year to bridge the gap .
Has this helped ?
Of course not .
California already has one of the highest state sales taxes in the country :
We have one of the highest sales taxes and also , one of the highest personal income tax burdens .
Los Angeles has a sales tax of 9.75 percent .
This is stunning .
I had to buy some household goods a few weeks ago and could n’t believe the $ 50 in sales tax being paid out .
That $ 50 could have been spent at a meal at a restaurant .
People then ask if employment gains did n’t plug the $ 60 billion in budget gaps , then what did ?
Taxes and cuts :
$ 30 billion of the budget was fixed with cuts , $ 12 billion in taxes , and $ 8 billion with Federal Stimulus .
If you think this has fixed the problem , it has not .
The above proposal came out in July and we are already off with the current estimate :
This is the latest report that came out in October and reflects revenue for the state up to September 30th .
So where did the biggest falls come from ?
Personal income taxes and sales taxes .
Last year in September , the state collected $ 5.5 billion in personal income taxes .
This year , that number is $ 3.9 billion .
Keep in mind that in September of 2008 things were already bad .
The housing bubble had already popped and unemployment was already high .
Yet what you see above is a state that is having a tough time collecting revenues from typical income streams .
The California housing market still has much more pain to face based on the above .
The above data is merely a proxy for the real economy .
California revenues are declining because unemployment is high and people are being more cautious with their money .
Another good indicator is estimated tax payments .
The wealthiest Californians pay a large portion of personal income taxes to the state .
Unlike most people , they do not pay the state via withholdings .
It comes from estimated taxes :
Look at it this way , if your best client is suddenly not buying as much of your goods , would you be worried ?
Of course .
Many of these people make money from the stock market and ironically , unlike many average Californians , have enough losses in 2008 to carry over for a few years with creative accounting .
But more importantly in terms of home buying , unemployment and underemployment is at 23 percent :
Someone that is unemployed is not paying personal income taxes .
Someone that is unemployed does not have the same disposable income as someone with a job .
There goes your personal income tax and sales tax .
Your two biggest income streams are still near the bottom .
In addition , people have seen their pay cut .
Take for example someone that was used to selling $ 600,000 homes and receiving a commission on that .
Now , they might need to sell three $ 200,000 homes for the same amount .
Bottom line is a large part of the above revenue stream was temporary and is never coming back .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are trying to revive parts of the housing bubble with the $ 8,000 tax credit ( a 4 year old got a credit and millions of dollars are under fraud investigation ) , Fed buying GSE MBS to buy down mortgage rates , and allowing banks to do whatever they wish with the foreclosure process .
Yet prices are not booming back .
Have sales increased ?
Yes .
But the question is how sustainable is this path without the real economy ?
Those arguing for a bottom are so one sighted about their analysis that they miss all of the above !
The state is still showing symptoms of a patient in intensive care .
Revenues are falling not because the economy is healthy , but because it is poor .
Yet the current solution to the problem is flood the housing market with money ?
Two years and nothing yet .
Who is really being helped here ?
And spare us the notion that everyone is making $ 250,000 a year ( by the way , that is what you would need to safely buy the once median price home of $ 600,000 ) .
In fact , this warrants putting a chart together :
So if this is the income distribution , how in the world did the median home price in the state approach the $ 600,000 mark ?
When you can make things up on mortgages like Alt - A loans and option ARMs , you can leverage yourself to whatever your heart desires .
If income is being made up , then there is no restraint on the bubble .
The only restraint is how much the criminal mortgage broker is willing to put on the gross income line .
California ’s Future ?
A recent survey shows that people are planning on spending less this holiday season .
This does not bode well for the sales tax California depends on .
And even though the stock market is up , like we have mentioned , many wealthy individuals have creative accountants that can game the system so the state should n’t expect a 60 percent bounce in revenues from this group even though the market has gone up this much .
Why ?
Because job hiring is still missing on the radar screen .
Some are viewing housing as the proxy to a recovery .
They see sales stabilizing and moving up and prices pulling back from the cliff and all of a sudden project this data onto the overall economy .
Yet they fail to realize the incredible subsidies that are floating in the housing market .
The $ 8,000 tax credit , historically low interest rates brought on by the Fed , a glut of low priced homes , investors desiring to be the next Rich Dad , and this notion that housing gave us the go - go 2000s so it will also lead us out .
That is the problem .
This obsession with housing .
Why not give tax credits for job creation ?
Or what about lowering interest rates on SBA loans so people can start businesses ?
Of course , the housing shills only care about and focus on housing with their one track mind .
They fail to see that housing will not lead us out of this recession .
It has to come from other industries .
California has a fleet of delusional realtors and brokers just itching to get back to 2005 .
They fail to see that 23 percent of people are unemployed and underemployed or that the state is back in a billion dollar budget deficit .
Rome is burning but they continue to play on their housing fiddle .
We will be dealing with another budget deficit soon .
This is in the cards .
And it is only a matter of time that the federal government raises taxes .
This is inevitable .
You ca n’t run trillion dollar deficits and expect the U.S. dollar to remain strong .
So we know where this is heading .
So much money spent on the banks and housing .
What a waste .
We could have spent the money on targeted job creation and housing would have fixed itself on its own .
Instead , we have handed out approximately $ 13 trillion to the banks and Wall Street through giveaways and backstops .
You still believe that what is good for Wall Street and Banks is good for the average American ?
Well the data above shows us it is certainly not good for California .

On Saturday , I posted about the strange , dark week of despair dropped on the world by Garfield in a 1989 series of newspaper strips .
Did Garfield die ?
Or was he just in the midst of a serious existential crisis ?
After all these years , the mystery has been solved .
This week , BB reader Kevin Skinner happened to have the opportunity to ask the comic 's creator , Jim Davis , about the so - called " Death of Garfield " series .
From Kevin 's email to me :
I read the ( " Death of Garfield ? " ) post a couple of days ago and was intrigued because I was scheduled to have a business meeting with Jim Davis in just a couple of days ( I work for Hallmark ) .
Well , I had that meeting at Paws ( Davis ' company ) yesterday and I used the opportunity to ask him just exactly what he had in mind when he wrote those strips .
The answer was simple .
He was not inspired by any cartoon ( though I could certainly see why the other commenter might believe so ) .
Garfield is NOT dead , nor is he starving to death ( Jim actually laughed loudly when I suggested these theories ) .
It was simply a week before Halloween and Jim wanted to do something legitimately scary , as opposed to Halloween - scary .
" Ghosts are n't scary … " he told me before explaining that before writing the strips he went around to everyone he knew and asked them what truly scared them .
The answer he got most often was " being alone " or " dying alone " .
Just that simple .
I mentioned the post to Jim and he seemed tickled .
I told him that I intended to set the record straight and he seemed fine with it .
As a matter of fact he was unaware of the many internet - circulated theories about the strips ( it took him a moment to even understand which strips I was talking about ) .
I have to admit that I am more than a little thrilled to have had the opportunity to address ( and resolve ) something that so many are speculating about .
A rare opportunity indeed …

The proposals would " challenge body images " say the party The Liberal Democrats have called for a ban on the " airbrushing " of images of women in magazines read by young girls .
Members at its party conference also backed proposals to require all photos " retouched " to make them more attractive to be clearly labelled .
Lib Dem MP
Jo Swinson said the proposals would challenge the " conformity of the perfect body image " .
She said such images were " dishonest and harmful " and had contributed to the rise in eating disorders .
' Dishonest ' Lib Dem members in Bournemouth overwhelmingly backed plans to regulate digitally enhanced images and impose a ban on airbrushed pictures in titles aimed at the under - 16s .
Photos in magazines and advertisements were being regularly manipulated , Ms Swinson said , to portray " perfect " images which were unattainable and damaging to most women .
These included doctored images of " whiter teeth , longer legs , flatter tummies and bigger breasts " , she said .
" Advertising makes big money from images of flawless women , " she said .
" It is dishonest , harmful and it has got to change . "
She admitted the proposal , which will now be adopted as party policy , would " ruffle " some feathers but argued the state had to take a lead rather than rely on the industry to change its practices .
She rejected suggestions the proposals would not work and that people would still be unable to tell whether models featured in pictures were genuine and had not had cosmetic surgery or been on a diet .
Legislation would not be required to force the change , she added , offering to work with the advertising and media industries as well as regulators to change existing codes of conduct .
Lib
Dem party members said the move would force advertisers to be more honest and open .
One , Ettie Spencer , said " urgent " action was required as more and more young women were under " all - consuming " pressure to emulate celebrities and fashion models .

AHMEDABAD : In a bizarre incident , a 35 - year - old man , Ramveer Singh Baghel , cut his tongue and offered it to appease goddess Amba at a temple in Meghaninagar on Sunday morning .
Devotees , who found him bleeding profusely from his mouth , treated him like a deity and anointed his forehead instead of rushing him to the hospital .
Surrounded by devotees , he had not received any medical attention till late evening on Sunday .
Baghel too has chosen to stay in the temple .
�� �He is a devout man and kept fasts and other religious penance twice a year for Navratri and Chaitri Navratri .
This Navratri , he was being guided by a sadhu to eat just once a day and chant mantras continuously .
He told me in gestures that he dreamt on Saturday night that Mataji appeared before him and asked for a sacrifice .
He chose to offer his tongue , ��� said Suresh Baghel , his uncle .
Baghel , who is unmarried , migrated from Bhind , Madhya Pradesh some 20 years ago .
He stays at Kismatnagar in Meghaninagar and works as painter for building contractors .
Early on Sunday , devotees thronging the Amba Mata temple spotted Baghel at 5 am with blood oozing from his mouth .
When they enquired , he pointed to the deity���s feet where they saw his tongue lying .
A blade was also found in a corner of the temple .
The devotees then washed off the blood stains and gave him a fresh pair of clothes .
As news spread that a man had chopped off his tongue , people started pouring in to see him .
Some even garlanded him and took out a small procession in his honour .
���His tongue is still lying in the temple .
There is no chance of corrective surgery now .
The devotees are not ready to take him to a hospital , ��� said a local resident on condition of anonymity .
BR Pandor , deputy commissioner of police said , �� �There is little we can do until a police complaint is filed .
However , we are trying to ensure that the man at least gets some medical attention .���
Democratic members of the House of Representatives now represent most of the nation 's wealthiest people , a sharp turnaround from the long - standing dominance that Republicans have held over affluent districts .
A USA TODAY analysis of new Census data found that Democrats represent a far different constituency today than they did in 2005 , when they were the minority in the House , or in 1990 , when they were the majority .
The Democratic - controlled House is now an unusual combination of the richest and poorest districts , the best and least educated , and the best and the worst insured .
The analysis found that Democrats have attracted educated , affluent whites who had tended previously to vote Republican .
Democrats now represent 57 % of the 4.8 million households that had incomes of $ 200,000 or more in 2008 .
In 2005 , Republicans represented 55 % of those affluent households .
" Democrats have made enormous gains in affluent , educated suburban districts , " says Warren Glimpse , founder of Proximity , a firm that analyzes demographics .
" What 's not clear is whether this reflects a profound change or a temporary blip . "
The Democrats ' new coalition of extremes could cause friction on issues such as health care and tax policy because of Democratic proposals to raise taxes on affluent households .
" We 're going to win back the hearts and minds of affluent voters when people see what the left - leaning Democrats do on health care and the economy , " says Connecticut Republican Party Chairman Chris Healy .
His state 's three most affluent districts have flipped from Republican control to Democrats since 2006 .
Ruy Teixeira of the liberal Center for American Progress disagrees : " The movement of professionals to the Democratic Party is a long - term realignment in American politics . "
" The story is really education , " says David Wasserman of the non-partisan Cook Political Report .
He says " educated , wine - drinking Democrats " and poorer minority voters are an effective coalition because both groups are increasing in numbers .
Even so , Wasserman expects
Democrats to lose up to two dozen seats in the 2010 congressional elections , especially in poorer , white districts .
Democrats have virtually erased the historic wealth gap that has long defined the parties and their policies .
The median household income of Democratic districts last year was just $ 1,180 less than in Republican districts , down from $ 6,793 in 1990 .
Wasserman says Republicans have tended to appeal to affluent voters since the Roosevelt era in the 1930s and 1940s but recently have appealed more to Southern and rural voters , who often have lower incomes .
Key demographic findings : • Education Democrats represent the top 10 and bottom 10 districts ranked by the percentage of people holding advanced degrees .
• Health insurance .
Democrats represent the 10 districts with the highest levels of health coverage and nine of the 10 with the lowest .

Who has nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t heard of the ubiquitous Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ secret Swiss bank accountÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ it is right up there in financial folklore with Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ off - shore tax havenÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ an account in the CaymansÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
Switzerland has long been a preferred destination for those looking to keep a lid on their financial dealings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the nobility of Europe during the French revolution , to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ newÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â  rich of today looking to avoid taxes ( or possibly even the source of their wealth itself ) .
In 2008 , the International Financial Services , London ( www.ifsl.org.uk) reported that $ 1.8 billion USD was deposited by non-Swiss residents , making Switzerland the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest offshore financial center .
But recent international rules on the sharing of client details could mean the days of the secret bank account are coming to an end .
One prominent Swiss bank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wegelin & Co. which just happens to be SwitzerlandÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oldest bank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recently went so far as to actually tell its clients to either sell their U.S. assets , or find another bank .
Wegelin & Co. Managing Partner Konrad Hummler said in an interview on Tuesday that the bank officials Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ came to the conclusion that itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s [ the new US regulations ] a threat to our clients .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s also a threat to us as a bank because as a custodian , we are an executor to the estate .
We find this aspect discomforting , so we recommend selling all American securities whatsoever .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
For decades , countries have been trying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with little success Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to gain access to information on accounts their citizens hold with Swiss banks ; but at last AprilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s G20 meeting , sufficient pressure was brought to bear on Swiss authorities , that regulators agreed to force banks to share account details on their non-Swiss customers .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailed the agreement as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ a new global financial order founded in transparencyÃ¢â‚ ¬Â , declaring that Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ the era of banking secrecy is overÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
A bit over the top perhaps , but there is no question that the concept of the Swiss bank account has been changed forever .
In May , Washington tabled new laws expected to recover close to $ 8 billion from private individuals sheltering funds offshore , and about $ 300 billion from corporations using a tax law loophole allowing them to defer taxes on profits earned in foreign countries .
But the pivotal case destined to set a new precedent for client disclosuere involves UBS , a bastion of the Swiss banking industry .
The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) led the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s charge against UBS , finally coercing the banking giant to provide the names and account details for several thousand U.S. citizens suspected of evading taxes in their homeland .
Swiss authorities finally relented , providing a list of names thought to include nearly five thousand accounts .
The IRS has offered amnesty for those that voluntarily declare their offshore accounts , but for those that hope to avoid a hefty tax bill , time could be running out .
Shortly after receiving the list from UBS , the IRS brought charges against the first of these account holders with many more expected in the coming months .

Prime Minister Stephen Harper kicked off Friday 's news conference in St - Georges , Que. , by saying he would like to see more than six National Hockey League teams in Canada .
" Of course , as a big hockey fan , I would certainly like to see more teams created here in Canada , " the prime minister replied .
" I think the cities of Quebec , Hamilton and Winnipeg are all able to support a team . "
Harper directed any further questions on hockey franchises to the NHL , adding he did n't want to be dragged into a local political debate .
Quebec
City is in the middle of a municipal election , and its incumbent mayor , Régis Labeaume , is campaigning on a promise to build a modern arena that could attract an NHL team .
Labeaume wants the provincial and federal governments to fund almost all of its projected $ 400 million cost .
The city lost its Nordiques team in the 1990s .
In May , Harper said southern Ontario could support a second NHL club .
At the time , Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie had submitted a $ 212.5 - million US offer to buy the financially ailing Phoenix Coyotes .
Balsillie's bid to purchase the Coyotes and relocate them to Hamilton ended in failure on Sept. 30 , with the co-CEO of Research in Motion Ltd. , maker of the BlackBerry smartphone , choosing not to appeal an Arizona bankruptcy judge 's rejection of his bid .
The new research suggests a way vegetables may help prevent heart disease .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- New British Heart Foundation ( BHF ) research from Imperial College London may have revealed why vegetables are good for the heart .
The findings suggest that a chemical found in vegetables such as broccoli , cabbage and cauliflower , can boost a natural defence mechanism to protect arteries from disease .
Arteries do n’t clog up in a uniform way .
Bends and branches of blood vessels - where blood flow is disrupted and can be sluggish - are much more prone to the build - up of fatty plaques known as atherosclerosis .
Atherosclerosis can lead to angina , heart attack and stroke .
BHF - funded researchers from Imperial College London have discovered that a normally - protective protein called Nrf2 is inactive in areas of arteries that are susceptible to disease .
But , they also found that treatment with a chemical found in certain vegetables - known to gardeners as ‘ brassicas ’ - can activate Nrf2 in these disease - prone regions .
Dr Paul Evans , from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London , who led the research team , said : “ We found that the innermost layer of cells at branches and bends of arteries lack the active form of Nrf2 , which may explain why they are prone to inflammation and disease .
Treatment with the natural compound sulforaphane reduced inflammation at the high - risk areas by ' switching on ' Nrf2 .
“ Sulforaphane is found naturally in broccoli , so our next steps include testing whether simply eating broccoli , or other vegetables in their ‘ family ’ , has the same protective effect .
We also need to see if the compound can reduce the progression of disease in affected arteries . ”
Brassicas - also called ‘ cruciferous ’ vegetables - include broccoli ( which has the highest levels of sulforaphane ) , cabbage , kale , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , bok choy and rocket .
Professor Peter Weissberg , Medical Director at the BHF , said : “ These fascinating findings provide a possible mechanism by which eating vegetables protects against heart disease .
“ As well as adding evidence to support the importance of eating ‘ five - a - day ’ , the biochemistry revealed in this research could lead to more targeted dietary or medical approaches to prevent or lessen disease that leads to heart attacks and strokes . ”
Using normal mice , and mice engineered to lack the Nrf2 protein , the research found that in straight sections of arteries Nrf2 was present in the endothelial ‘ lining ’ cells .
Through its action on other proteins , it prevented the cells from becoming inflamed , which is an early stage in the development of atherosclerosis .
In the lining cells of disease - prone sites - such as bending or branched arteries - Nrf2 was attached to a protein that made it inactive .
This stifled its protective properties .
The addition of sulforaphane re-activated Nrf2 in the disease - prone regions of the artery , restoring the cells ’ ability to protect themselves from becoming inflamed .
The researchers believe that this will enable these artery regions to remain healthy for longer , or even reduce the progression of existing disease .
This will be tested in their next phase of research .
The research is published today in the Journal Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology .

“ We did exactly what the government wanted us to do , ” said Ms. Myers , a third grade teacher .
“ We stimulated the economy . ”
Mortgage applications increased nearly 10 percent for the week ending Sept. 3 from late August , the largest gain since early April and the latest of many signs of life in real estate .
The upturn can be attributed to several factors : the return of confidence , very low mortgage rates , and prices in some markets that are at decade - low levels .
But the looming expiration of the tax credit on Nov. 30 seems to be playing a role too , particularly in relatively low - cost markets like Phoenix , Las Vegas and Dallas .
The 50 - year - old complex that the Myerses live in , grandly named the Lawn at Bluffview , provides a snapshot of the credit ’s influence  and limitations .
Two years ago , the buildings were converted from apartments to condominiums by their owner , a local developer .
In January , before the credit , only 30 of the 70 units had sold .
Since then , another seven units have sold , including the one bought by the Myerses .
Brian Denbow , who works for a subprime auto financing firm , also was spurred to action by the credit .
He too intends to use the money for furniture .
Five of the buyers did not qualify for the credit for various reasons .
The Lawn at Bluffview remains nowhere near full .
Potential buyers “ just want a deal , ” said the sales agent , Beverly Bell .
Two weeks ago , the price of the unsold units was cut 10 percent .
The National Association of Realtors estimates that about 350,000 sales this year would not have happened without the lure of the tax credit .
Moody ’s Economy.com used computer modeling to put the number at 400,000 .
Bronwen Maddox - this week 's Analysis presenter .
BBC Radio 4's Analysis : Small States is broadcast on Monday 12 October at 20.30 BST .
Read the programme transcript
We live in an age of small states .
When the UN was founded in 1945 it had 51 members .
Now there are 192 .
The post - colonial era spawned nations at a rapid rate .
The fragmentation of the USSR and its satellites created even more .
Many new nations are tiny .
Of the 53 members of the Commonwealth , for example , 32 have populations of fewer than 1.5 million people .
But is it a good idea to be small ?
In this week 's Analysis , Bronwen Maddox asks why so many small nations run into trouble .
Iceland : Small , beautiful , independent - and now broke .
And she considers whether the collapse of Iceland a year ago , once cited by the SNP as a model economy , makes Scottish independence look less likely - and less desirable .
Analysis finds that while there is an economic argument that size no longer matters ( because empire does n't pay and a country can get the resources it needs through trade ) , small nations are vulnerable to a number of threats : cronyism ; crime ; corruption ; and currency shocks .
There are success stories among the small nations of the world - from Singapore to Switzerland - and they have in common a number of attributes , like strong economic governance and advanced social development .
But their formula is not easily replicated .
Still , the desire for independence remains strong in aspiring nations all over the world .
Often , it is easy to understand why .
Analysis finds , however , that in many cases it is far from obvious that a successful campaign for independence will lead to a wealthier , happier nation - state .
Interviewees include : John Kay , economist and member of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers Dr Marc Weller , Reader in International Law at Cambridge University Professor Robert Wade from the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics Dr Muhamet Hamiti , Ambassador for the Republic of Kosovo , London Professor Lino Briguglio , Director of the University of Malta 's Islands and Small States Institute Kamalesh Sharma , Secretary - General of the Commonwealth Oksana Antonenko , Programme Director , Russia and Eurasia , the International Institute for Strategic Studies Pavel Samecki , EU commissioner for regional policy Bronwen Maddox is The Times ' chief foreign commentator .

As Congress nears votes on legislation that would overhaul the health care system , many small businesses say they are facing the steepest rise in insurance premiums they have seen in recent years .
Insurance brokers and benefits consultants say their small business clients are seeing premiums go up an average of about 15 percent for the coming year  double the rate of last year ’s increases .
That would mean an annual premium that was $ 4,500 per employee in 2008 and $ 4,800 this year would rise to $ 5,500 in 2010 .
The higher premiums at least partly reflect the inexorable rise of medical costs , which is forcing Medicare to raise premiums , too .
Health insurance bills are also rising for big employers , but because they have more negotiating clout , their increases are generally not as steep .
Higher medical costs aside , some experts say they think the insurance industry , under pressure from Wall Street , is raising premiums to get ahead of any legislative changes that might reduce their profits .
THE DEATH MASTER - 3000
How to build the ultimate Nerf terror weapon
Ever since I began hearing rumors that Hasbro was releasing a revolutionary Nerf machine gun I knew I had to get one .
When they finally came out I was the first in line at the local Toys - R - Us to slap down the $ 50 they charged for them .
I was n't disappointed .
In every imaginable way the Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EBF - 25 Blaster is markedly different from every other Nerf gun .
Powered by batteries instead of air pressure , it blasts outs
Nerf darts at the rate of three per second with ranges up to forty feet .
Unlike previous
Nerf guns , the heft of this weapon is significant .
While its 8 pounds may be too heavy for young children , for serious Nerf gamers its weight gives a sense of realism that no previous Nerf gun offers .
Also unique is the dart - holding chain that feeds through the gun just like a real machine gun .
This is truly an outstanding weapon , but ...
As much as I like this gun there are many problems with the design .
The plastic box that 's supposed to hold the chain comes off much too easily .
Worse still , while it prevents the loaded side of the chain from flopping around the emptied side of the chain dangles down , whipping this way and that with even small gun movements .
Equally problematic is the fact that when the last round is fired the chain just falls on the ground .
To address these and other performance issues , I ripped into my Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EBF - 25 Blaster and turned it from a merely competent machine gun to the DEATH MASTER - 3000 , killing machine .
Here 's how I did it :
Increasing the Firing Duration :
While 25 rounds of continuous fire is impressive , you have to realize that it 's all over in 8 seconds .
So the first thing I wanted to do was increase the length of the ammo chain .
Increasing it to 75 or even 100 rounds sounds attractive , but the fact is that such a long chain would be so bulky and heavy and prone to tangling that it 's impractical .
A 50 - round belt appears optimum .
I began by purchasing a spare belt and after lining it up with the belt that came with the gun , unscrewed the blank holders at the ends of each belt to free the nylon connecting material .
Next I cut off all but 1/4 - inch of the nylon belt from each end ...
... then stitched the two ends together , making sure to maintain the same 1/4 - inch spacing as all the other segments .
It 's also important to keep the dart holders parallel .
Because of the tight spacing this stitching was awkward and difficult .
Finally , I sealed the loose ends of the nylon belt material with a little flexible glue to prevent it from fraying .
And that was it !
Half an hour 's work yielded a 50 - dart belt .
Is it worth it ?
You bet .
There 's no sweeter pleasure than drilling a dart between your best friend 's horns because he thinks you 've run out of ammo .
A 50 - dart bent ensures you 'll experience this joy many times .
Curing the Floppy - Belt Problem :
A 50 - dart belt is almost 6 - feet long .
Moving around with that much ammo dragging on the ground is awkward to say the least .
My solution was to make two cardboard boxes measuring 4x6x7 inches and screw them to the sides of the gun .
One holds the loaded belt while the other captures the belt as it leaves the gun 's firing chamber .
No more floppy belts .
A piece of masonite glued to the inside face of each box provided a strong surface to hold the screws and support the box .
Make sure the screws are short enough so that they do n't block the battery case from sliding into its holding tray .
Boost ing the Fir ing Power :
The Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EDF - 25
Blaster has an average range for Nerf guns .
It would be nice to increase it as well as speed up the firing rate .
This was easily done by boosting the battery voltage from 9 to 12 - volts .
Start by buying a self - holding , 2 D - cell battery pack .
Connect the leads to 2 pieces of aluminum tape , which can be found in the heating and air conditioning department of any hardware store .
Stick the foil tape to opposite sides of a small square of poster board and slip this two - sided connector between the front two batteries in the gun 's battery pack .
Be sure that the polarity of the connector is aligned with the rest of the batteries or instead of boosting the output to 12 volts you 'll cut it to 6 .
Insert the gun 's battery pack as usual , guiding the extra battery pack 's wires so that they are n't pinched by the plastic retainer when it 's screwed into place .
Using adhesive - backed Velcro is an easy way to attach the extra battery pack to the bottom of the gun .
Because the extra battery holder is upside down , it 's important to get one that locks the batteries in place so they do n't fall out .
The extra voltage increases the range ten percent and boosts the firing rate from 3 to 4 darts per second .
A possible downside to this is that the motor is being over driven and the gun 's lifetime might be reduced because of this .
Held level at waist height the gun has a range of 25 feet .
Raised to a 45 - degree angle this increases to 42 feet , with a distance spread at that range of eight feet .
The Ta le of Two Darts :
The Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EDF - 25
Blaster accepts both normal darts and streamline darts .
Normal dart on the left , streamlined dart on the right .
Thinking that streamlined darts would add range I purchased a set and tested them against normal darts .
The results were surprising .
First : the streamlined darts did not go any further than the normal darts .
Second , the streamlined darts tended to swerve off the main firing line much more than normal darts .
Normal darts fired 30 feet had an average spread of two feet .
The streamlined darts at the same range averaged four , twice as great .
For my money the streamlined darts are n't worth the expense .
Another surprising result from this test concerns the normal darts all by themselves .
Take a closer look at the head of the normal dart in the picture above and it's easy to spot that it 's angled sharply to the right .
I assumed that this would cause the dart to swerve off the main line of fire .
It does n't .
I sorted all my darts into those with straight heads and those with the worst angled heads .
Firing these two groups through the Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EDF - 25 Blaster and marking the spread of each showed that the angled heads swerved no more than the straight ones .
Cosmetics :
And that 's it !
You now have a Nerf machine gun capable of out performing the Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EDF - 25 Blaster in convenience , firing duration , range and firing speed .
There 's just one lingering problem : the Nerf N - Strike Vulcan EDF - 25
Blaster 's bright orange and yellow coloring make it look like a toy .
The two cardboard boxes attached to the sides do n't help either .
I mean sure , it is a toy , but that does n't mean we can't make it look a little more macho if for no other reason than to show it 's not just another stock gun .
After masking off all the moving sections I spray painted the entire gun black .
My intention was then to add flame decals to dress it up but the fact is that it looked so good in solid black that I left it that way .
The only decoration I added was the DM - 3000 .
logo for " Death M aster - 3000 , " my new name for this ultimate Nerf terror weapon .
The black looks so good I 'm surprised Hasbro is n't offering the gun in this color , or at least a camouflaged version .
This heavily modified gun is n't suitable for heavy field action like rolling sideways over the ground but for standing in a bunker or moving upright it provides unequaled fire power .
IMPORTANT NOTE !
I have received emails from Nerf gun modifiers explaining that by common sense , and in some areas by law ,
toy guns should never be painted black because they may look too much like real weapons .

We ’ve seen a few cases in the past few years where someone was ordered to turn over a password to a computer system or the encryption key .
But now a dispute over the security of a law enforcement database has two county agencies in Maricopa Arizona battling in court and a judge threatening the sheriff ’s office with contempt of court if they do not turn it over .
It seems to have started with an interagency dispute as to which agency should control access to a computer system that serves both the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ( MCSO ) and the county ’s board of supervisors .
Three other agencies also use the computer system , including the Maricopa County Attorney .
On the system is a database — the integrated criminal justice information system ( ICJIS ) — that stores criminal records and information .
When budget cuts were made , the county manager had reportedly moved the system ’s information - technology positions to the Office of Enterprise Technology , which essentially gave control of the system to the county instead of to the sheriff ’s office .
In April , the MCSO sued the county supervisors to get control over it , citing state and federal law that allegedly requires that a criminal - justice agency manage the system .
On Wednesday , the MCSO took action , even though the matter was still before the court .
Depending on whose version you believe , and claiming that the state Department of Public Safety was concerned that civilians could have inappropriate access to criminal records in the system and that they feared an intrusion or breach was “ imminent , ” the MCSO either : ( a ) stormed the county building , threatened county workers with arrest if they interfered , and then proceeded to change the passwords on the computers or ( b ) just went in and responsibly changed the password so that only law enforcement personnel could access the ICJIS .
On Thursday , the Board of Supervisors and county administrators tried to get a temporary restraining order against the Sheriff ’s Office and to get the system back under their control .
The judge declined to issue the order and the hearing continued into Friday .
The Phoenix New Times live blogged the two days of hearings .
According to the paper :
The sometimes - jocular Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Heilman did n’t seem to be fooling around :
Near the conclusion of today ’s hearing , he said he wants the Sheriff ’s Office to turn over the computer system ’s administrative password to IT guru Tom Gendron [ Gendron is an IT consultant who works for ICJIS ] by Wednesday .
Hendershott , Sheriff Joe Arpaio ’s top administrator , huddled for a few seconds with the two lawyers for Arpaio .
Then Kerry Martin , the lead lawyer , told the judge his client was “ unable ” to give the password to Gendron .
That rankled the judge , who said whoever violated his order would be held in contempt .
After a few more affairs were put in order , Heilman ended the hearing by again warning that if the password was n’t divulged , “ someone ” was going to be held in contempt .
To hammer home his point , he looked at Arpaio ’s team and said it would likely be someone sitting at that table .
The defense ’s reason for not providing the password relates to the very same federal and state laws that they insist require them to be in charge of the security of the database .
In the interim , the judge ordered that no additional changes be made to the computer system .
He also reportedly ordered representatives of the five stakeholder agencies to meet next week , but according to the Phoenix New Times coverage , no one seemed to be sure who those representatives were .
To complicate matters even more , the Arizona Republic reports that
Hendershott said the Sheriff ’s Office is conducting a criminal investigation into suspected mismanagement of the computer system .
He said the investigation targets Superior Court presiding Judge Barbara Mundell , County Manager Smith and other county personnel .
He did not provide details on the investigation .
The Phoenix New Times adds that Hendershott “ did say he had questions about a half - million - dollar “ donation ” to the county from a computer company . ”
Will the MCSO back down and turn over the password as ordered , or will the sheriff go to jail ?
We ’ll have to wait to see what happens next week .
ARLINGTON , Va. --
The Washington Capitals have hired former NHL All - Star Arturs Irbe as their goaltending coach .
The Capitals made the announcement on Thursday .
Irbe replaces Dave Prior , who resigned after 12 years with the Capitals .
Irbe was an NHL goalie for 13 seasons with San Jose , Dallas , Vancouver and Carolina , compiling a 2.83 goals - against average and .899 save percentage .
He appeared in the 1994 and 1999 NHL All - Star games .
Irbe last was in the league in the 2003 - 04 season , then played professionally in Europe .
He was the goaltending coach for his hometown Dinamo Riga in Latvia in the Continental Hockey League last season .
Jill Abramson , the managing editor for news , agreed with me that the paper was " slow off the mark , " and blamed " insufficient tuned - in - ness to the issues that are dominating Fox News and talk radio . "
She and Bill Keller , the executive editor , said last week that they would now assign an editor to monitor opinion media and brief them frequently on bubbling controversies .
-- New York Times public editor Clark Hoyt , September 26 column [ emphasis added ]
Talk about great timing !
Just after
The New York Times announced it would appoint somebody to monitor the partisan opinion media more closely , and right after editors were chastened for reacting too slowly to buzzworthy news scoops launched by the conservative media , the right - wing press went into overdrive last week .
Like a proud peacock showing off its feathers , the right - wing media was in full bloom , showing the Times all the tricks that have made the movement 's trade so renowned .
There was outright lying , lying by omission , attempted guilt - by - association , U.S. - bashing , hateful smear campaigns ( lots of those ) , fearmongering , incompetence , and just batshit crazy stuff .
( Did I mention the heavy dose of crazy ? )
All the key notes were hit -- and in just one epic week .
I hope the Times is enjoying its new - found , front - row seat to the right - wing media 's slow - motion crack - up , where I doubt even the denizens can keep track of the avalanche of falsehoods , smears , and lies that now tumble out on a daily ( hourly ? ) basis .
The whole enterprise has come unglued by Obama 's presidency .
And where serial mendacity was once the rule , a whole new level of crazy has been achieved in 2009 .
Even conservative blogger Rick Moran last week called out the " lunacy " that fuels so much of the Obama hate ; a hate that 's stoked around the clock by conservative media .
And now the Times can chronicle it every day because editors there think they might uncover news leads .
Good luck with that .
The truth is , the partisan right - wing press this year has morphed into a minefield of paranoia , distrust , and hate .
But , hey , if The New York Times thinks it 's going to mine some news nuggets in the fever swamps , be my guest .
Whoever is tasked with tracking the right - wing media , though , ought to get combat pay because , trust me , monitoring the endless layers of misinformation and sheer lunacy that now power the conservative movement 's media deadens the senses pretty quickly .
It 's a permanent port hole into the dark recesses of American hate politics .
Nonetheless , in honor of the Times ' ( highly questionable ) decision to pay even more attention to the stories that are bubbling up on the far - right blogosphere , talk radio and Fox News -- to get hip to all that right - wing " buzz " -- let 's examine what just a seven - day span looked like .
The right - wing media last week offered up a smorgasbord of delicious news treats , with the Beck / Drudge / Malkin brigade producing some Grade - A news leads .
Indeed , the scoops last week practically came gift - wrapped , courtesy of the conservative media , which was en fuego .
Check that .
The right - wing media 's been en fuego for weeks now !
Who can forget Michelle Malkin 's big scoop on the day of the September 12 anti-Obama rally in Washington , D.C. ?
Two million protesters had taken to the streets , according to Malkin's " reporting . "
Buzz ?
That one was off the charts , with all the big - time bloggers and Fox News personalities helping to spread the blockbuster news .
( Pajamas Media 's Roger Simon : " [ T ] wo million people on the Washington Mall . Wow ! " )
OK , it 's true that Malkin 's estimate was off by , oh , 1.93 million people .
But , still , that was a perfect example of how right - wing bloggers do n't just sit around and wait for the news to happen .
They get out there and make ( up ) their own .
They create their own buzz , and the Times ought to respect that .
Let 's take a look at what other right - wing " buzz " stories the Times was treated to last week .
There was the big Drudge Report scoop about how a Fox TV affiliate in Chicago was " ordered " to not air a report it had done highlighting the fact that not all Chicagoans were behind the city 's push to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games .
The New York Times wants " buzz " ?
Drudge 's breaking story got wall papered online , with Breitbart.tv , Townhall.com , Don Surber , Scared Monkeys , Gates of Vienna , Riehl World View , and Confederate Yankee all cheering it on .
( i.e. " Silence ! Do Not Speak Ill of Chicago ! " )
Were there some holes in that story ?
Sure .
For instance , there was the screaming Drudge headline :
FOX - TV Chicago Ordered Not to Run Anti-Olympic Story
It turns out that according to Drudge 's own " reporting , " the innocuous 60 - second news report had already aired , which , of course , meant the headline about the station being " ordered not to run " was completely misleading .
And Malkin also did her best to improve the sketchy tale , in which a news director at the station reportedly decided not to re-air the segment .
Yet Malkin hyped the story to readers this way [ emphasis added ] :
Drudge reports that WFLD - TV has been ordered not to broadcast an anti-Olympics segment again .
That breathless phrasing , of course , made it sound like some nefarious outside source ( the Obama White House ? ) dictated a nasty bout of censorship , when in fact the decision was ( reportedly ) made internally .
Meanwhile , if the Times was looking for buzz last week , did any story ring louder than the far right 's campaign against Chicago 's Olympic bid ?
The conservative media 's Who's
Who signed up to condemn Chicago as a hellhole and berated the Obama White House for even thinking about elevating the Second City to the international stage and to showcase the American city .
Perhaps the only cries louder than the rhetorical brickbats hurled at Chicago were the subsequent shouts of joy when Chicago -- and America -- was denied the honor of hosting the Summer Games .
Thank God !
And then there was the stellar work produced by Andrew Breitbart , the self - styled leader of today 's conservative " journalism . "
His site last week claimed to have uncovered a video of community organizers praying to Obama .
Talk about " buzz " !
Obedient right - wing bloggers such as Malkin , Atlas Shrugs , RedState , Stop the ACLU , HotAirPundit , Sundries Shack , along with cable TV talkers Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs , immediately piled on , openly mocking a group of mostly African - Americans activists as they gathered in prayer .
( If second - graders are n't off - limits from being called " Obama - worshiping drones " by members of the right - wing media , why would people amidst prayer not be ridiculed , right ? )
One right - wing site accused the organizers of " blasphemy , " and lots more shrieked as loud as they could about how the devastating video confirmed that loony liberals were falling for the Cult of Obama .
RedState : " Speechless . "
Hot Air Pundit : " Difficult to watch . "
Stop the ACLU : " It 's a cult . "
HotAirPundit : " Shocking Video . "
Slight problem :
When some sane people outside of Breitbart 's ( hate ) circle actually watched the video , they realized that the community organizers who gathered were n't saying " Obama . "
They were saying " Oh God , " which is typical when people are in prayer .
So , yeah , that was a hiccup .
Meaning , the only reason Breitbart posted the video was in order to smear liberal activists in prayer because he thought they were saying " Obama . "
That was the whole point of the video .
But Breitbart bungled the audio , which meant the smear collapsed , even some right - wing bloggers , such as ... well , pretty much all them , never bothered to correct their original posts in which they called the organizers out as creepy cult members .
But Times editors please take note -- huge buzz !
And boy , did the conservative press think it hit the jackpot last week with its latest ACORN installment : Obama 's right - hand political man inside the White House , Patrick Gaspard , used to be a big shot for ACORN .
Connect the dots , people !
Fox News , American Spectator , RedState , Jawa Report , and National Review Online all did .
Slight problem .
The Gaspard claim was n't true .
Meanwhile , led by Fox News , the right - wing media did their best to get fired an openly gay member of the Obama administration , Kevin Jennings , the director of the Department of Education 's Office of Safe and Drug - Free Schools .
Fox News ' Bill Hemmer reported that 21 years ago when Jennings was a school counselor and giving advice to a gay student , Jennings had known of a " statutory rape " case between the student and a grown man , but had " never reported it . "
Others at Fox accused Jennings of " covering up statutory rape . "
Also , Rush Limbaugh accused Jennings of encouraging a sexual relationship between the student and an adult .
So did the Washington Times editorial page : Jennings " encourag[ed ] " a relationship that amounted to " statutory rape . "
Fox News reported the boy in question was " 15 years old . "
And The Washington Examiner even claimed
there was a link between Jennings and the North American Man-Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA ) .
But yes , upon reflection the very buzz -y story had some holes in it .
And yes , the over - heated exercise felt much more like a primal witch hunt that it did any sane attempt to gather facts .
( RedState : Jennings is a " radical homosexual druggie . " )
The problems with the story ?
Not all the allegations lobbed against Jennings in regard to the incident 21 years held up .
In fact , none of them did .
Period .
In light of last week 's conservative media performance , where basically no buzzworthy story -- or even individual facts -- could be trusted , here 's an idea for the Times and its self - proclaimed interest in right - wing opinion media :
Maybe the newspaper ought to report truthfully about the nonstop cascade of lies and misinformation that emanates from the conservative media .
Maybe instead of waiting around for the proverbial clock to be right twice a day , the Times should n't cherry pick the tiny number of " buzz " stories that stand up to outside scrutiny and create legitimate news .
Instead , the Times ought to regularly highlight how so much of what passes for " news " within the right - wing echo chamber is just hateful -- and purposeful -- misinformation .
In other words , maybe the Times ought to practice some journalism .

Poor little old innocent Lou Dobbs .
That big , bad " left wing " media is attacking him for " simply asking questions " .
Oh ... so that 's what you were doing ?
So saying he had a " document problem " was n't meant to imply he's an illegal alien , right Lou ?
I 'd say rather than the " left wing " media , it 's more just anyone who is n't insane and calls you out for what you 're doing , which is feeding the crazies with this birther nonsense , but who am I to quibble ?
If you want to continue to implode on national television night after night and make an utter fool of yourself , do n't let me stop you .
Although Dobbs admits that he thinks the President is a citizen , he still thinks this is a subject worth carrying on about , which Roland Martin does a pretty good job of taking him to task for .
He beat back Rep. Ted Poe 's nonsense over the validity of what the State of Hawaii has given as proof of Obama 's birth as well .
I 'm actually surprised Martin did n't say something back to hot head Dobbs when he told him he needed to keep his cool .
Dobbs has no room to talk about anyone else losing their temper after his nightly rants on illegal immigrants or whatever topic du jour has him baring his teeth in rage .
Roland Martin has it right here .
If Dobbs admits there is no question about whether the President is a natural born citizen of the United States , why does he feel the need to keep saying there 's a controversy ?
Dobbs knows full well what he 's doing but could care less what the ramifications are .
DOBBS : So , you do n't think the president has a copy ?
Now , you are saying , where 's the original ?
According to the state of Hawaii , that is the document that establishes where he was born .
So , what is the issue ?
ROLAND MARTIN , CNN CONTRIBUTOR :
Well , first and foremost , he 's produced the document he received from the state of Hawaii .
DOBBS : Why not ?
That 's the question , Roland Martin .
What 's the answer ?
I believe Barack Obama is a citizen of the United States , folks .
Do n't you ?
But I do have a couple of little questions , like you .
Why not just provide a copy of the birth certificate ?
That 's entirely within the president 's power .
DOBBS : I think the president of the United States is a citizen .
But what I do n't understand is why he has n't just produced it to get this -- this noise out of the way .
Just -- just one statement , very quickly , if you will .
Play that .
Before we get started , I want to be clear where I stand , because the -- the left - wing media kind of forgot to leave out -- kind of left a few things out .
It was inconvenient to their stories .
Joining me now , Roland Martin .
He 's CNN contributor , syndicated columnist .
And joining us as well , Congressman Ted Poe .
That explanation , however , has not satisfied some critic .
And a number of Americans are asking , why not ?
The left - wing media has attacked me because I simply asked the question .
Meanwhile , the state of Hawaii says it can't release a paper copy of the president 's original birth certificate because they say the state government discarded the original document when the health department records went electronic some eight years ago .
DOBBS : President Obama promised transparency and openness in his administration .
Yet , he 's chosen not to release his original birth certificate or a copy of it .
MARTIN : No , but what is the issue ?
DOBBS : Well , the issue is ...
MARTIN : I mean , he 's the president .
He 's been certified .
He 's in office .
DOBBS : Well , he 's a president .
I mean , he 's not like a -- I mean , you make it sound like he 's been anointed something beyond that .
MARTIN : No , no , he 's a president of the United States , the 44th .
DOBBS : Yes .
Yes .
MARTIN : So , what -- what is the point ?
I mean , exactly where is the story in this ?
If he has presented a document , the state of Hawaii has confirmed that -- that he was indeed born there , what 's the issue ?
DOBBS : Ted Poe , Congressman , what 's the -- what 's the issue ?
REP .
TED POE ( R ) , TEXAS :
Well , the president has not produced a birth certificate .
He has produced what is a birth announcement from the state of Hawaii .
And this could all be settled if he would just produce the birth certify call .
And that 's why we have introduced legislation that , in future elections , that the president prove that he is a resident for 14 years , that he 's over 35 , and that he 's a native - born American .
And that applies to everybody , and we get rid of all this controversy , and we move on down the road .
MARTIN : Congressman , it 's nonsense .
First of all , you were a state judge in Texas .
I was born and raised in Houston .
I remember seeing your stories all the time .
My dad , when I got him got a passport , he did n't have his original birth certificate .
He went to the Houston Department of Health and got a copy of his birth certificate .
It satisfied his passport , satisfied the State Department .
So , how can you say that 's legitimate ; oh , but the president has not presented what the state of Hawaii said is an official document with their seal on it ?
POE : Because it is not a birth certificate .
It 's not even a copy of the birth certificate .
It is a birth announcement .
It is like me sending out a birth announcement for one of my children ...
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : No .
What is in the newspaper is a birth announcement .
( CROSSTALK )
POE : And that 's what it is .
MARTIN : That is an official document .
What is in the newspaper is a birth announcement , Congressman .
Come on .
DOBBS : Let -- let -- if I may interject ...
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : ... do we have a -- could we just put up a copy of that certificate -- certificate of live birth ?
What you are looking at there , which I believe is the copy that comes from FactCheck.org or Annenberg , there 's no reference there to the attending physician .
There 's no reference there to the hospital in which he was born .
It is a certificate that refers to the fact that another certificate exists .
MARTIN : Is it an official state document ?
DOBBS : I 'm sorry ?
MARTIN : Is it an official state document of the state of Hawaii ?
DOBBS : Well , let me try this again , so I can be really clear about it .
It is a document that says there 's another document .
It does not include that -- you are referring to your father 's birth certificate .
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : A copy of his birth certificate would have the doctor , the hospital that he was born in , correct ?
And this is the -- and , by the way , this is just what people are concerned about .
MARTIN : No , no , whose people , first of all ?
You got 13 percent ...
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : ... 600,000 people who have signed a petition .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Six hundred thousand .
Thirteen percent of Americans , 39 million , still think he is Muslim .
And we have done everything , Lou , to debunk that as an absolute lie .
So , it is irrelevant .
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : OK .
If you want to make it irrelevant , that 's fine .
POE : Well , I do n't know why you are getting so ...
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : Yes , go ahead , Congressman .
POE : Well , I do n't know why you are getting so upset .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Because , Congressman , you probably -- because you probably have better things to do , Congressman , than this silly little law here .
( CROSSTALK )
POE : ... certificate for McCain .
They were -- your side was ...
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : No , no , no , no , Congressman .
Congressman , let me correct you with something .
( CROSSTALK )
POE : And , so , he produced his birth certificate ...
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Congressman , I want to ...
( CROSSTALK )
POE : ... territories of Arizona .
MARTIN : Congressman , Congressman , nice try .
But , first of all , I voted Republicans and Democrats .
So , do n't try the " your side . "
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : I thought the left - wing people were nuts as well .
I just want to correct you on that one .
( CROSSTALK )
POE : Why are you so upset ?
Produce the birth certificate .
That 's all you have got to do .
MARTIN : No , no , because it is silly .
It is silly .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : It 's silly .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Are you losing sleep over this ?
DOBBS : Look , Roland , look , Roland ...
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : I mean , Lou , are you losing sleep over this ?
DOBBS : Roland , here 's what I would like you to do .
I would like you to remember , if you would -- and I 'm -- and I 'm trying to be as nice as I can be , but you are yelling and you 're getting awfully excited about something that , you know , does n't require this level of ...
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Well , I think it is hilarious .
DOBBS : Then laugh .
But do n't -- please , do n't ...
MARTIN : But it 's utterly hilarious , Lou .
DOBBS : The congressman might take your remarks a different way .
And I 'm asking is that you just -- you know , relax just a bit .
And let 's take a look at headlines from " The New York Times , " if we may , from last year , when at -- at question was Senator John McCain 's citizenship , and see if we can see a difference in the way in which they have approached this -- this issue .
This is " The New York Times . "
" A hint of new life to the McCain birth issue . "
" McCain 's canal zone birth prompts queries about whether that rules him out " -- The New York Times , " and , in July of last year , with an article .
I mean , it goes on .
The issue of " Justices turn back on a challenge on Obama that has stopped squall of Internet - fueled rumors . "
There 's an obvious difference in tone here from " The New York Times " when talking about John McCain than there is when they were talking about Barack Obama .
MARTIN : And I do n't care about the " New York Times " column .
The issue there ...
( CROSSTALK ) DOBBS : But I do .
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : And that 's why I bring it up .
MARTIN : Lou , your issue , though , is about a certificate .
It 's not about how the media is covering it .
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : No , no .
No , no .
MARTIN : So , which one is it ?
DOBBS : My -- my issue is this , OK ?
When this could be dispelled so quickly , and -- and simply by producing it , why not do it ?
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : He has produced a document that is satisfactory , but it 's not satisfactory to you .
So , Lou , he 's not here to satisfy Lou Dobbs .
He 's the president of the United States .
He probably has other things that 's on his mind than satisfying Lou Dobbs .
DOBBS : Yes .
And does that , then , what , just dismiss the concern ?
MARTIN : No .
He has presented a document that is legal .
In the state of Hawaii , it is legal .
It is a document .
It 's there .
Now , because you 're not satisfied , OK .
And , Lou , if this ...
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : Do n't worry about my -- do n't worry about my satisfaction .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : No , no .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : Lou , you 're the one who is still making this an issue .
( CROSSTALK )
DOBBS : No , no , please .
Again , did you hear what I said ?
MARTIN : Yes .
DOBBS : I believe he 's a citizen .
MARTIN : OK .
So , why even continue the story ?
Is it keeping you up at night ?
It is a non-issue .
It is irrelevant .
You say so many Americans care .
( CROSSTALK )
MARTIN : No , it is an irrelevant issue .
It 's been established .
He 's the president .
DOBBS : All right .
All right .
MARTIN : What is the big deal ?
DOBBS : Is there a big deal here , Congressman Poe ?
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The 7.2 million jobs lost in the recession wo n't return until 2012 or beyond , according to a new survey of top business economists released Monday .
Economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics said any recovery is likely to be so gradual that these jobs wo n't return to the labor market for three years .
Less than 8 % of the 44 economists surveyed expect to regain the lost jobs before 2012 .
About 54 % expect to see the loss fully reversed by 2012 .
At the same time , 33 % project it will take until 2013 to recover the lost jobs .
Five percent say it will take even longer .
Real GDP is expected to advance at a 2.9 % pace over the second half of this year and at a moderate 3 % pace next year , the survey concluded .
The NABE panel forecast the unemployment rate to rise to 10 % in the first quarter of next year and only slip to 9.5 % by the end of 2010 .
The economists think the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at record low levels until late next spring , and then will push rates up to 1.0 % by the end of the year .
Inflation will remain low , the economists said .
Substantial labor market slack will keep wages from rising .
The core index of personal consumption expenditures , the Fed 's preferred measure of inflation , to forecast to tick up to 1.5 % in 2010 from the 1.4 % rate expected this year .
The forecasters think it will take some time for financial markets to return to normal .
Almost a third of the panel members believe this will not occur until some time between 2011 and 2013 .
The housing market will gather momentum next year and contribute to overall growth for the first year since 2005 .
House prices are slated for a modest 2 % gain in 2010 .
Consumer spending is expected to remain sluggish given the lagged effects of past wealth loss and a weak labor market .
The savings rate is not expected to rise sharply however and will average only 3 - 5 % through 2012 .
LONDON 
If the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain exists partly to subvert expectations , then the first expectation it subverts is that it is going to be very , very bad .
“ Relief is one of the major emotions of our audience , ” declared Dave Suich , an orchestra member .
But the happy surprise of encountering something completely different from the Tiny Tim - style hamming or banjo - plucking embarrassment of your imagination does n’t wholly explain the deep love the orchestra inspires , not just in Britain , but also in Europe and as far away as New Zealand and Japan .
Previously the private passion of a large but sub rosa group of devotees , the orchestra hit mainstream popularity last month when it performed to a sold - out crowd at the BBC Proms music festival at the Royal Albert Hall here .
“ They have grown into a much - loved institution , ” The Observer of London wrote .
In The Financial Times Laura Battle praised the orchestra members ’ “ consummate skill ” and said that the “ sophisticated sound they make  both percussive and melodic  is at once hilarious and heartfelt . ”
The Evening Standard said , “ The country would plainly be a happier place if more of us played the ukulele . ”
Part of the appeal is that the group  eight of them , all singing and playing the ukulele  extracts more than seems humanly possible from so small and so modest an instrument , with its four little strings .
Part of it is the members ’ deadpan sense of humor , in which they laugh at themselves as much as at the music .

As a strong supporter of Barack Obama ’s candidacy , and of his administration in general , I must concede that Glenn Greenwald yesterday proved why he is such a valuable commentator in taking the administration on .
He kept his rhetorical tics to a minimum and avoided the “ ideological wind tunnel ” effect that so much of his writing produces – and this allowed his piece to have a broader impact .
Alright – he started off with the same weirdly exaggerated sense of perspective – proving my previous point that Glenn Greenwald uses hyperbole the way other writers use punctuation :
It ’s now apparent that the biggest sham in American politics is Barack Obama ’s pledge to close Guantanamo and , more generally , to dismantle the Bush / Cheney approach to detaining accused Terrorists .
[ my emphasis ]
But Greenwald quickly got down to making the substantive case – which on this front is extremely strong .
On my blog and elsewhere , I have brought up Bagram as an example of Obama ’s most clear failure , though I have n’t yet made the sustained case as Greenwald does .
As I wrote earlier , the Supreme Court ’s rulings on the rights of detainees to certain basic rights at Guantánamo was based on the idea that our government should not be able to deprive an individual of rights merely by moving them to a particular location .
Yet this is exactly what the Obama administration is claiming .
Our nation ’s freedoms are grounded in our traditions , and at the base of these traditions is a single , fundamental restriction on the state .
To quote Winston Churchill :
The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law , and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers , is in the highest degree odious , and the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist .
Greenwald does not attempt to reconcile Obama ’s views about Guantánamo as a candidate with the positions taken by his administration now – he simply hurls the well - justified charge of hypocrisy while tossing in a few snide remarks about those who continue to support Obama ( which is a Greenwald staple . )
He does not try to grapple with the issues the Obama administration faces in trying to deal with the political , legal , and strategic consequences of the radical actions taken by the Bush administration .
Greenwald is not the “ fox ” of Isaiah Berlin ’s parable , but the very Bushian hedgehog .
And on this issue , the hedgehog has grasped the basic truth :
In condemning Bush for Guantánamo and the secret CIA prisons while expanding Bagram and using this different location for the same or similar purposes cannot stand , the Obama administration is engaging in rank hypocrisy which we can not let stand .
( As Greenwald points out , its unclear what exactly Bagram is being used for as the Obama administration has been keeping too many documents secret . )
I highly reccomend you read Greenwald ’s important post from yesterday .
By acting this way regarding detainees at Bagram , Barack Obama threatens the very Rule of Law that he came into office promising to protect – and that he swore to protect when taking the oath of office .
Liberals must oppose this ; conservatives must oppose this ; libertarians must oppose this ; Americans must oppose this , and be guided by “ Something wiser than our own quick personal impulses … [ & ] sweeter than the taste of a political victory . ”
We must be guided , simply , by Our Lady of the Law .

Tom DeLay was icing his foot and resting his booty .
On Monday , his debut as a dancing fool ( or just a fool , depending on whom you talk to ) , he had started at 10 a.m. and ended at 10 p.m. , and his pre-stress fracture was acting up .
“ It swole up a little bit , ” he said , on the phone from Los Angeles .
“ The doctor says to keep icing it . ”
That meant a delay in learning the tango from Cheryl Burke , his partner on ABC ’s “ Dancing With the Stars ” who blessedly had never heard of the guy once dubbed “ The Meanest Man in Congress ” when he was first assigned to her .
“ Cheryl says the tango ’s macho , arrogant and aggressive , and I said , ‘ That ’s me , ’ ” he recalled .
The Hammer , who in rehearsal admitted to feeling like “ a complete goose ”  and not simply because he had his golf shirt tucked into his sweat pants  is clinging to his Texas machismo even as he follows Cheryl ’s instruction to find his “ feminine side . ”

Lithuanian twelfth grader Andrius Šutas built his own robot for Rubik 's cube solving and does not hesitate to share secrets of the build ( i. e. schematics , CAD design , source code ) .
It 's not very fast , but does the job pretty well and the simplicity of the design looks good .
The solving algorithm in question is layer - by - layer ( same as an average Human would use ) .
From the Upcoming ueue , submitted by sutas .
The Hils wanted more than “ something of a life ” for their little girl , who turned out to have a rare genetic disorder called familial juvenile nephronophthisis , which causes the kidneys to develop incapacitating cysts .
It has no cure , but one treatment can solve the problem for years , even decades : a kidney transplant .
Unlike dialysis patients , transplant recipients can live normal lives , with few restrictions besides the need for immunosuppressant drugs .
Since getting a transplant in late May , David says , “ I can eat anything I want to eat .
I ’ll be able to travel .
I do n’t need a nap every day .
There ’s no comparison . ”
Despite the high price of drugs , transplants overall cost less money — a lot less money — than long - term dialysis .
You might think that such a superior treatment would be standard .
But kidneys are hard to come by .
In the United States , more than 80,000 people are on the official waiting list , all hoping that someone will die in just the right circumstances and bequeath them the “ gift of life . ”
Last year , only 16,517 got transplants : 10,550 with the cadaver organs allocated through the list , and 5,967 from living donors .
More than 4,000 on the list , or about 11 a day , died .
And the list gets longer every year .
For those who survive long enough to get transplants , the wait routinely lasts years .
The odds are particularly bad in large cities .
Take the nation ’s largest transplant center , the University of California , San Francisco .
In 2008 , its surgeons did an impressive 347 kidney transplants , including 231 with organs from deceased donors .
But 5,271 people are on UCSF ’s waiting list — meaning that , relying entirely on deceased donors , they would expect to wait an average of almost 23 years .
If , like Steve Jobs , who recently got a liver transplant in Memphis , you can travel great distances on short notice , you can register all over the country .
But few kidney patients are that flexible .
They wait , they get sicker , and , too often , they die .
With 300 million people in the United States , the numbers should n’t be so daunting .
Eighty thousand people would n’t even fill the Rose Bowl .
Surely we could find enough kidney donors to end the list .
But solving that problem demands creativity , daring , and , above all , a sense of urgency — a radical break with the fatalism fostered by dialysis culture .
Kidney patients ought to command the kind of outrage that demanded a cure for AIDS .
The list does n’t have to exist .
It is a result not of medical necessity or economic constraints but of public ignorance , conscious policy , and complacent institutions .
Too many people are suffering unnecessarily .
To end the list , we first have to give up the idea that “ organ donor ” means someone dead .
Deceased donors are , of course , essential for hearts .
But not for kidneys .
And not enough people die in exactly the right way to meet the need for kidneys .
The best estimate is that there are between 10,500 and 13,800 brain - dead potential organ donors each year .
More than half already become donors , and not all their kidneys can be used .
If every single person who died the right way became an organ donor , an optimistic estimate would be that 7,000 more kidneys a year would be available for transplant .
Since the list is now increasing by 6,000 a year , that would be enough to end it — in 80 years .
MANILA ( Reuters ) - Philippine officials scampered to send relief aid Monday to hundreds of thousands hit by weekend floods in and around Manila , while anger mounted over what was seen as an inadequate response from the government .
As the death toll from flash floods soared to 140 , analysts said the anger could damage the prospects of Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro , the administration ’s candidate in the May 2010 presidential election .
“ His 0.2 percent popularity could be zero by now , ” said political analyst and columnist Nelson Navarro , of Teodoro .
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , already deeply unpopular in opinion polls , ordered an emergency center be set up in the presidential palace Monday , two days after the floods , highlighting for some the haphazard response to the disaster .
At least 450,000 people were affected , including about 150,000 displaced .
Officials said the economic damage from the worst rains on record in the Manila area was about 1.4 billion pesos ( $ 30 million ) , including 500 million pesos in lost crops .
Damaged roads and bridges accounted for most of the remaining costs .
Officials expected the toll to rise with people looking for missing relatives and residents trapped in flooded houses two days after Typhoon Ketsana dumped about 410 mm of rain in 24 hours , about the average amount of rainfall for an entire month .

‘ ONCE-IN -A-LIFETIME TYPHOON ’
Arroyo called the typhoon “ an extreme event that has strained our response capabilities to the limit .
But it is not breaking us . ”
“ It ’s a once - in - a - lifetime typhoon , ” she said in a statement .
“ We are continuing the rescue efforts until everyone in danger is accounted for . ”
While waters had receded from most flooded areas in Manila , some parts of the city of 15 million remained cut off and in others , mud and garbage was left caked on streets .
Schools were ordered closed , but financial markets were open Monday and public transport was operating .
Offices and businesses were open , but attendance was poor .
“ There was a massive failure in government and the direction of management response , ” said Mario Taguiwalo , president of the National Institute for Policy Studies think - tank .
“ The root cause is you have a government whose predominant preoccupation is with graft and corruption -- how to steal more money from the people , ” Taguiwalo said .
Slideshow ( 26 images )
“ If your officials are not motivated to serve and just motivated to steal , then that ’s the kind of response you get . ”
Arroyo has been accused of vote fraud and corruption in her nine years in power .
She has consistently denied the charges .
The government was using helicopters to drop food packets .
Television reports said private citizens and volunteer groups were collecting relief goods -- mostly clothes , drinking water and medicines -- and distributing them to victims .

[ Haskell ] Jane Street is Hiring ( as if you did n't already know )
This is my periodic reminder to the FP world that Jane Street is looking to hire functional programmers .
I 've started getting the occasional inquiry coming in from people who are clearly unsure if our previous hiring announcements still apply , and I wanted to make it clear that they do .
Also , I wanted to mention that I will be at parts of ICFP , CUFP and DEFUN this year , so if you 're interested , come and talk to me there .
Without further ado , and at the risk of boring longtime residents of the list to tears :
Despite the problems besetting much of the financial industry , we have grown strongly in the last few years in our people , our technology , the scope of our business and its profitability .
We now have over 30 OCaml developers , and we are actively looking to hire more in Tokyo , London and New York .
For someone who cares about functional programming , Jane Street is an interesting place to consider .
Jane Street has invested deeply in OCaml , to the point where we now have the largest team of OCaml programmers in any industrial setting , and probably the world 's largest OCaml codebase - - over a million lines .
We really believe in functional programming , and use OCaml for everything from research to systems adminstration to trading systems .
The atmosphere is informal and intellectual , with a focus on learning .
The work itself is deeply challenging , and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms .
Jane Street is also a small enough place that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business .
Unlike many financial firms , software and technology are considered a core part of what we do , not some segmented - off cost center that the people who run the business do n't think about .
Jane Street is a place where people really care about the quality of the software , to the point that several of the most senior members of the firm , who do not have technology backgrounds , nonetheless review critical portions of the codebase before they can go into production .
If you 'd like to learn more , here are some links .
First , there are a couple of papers we 've written about our experiences here .

the settlers used stones , sticks , and chairs in their criminal attack again al - Gawi and Hannoun families .
August 9 , 2009
( click on pictures to see them bigger )
See more Photos Yesterday August 8 2009 at noon , about 40 ultra- orthodox jewish squatters , the Israeli terrorists generally known as " Siknaj " , attacked the tent of the Al - Ghawi family and beat and wounded four members of these families , who were forcibly expelled from their own house on last 2 August 2009 .
The criminal settlers , or " Siknaj " , were wearing black talars and hats , and used stones , sticks , and chairs in their criminal attack .
The victims were three children aged between 10 � 13 and a woman .
One of them was left bleeding in critical condition .
Naser Al - Gawi , one of those robbed of his house by the israeli government , said that a large detachment of Israeli police came to the place of the assault , and that rather than preventing the criminal attacks of the Siknaj , they protected them and arrested Khaled Al - Gawi , aged 40 , another victim of the israeli theft .
Al - Gawi denied that his family had provoked the Siknaj settlers .
He said that the settlers wanted to remove their tents , which they set up near their houses , which are now occupied by the siknaj .
He confirmed that he will not leave the area until he is able to return to his house .
On August 2 2009 , the Israeli criminal forces forcibly terrorized and expelled two Palestinian families , Al - Gawi and Hannoun from their houses in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem after they demolished the gates of the houses ( 11 houses , eight houses belong to Aberd Al - Fattah Hannoun and his sons , and three houses belong to Maher Hannoun and his brothers ) , and forced the families to get out under the threat of murdering them .
The criminal armed Israeli police pointed their guns at the civilians and denied them the right to take the necessary things for their children , or to remove from their furniture and other belongings .
Few hours after the Palestinian family�s expulsion , a truck of ultra orthodox jews , Siknaj , came to live in the Palestinian houses .
The Siknaj and the criminal forces of Israel threw the furniture of the two families out of their homes and moved their belonging of the Siknaj to the Palestinian houses , while the Israeli police stood to guard to protect them from any attempt from the Palestinian families to recover their property .
Before that , on November 2008 , the Israeli military border police forcibly expelled Mahmoud Al - Kurd , an old paralyzed man on a wheelchair , his wife Fawzia , Um Kamel , and their five children and their families , from their home in Sheikh Jarrah in the East of Jerusalem .
Mohammed Al - Kurd had lived in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood from 1956 until the morning of November 9 , 2008 when the Israeli police enforced a court order that evicted them .
Few days after this expulsion , Mahmoud Al - Kurd died of heart attack in his protest tent in the neighborhood of his house .
The criminal Israeli Zionist organization police has since then destroyed the tent of the Al - Kurd family several times .
The Vice President of the European Parliament , Luisa Morgantini , had sent a letter for Al - Kurd family after their expulsion from their house in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem .
She wrote : Dear all , you may remember that last Thursday during the plenary session we passed a urgency resolution on the expulsion of the Al Kurd family from the house they bought and lived in since 1956 in East Jerusalem .
A group of extremist settlers claimed ownership to that house and 26 other houses in the same neighbourhood , on the basis of an Ottoman title deed dating from 1880 , the authenticity of which is doubtful and which is also disputed by United States .
The project of the Jewish associations is to build 200 hundreds colonial units that will replace the Palestinian homes .
Mohammed Kamal Al Kurd the husband of Umm Kamal did not survive , yes he was already ill , but the expulsion from the house , and the destruction by the Israeli police of the tents were they were staying after being expelled from their home , has been unbearable to him .
He died in the Hospital .
Best regards , Luisa Morgantini
Vice President of the European Parliament Currently , a total of around 28 Palestinian families of East Jerusalem face Israeli expulsion from their homes in Al - Shiekh Jarrah neighborhood .
The Palestinian families had lived in their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood since the days when east Jerusalem was under Jordanian control .
The United Nations upon contract with Jordan allotted them the land after they became refugees when they were expelled from their homes in west Jerusalem by Zionists during the 1948 war .
Despite the UN and the Palestinian denials , and despite the fact that the lawyer of the Sheikh Jarrah families found that there is no evidence in the Turkish archives that the Siknaj are the owners of the land and the houses , the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the expulsion of the Palestinian families following an appeal by the Zionists Nahalat Shimon settler group , which claimed that the Siknaj lived in , or bought plots in these areas before the establishment of Israel itself and by the partition resolution of 1948 .
Two third of the houses in the West of Jerusalem belong to Palestinian families whose owners are denied the right to retake them .
Some of these owners have appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court to regain their property , but always this court has always rejected their appeals , thus in fact creating injustice and supporting crimes .
What the Israeli Supreme Court and the Zionists organization " State of Israel " must remember and never forget is that we are all the Palestinians will NEVER give up and never forget , and that FOR EVER there are tens of thousands , millions of us who have their land and the homes in occupied Palestine , since 1948 and prior to that , and that we have the documents which prove our ownership .
Over 750.000 of us Palestinians were forcibly expelled in 1948 by the Israeli Zionists , turning us into refugees in Arab countries and in the Diaspora , and that also millions of us live in the occupied West Bank , Jerusalem , and Gaza Strip .
We all have the right to return and to ask about our property .
The Siknaj will be institutionalized , the whole criminal enterprise called " Israel " will go , and after that ALL jews of the world will be forever held in contempt everywhere , even in countries where today they are highly respected .
[ Kawther ]
There are many houses and land belonging to Palestinians , which since 1948 � and until now , have been stolen and occupied by these European and American jews , which today are occupied by Israeli ministers .
One of these thieves is the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who lives in a house stolen from a Palestinian family in the Al - Talibia Arab district in the west of Jerusalem .
The Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem was built by the UN and Jordanian government in 1956 to house Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war .
In 1967 Israel captured and illegally annexed Jerusalem during the six day war .
We Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state that includes the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , and so it will be with or without the consent of the Siknaj , who better start packing .

Orly Taitz Sanctioned for $ 20,000
Created : October 13 , 2009 10:42 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The “ Birther queen ” has been slapped with a five - figure fine for “ wasting the judicial resources ” of the Middle District of Georgia , where she ’d filed one of her numerous lawsuits demanding that President Obama prove his citizenship before deploying soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan .
The judgment , which calls Taitz ’s case and tactics “ delusional ” :
Counsel Orly Taitz is hereby ordered to pay $ 20,000.00 to the United States , through the Middle District of Georgia Clerk ’s Office , within thirty days of the date of this Order as a sanction for her misconduct in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .
The entire document , and some key excerpts , after the jump .
Judge Clay Land makes the toughest statement about Taitz ’s antics here :
The Court finds that counsel ’s conduct was willful and not merely negligent .
It demonstrates bad faith on her part .
As an attorney , she is deemed to have known better .
She owed a duty to follow the rules and to respect the Court .
Counsel ’s pattern of conduct conclusively establishes that she did not mistakenly violate a provision of law .
She knowingly violated Rule 11 .
Her response to the Court ’s show cause order is breathtaking in its arrogance and borders on delusional .
She expresses no contrition or regret regarding her misconduct .
To the contrary , she continues her baseless attacks on the Court .
And here ’s the tick - tock of Taitz ’s appearance in court :
Counsel ’s frivolous and sanctionable conduct wasted the Defendants ’ time and valuable judicial resources that could have been devoted to legitimate cases pending with the Court .
When she filed the Rhodes case , counsel indicated that it was urgent that the matter be heard because her client was facing imminent deployment .
The Court rearranged its schedule , took time to read the legal papers , and conducted preliminary research in preparation for the hearing .
The Army had to activate its legal team on short notice , sending a Major from the Army Litigation Division in Washington , D.C. and a Captain from the CONUS Replacement Center at Ft. Benning .
In addition , the Assistant U.S. Attorney had to accompany them .
Like the Court , the government attorneys had to prepare in an expedited manner for the hearing .
During the week preceding Captain Rhodes ’s deployment , the Court was in the midst of a jury trial .
Therefore , the Court had to alter the trial schedule to conduct the hearing during an extended lunch break , thus affecting other counsel and jurors .
The Clerk ’s Office was burdened by Ms. Taitz ’s inability to follow the Court ’s rules regarding pro hac vice admission and the Court ’s rules for electronic filing .
On five separate occasions in a short period , the Clerk ’s Office personnel error - noticed counsel for her failure to follow simple rules .
At the hearing , ** counsel failed to make coherent
legal arguments but instead wasted the Court ’s time with press conference sound bites and speeches .**
Forget about 20 /20 .
" Perfect " vision could be redefined by gadgets that give you the eyes of a cyborg .
The tech industry calls the digital enrichment of the physical world " augmented reality . "
Such technology is already appearing in smartphones and toys , and enthusiasts dream of a pair of glasses we could don to enhance our everyday perception .
But why stop there ?
Scientists , eye surgeons , professors and students at the University of Washington have been developing a contact lens containing one built - in LED , powered wirelessly with radio frequency waves .
Eventually , more advanced versions of the lens could be used to provide a wealth of information , such as virtual captions scrolling beneath every person or object you see .
Significantly , it could also be used to monitor your own vital signs , such as body temperature and blood glucose level .
Why a contact lens ?
The surface of the eye contains enough data about the body to perform personal health monitoring , according to Babak Parviz , a University of Washington professor of bionanotechnology , who is working on the project .
" The eye is our little door into the body , " Parviz told Wired.com .
With gadgets becoming increasingly mobile and powerful , the technology industry is seeing a steady stream of applications devoted to health .
A few examples include a cellphone microscope used to diagnose malaria , surgeons honing their skills with the Nintendo Wiimote , and an iPhone app made for diabetes patients to track their glucose levels .
A contact lens with augmented - reality powers would take personal health monitoring several steps further , Parviz said , because the surface of the eye can be used to measure much of the data you would read from your blood tests , including cholesterol , sodium , potassium and glucose levels .
And that 's just the beginning .
Because this sort of real - time health monitoring has been impossible in the past , there 's likely more about the human eye we have n't yet discovered , Parviz said .
Beyond personal health monitoring , this finger - tip sized gadget could one day create a new interface for gaming , social networking and , well , interacting with reality in general .
Parviz and his colleagues have been working on their multipurpose lens since 2004 .
They integrated miniature antennas , control circuits , an LED and radio chips into the lens using optoelectronic components they built from scratch .
They hope these components will eventually include hundreds of LEDs to display images in front of the eye .
Think words , charts and even photographs .
( The illustration above is a concept image showing what it would look like with the lens displaying a digital overlay of the letter E. )
Sounds neat , does n't it ?
But the group faces a number of challenges before achieving true augmented eye vision .
First and foremost , safety is a prime concern with a device that comes in contact with the eye .
To ensure the lens is safe to wear , the group has been testing prototypes on live rabbits ( pictured to the right ) , who have successfully worn the lenses for 20 minutes at a time with no adverse effects .
However , the lens must undergo much more testing before gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration .
A fundamental challenge this contact lens will face is the task of tracking the human eye , said Blair MacIntyre , an associate professor and director of the augmented environments lab at Georgia Tech College of Computing .
MacIntyre is not involved in the contact lens product , but he helped develop an augmented - reality zombie shooter game .
" These developments are obviously very far from being usable , but very exciting , " MacIntyre said .
" Using them for AR will be very hard .
You need to know exactly where the user is looking if you want to render graphics that line up with the world , especially when their eyes saccade ( jump around ) , which our eyes do at a very high rate . "
Given that obstacle , we 're more likely to see wearable augmented - reality eyeware in the form of glasses before a contact lens , MacIntyre said .
With glasses , we 'll only need to track where the glasses are and where the eyes are relative to them as opposed to where the eyes are actually looking .
And with a contact lens , it will be difficult to cram heavy computational power into such a small device , even with today 's state - of - the - art technologies , Parviz admits .
There are many advanced sensors that would amplify the lens ' abilities , but the difficulty lies in integrating them , which is why Parviz and his colleagues have had to engineer their own components .
And when the contact lens evolves from personal health monitoring into more processor - intense augmented - reality applications , it 's more likely it will have to draw its powers from a companion device such as a smartphone , he said .
Layar , an Amsterdam - based startup focusing on augmented reality , shares University of Washington 's vision of an augmented - reality contact lens .
However , Raimo van der Klein , CEO of Layar , said such a device 's vision would be limited if it did not work with an open platform supporting every type of data available via the web , such as mapping information , restaurant reviews or even Twitter feeds .
Hence , his company has taken a first step by releasing an augmented - reality browser for Google Android smartphones , for which software developers can provide " layers " of data for various web services .
Van der Klein believes a consumer - oriented , multipurpose lens is just one example of where augmented - reality technology will take form in the near future .
He said to expect these applications to move beyond augmenting vision and expand to other parts of the body .
" Imagine audio cues through an earpiece or sneakers vibrating wherever your friends are , " van der Klein said .
" We need to keep an open eye for future possibilities , and I think a contact lens is just part of it . "

States across the nation are cutting taxes to boost stagnant economies .
Texas , Arizona , and Maine are all taking steps to lower taxes .
A recent study by former U.S. Treasury economist Robert Carroll shows that states with lower corporate tax rates have higher wage gains and more productivity over time .
Governor Rick Perry announced that Texas created more jobs in 2008 than the rest of the states combined .
Texas does not tax capital gains or income .
In July the state had an unemployment rate of 7.5 % , two points below the national average .
Governor Perry has worked to attract businesses to Texas .
Businesses like Medtronic and Caterpillar are moving to Texas to take advantage of the state ’s stable budget and low taxes .
Arizona is following suit .
The legislature will vote on tax reform to lure employers and high - income taxpayers to the state .
Republican Governor Jan Brewer ’s plan would reduce the state ’s corporate income tax rate from 6.97 % to 4.86 % .
The proposal cuts all personal income tax rates by 6.6 % , and abolishes a hated statewide tax on commercial and residential property .
To balance the decreases , the plan temporarily raises the states sales tax .
In Maine the Democratic legislature and Governor John Baldacci enacted sweeping tax reform .
The new law removes the state ’s graduated income tax structure with a top rate of 8.5 % and replaces it with a simple 6.5 % flat tax .
Those with earnings above $ 250,000 will pay a surtax rate of 0.35 % , for a total rate of 6.85 % .
Maine plans to finance the tax breaks with $ 300 million in cuts to the states $ 5.8 billion budget .
It also proposes to expand the state ’s 5 % sales tax on services that had been previously been exempt , such as ski lift tickets .
Three states that have raised taxes
New Jersey lawmakers approved a string of 103 tax increases which created a large state debt .
From 2001 to 2008 , New Jersey lost a net 25,000 private - sector jobs as public employment grew by 65,000 workers .
New Jersey is now considering adopting a flat tax .
Maryland lost one - third of its millionaires when it created a millionaire tax bracket by raising the top marginal income - tax rate to 6.25 % .
As a result , Baltimore and Bethesda have increased income taxes to support city services .
The combined state and local tax rate in Maryland can go as high as 9.45 % .
Critics point out that the drop in top wage earners is a reflection of national income trends and not directly related to the tax .
Finally , Oregon raised taxes on incomes over $ 125,000 and on business by increasing the corporate minimum tax .
Currently , these taxes are being challenged by a state referendum petition effort to bring the issue to the statewide ballot .

The world of books is buzzing about a new publishing sensation to rival Dan Brown 's The Lost Symbol , industry sources have revealed to The Register .
A groundbreaking proposal from new North West author Duncan Webster arrived at the office of publishing giant Random House last week , but quickly leaked to rivals and has sparked much discussion among London 's literati .
Webster 's working title for the project is Do You Want To See My Cock ?
We 'll let the talent explain , in his ( genuine ) pitch :
To whom it may concern ,
I am writing to ask whether your company would be interested in an idea for a book which I had recently .
The theme of the book would be similar to the challenge / travel adventures of authors like Dave Gorman .
The idea came to me during a recent visit to the doctor 's in which I asked if I should take off my pants to show the doctor the rash on my leg .
She asked if she could see without , I said yes , to which she said " In that case , no " .
But doctors have to see anything you show them , and so my idea is to see how many people I can get to see my penis without getting arrested .
As I said , doctors would be an easy start , but there 's only so many time you can do that in the same surgery without getting a ban , which is what would make the challenge interesting .
My immediate thoughts are then GUM clinics , life modelling , art installations , etc. , but I would be willing to push the boundaries a bit for the good of the book and await your suggestions .
Initial ideas for working titles include " Do You Want To See My Cock ? " , " Can I Show You Something ? " and " Balls To The Wind " .
I think we could probably find something better .
I have also done a couple of sketches for the cover if you want to see them , ( do n't worry they 're tastefully done ) .
I was thinking we could do this project as a charity tie - in , to raise money for testicular cancer , for example .
I do n't have cancer , but am aware of the importance of raising attention for the cause .
So , all that 's left to say is Do You Want To See My Cock ?

William Kamkwamba educated himself in his local library
By Jude Sheerin
BBC News
The extraordinary true story of a Malawian teenager who transformed his village by building electric windmills out of junk is the subject of a new book , The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind .
Self - taught William Kamkwamba has been feted by climate change campaigners like Al Gore and business leaders the world over .
His against - all - odds achievements are all the more remarkable considering he was forced to quit school aged 14 because his family could no longer afford the $ 80 - a - year ( £ 50 ) fees .
When he returned to his parents ' small plot of farmland in the central Malawian village of Masitala , his future seemed limited .
But this was not another tale of African potential thwarted by poverty .
Defence against hunger
The teenager had a dream of bringing electricity and running water to his village .
Many , including my mother , thought I was going crazy - people thought I was smoking marijuana
William Kamkwamba
And he was not prepared to wait for politicians or aid groups to do it for him .
The need for action was even greater in 2002 following one of Malawi 's worst droughts , which killed thousands of people and left his family on the brink of starvation .
Unable to attend school , he kept up his education by using a local library .
Fascinated by science , his life changed one day when he picked up a tattered textbook and saw a picture of a windmill .
Mr Kamkwamba told the BBC News website : " I was very interested when I saw the windmill could make electricity and pump water .
" I thought : ' That could be a defence against hunger .
Maybe I should build one for myself ' . "
When not helping his family farm maize , he plugged away at his prototype , working by the light of a paraffin lamp in the evenings .
But his ingenious project met blank looks in his community of about 200 people .
" Many , including my mother , thought I was going crazy , " he recalls .
" They had never seen a windmill before . "
Shocks Neighbours were further perplexed at the youngster spending so much time scouring rubbish tips .
William Kamkwamba 's achievements with wind energy show what one person , with an inspired idea , can do to tackle the crisis we face
Al Gore " People thought I was smoking marijuana , " he said .
" So I told them I was only making something for juju [ magic ] . '
Then they said : ' Ah , I see . ' "
Mr Kamkwamba , who is now 22 years old , knocked together a turbine from spare bicycle parts , a tractor fan blade and an old shock absorber , and fashioned blades from plastic pipes , flattened by being held over a fire .
" I got a few electric shocks climbing that [ windmill ] , " says Mr Kamkwamba , ruefully recalling his months of painstaking work .
The finished product - a 5 - m ( 16 - ft ) tall blue - gum - tree wood tower , swaying in the breeze over Masitala - seemed little more than a quixotic tinkerer 's folly .
But his neighbours ' mirth turned to amazement when Mr Kamkwamba scrambled up the windmill and hooked a car light bulb to the turbine .
As the blades began to spin in the breeze , the bulb flickered to life and a crowd of astonished onlookers went wild .
Soon the whiz kid's 12 - watt wonder was pumping power into his family 's mud brick compound .
' Electric wind '
Out went the paraffin lanterns and in came light bulbs and a circuit breaker , made from nails and magnets off an old stereo speaker , and a light switch cobbled together from bicycle spokes and flip - flop rubber .
Before long , locals were queuing up to charge their mobile phones .
WINDS OF CHANGE 2002 : Drought strikes ; he leaves school ; builds 5 m windmill 2006 : Daily Times writes article on him ; he builds a 12 m windmill 2007 : Brings solar power to his village and installs solar pump Mid-2008 : Builds Green Machine windmill , pumping well water Sep 2008 : Attends inaugural African Leadership Academy class Mid-2009 : Builds replica of original 5 m windmill Mr Kamkwamba 's story was sent hurtling through the blogosphere when a reporter from the Daily Times newspaper in Blantyre wrote an article about him in November 2006 .
Meanwhile , he installed a solar - powered mechanical pump , donated by well - wishers , above a borehole , adding water storage tanks and bringing the first potable water source to the entire region around his village .
He upgraded his original windmill to 48 - volts and anchored it in concrete after its wooden base was chewed away by termites .
Then he built a new windmill , dubbed the Green Machine , which turned a water pump to irrigate his family 's field .
Before long , visitors were traipsing from miles around to gawp at the boy prodigy 's magetsi a mphepo - " electric wind " .
As the fame of his renewable energy projects grew , he was invited in mid-2007 to the prestigious Technology Entertainment Design conference in Arusha , Tanzania .
Cheetah generation
He recalls his excitement using a computer for the first time at the event .
" I had never seen the internet , it was amazing , " he says .
" I Googled about windmills and found so much information . "
Onstage , the native Chichewa speaker recounted his story in halting English , moving hard - bitten venture capitalists and receiving a standing ovation .
William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer ( left ) spent a year writing the book A glowing front - page portrait of him followed in the Wall Street Journal .
He is now on a scholarship at the elite African Leadership Academy in Johannesburg , South Africa .
Mr Kamkwamba - who has been flown to conferences around the globe to recount his life - story - has the world at his feet , but is determined to return home after his studies .
The home - grown hero aims to finish bringing power , not just to the rest of his village , but to all Malawians , only 2 % of whom have electricity .
" I want to help my country and apply the knowledge I 've learned , " he says .
" I feel there 's lots of work to be done . "
Former Associated Press news agency reporter Bryan Mealer had been reporting on conflict across Africa for five years when he heard Mr Kamkwamba 's story .
The incredible tale was the kind of positive story Mealer , from New York , had long hoped to cover .
The author spent a year with Mr Kamkwamba writing The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind , which has just been published in the US .
Mealer says Mr Kamkwamba represents Africa 's new " cheetah generation " , young people , energetic and technology - hungry , who are taking control of their own destiny .
" Spending a year with William writing this book reminded me why I fell in love with Africa in the first place , " says Mr Mealer , 34 .
" It 's the kind of tale that resonates with every human being and reminds us of our own potential . "
Can it be long before the film rights to the triumph - over - adversity story are snapped up , and William Kamkwamba , the boy who dared to dream , finds himself on the big screen ?
We asked for your reaction to this story .
Please find a selection of your comments below .
Kudos to this lad for his perseverance .
The answers to Africa 's problems lie within - not from well meaning do - gooders from the West giving continual handouts .
He 'll go far and probably end up as prime minister of Malawi .
Sue , London UK
This remarkable example shows how much of a contribution one could make by taking an initiative with a sound vision .
Ziyad , Maldives
My response ?
I am in ( joyful ) tears .
This is a great example of perseverance and steadfast hope despite " dire " circumstances .
It also affirms the need to share education and technology , to empower people to find sustainable solutions to their circumstance .
Thank you for your perseverance and positive spirit to help your own people .
May people like you multiply .
J. Miners , Canada
This story is splendid , it is solid .
It is what the whole of Africa should hear and learn about .
It will ignite a new spirit in the continent 's young minds who badly need such inspiration to get Africa going .
Accomplishing something out of obscurity and carving a place for yourself in history like this Malawian shows that the human potential can never be limited , thus Africa could change if this mindset is nurtured and developed .
Brima Karl Samura , Freetown , Sierra Leone Amazing triumph of the human spirit over adversity .
What a remarkable and staggeringly honourable young man .
I am inspired and humbled by him .
I hope this fabulously positive story goes on to change the negative attitudes that have plagued Africa .
Made my day !
Raj , London William 's achievements portray that anyone can do anything as long as they hope to do it and do n't stop at only hoping but aim at making it happen .
It shows that there are possibly other intelligent kids out there in Africa but what they lack is perhaps resources or vigour that they can make great things happen .
This shows that if we Africans worked together as a team , and solved problems not as individuals , we would not be bothered at all by drought and power problems , most especially in our rural areas .
I hope our young generation gets to read your story William , am sure it will change many hopeless minds that have always thought ' they ca n 't ' .
Tell them William , tell them , that ' YES WE CAN '
Daisy , Kampala , Uganda
I love what this boy has done because he has used his own innovative ideas to power a village .
I work in rural Kenya and I will definitely use this story as a case study to the youth who feel so desperate to make something of their lives but do n't often have anyone to look up to that made it with little education like them .
Tess Ochino , Nairobi , Kenya
He is a star for Malawi in this world of technology .
This shows the potential of poor Malawi and Africa .
There are many potential youths in Africa but poverty is hindering them to rise .
It could have been a good idea that funds that got lost through corruption and wars were used to provide an environment for such potential intellectuals to achieve their God given dreams / capabilities .
Gerald Mabveka , Lilongwe , Malawi
What a fabulous , heart warming story .
Congratulations on all of your hard work .
You will be an inspiration to everyone who reads or hears about your triumphs .
One of my former students Leo who is from Shandong , will go to the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia to install wind turbines in November .
David , Xi'an , Shanxi China
While not wanting to detract from this chap 's achievements , I 'm very surprised that this is not already common across the region .
On my travels to South America , and mainly Patagonia - where there is no concept of electricity or running water outside the main towns - people have been using windmills to pump water for livestock and themselves , as well as generate electricity , for decades .
One would think that it was an obvious solution for NGOs and charities working in poverty and drought stricken countries .
But good luck to William : well done !
Joseph , London , UK
It is amazing for a school dropout to do such a thing .
It should be a lesson to all Africans that nothing is lost , no matter what the situation .
So Africans should all work no matter where they find themselves .
God should enlighten him to do great things .
Isaac Tuffour , Effiduase - Ghana Congratulations for publishing for once a positive story !
Mr Kamkwamba was able to achieve his dream because he went to school and had the opportunity to have access to a library , but also because he believed that changes can be made .
What a lesson to teach to our European youth who complain about everything , and have all the opportunities and but no will to use them positively .
Burke , Brussels , Belgium Such are the stories that Africa needs .
Stories that can inspire and galvanise our youths to think big .
And maybe shame our leaders to be positive in the interest of their people .
Babshow , Lagos , Nigeria
Now that 's inspirational and that 's how you would change the world .
Physically making changes and not all that political talk .
Helen Lau , London Reading this almost brought tears to my eyes .
What a great story - human determination in the face of real adversity .
I feel humbled .
Warm regards to the young man !
Brian Cockburn , Tunapuna , Trinidad & Tobago Definitely a remarkable story .
Who says one person cannot make a difference ?
It is certainly a story worth telling the world about as it inspires us to become the best that we can be , and never give up .
My sincere congratulations to William !
A young man that puts many adults to shame .
Karen O'Connor , Bunbury , Australia Amazing story , but a shame BBC has not done it justice .
For all the implications Mr Kamkwamba 's remarkable story raises , the article 's conclusions disappoint .
The " boy " who " dared to dream " ?
Will he get a film deal ?
Is this really what one takes away from Mr Kamkwamba 's achievements ?
A severely disadvantaged young person applied his effort and abilities to address a serious problem , and greatly improved his community 's quality of life .
His innovation is an inspiration to millions , exemplifying the kind of home - grown sustainable development western governments and NGOs have scrambled after ( and spent billions on ) for years , with marginal success .
Mr Kamkwamba , and others like him , need more attention , support and resources to expand their work .
Not speculation on their Hollywood prospects .
At the very least , they deserve more mature , respectful coverage of their stories in the future .

I just wish to say that if I were ever given the opportunity to meet William Kamkwamba I would express an enormous gratitude for allowing his story to circulate the world .
He serves as an inspiration to everyone , especially to our generation , the ones who are currently struggling to graduate and become what he has - an individual who has shown strength and endurance to positively influence his community as well as everyone else residing in other more technologically advanced areas of the world .
Thank you Mr Kamkwamba !
Natasha , Miami , FL Our governments in Africa need to encourage these people .
It is unfortunate that these people are not recognised and assisted accordingly .
Imagine , I am in Malawi but I have learnt about this man through the BBC .
Patrick Gondwe , Blantyre , Malawi
That is what Africa truly wants .
I am very proud by the deeds of Mr Kamkwamba .
He has a wonderful mind .
We should n't expect everything from someone else to teach us .
If we look inside and use our potential , it is possible we can make a difference .
Wishing you success in your future endeavours !
God Bless you !

This is a really inspirational story .
So many young people get sidetracked when they find themselves in difficult life situations but this youngster has the resilience of our ancestors .
He is truly a leader and a hero .
Congratulations .

It 's amazing to see how much talent and commitment we have in this world , it seems this world could gain more if we were to concentrate more on the less fortunate and third world countries .
I believe it 's the only way forward rather dealing with the politicians .
Wonder how many of this kind we have out there , together we can change this world just by looking to the next person to you and offering a hand or advice if you can .

It is indeed a great joy to see a talented young African brother having a big dream to modernise his community with water and electrical supply .
Africa has a lot of talented youths but there are no resources to work on .
The intelligent poor children have no seats in the classroom and our greedy politicians are only looking after their own interests .
Job well done my brother , I hope many will take your steps in the love of our own people .
Let Africans think positively for our way forward and stop the killing and corruption .

It is due to his zeal and vision to help his fellow countrymen that he dared to make his dream come true .
We should have more such people and the world will be a better place
Lawrence Lim , Singapore Kamkwamba's story is a story of defying impossibilities , determination and that is what the world needs !!
Nkomo Dingilizwe , Zimbabwe , Harare Truly inspirational !!
I 'm an engineer with years of experience so I take my hat off !!
Its so nice to hear something nice happening for once !
Good on him and all those who he wishes to help .
Paul , Lincoln , UK As a Malawi I feel great , and would appreciate very much if African governments can do more to support these many talented young ones .
Kondwani Mpahuwa , Kanengo , Lilongwe , Malawi Kamkwamba is a gift from God .
If it was n't so , his idea could have not materialised , through the BBC .
I would like his story to be published in every African country , so that gifted teenagers like Kamkwamba will come up .
Congratulations Kamkwamba , I am really proud of you .
Well done , and may Lord Bless you .
Esther Richard Semkuya , Dar Es Salaam , Tanzania
There is so much hope for Africa and this young man shows what is possible with meagre resources .
We do not have to wait for corrupt governments , officials or donors to sort out , we just need to go back to basics .
So proud and so challenged !!
Eva , Munich , Germany I 'm living in Malawi at present .
Unless you 've lived here you can't possibly understand just what an amazing achievement it is !
I live in a city and the electricity cuts out most nights .
Katy Berry , Formby Merseyside UK
What an inspirational story !
He has shown the world , especially Africa , that the development and progress of Africa lies in the hands of Africans .
Africans must dig deep into their skills and talents , using them to build their communities and nations as a whole .
Nothing stopped him , despite the obstacles and challenges he encountered .
I am very proud of him and if he should set up a development fund I will definitely take part because it will be for a good cause .

With 60 per cent of the U.S. population at risk , is swine flu nasal spray a pandemic waiting to happen ?
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , October 6 , 2009
Doctors and hospitals are expressing concern that the FluMist vaccine could endanger people because it contains live H1N1 virus , unlike the injectable shot that contains antibodies .
With no less than 60 per cent of the U.S. population immunodeficient in one way or another , could FluMist be a pandemic waiting to happen ?
Hospitals in Colorado and elsewhere are shunning the FluMist H1N1 vaccine , a nasal spray that contains live swine flu virus , because of fears it could infect people with weakened immune systems and underlying health conditions .
“ Several metro area hospitals said they wo n’t be taking the FluMist because they do n’t want to endanger patients , ” reports TheDenverChannel.com .
Lois VanFleet , infection prevention specialist at Exempla Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette , expressed concern that doctors and nurses who inhaled the live virus could infect patients whose immune systems are compromised .
However , H1N1 FluMist is being rolled out nationwide from this week , including at “ drive - through clinics ” across the country where the nasal spray is administered while people sit in their cars with their window wide open ( see top picture ) .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The live virus contained in the nasal spray is weakened but it can be transmitted from person to person for up to three weeks .
According to studies , “ the odds of transmitting the virus after receiving the nasal spray are about 2.5 percent , ” with children the most susceptible .
The nasal spray is being rolled out on a mass scale before the widespread introduction of the injectable vaccine .
Some fear that the nasal spray will contribute to a wider pandemic , which will then provide governments with the crisis they need to make the injectable vaccine mandatory .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ This would accelerate the move to a state of emergency , cripple the US health care system , and would result in the “ need ” to have military , eventually UN troops , take control , ” notes TheFluCase.com .
“ Also , all public assemblies , including courts , would be prohibited , thereby satisfying a condition for the imposition of martial law , mass quarantines , and forced vaccinations for the rest of us . ”
According to the Mayo Clinic , the swine flu scandal of 1976 , when more people died from the vaccine than the actual virus , was what caused the live virus to be removed from future vaccines .
However , it is admitted that FluMist contains the live virus .
“ It has been documented that the live viruses from the vaccine can be shed ( and potentially spread into the community ) from recipient children for up to 21 days , and even longer from adults .
Viral shedding also puts breastfeeding infants at risk if the mother has been given FluMist , ” writes Dr. Sherri Tenpenny , one of the most outspoken physicians in the country on the hazards of vaccines and vaccination .
FluMist ’s own package insert reads as follows , “ FluMist ® recipients should avoid close contact with immunocompromised individuals for at least 21 days . ”
“ The warning is specifically directed toward those living in the same household with an immunocompromised person , but the on - going release of live viruses throughout the community may be a significant risk to everyone who has a weak , or weakened , immune system , ” writes Tenpenny , pointing out that if one takes into account a plethora of health conditions that could be classified as contributing to immunodeficiency , as much as 60 % of the entire population could be considered to be “ chemically immunosuppressed . ”
“ An ever greater concern about FluMist is the contents within the vaccine .
Each 0.5 ml of the formula contains 10 6.5 - 7.5 particles of live , attenuated influenza virus .
That means that between 10 million and 100 million viral particles will be forcefully injected into the nostrils when administered .
The viral strain was developed by serial passage through “ specific pathogen - free primary chick kidney cells ” and then grown in “ specific pathogen - free eggs . ”
That means that the culture media was free of pathogens that were specifically tested for , but not a culture that was necessarily “ pathogen - free . ”
The risk that the vaccine may contain contaminant avian retroviruses still remains , ” warns Tenpenny .
One of the pharmaceutical companies developing nasal spray vaccines is Baxter International , who were caught earlier this year releasing batches of vaccines from a lab in Austria that were contaminated live bird flu virus , otherwise known as H5N1 .
The video below outlines further concerns regarding FluMist and the nasal spray vaccine in general .

Israel has demolished hundreds of Palestinian homes built without permits
Israeli authorities have demolished two Palestinian - owned structures in East Jerusalem , in defiance of international calls to stop such actions .
Palestinian reports say a family of five was forcibly evicted from their home in the Beit Hanina district before the building was demolished .
Israeli bulldozers then destroyed the foundations of another building nearby .
UN officials say such demolitions violate international law and raise serious humanitarian concerns .
Israel says buildings subject to demolition orders have been built without permits .
Palestinians say it is virtually impossible to obtain the necessary approval from Israel 's municipal authorities in Jerusalem .
The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem , says the authorities have demolished about 420 Palestinian - owned houses in East Jerusalem since 2004 saying they were built without permits .
Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 war and annexed it soon afterwards in a move that has not been recognised internationally .
A lot has happened since the first Google phone arrived 12 months ago .
So it makes sense for HTC to finally make a legitimate stab at upgrading the Android operating system , now that Palm has its web - errific Pre , the iPhone graduated to video ( not to mention cut - and - paste ! ) , and Motorola just unveiled the Cliq , the first non-HTC phone to run Android .
HTC 's third Android phone , the Hero , is available on Sprint in the United States .
It 's almost identical to the Hero released in Europe last July .
And compared to previous HTC handsets ( cough , the G1 ) the phone boasts refinements that make it superior , at least on paper : HTC has ditched the freakishly curved bottom of the G1 , enlarged the trackball , tossed in a 5 - MP camera and , like the MyTouch , abandoned the physical QWERTY keyboard .
On the software end , HTC has done some impressive stuff .
The Sense UI , a custom interface that HTC created to make Android more usable , is attractive , fairly logical and flashy .
( Literally :
It now supports websites with Adobe Flash . )
And HTC 's gone full - on multitouch , too , adopting the pinch - and - flick gestures iPhone - Pre users are accustomed to .
It could use a little fine tuning though — when zooming in and out the motion is more herky - jerky than a Dodge Dart with a busted tranny .
The more time we spent with the Hero , it became obvious that the phone and OS have become mature counterparts .
Dragging and dropping apps , shortcuts , and HTC / Android widgets was easy and fun .
For instance , the Twitter widget streams your feed in a smaller , always - on window on one dedicated desktop .
Translation :
You have less , if no need to launch the full - screen app .
While the OS is a big step in the right direction , the hardware feels mediocre .
Optics are rather disappointing , especially the video .
The lack of even a slightly curved bottom left the plain - Jane Hero looking much less iconic than , say , the MyTouch .
And that 's really it in a nutshell :
The Hero is a usable phone with some panache , but it 's ultimately a solid Michael Keaton , not a game - changing Christian Bale .
Washington has just run a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2009 , even as we are told a new health - care entitlement will reduce red ink by $ 81 billion over 10 years .
To believe that fantastic claim , you have to ignore everything we know about Washington and the history of government health - care programs .
For the record , we decided to take a look at how previous federal forecasts matched what later happened .
It is n't pretty .
Next let 's examine the record of Congressional forecasters in predicting costs .
Start with Medicaid , the joint state - federal program for the poor .
The House Ways and Means Committee estimated that its first - year costs would be $ 238 million .
Instead it hit more than $ 1 billion , and costs have kept climbing .
Thanks in part to expansions promoted by California 's Henry Waxman , a principal author of the current House bill , Medicaid now costs 37 times more than it did when it was launched — after adjusting for inflation .
Its current cost is $ 251 billion , up 24.7 % or $ 50 billion in fiscal 2009 alone , and that 's before the health - care bill covers millions of new beneficiaries .
Medicare has a similar record .
In 1965 , Congressional budgeters said that it would cost $ 12 billion in 1990 .
Its actual cost that year was $ 90 billion .
Whoops .
The hospitalization program alone was supposed to cost $ 9 billion but wound up costing $ 67 billion .
These are n't small forecasting errors .
The rate of increase in Medicare spending has outpaced overall inflation in nearly every year ( up 9.8 % in 2009 ) , so a program that began at $ 4 billion now costs $ 428 billion .
I spend a lot of time every day connected to the internet and I see many things .
Very few of them come as close to being as incredibly geeky and super- cool as what Benjamin J. Heckendorn is making in his off - time : the world 's only and fully working pinball machine meant to honor the film career of Bill Paxton .
Twister .
Aliens .
True Lies. Frailty .
The Dark Backward .
Weird Science .
The Terminator .
The man is worthy -- nay , OWED -- a pinball machine to his geek greatness .
Heckendorn has been working on his custom pinball machine since 2005 ; he is considered an expert game modder and so has a bunch of other projects on the go at any given time but now Heckendorn hopes to have his BPP game ready for playing next year .
Based on the photos and videos he 's showing us , the dream will be realized on time .
Heckendorn 's pinball machine will be professional and worthy of playing in any arcade .
He 's come up with bitmap graphics for the pinball 's LED score display , created custom artwork on the sides and display case using screengrabs from Paxton 's movies and Big Love TV series and is knee - deep in designing the mini- games that the player will be able to score on .
For example , one of the sections inside the case will be based on Titanic and allow the player to shoot the pinball into a replica of the sunken hold of the ship to achieve single , double or triple scores .
Another section will be based on Aliens and feature two guns counting down from 99 as the player tries to achieve a bonus score .
No word yet if , when the pinballer loses his last ball , the machine will feature Private Hudson 's famous line " That 's it man , game over , man !
Game over ! " -- BUT IT BETTER .
This is the coolest film - related homebrew thing that I have seen so far for 2009 .
Does our man Bill know about this ?
And I found videos !
There IS a God !
Thanks to the cool bunch at Filmrot for tweeting about this wonder of the modern world .
Over a year after Danger Room first reported on the Defense Department 's plans to buy Russian helicopters in a no-bid sweetheart deal , a U.S. senator is now demanding that the Pentagon put a stop to such purchases all together .
At issue are a series of ad hoc decisions that were made to buy Russian helicopters for Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , much of it financed by U.S. taxpayer dollars .
In a letter sent yesterday to Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Republican Senator Richard Shelby blasted the Pentagon for its handling of the Russian helicopter disaster , which has included delays , cost increases , andquestionable deals .
Shelby wrote :
* The United States has spent $ 807.2 million on the purchase of Russian - made Mi-17s .
Prior to this acquisition , no requirements were defined , no analysis of alternatives was completed , and no other airframes were considered .
Of even further concern , there is no predictability of funds to support the Russian helicopter procurement .
Multiple Services are involved in this procurement effort and yet there has not been a single aviation program management office appointed to oversee this program .
In fact , it took two months of requests from my office to receive material on the subject .
*
The Pentagon 's nearly billion dollar purchase of Russian helicopters has been a mess largely created by the Army 's Threat Systems Management Office ( TSMO ) .
The group chose to route no -bid contracts through ARINC , a communications and engineering firm that had almost no prior experience buying Russian helicopters , and Air Transport Europe , a small Slovak firm best known as an ambulance service .
( Air Transport Europe insists it is licensed by the Moscow - based International Aviation Committee , but the Russian helicopter design bureau does not list the company as a certified overhaul facility . )
Shelby says the entire Russian helicopter strategy has been a total failure , citing in particular the ARINC contract for Iraq .
" Eighteen months later , the $ 345 million U.S. / Iraqi acquisition contract is nearly a year behind schedule and the cost of airframes has skyrocketed , " Shelby wrote in his letter to Gates .
The question now is whether the problem is really Russian helicopters per se , or simply a mismanaged acquisition strategy .
For Shelby , the answer is clear .
" We should provide the Iraqis and the Afghans with the optimum helicopter for their lift requirements , " he writes .
" We can not do this by basing our decisions on false assumptions , a total lack of requirements analysis , and the Russians . "
Shelby , who is from Alabama , certainly has constituent reasons for questioning the choice of Russian helicopters ; his home state is a hub for helicopter manufacturing .
It 's also not clear whether immediately stopping Russian helicopter purchases now is in anybody 's best interest ( except perhaps Sikorsky 's and Bell's ) .
Mi-17s have been bought for Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan for a variety of reasons – some of them sensible – including availability , price , and capabilities .
But Russian helicopters are only cheaper and better if they actually get delivered .
Tragically , no helicopters have been delivered under the ARINC contract for Iraq , even though all the money was paid upfront .
Another 10 helicopters bought through ARINC for Afghanistan are also nowhere near delivery .

Worry does not empty tomorrow of sorrow – it empties today of strength .
Corrie ten Boom
You need to know how to stop worrying if you want to live life to the fullest .
Why ?
Because worry does n’t do you any good .
It wo n’t help you live a better life .
It wo n’t make you feel better and more energized .
Instead , it will make you less happy and less productive .
But how can we do that ?
How can we stop worrying ?
Here are eight ways :
1. Focus on what you can control
Thinking about things you ca n’t control puts unnecessary burden on your mind .
For example , why should you worry about how bad the economy is ?
There ’s nothing you can do about it unless you are a key person in the government .
No matter how much you think about it , nothing will change .
So instead of worrying about it , focus on things you can control like building your network and increasing your value .
Do n’t worry about things you ca n’t do anything about .
2 . Use your imagination positively
Worry is a misuse of imagination .
Dan Zadra
Your imagination is a double - edged sword .
You can use it to dream big dreams and keep your motivation high , but you can also use it to discourage yourself .
People often worry about something because they fill their imagination with all the bad things that might happen .
The reality is often not that bad , but it looks worse and worse because they give it too much attention .
3. Expect good things to happen
Do not anticipate trouble , or worry about what may never happen .
Keep in the sunlight .
Benjamin Franklin
Not only should you use your imagination positively , but also you should expect good things to happen in your life .
Instead of expecting something to fail , expect it to succeed .
Instead of expecting people not to like you , expect them to like you .
You should be realistic , of course , but always expect to be a winner in life .
4. Accept responsibility
You might make mistakes in the past and worry about the consequences .
In this case , the solution is to accept responsibility .
Do n’t let your worry drag you down .
Accept the responsibility and move on .
You still have a lot of great things waiting for you .
5 . Be grateful
It ’s easy to focus on the few things that could go wrong that we forget about the many things that already go right .
That ’s why having an attitude of gratitude is important .
It keeps your perspective in balance .
It makes you realize that for one thing that goes wrong there are many more things that go right .
Just start with these simple things to be grateful for .
6 . Run your own race
Stop comparing yourself with other people .
Comparing yourself with others will only drain your mental energy .
You have your own race to run .
Instead of comparing yourself with others , focus on being the best that you can be .
7. Simplify your life
The simpler your life is , the fewer things you could worry about .
So instead of doing a lot of things , focus on the few things that are most fulfilling and give you the most return for your time and effort .
Find your life purpose and use the 80/20 rule to choose the few important activities to focus on .
8 . Have faith
You should focus on things you can control .
But what about things you ca n’t control ?
What can we do to eliminate any worry about them ?
The answer here is faith .
You need to believe that everything will go well no matter how bad it might seem .
You need to believe that everything will come out better in the end .
Having faith eliminates a lot of worries in your life .
It gives you peace of mind .
Welcome to Stony Ridge Observatory ( SRO ) SRO was originally designed and built , and continues to be owned and operated by amateur astronomers .
This observatory has served its members , science investigators , students and the public ( through planned outreach programs ) since its completion in 1963 .
Our observatory is perched on a ridge above the 2000 - foot deep Devil 's Canyon , about 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) north by north - east of the historic Mt. Wilson Observatory .
Stony Ridge is located very near a site that had been considered for the location of George Ellery Hale 's " new " 200 - inch ( 5 - m ) telescope .
That location was at " Horse Flats " described in this 1928 paper .
After a 45 - minute drive along the Angeles Crest Highway north of Pasadena , California , the visitor arrives at Stony Ridge Observatory in the heart of the beautiful Angeles National Forest .
We invite you to browse our web site by starting with our History page , or by visiting our SRO Vistas Gallery to view some of our members ' photographs of the Stony Ridge area .
Above :
The telescope first arrives at its new mountain home .
Above : Photo of a bronze plaque mounted next to the entrance door of the Stony Ridge dome .
The names are those of the original 15 founding members of Stony Ridge Observatory .
An asteroid , ( 10168 ) Stony Ridge , was discovered at SRO in 1995 and named to honor these members .
Another asteroid , ( 144633 )
Georgecarroll was discovered at SRO in 2004 and was named in tribute to the founder who designed , and was the principal builder of , the 30 - inch ( 0.76 - m ) telescope at Stony Ridge Observatory .
Click here to see what these folks did for SRO .
2016 Observatory Status
The original Carroll chain drive on the 30 - inch ( 0.76 - m ) telescope has been reinstalled and upgraded with an advanced computer control system .
The Station Fire ( 2009 ) still shows its brand on Stony Ridge Observatory .
Dead and still - standing trees are everywhere at the site .
During the recent high wind events at SRO , many of these trees were blown over , sometimes blocking access to the observatory .
Stony Ridge Observatory is accessible to members and escorted guests only .
Future Invited Guest Nights are temporarily on hold .
They are expected to resume early summer .
For additional information and to put your name on the invitation list please email The Stony Ridge Observatory .

This week I made a new wigflip toy called Thank You Mario .
It lets you fake up that castle screen from Super Mario Brothers where you are told " THANK YOU MARIO !
BUT OUR PRINCESS IS IN ANOTHER CASTLE ! " except with your own text .
Like some of the other toys , the output is an animated GIF you can save and share around .
Something like this :
The core of this toy is around 300 lines of Common Lisp , supported by the Vecto , zpb - ttf , and Skippy libraries .
I figured I 'd share the code , just for the heck of it .
Here 's nesfont.lisp .
It creates really simple nesfont objects from TrueType font files .
The nesfont can be saved to disk and reloaded when the app starts .
Those nesfonts are used to produce GIF image frames that are laid over the background .
; ; ; ; nesfont.lisp ;; ; ; ;; ;; A " nesfont " file is for storing the rasterized glyphs in a ; ; ; ; bitmap - style TTF for easy use on a GIF .

WIKILEAKS EDITORIAL
Legal obstacles , which cannot be identified , involve proceedings , which cannot be mentioned , on behalf of a client who must remain secret .
Over the last 24 hours , a lot of self - congratulating hyperbole has appeared on and off line about how the popular short message service Twitter saved free speech in the UK .
Twitter did not save free speech — and free speech has not been saved .
The twitter " back - patting storm " follows an agreement not to use an existing High Court gag order to block the Guardian 's reporting of a single sentence made in parliament by Paul Farrelly MP .
Farrelly 's question related to press freedoms and in particular , a leaked WikiLeaks report , the so - called " Minton report " , which exposed a toxic dumping disaster inflicted on the Ivory Coast by oil trading giant Trafigura , which saw 108,000 people seek medical attention .
However , the secret gag order against the report , granted on September 11 , remains in effect , and entirely prevents the reporting of the report 's contents in the UK .
It is not the only one .
Last month , the Guardian revealed that it had been served with 10 secret gag orders — so - called " super- injunctions " — since January .
In 2008 , the paper was served with six .
In 2007 , five .
Have n't heard of these ?
Of course not , these are secret gag orders ; the UK press has given up counting regular injunctions .
To understand the crucial events in this case , we need to go back to September when commodities giant Trafigura obtained its " super injunction " preventing discussion of the leaked Minton report into the Ivory Coast disaster .
During September and the preceding months , investigative reporters from the Guardian , Norway 's NRK TV , the Independent , the BBC's Newsnight , the Dutch press , Greenpeace and lawyers for the victims were collaborating to show Trafigura 's culpability .
Trafigura knew the investigation teams had a copy of the Minton report , because journalists had asked the company to respond to the report 's findings .
Instead of providing a countering opinion , the company went to the High Court and obtained a secret injunction preventing journalists from telling the public anything at all about the document .
Although the Minton report is a merely a short engineering and legal assessment of the Ivory Coast disaster , no - doubt one among many , instead of commissioning it directly , the company " laundered " the report through its lawyers , Waterson & Hicks .
This permitted Trafigura to claim legal privilege on the document should it leak ; which is precisely what the company did , when it did .
An undisclosed UK High Court judge , who we can reveal to be Justice Maddison , accepted this parlour trick , and on September 11 , issued a broad gag order with secrecy provisions that prevented even the existence of the gag order from being reported .
On September 14 , WikiLeaks released the full Minton report in an attempt to undermine the injunction .
The UK press was then left in the Kafkaesque position where neither the Minton report , nor the injunction against it could be mentioned , despite the report appearing on the front page of WikiLeaks .
A few days later , in private correspondence with Norwegian journalists Synnøve Bakke and Kjersti Knudssøn from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation , another legal firm representing Trafigura shed some light on the injunction :
Your questions of today do also reveal the fact that you are in possession of a draft , preliminary expert opinion produced by Minton Treharne & Davies Ltd , and that you appear to be ready to disclose information from this report .
Trafigura looks very seriously upon this , as disclosing any information from this report would be a clear breach of confidentiality and privilege .
The report is clearly privileged and confidential and was obtained unlawfully by whoever is responsible for it coming into your possession .
Please be aware that on Friday of last week , our clients sought and obtained an injunction in relation to this document and information contained in it against the Guardian newspaper and Persons Unknown , pending a further hearing .
A few days after the investigative stories appeared on September 17 , Trafigura entered into a settlement with over 31,000 Ivorian class - action claimants — while continuing to deny any responsibility for the disaster .
Since direct reports of parliamentary proceedings are largely exempt from libel laws in the UK ( most recently under the 1996 Defamation Act ) , it is not uncommon for MPs to mention censored facts , so that newspapers will be able to safely take the facts from their parliamentary speeches .
This same approach was used by Paul Farrelly MP , to expose the Minton report gag .
Farrelly , a former Observer section editor , tabled the following question notice in the House of Commons , and in the process , exposed two secret gag orders , including the gag against the Minton report :
Paul Farrelly ( Newcastle - under - Lyme ) :
To ask the Secretary of State for Justice , what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of legislation to protect ( a ) whistleblowers and ( b ) press freedom following the injunctions obtained in the High Court by ( i ) Barclays and Freshfields solicitors on 19 March 2009 on the publication of internal Barclays reports documenting alleged tax avoidance schemes and ( ii ) Trafigura and Carter - Ruck solicitors on 11 September 2009 on the publication of the Minton report on the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the Ivory Coast , commissioned by Trafigura . [ 1 ]
Trafigura 's lawyers , Carter Ruck , no doubt recognizing an attempt to use parliament as a venue to not only subvert the September 11 gag , but as a way to attack their suppression business , told the Guardian that they would consider reporting Farrell 's question a contempt of the September 11 gag order .
The Guardian decided to make the gag a national issue .
David Leigh , lead author on the Trafigura story , wrote a carefully worded article designed to inflame , and the Guardian gave it substantial prominance on October 12 and 13 :
The Guardian is also forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented – for the first time in memory – from reporting parliament .
Legal obstacles , which cannot be identified , involve proceedings , which cannot be mentioned , on behalf of a client who must remain secret .
These and other subtle clues , which included a specific mention of the law firm " Carter Ruck " , were enough for a number of professional blogs , such a the parliamentary watch blog Order - Order , and WikiLeaks , to soon find the question notice on the House of Commons ' website transcript ( Hansard ) .
Twitter then promoted the visibility of the Guardian article , the WikiLeaks copy of the gagged Minton report and the articles about the Commons ' question .
However there are only a few players who affected this case 's inevitable legal conclusion .
The investigative team of the traditional media , Greenpeace , the victims and their respective legal teams .
WikiLeaks , who released , and kept up , the report at the center of the injunction as well as the gag order .
The lesson for Carter Ruck and other lawyers : be careful what you wish for .
Had Twitter not existed , we would have seen the same legal outcome , for such an affront to the UK political classes could never have survived the attentions of a national newspaper like the Guardian .
However , the September 11 gag , which threatens only the interests of the press and the people , continues , as do a vast number of other injunctions , acquired by those with unequal access to justice and something to hide .
Under pressure from legal costs , UK papers have silently removed some of the original September 17 dumping investigations .
For example , the Independent 's " Toxic Shame : Thousands injured in African city " no -longer " exists " except at WikiLeaks .
Now is not the time to be distracted from this reality , or to see the unravelling of a grotesque attack on parliamentary reporting as step forward ; it is a return to last week .
We are back at the UK censorship status quo , which may be described , without irony , as privatized feudalism .
So take your hands from each other 's backs , sharpen your ( s ) words — and get to work .
The battle is n't over , however it just may , be beginning .

Art experts believe a new portrait by Leonardo da Vinci may have been discovered thanks to a 500 - year - old fingerprint .
A Young Girl in Profile in Renaissance Dress , the painting which has been attributed to Leonardo da Vinci .
Photograph : Christie's
The small picture of a young woman in profile was previously believed to be a German work from the early 19th century and has changed hands in recent years for around £ 12,000 .
But a growing number of leading Leonardo scholars agree the work is almost certainly by the Renaissance figurehead because it appears to have his fingerprint on it .
Carbon dating and infrared analysis of Leonardo 's techniques back up the theory .
If the scholars are correct , it will be the first major work by Leonardo to be identified for 100 years and will be worth tens of millions of pounds .
Martin Kemp , emeritus professor of the history of art at Oxford University , is so convinced the portrait is a Leonardo that he has written an as yet unpublished 200 - page book about it .
Kemp said he first thought the find was " too good to be true – after 40 years in the Leonardo business I thought I 'd seen it all " .
But gradually , " all the bits fell into place like a well - made piece of furniture .
All the drawers slotted in , " he told the Times .
The fingerprint , which corresponds to the tip of the index or middle finger , was found by Peter Paul Biro , a Montreal - based forensic art expert , when he examined images taken of the portrait by the revolutionary multispectral camera .
Multi-spectral analysis can capture light from frequencies beyond the visible light range , such as infrared , allowing the extraction of information that the human eye fails to capture .
Biro believed the fingerprint , which was found near the top left corner of the work , was " highly comparable " to a fingerprint on Leonardo 's St Jerome in the Vatican , the Antiques Trade Gazette reported .
The magazine said infrared analysis showed " significant " stylistic parallels with those in Leonardo 's Portrait of a Woman in Profile in Windsor Castle and showed the work was made by a left - handed artist , as Leonardo is known to have been .
Drawn in ink and chalks , the beautiful young woman 's costume and elaborate hairstyle reflected Milanese fashion of the late 15th century , and carbon analysis was consistent with that dating , the magazine reported .
Kemp believed that " by a process of elimination " , the fresh - faced teenager could be Bianca Sforza , the daughter of Ludovico Sforza , Duke of Milan from 1452 - 1508 , and his mistress Bernardina de Corradis .
Kemp said he thought the portrait , which measures 33 cm x 22 cm ( 13 in x 9in ) , must date from around 1496 when , aged 13 or 14 , the Bella Principessa married the Duke 's army captain , Galeazzo Sanseverino , a patron of Leonardo's .
She died four months after the wedding .
It would be Leonardo 's first known portrait of the princess , although he painted two of the duke 's mistresses Cecilia Gallerani and Lucrezia Crivelli .
The picture was sold at Christie 's in New York in 1998 , in an Old Master Drawings sale as a Young Girl in Profile in Renaissance Dress , catalogued as German , early 19th century , with an estimate of $ 12,000 - $ 16,000 .
It sold for $ 19,000 ( £ 12,000 ) and later went for a similar sum to Canadian - born collector Peter Silverman , in 2007 .
Silverman believed there was more to the portrait and delved into the matter after a discussion last year with Dr Nicholas Turner , formerly the keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum .
Silverman told the Times that when he first saw the picture , " my heart started to beat a million times a minute .
I immediately thought this could be a Florentine artist .
The idea of Leonardo came to me in a flash . "
The portrait is due to go on display in an exhibition in Sweden next year .
Harmonix and MTV Games revealed 19 more songs from the upcoming release of " The Beatles : Rock Band , " bringing the total of announced tracks to 44 .

All of the bonus content was vetted by members of Apple Core Studios , and some were confirmed by Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono .
Developed by Harmonix , " The Beatles : Rock Band " follows the same gameplay style as " Rock Band " and " Rock Band 2 , " letting four people crowd around the TV to play digital members of a rock band .
For " The Beatles : Rock Band , " the developers , along with MTV Games , were able to secure the rights to the entire Beatles catalog , along with the likenesses of the band members .
Players will be able to take on the role of Paul , John , George and Ringo as they work their way through the Beatles ' storied career , starting in the Cavern Club and ending up on the rooftop of Abbey Road Studios , where the band played its last public concert in January 1969 .
In addition to the standard " Rock Band " gameplay , " The Beatles : Rock Band " introduces three - part harmony , letting three players sing in tandem for a handful of the songs .
The game will launch on September 9 as a special edition pack for $ 259.99 ( including replica bass guitar , drums and microphone controllers ) , or just as the disc for $ 59.99 .

Change management skills and experience are ‘ must have ’ qualities for many senior jobs .
If you want to progress to the top , you ’ll need to tick this box .
Job advertisers misuse the term .
A advertisement using the term change management might mean a willingness to sack people .
Others use it as a euphemism for aggressive or even bullying management .
I ’ve seen it used where the recruiter meant ‘ an ability to get things done ’ .
When an employer genuinely asks for change management skills they are looking for someone to steer a team , department or organisation through business change .
Business change management
Business change takes one of two basic forms .
The first happens when an organisation decides to remake itself .
This could be part of a merger , demerger or management buyout .
It could be when a company changes focus .
Under Lou Gerstner IBM moved from a hardware orientation to consulting services .
Or when Apple switched from computers to making music players and mobile phones .
In theory this kind of change is orderly .
You ’d start with a master plan and make considered changes .
Any change will lie mainly within the bounds of the organisation and controlled by the organisation .
In this case change management is like looking at a map and saying to yourself ‘ we ’re are now at point A , what is the best route to get to point B ? ’
When things blow off course , you can always go back to the map and find a new course .
Change due to external forces
If only things were always so simple .
The other type of change happens when external pressures drive organisations to reconfigure .
This may happen because of a new piece of legislation or government regulation .
An example might be the changes required within accounting businesses when governments introduce new tax rules .
To understand how complex this can become imagine what processes might have taken place if the US government had broken up Microsoft .
Government led change may be negotiable and comes with plenty of warning .
Other external forces driving change are less predictable .
For example : social upheaval , radical technological advances , economic upsets , competitor action , accidents , war and so on .
Some change is merely the rough and tumble of market forces – nobody would deny Cisco has been through periods of unforeseen change over the years .
Although there are exceptions , few companies can expect to have much influence over these external forces and even where there is an opportunity to influence external change , things might not happen the way you expect .
Change management types
It ’s worth making a clear distinction between the two different ways of dealing with external change .
Usually external changes push companies into reactive responses .
These can be knee - jerk responses or more measured approaches .
The key is going through the change and dealing with problems as they arise .
When change is sudden and unforeseen , there is no option but to react this way .
Alternatively , companies can attempt to anticipate change and prepare for it .
This does n’t necessarily need a crystal ball .
All it requires is keeping well - informed .
For example , agricultural companies already know the climate is changing ; some will be making plans as evidence of global warming emerges .
Software developers can look at the road maps for future product development issued by companies such as Intel , Google and Microsoft .
Carmakers know some jurisdictions will require zero emissions by as set date .
Role play
Multinational oil companies like BP and Shell have role - play exercises coaching executives through dummy external shocks .
For example they might look at how a military coup in a major oil - producing country might affect their business .
This is an important way of preparing for radical external change .
It enables executives to build teams and learn how things get done when the everyday rules of business change .
Companies in other industries engage in similar speculative activities or have informal think tanks to work through various scenarios .
You may apply a simplified version of some of these techniques to your own situation .
Preparation , planning and research are important keys to dealing with change in any area of activity .
But no amount of planning can adequately prepare you for some events .
Companies at the World Trade Centre might have had plans to deal with computer failure , or even a large - scale disaster .
They may have work - shopped a whole range of ideas .
I doubt if many expected the bulk of their employees to die in a single morning .
Yet , companies looking at other possibilities would have had a starting point for dealing with the crisis .
You may think dealing with a terrorist attack has little to do with change management .
The connection is slim .
Yet , airlines faced with plummeting ticket sales and security companies faced with increased demand went through their own change management processes after the terror attacks .
Most of the change management you will need to deal with will be on a smaller scale and less dramatic .
We ’ll look more closely at the issues for change managers in another post .

Lies and Seductions is a single player adventure game , in which player controls Abby .
Abby has made a wager with her friend Becca to seduce Chris , a Christian rock star , who has promised to stay a virgin until marriage .
The game takes place in a cruise ship .
If Abby succeeds in seducing Chris before the cruise ends , Becca will sleep with Abby .
Otherwise Becca can publicly humiliate Abby .
The player can freely move in 3D space and guide to have conversation with another character using menu based system .
The player can learn about what Chris likes and dislikes by talking with Chris 's friends Emma and Ed , or eavesdropping on their conversations , and later use that information in order to seduce Chris .
The game contains also two mini games : a Dance Dance Revolution - like dance game and Texas Hold 'em poker .
The performance in both mini games also influences the game 's progression .
From time to time , comic strip - style cutscenes are used to progress the story .
The game has three different endings : an ending for the lost wager , and two slightly different endings for winning the wager .
Chris is discussing problems with his girlfriend with his sister Emma .
The Lies and Seductions game is a part of my doctoral research on character - driven game design .
A team of masters degree students joined with me to develop this game .
My research has revolved around social dynamics between game characters , and using those dynamics in gameplay design .
I was looking for ideas for a game to test some of the ideas from my research .
I found the characters and setup of the novel Dangerous Liaisons by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos fascinating , and wanted to explore how one could build a game around the main conflict of the story : a game that deals with sex , seduction , and betrayal .
The cutscene shows what happens after Abby has lost the wager .
I proposed my idea for the game based on Dangerous Liaisons to the students , and we started to work with the game in Autumn 2007 .
The development of the game was a part of a course Game Project at the department of Media Laboratory at the University of Art and Design Helsinki , Finland .
I started to teach a course Game Project at 2007 .
The main goal of the course is to design and develop a working game , and learn about game development in practice .
First , we decided to set the game to present times , instead of the late 18th century France of the Dangerous Liaisons .
We thought that without proper background research the setting would feel like a modern day with funny façade -- and we did n't have resources to do the background research .
In addition , we knew from the beginning that we could only model and animate few characters and locations .
To tackle this issue , setting the events in a modern , leisure cruise ship seemed to be good choice to limit available space and give a good reason to a motley crew to spend time together .
As mentioned , we took the main characters and conflict from the novel as a starting point for our game :
Abby , the PC , was based on Vicomte de Valmont , a skilled , unscrupulous womanizer .
Chris was based on chaste and god-fearing Madame de Tourvel .
The character was transformed to a male rock star , but we kept the important features of de Tourvel , such as chastity and religiosity , in order to keep the conflict motivated .
Becca was based on Marquise de Merteuil , who is an amoral intriguer .
Becca is present only in the cutscenes , because we did n't have resources to model , animate , and write dialogue for her , and the gameplay did n't require her to be present .
Other characters have been inspired by the story , but were more designed to serve gameplay .
The reception of the game has varied .
Some have liked it and some found it unsatisfactory .
For example , Kierron Gillen sums up the review he wrote for Rock , Paper , Shotgun : " interesting , but not entirely successful . "
Others have more positive , for example : " it 's a really interesting concept .
I did n't manage to get the super mega happy ending yet ... but that 's ok because I 'm happy to go back and try again .
It 's fun to see how the story plays out . "

Video : Cockroach slipping off coated glass rod Video : Cockroach slipping off coated glass rod
Sticky fly traps ?
So twentieth century , darling .
Scientists have identified a cheap , durable and eco-friendly chemical that , when painted onto walls , baby bottles and crops , gets rid of pests by making their feet “ sweat ” .
Insects normally have no trouble strolling up walls and across slippery surfaces .
Tiny pads on their feet secrete a ketchup - like glue – part oil , part water – that holds them in place .
Now , Jan-Henning Dirks and colleagues at the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge say they have found a way to turn this glue into a slippery lubricant .
Dirks ’ team painted glass rods with a range of chemicals and compared how these affected the ability of cockroaches to climb up the rods to a piece of apple .
They also measured the frictional force between the roach ’s feet and the surface of the rod .

Greasy insect
They found that roaches effortlessly shimmied up rods coated in PTFE , a non-stick coating commonly found on cooking pans .
But when the rods were covered in polyimide resin , the creatures lost their grip .
In fact , the resin reduced the friction between the insects ’ feet and the glass rods by around 60 per cent .
“ The cockroaches simply slid off the rod , ” Dirks says .
Using interference reflection microscopy , the scientists discovered that polyimide resin sucks up the water contained in the insect ’s glue – leaving behind a slippery layer of oil with no adhesive properties .
“ In the future , this could prove to be a powerful tool to prevent pests from scuttling around on many hard - to - reach surfaces , ” says Dirks .
Because the water absorbed by the resin evaporates quickly , the resin never needs to be replaced .
“ As a result , it ’s far cheaper and more eco-friendly than conventional pest - controlling methods . ”
Whether the technology will control flies , earwigs and geckoes , which use a slightly different form of “ glue ” , remains to be seen , says Dirks .
Any possible side - effects of the resin on wildlife will also need to be investigated .

Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that “ We have to bring these deficits down very dramatically . ”
This is the understatement of the new century :
Many private economists now predict that deficit spending will surpass $ 2 trillion this year , with $ 10 trillion more borrowing over the next decade .
How will the Obama administration cope with this budget recklessness ?
Mr. Geithner and Larry Summers , Mr. Obama ’s director of the National Economic Council , hinted last weekend that taxes on everyone ...

Nelson Piquet has said he does not expect forgiveness for his involvement in the fixing of last year 's Singapore Grand Prix , as he admits he must now start his career from zero .
The Brazilian testified at the FIA 's World Motor Sport Council hearing into the Renault race - fix affair in Paris on Monday , but left the proceedings without commenting to the assembled press .
However , in a statement that was issued shortly after it was announced that Renault had been given a two - year suspended ban , Piquet said he has happy the matter had now been brought to an end .
" I am relieved that the FIA investigation has now been concluded , " explained the Brazilian .
" Those now running the Renault F1 Team took the decision , as I did , that it is better that the truth be known and accept the consequences .
The most positive thing to come from bringing this to the attention of the FIA is that nothing like it will ever happen again .
" I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given .
I wish every day that I had not done it .
I do n't know how far my explanation will go to making people understand because for many being a racing driver is an amazing privilege , as it was for me .
All I can tell you is that my situation at Renault turned into a nightmare .
" Having dreamed of being a Formula 1 driver and having worked so hard to get there , I found myself at the mercy of Mr Briatore .
His true character , which had previously only been known to those he had treated like this in the past , is now known . "
The nature of Piquet 's deteriorating relationship with Briatore only came to light when he issued a stinging attack on the former Renault team principal after he was dismissed from the team shortly after the Hungarian Grand Prix .
And Piquet said that his time working with Briatore had been a living nightmare , and the worst period of his life .
" Mr Briatore was my manager as well as the team boss , he had my future in his hands but he cared nothing for it .
By the time of the Singapore GP he had isolated me and driven me to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life .
Now that I am out of that situation I cannot believe that I agreed to the plan , but when it was put to me I felt that I was in no position to refuse .
" Listening now to Mr Briatore 's reaction to my crash and hearing the comments he has made to the press over the last two weeks it is clear to me that I was simply being used by him then to be discarded and left to ridicule . "
Although Piquet 's involvement in the affair makes it unlikely he will be able to make a return to F1 , he has said he still has a strong desire to return to the top level .
" I have had to learn some very difficult lessons over the last 12 months and reconsider what is valuable in life , " he said .
" What has not changed is my love for Formula 1 and hunger to race again .
I realise that I have to start my career from zero .
" I can only hope that a team will recognise how badly I was stifled at Renault and give me an opportunity to show what I promised in my career in F3 and GP2 .
What can be assured is that there will be no driver in Formula 1 as determined as me to prove myself .
" As my final words on this matter , I would like to repeat that I am so sorry to those who work in Formula 1 ( including the many good people at Renault ) the fans and the governing body .
I do not expect this to be forgiven or forgotten but at least now people can draw their conclusions based upon what really happened . "
In a daring experiment in Europe , scientists used mosquitoes as flying needles to deliver a " vaccine " of live malaria parasites through their bites .
The results were astounding : Everyone in the vaccine group acquired immunity to malaria ; everyone in a non-vaccinated comparison group did not , and developed malaria when exposed to the parasites later .
The study was only a small proof - of - principle test , and its approach is not practical on a large scale .
However , it shows that scientists may finally be on the right track to developing an effective vaccine against one of mankind 's top killers .
A vaccine that uses modified live parasites just entered human testing .
" Malaria vaccines are moving from the laboratory into the real world , " Dr. Carlos Campbell wrote in an editorial accompanying the study in Thursday 's New England Journal of Medicine .
He works for PATH , the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health , a Seattle - based global health foundation .
The new study " reminds us that the whole malaria parasite is the most potent immunizing " agent , even though it is harder to develop a vaccine this way and other leading candidates take a different approach , he wrote .
Malaria kills nearly a million people each year , mostly children under 5 and especially in Africa .
Infected mosquitoes inject immature malaria parasites into the skin when they bite ; these travel to the liver where they mature and multiply .
From there , they enter the bloodstream and attack red blood cells — the phase that makes people sick .
People can develop immunity to malaria if exposed to it many times .
The drug chloroquine can kill parasites in the final bloodstream phase , when they are most dangerous .
Scientists tried to take advantage of these two factors , by using chloroquine to protect people while gradually exposing them to malaria parasites and letting immunity develop .
They assigned 10 volunteers to a " vaccine " group and five others to a comparison group .
All were given chloroquine for three months , and exposed once a month to about a dozen mosquitoes — malaria - infected ones in the vaccine group and non-infected mosquitoes in the comparison group .
That was to allow the " vaccine " effect to develop .
Next came a test to see if it was working .
All 15 stopped taking chloroquine .
Two months later , all were bitten by malaria - infected mosquitoes .
None of the 10 in the vaccine group developed parasites in their bloodstreams ; all five in the comparison group did .
The study was done in a lab at Radboud University in Nijmegen , the Netherlands , and was funded by two foundations and a French government grant .
" This is not a vaccine " as in a commercial product , but a way to show how whole parasites can be used like a vaccine to protect against disease , said one of the Dutch researchers , Dr. Robert Sauerwein .
"
It 's more of an in - depth study of the immune factors that might be able to generate a very protective type of response , " said Dr. John Treanor , a vaccine specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester , N.Y. , who had no role in the study .
The concept already is in commercial development .
A company in Rockville , Md. — Sanaria Inc. — is testing a vaccine using whole parasites that have been irradiated to weaken them , hopefully keeping them in an immature stage in the liver to generate immunity but not cause illness .
Two other reports in the New England Journal show that resistance is growing to artemisinin , the main drug used against malaria in the many areas where chloroquine is no longer effective .
Studies in Thailand and Cambodia found the malaria parasite is less susceptible to artemisinin , underscoring the urgent need to develop a vaccine .

~~THINGS TO IMPROVE ON ~ ~
A splash of color here and there would be nice .

A few years ago , Alistair McGowan went on holiday to Cornwall with his then girlfriend Ronni Ancona and her friends .
" There were two gay guys , a writer and some of Ronni 's girlfriends , " he recalls , " and all had one thing in common – they could n't care less about football . "
McGowan , on the other hand , had spent most of the year doing football - related gigs , and his head was filled with whether Rochdale would make the League Two play - offs , what Stenhousemuir 's ground was like , and how great it was to be at Plough Lane when Wimbledon 's Vinnie Jones grabbed Gazza 's crown jewels .
" I suddenly realised I had nothing to say to them . "
It was , he says , a horrible epiphany .
" I never thought of myself as an addict .
I loved the idea of turning up to see a play on a Saturday night with a football programme from the afternoon in my pocket .
I thought of myself as cultured , interested in a wide variety of things , but I was an addict .
I just did n't realise . "
McGowan reckons his addiction to football destroyed his relationship with Ancona , the other half of his double act on BBC1's the Big Impression , which ran from 1999 to 2002 .
She was the Nancy to his Sven , the Posh to his Becks , the Audrey Hepburn to his Cary Grant .
Off - screen , though , Ancona – whom McGowan had fallen for at a comedy club , describing her as " this sweet , lost - looking creature with the most beautiful clavicles I had ever seen " – felt suffocated by her partner 's obsession with the game ; his barmy need to study attendance figures on Ceefax , his inability to read a newspaper from front to back .
Even now , McGowan stuffs football references into his stand - up routines .
During our interview , he does bang - on impersonations of the Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill , commentator John Motson , and former Portsmouth manager Tony Adams in a post - match interview .
" You do n't need to know who Tony Adams is to appreciate this , " McGowan says .
" All you need to know is that whenever he did an interview , he always sounded as though he'd just been burgled . "
I smile weakly at his impersonation , not because I did n't find it funny ( I did ) but because I worry for the mental health of someone who has let the beautiful game become an evil empire colonising every bit of his life , work and psyche .
Surely , though , there must have been more to the break - up with Ancona than this infantile obsession ?
" Well , " retorts McGowan slightly reprovingly , fixing me with those huge eyes , " it typified the clash between us .
We were opposites and that worked wonderfully : I became much wilder and more surreal in my comedy thanks to knowing and working with Ronni .
But if we had stayed together , we would have killed each other – literally killed each other .
And football would have been responsible for that . "
This is where the Ancona - McGowan story gets really weird .
They have just collaborated on a book called A Matter of Life and Death , Or How to Wean a Man off Football .
What kind of an ex helps her former boyfriend over his football addiction ?
Especially when she 's now married with kids , and her husband is – judging from what Ancona writes in the book – just as much of a football obsessive as her ex ?
Surely , despite the appeal of having a pair of household names on the dustjacket ( a novel take on the two - for - one deal ) , she should have been trying to wean her husband rather than her ex ?
Both Ancona and McGowan are aware their book risks confirming gender stereotypes that men who do n't care about football and women who do may find insulting .
No matter : after apologising for generalisations , they get on with offloading them in alternating chapters .
" This is going to be difficult , " McGowan writes about giving up football .
" Nine months !
And then I will , officially , be a girl ! "
It was , in fact , a woman who unwittingly blighted McGowan 's life with football , an elderly lady called Mrs Drury whom he met aged four on holiday in Barmouth , north Wales .
" There 's something quixotic in how we choose football teams we 're doomed to stay with through the rest of our lives , " McGowan says .
" For me it was this nice lady from Leeds I met on holiday . "
After a week in Barmouth , young McGowan returned home to Evesham in Worcestershire a committed Leeds United fan .
He even went to Leeds University in part because of its proximity to the club 's Elland Road ground .
Football , for McGowan , is a phenomenon that holds the world in place .
" I recognise I have OCD about the game , " he says , " and that in my interviews I come across as a seriously strange man , but football does keep me together . "
' We no longer have the same cultural references '
Autumn marks McGowan 's return from relative obscurity .
For four years , he and Ancona were fixtures on British telly : the Mike Yarwood and Faith Brown of the new millennium .
" My fame is a little like that of retired footballers ; they get recognised on the street long after they do n't get any work . "
He claims not to mind the relative dearth of TV gigs , having worked on several high - profile theatre productions in the West End and with the RSC .
But he is clear about the reason for the declining clamour for his brand of mimicry : " multi-channel TV . "
" The Big Impression worked because we had the same cultural references , but we 're all watching different stuff now .
I did , if I say so myself , a very good Dylan Moran [ the Irish stand - up ] around the time he was starring in Black Books .
Then I did him for my mother and she said : ' Why are you doing Alan Rickman with an Irish accent ? '
TV has splintered , so where in the past I could expect my mother to know who Dylan Moran is , now I can 't . "
But do these socio-cultural changes mean the king of impersonators is obsolete ?
" Er , no , " he says , fixing me with those huge eyes once more .
" What it means is that when I impersonate someone , I have to assume most people wo n't know who it is .
Nowadays it 's about playing the percentages – some people will get my Tony Adams , some will appreciate my Colin Firth , others will like me doing Will Self as an X Factor judge . "
That said , McGowan is , sensibly , diversifying his brand .
He is now an author , a film star ( thanks to his cameo as a sleazy Greek tour guide in the new romantic comedy Driving Aphrodite ) , and an actor as capable of playing Shakespeare as having balloons shoved down his trousers before going on stage to sing Money Makes the World Go Round ( as he did in the West End production of Cabaret ) .
And he 's a playwright .
His first play , Timing , opens next month at the King 's Head pub theatre in Islington and stars EastEnders ' Dean Gaffney .
" It 's about a guy who meets his ex when they record an advert for a car that has Satnav as standard .
It 's about choice , about the acquisition of shite and about fatherhood .
What is the right time for men to have children . "
Curiously , on his return to stand - up last month , McGowan informed the press night crowd that his wife had just given birth to their third child , and duly received warm applause .
It was a lie : he 's currently unattached and childless .
What was that about ?
" I 'd just done this incredible bit about snooker commentary , which had died , and then I get applause for nothing .
I was pointing out how crazy it is that they react over a cultural shibboleth – me becoming a dad for the third time – and ignore what they 're here to see . "
McGowan goes on tour next month for the first time in eight years , so if you 're in the audience , try not to clap him for things he has n't done .
But has Ancona 's 12 - step anti-football programme worked ?
It seems unlikely : McGowan 's new stand - up routine remains riven with football arcana , and his acknowledgment at the back of the book includes the entire Leeds team from the early 70s .
Still , he does believe that , with his ex's help , he has grown as a human being .
McGowan relates his pleasure in seeing Richard Strauss 's opera Salome recently : " I saw it one night when I was working in theatre in Plymouth .
Loved it – and not only because it was 90 minutes , the same length as a football match . "
Although that probably helped .
$ 1 trillion in California mortgages are underwater and swimming in the Pacific Ocean .
$ 3 trillion in U.S. mortgages are in a negative equity position .
What this means is borrowers owe more than their home is worth .
A few research papers have shown that the number one factor in determining potential foreclosure is being upside down on a mortgage ( job loss is up there as well ) .
You can rest assured that all those Alt - A and option ARM mortgages in California are underwater to the point of touching sea bottom .
How bad can it get ?
One area in Southern California , the Inland Empire has an estimate total housing property value of $ 222 billion .
Only problem is there are $ 238 billion in mortgages attached to these properties .
Two enormous counties with negative equity .
Take for example the larger Los Angeles and Orange County areas .
We have some $ 1.077 trillion in housing property yet a total of $ 311 billion of mortgages are underwater .
This does not mean they are currently in foreclosure but the likelihood is extremely high .
Given that the Alt - A and Option ARM loans are more prominent in the so - called “ prime ” markets , a large number of these loans will implode on first recast .
Many are defaulting prior but once the recast hits , it will be game over .
Banks know this and that is why they are hiding foreclosed properties from the public view .
I ’ll try to make this a comprehensive review of the nationwide housing market and will also focus on issues specific to California since it makes up one - third of the face value of mortgages underwater .
First , the main cause of this problem is the real estate crash :
The Federal Flow of Funds report shows that over $ 5 trillion in real estate value has been wiped off the map since the peak hit .
That is a quick way to put a tremendous number of mortgages underwater .
The incentive to pay on a home that is worth less than you paid for is a psychological jolt .
We are conditioned to believe that a home is the greatest investment ever so when we are then told that a home is underwater , it strikes at the core of an American mantra .
What should have been expressed is housing is a great investment if purchased at the right price and not inflated casino values brought about crony Wall Street and their epic bubble machine .
It is hard to predict the ramifications down the road of this wealth annihilation .
We ’ve never seen so much household wealth disappear .
The stock market crash has also hurt but there is something intrinsic about a home that is going to shatter consumer confidence for a very long time .
Let us look at the overall household balance sheet since the recession started :
Now think for a second how big $ 13.8 trillion is .
That is the amount that has evaporated from the American household balance sheet .
Sure , the stock market has rallied since the March lows but we are still 36 percent down from the 2007 peak if we look at the S&P 500 .
At the same time , housing values have continued to decline and this makes up a large portion of the American balance sheet so the gains from March will probably be offset by the continued decline in household wealth .
The most recent data released from the Fed for this set only goes up to Q1 of 2009 .
A lot has happened in Q2 of 2009 .
Let us look at the Case - Shiller Index :
Couple of things regarding the recent stabilization .
A large part of this was seasonal and also , the tax break for clunker homes has worked to entice people back into the market .
Yet how long can these gimmicks hold up $ 3 trillion in underwater mortgages ?
We have yet to see those Alt - A and option ARMs come home to roost and they will .
I ’ve been reading many reports about the raw number of underwater homes .
The three major reports I have seen come from Deutsche Bank , Zillow , and Loan Performance .
I ’ve decided to put all the data in one spot :
It is a curious find to see nearly all three of the reports coincide with each other .
The reports show that some 15 to 16 million mortgages are underwater ( Zillow is a bit higher with a 20 million current estimate ) and the Deutsche Bank report predicts that the bottom will come in 2011 and at that point , 25 million mortgages will be underwater in the U.S. I tend to agree with the Zillow estimate .
Why ?
First , as we had initially highlighted $ 1 trillion of the $ 3 trillion in U.S. underwater mortgages are here in California .
Given the still delusional world of places like Culver City , Pasadena , Palms , Rancho Park , and other areas prices still have a way to go down .
A Loan Performance report shows that 2.9 million mortgages in California are underwater .
Given the amount of Alt - A loans in the state that number seems about right ( we also have prime loans that are now underwater ) .
Now you want an example of this insanity in a prime area ?
Let us look at a bank owned home in Pasadena :
Sale History
8/31/2001 : $ 558,000
03/07/2003 : $ 655,000
Not a big deal right ?
Pasadena is prime Southern California .
Oh , but this is where it gets interesting .
This home is now bank owned .
This is another example of the home ATM machine .
The initial data I am seeing has this place listed as a 2 bedrooms 2 baths home but on more recent data , I ’m seeing it come in at 4 bedrooms .
When we look at the loans you can tell this was a HGTV time here :
This is the kind of insanity that is going to implode the mid to upper priced market .
Keep in mind , this home is n’t listed on the MLS and is part of that hidden inventory .
Seriously , from $ 655,000 to over a million in loans on a 2 bedrooms 2 bath home ( initially ) in Pasadena .
Now why am I putting all this data in one spot ?
Because this is crucial in understanding where we are heading .
This recession was brought to us by housing but housing will not bring us out of it .
That is a big mistake being made with propping up failed banks and lenders .
The solution does not come from housing or the finance industries .
Alt - A and option ARM loans should fail and they will fail in epic fashion .
I ’ve gotten a few e-mails now that it seems the public - private investment program ( PPIP ) is set to go but at a more trimmed down version .
My response is this :
Okay , let us assume all the toxic crap mortgages are put off onto the taxpayer .
100 percent .
Let us just say we dump the $ 3 trillion in underwater mortgages to the U.S. Government .
Now what ?
You still have to sell the homes .
You still have to go through price discovery .
Someone still needs to eat that loss .
I ’m amazed that some people think that once the toxic assets are shifted to the government that some mysterious Midas touch is going to turn these toxic mortgages into gold .
This is the same idiotic logic that allowed Wall Street cronies to create collateralized debt obligations and junk filled mortgage backed securities .
Their idea was “ let us mix crap mortgages with mortgages that are less than crap ” and somehow it will turn into a glorious triple - A rated security .
And by the way , all those bailouts are doing absolutely zilch in stemming the foreclosure crisis .
Last month we hit an all - time record in foreclosure filings :
So much for stemming the issue and we are approaching one year since TARP .
We have thrown some $ 13 trillion in bailouts and commitments to Wall Street and banks and all we get is a 50 percent stock market rally .
Guess who is making out like bandits right now ?
It sure is n’t the American homeowner and worker .
Talking about jobs , it might be important to get people working because without a job , it might be hard to make the mortgage payment .
California is entering stage two of the housing implosion :
The vast majority of those notice of defaults will turn into REOs that will go into the hidden inventory .
But looking at foreclosure data , there is a record number of homes going to auction in the next few months .
The only question is , will they actually be put on the market or will banks keep on holding them on their books at inflated prices ?
At this point they do n’t have much of a choice .
The cash flow is going to stop in 2010 once the loans recast .
I would venture to guess that many people are paying the artificial teaser rate and many are already mentally prepared to stop paying once the payment recasts .
At that point , banks are going to be struggling for capital and if the stock market rally ends , they are going to need another casino to raise easy equity from suckers chasing P/E ratios in the triple digits .
Now where does this leave housing ?
The number one reason for the increase in home sales is lower prices .
It boggles the mind that people then think that rising home values will keep the gig going .
Most of the lower priced homes are coming from foreclosure re-sales .
So as long as foreclosures are running high , there will be pricing pressure on the downside .
This is simply the new reality .
Also , much of the jump in home sales was brought on by gimmicks like the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve tag teaming up on the mortgage markets and buying up some $ 1.25 trillion in mortgage debt .
Okay , now that is coming to an end .
Also , the tax break for buying a home is simply another subsidy to homeowners at the expense of non-homeowners .
That will be coming to an end .
Unemployment will remain high for another 12 to 18 months ( at least ) .
So there goes more potential home buyers .
If you look at this objectively , there is little reason to believe housing will rebound any time soon .
And when we say rebound , we mean prices .
Sales will keep increasing so long as prices keep falling .
We have a poorer country that will look to buy homes that reflect their new net worth .
And a worried consumer is reluctant to buy high priced items :
One stat that simply is not quantifiable but I am certain is present , is how many folks are sitting around the dinner table at night and saying , “ once this payment recasts we will stop paying . ”
In California , I am certain many have already had this conversation especially if they have an Alt - A and option ARM .
Attorney General Jerry Brown is cracking down on numerous loan modification operations .
For the most part , any loan modification is going to benefit the bank , not the homeowner .
Most people are strategically defaulting and this is the right business move .
Some shills in the industry will start arguing morality but they were largely silent with duct tape over their mouth when the housing bubble kept going up .
All of a sudden banks want to enforce standards and tighten up credit and those in the industry suddenly went from bank robber to reformed officer .
Was n’t the point of the bailouts to increase credit ?
Please , it was to mend the balance sheet of banks under a larger pretense .
The solution is simple .
Housing prices must come down further .
People must put 10 to 20 percent down on a home purchase .
There is a reason for this .
If you are buying a $ 500,000 home it will pain you to see $ 100,000 of your own cash evaporate if you walk away .
Going with a zero down Alt - A loan you will simply walk away if that home is now valued at $ 300,000 .
The math on this is simple .
When you put the entire housing situation into perspective you realize that there will be no long term recovery and we are still in for another tough round .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Christopher Kelly , former chief fundraiser for ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , has died , according to the ex-governor and a hospital official .
Christopher Kelly , 51 , was former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's chief fundraiser .
" I am deeply saddened to hear that Chris had died , " Blagojevich 's statement said .
The Cook County , Illinois , medical examiner did not return calls Saturday .
However , Kelly , 51 , of Burr Ridge , was pronounced dead at Stroger hospital in Cook County at 10:46 a.m. Saturday , hospital spokesman Marcel Bright told CNN .
Bright said Kelly had been treated at another county hospital late Friday before being transported to Stroger early Saturday , though he would not disclose any other details .
" It is now a police investigation , " he said .
Watch report on death of Kelly
Cook County authorities did not release any details about Kelly 's death .
Blagojevich was in New York and declined to comment further .
Earlier this year , Blagojevich , who was impeached and removed from office , pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges .
A federal grand jury in April indicted him on 16 felony counts , including racketeering , conspiracy , wire fraud and making false statements to investigators .
The indictment also named some of Blagojevich 's closest aides , including Kelly ; former chief - of - staff , John Harris ; and Springfield millionaire William Cellini .
On Tuesday in a separate case , Kelly pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud " as part of a kickback scheme to illegally obtain $ 8.5 million in work at O'Hare International Airport , " the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday in story about his death on the newspaper 's Web site .
" At the time , Kelly , 51 , said he was under pressure from federal prosecutors to cooperate in their investigation of Blagojevich , but he refused , " the Tribune reported .

Torres knew she needed surgery on her ailing left knee .
She did n't expect a radical operation and a recovery of up to 18 months .
The 42 - year - old , five - time Olympic swimmer told The Associated Press on Thursday she will have the reconstructive procedure Oct. 20 in Boston .
Her shinbone will be broken to create more room for cartilage to grow around her kneecap .
While admitting she 's a bit " freaked out " about having such a major operation , Torres said it could actually give her more motivation to come back for the 2012 London Olympics .

Mark Guertin writes in with an interesting situation that he 's dealing with , which I think highlights some of the problems with copyright law today .
Guertin put together a YouTube video of some swimming pugs as part of a promotion for a charity he 's involved with .
Knowing that music on videos is a potential copyright issue , he went to Wikipedia to find some public domain music , and chose Wagner 's Ride of the Valkyries to accompany the swimming pugs .
Except ... he got blocked .
YouTube 's content ID system told him that the song was owned by ( who else ? )
Warner Music Group , and thus the soundtrack was muted .
Guertin filed a counternotice , and the music was reinstated , but then muted a second time as apparently someone ( Google / Warner ? ) did n't agree with the counternotice .
Without knowing the details , myis that the situation has to do with the different types of copyright coverage .
While the songis public domain , each individualof it is covered by copyright .
It seems likely that whatever recording was used is still under copyright .
Guertin is reasonably upset about the situation , especially the whole concept of having the music blocked until WMG has a chance to weigh in on it , noting that " guilt before innocence " seems incredibly unfair .
But the bigger issue may be how this ( once again ) shows how out of sync copyright law is with what people think is reasonable or fair .
If you found out a piece of music was in the public domain , it 's natural to assume that a recording of that same piece of music is in the public domain .
And to make things more confusing , that 's absolutely true ( in the US at least ) of a photograph of a public domain painting .
But making a new recording of a public domain song ?
Bam .
A new monopoly created .
Unfortunately for Guertin , thehe used probably isin the public domain , even if theis ( yes , that 's confusing ) .
That 's why , these days , it 's probably more reasonable to search out Creative Commons - licensed music than public domain music -- because you can't be as sure whether the PD part covers the recording as well as the music .
To some of us , that seems like awith current copyright laws , while others appear to view it as a feature .

Over 400 million transistors are packed on dual - core chips manufactured using Intel 's 45 nm process .
That 'll double soon , per Moore 's Law .
And it'll still be like computing with pebbles compared to quantum computing .

Quantum computing is a pretty complicated subject — uh , hello , quantum mechanics plus computers .
I 'm gonna keep it kinda basic , but recent breakthroughs like this one prove that you should definitely start paying attention to it .
Some day , in the future , quantum computing will be cracking codes , powering web searches , and maybe , just maybe , lighting up our Star Trek - style holodecks .
Before we get to the quantum part , let 's start with just " computing . "
It 's about bits .
They 're the basic building block of computing information .
They 've got two states — 0 or 1 , on or off , true or false , you get the idea .
But two defined states is key .
When you add a bunch of bits together , usually 8 of 'em , you get a byte .
As in kilobytes , megabytes , gigabytes and so on .
Your digital photos , music , documents , they 're all just long strings of 1s and 0s , segmented into 8 - digit strands .
Because of that binary setup , a classical computer operates by a certain kind of logic that makes it good at some kinds of computing — the general stuff you do everyday — but not so great at others , like finding ginormous prime factors ( those things from math class ) , which are a big part of cracking codes .

Quantum computing operates by a different kind of logic — it actually uses the rules of quantum mechanics to compute .
Quantum bits , called qubits , are different from regular bits , because they do n't just have two states .
They can have multiple states , superpositions — they can be 0 or 1 or 0 - 1 or 0+1 or 0 and 1 , all at the same time .
It 's a lot deeper than a regular old bit .
A qubit 's ability to exist in multiple states — the combo of all those being a superposition — opens up a big freakin ' door of possibility for computational powah , because it can factor numbers at much more insanely fast speeds than standard computers .
Entanglement — a quantum state that 's all about tight correlations between systems — is the key to that .
It 's a pretty hard thing to describe , so I asked for some help from Boris Blinov , a professor at the University of Washington 's Trapped Ion Quantum Computing Group .
He turned to a take on Schrödinger 's cat to explain it : Basically , if you have a cat in a closed box , and poisonous gas is released .
The cat is either dead , 0 , or alive , 1 .
Until I open the box to find out , it exists in both states — a superposition .
That superposition is destroyed when I measure it .
But suppose I have two cats in two boxes that are correlated , and you go through the same thing .
If I open one box and the cat 's alive , it means the other cat is too , even if I never open the box .
It 's a quantum phenomenon that 's a stronger correlation than you can get in classical physics , and because of that you can do something like this with quantum algorithms — change one part of the system , and the rest of it will respond accordingly , without changing the rest of the operation .
That 's part of the reason it 's faster at certain kinds of calculations .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
The other , explains Blinov , is that you can achieve true parallelism in computing — actually process a lot of information in parallel , " not like Windows " or even other types of classic computers that profess parallelism .
So what 's that good for ?
For example , a password that might take years to crack via brute force using today 's computers could take mere seconds with a quantum computer , so there 's plenty of crazy stuff that Uncle Sam might want to put it to use for in cryptography .
And it might be useful to search engineers at Google , Microsoft and other companies , since you can search and index databases much , much faster .
And let 's not forget scientific applications — no surprise , classic computers really suck at modeling quantum mechanics .
The National Institute of Science and Technology 's Jonathan Home suggests that given the way cloud computing is going , if you need an insane calculation performed , you might rent time and farm it out to a quantum mainframe in Google 's backyard .

The reason we 're not all blasting on quantum computers now is that this quantum mojo is , at the moment , extremely fragile .
And it always will be , since quantum states are n't exactly robust .
We 're talking about working with ions here — rather than electrons — and if you think heat is a problem with processors today , you 've got no idea .
In the breakthrough by Home 's team at NIST — completing a full set of quantum " transport " operations , moving information from one area of the " computer " to another — they worked with a single pair of atoms , using lasers to manipulate the states of beryllium ions , storing the data and performing an operation , before transferring that information to a different location in the processor .
What allowed it to work , without busting up the party and losing all the data through heat , were magnesium ions cooling the beryllium ions as they were being manipulated .
And those lasers can only do so much .
If you want to manipulate more ions , you have to add more lasers .
Hell , quantum computing is so fragile and unwieldy that when we talked to Home , he said much of the effort goes into methods of correcting errors .
In five years , he says , we 'll likely be working with a mere tens of qubits .
The stage it's at right now , says Blinov , is " the equivalent of building a reliable transistor " back in the day .
But that 's not to say those of tens of qubits wo n't be useful .
While they wo n't be cracking stuff for the NSA — you 'll need about 10,000 qubits for cracking high - level cryptography — that 's still enough quantum computing power to calculate properties for new materials that are hard to model with a classic computer .
In other words , materials scientists could be developing the case for the iPhone 10G or the building blocks for your next run -of - the - mill Intel processor using quantum computers in the next decade .
Just do n't expect a quantum computer on your desk in the next 10 years .

We have talked about population growth before , but recent numbers show that the problem is far from over .
The worldâ€™s population surpassed 6.8 billion in early 2009 , with no significant slowing in the pace of growth in recent years .
Estimates by the United Nations Population Division indicate that humanity has been consistently gaining more than 79 million peopleâ€ ” a population almost the size of Germanyâ€ ™sâ€ ” each year since 1999 .
Indicators including decreased assistance for family planning services , fertility levels well above replacement levels in many countries , and improvements in life expectancy for people living with HIV point to a human population that is growing somewhat more rapidly than demographers had expectedâ€ ” pointing to uncertainty in the commonly cited U.N. projection of 9.1 billion by 2050 .
One variable not taken into account in population projections is the impact of global climate change , which will likely most adversely affect people in developing countries .
According to the latest Vital Signs snapshot of population worldwide :
Â· More than 95 percent of population growth is occurring in developing countries , especially in Africa and Asia , regions that account for more than three - quarters of the current population .
U.N. demographers estimate that by mid-century , Africa will be adding 21 million people a year to world population and Asia 5 million .
Â· Although the populations of Japan , Germany , Russia , and some Eastern European countries are already declining , U.N. demographers do not indicate a population peak among industrial countries as a group until 2036 .
Â· Global spending on contraceptive supplies and services totaled just $ 338 million in 2007 , considerably less than half the amount in 1995â € ” despite a 20 - percent increase in the number of people of reproductive age in developing countries .
This new population update includes the latest figures on annual additions to world population , donor family - planning expenditures , and the reproductive - age population in developing countries .

Rip currents — powerful , channeled currents of water flowing away from the shore — represent a danger to human life and property .
Rip currents are responsible for more than one hundred deaths on our nation 's beaches each year , according to the United States Lifesaving Association , and if rip currents persist long enough they can cause beach erosion .
Henry Bokuniewicz , Professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University , and Ph.D. candidate Michael Slattery found that rip currents at East Hampton Village Beach lasted on average a little over one minute , not long enough to substantially alter the shoreline .
They will present their findings October 14th at the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association 's 2009 National Coastal Conference , " Integrating Coastal Science & Policy . "
With funding from the East Hampton Beach Preservation Society and the Halpern Foundation , Dr. Bokuniewicz and graduate student Michael Slattery set up a video camera to record an image of a half mile stretch of the East Hampton Village Beach every 20 seconds .
In the images , rip currents can be detected as a gap in the line of incoming waves .
They collected over 500 hours of video images and observed hundreds of rip currents in this short stretch of coast .
The monitoring showed that the rip currents were not associated with man-made structures and they were short lived , with the most persistent rip currents lasting no more than a few minutes .
" Most rip currents we observed did not last long enough to change the character of the shoreline , although they could pose a risk to swimmers unfortunate enough to encounter them , " said Dr. Bokuniewicz .
Besides gathering statistics on the occurrence of rip currents , Dr. Bokuniewicz and Michael Slattery are studying the wave patterns that lead to rip currents .
Rip currents are generated by a combination of waves , including , long , low , barely perceptible waves that appear along the ocean shoreline , called " infragravity waves . "
Infragravity waves cannot be measured directly and computer models are inadequate for predicting them .
Bokuniewicz and Slattery are using a novel approach to study these waves ; they deploy seismometers to measure the noise created by breaking waves .
" It appears that very slow , long - period changes in the amount of wave noise are precursors to the generation of rip currents , " said Dr. Bokuniewicz .
" We are hopeful that seismometers can be used to measure wave patterns that we can't easily observe in any other way .
In the future , we hope to utilize this method to monitor and ultimately forecast wave conditions that cause rip currents . "
The visit of the pornographic star Maria Ozawa to Indonesia to roll a comedy , but totally dressed , has unleashed a war between the integrists whom they persecute to prevent that it enters the country and its legion of the unconditional premises .
The radicals , headed by a group of Muslim clergymen , have won the first battle , when obtaining that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism denies the permission to him of entrance in the country to the Japanese , of 23 years , that it had predicted to arrive today at Jakarta .
“ Its flight was predicted for today , we have had but it to cancel ” , recognized Ody Mulya , producer of films “ Menculik Miyabi ” , literally , “ To kidnap to Miyabi ” .
The film is an inoffensive adolescent comedy that counts the misfortune of a group of Indonesian college students who kidnap by accident to the actress Maria Ozawa , well - known like Miyabi , that in the tape would be interpreted to itself .
“ In any case the film follows ahead , that by all means .
We will try that the month comes that comes ” , added the producer , of the Indonesian studies Pictures Principle .
The critics of the more orthodox Muslim groups have gotten worse days in the last to press by the hundred to the Government , removing to the streets of preservative college students who , in a manifestation burned feminine underclothes .
Meanwhile , the movement of support to Maria Ozawa is pleasing in Internet , where the followers of the Japanese , quite popular pornographic actress mix themselves in Indonesia , and the defenders of the civil liberties in the greater Muslim country .
In the social network Facebook , where several favorable groups to the visit of the Japanese have been able to draw attention of 300,000 people of both sexes , the commentaries abound that praise the physicist of the actress and the critics to the most integrist sectors of the Indonesia society , mainly moderate .
The president of the powerful and preservative Council of Ulemas of Indonesia ( MUI ) , Amidhan , attacked recently against the pornographic star , to which he labeled as “ sweepings ” , and against the Indonesian producers of the tape , to those who he accused to damage the mental health of Indonesia youth .
“ Although she is not pornographic , this film is very dangerous for our young people , especially if they become admirers of this pornographic actress and curiosity enters to see the rest them of its films ” , Amidhan argued .
“ One is the reputation of Indonesia , the Muslim country more colonising ” , added , remembering that the archipelago welcomes in more than 200 million faithfuls .
” We reject the visit of Miyabi !
They do not have to allow him to enter Indonesia .
We will die fighting to cancel its arrival " , proclaimed during a protest Umar Alatas , head of the radical group Front of Defenders of Islam ( FPI ) by the district the west of Jakarta .
Do n't mention it they have served the explanations as the producers of the comedy , that use the innocuity of a project that watches more after the pull in ticket office of the actress who by its eroticism .
“ We guaranteed that Miyabi will not participate in a pornographic film .
We will not bring it as it stars pornographic , but to act in a comedy ” , emphasized the chief of a main directorate of Principle Pictures , Adi Sudiadi .
“ Miyabi is very well - known by the Indonesians … and we hoped to attract with her a pile of spectators ” , added .
Maria Ozawa catapulted itself to the estrellato of the cinema for adults in 2005 , after putting in a page Japanese Web , and since then she has appeared in more of a hundred of pornographic films .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) 
Thousands of individuals claiming the first - time home buyer 's $ 8,000 tax credit may have been trying to scam the system , including purported 4 - year - olds and illegal immigrants , according to a watchdog report released Thursday .
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George told a House panel that more than 19,000 people filed 2008 tax returns claiming the credit for homes they had not yet purchased .
George said his office had identified another $ 500 million in claims , by some 74,000 taxpayers , where there were indications of prior home ownership .
He told a House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee that they also found 580 taxpayers under the age of 18 who claimed $ 4 million in first - time home buyer credit .
One was 4 years old .
" Some of our findings , while preliminary , are somewhat disturbing , " George said .
Among the most striking instances of fraud include 4 - year - olds , non-U.S. citizens and IRS employees inappropriately claiming the benefit , he said .
The report comes amid a heated debate about the popular credit , which the real estate and home - building industry is fiercely lobbying to protect .
It expires at the end of November , and some say it simply doles out cash to those who would have purchased a home without it .
A subcommittee of the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives will hear from IRS , IG and other officials at a hearing Thursday .
About 1.4 million tax returns have been filed to take advantage of the credit at a cost to the government of about $ 10 billion .
Many powerful lawmakers want to extend it , including some that back broadening it to all home buyers and doubling its benefit .
Extension in its current form would cost about a $ 1 billion a month .
A proposal in the Senate to double the credit and extend it until June would cost about $ 17 billion .
In response to a report last week citing thousands not qualifying properly for the credit , the IRS said it intends to vigorously root out fraud in the program .
An IRS spokesman also said potential for fraud exists whenever a refundable credit is put in place .
The agency has opened 107,000 civil cases related to the credit and identified 167 criminal schemes .
Also , they have selected thousands of returns for those claiming the credit for deeper audits .
The report finds that 582 taxpayers under the age of 18 claimed about $ 4 million using the credit , with the youngest being 4 .
It further faults the IRS for failing to take its advice that a third party be required to document an individual claiming the credit actually purchased a home .
The IRS disputed some of the findings of the IG , and argued for example that some findings are premature because some taxpayers may eventually purchase a home .
Under the law , the credit should be claimed after purchase .
The IRS has responded to some of the IG 's advice , including installing computer filters so those who filed for a home mortgage interest deduction could not also claim the first - time tax credit .
" The IRS is having a very mixed bag in terms of its implementation of this important tool to help the economy , " George said .
A 2008 law created a $ 7,500 tax credit for those who have n't purchased a home in three years and who meet certain income limits , with the intention of jump starting the moribund housing market .
A 2009 law boosted the credit to $ 8,000 .
A bipartisan group of lawmakers , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , want to extend the credit but the housing chief for the Obama administration on Tuesday expressed doubts the United States could afford to extend the credit .
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said the administration would decide in coming weeks whether it backs an extension .

The content management system you choose can really make a huge difference in how much time you ( or your clients ) spend keeping a site updated and maintained .
There ’s a huge variety out there — some estimates put the number at around 1700 different options .
Some are great … some , not so much .
Below are ten useful guidelines to consider when choosing a CMS , followed by rundowns on ten great CMS options available and how they stack up based on the guidelines .
Ten Simple Guidelines for Choosing the Perfect CMS
1 . The CMS you choose should be really good at whatever the main function of your website is .
What do you want your website to do ?
Is it going to be primarily a static website , like an online brochure ?
Or is it going to be a fully - functioning ecommerce site ?
Or maybe it ’s going to be really media - heavy with tons of videos , photos , and audio files .
Or is a blog going to be the primary focus ?
Whatever your site ’s primary function is going to be , you need to define it and then find a CMS that does that particular thing really , really well .
If blogging is the main focus of the site , then use a blog platform .
If images and video are the main focus , then you need to find a CMS that either has great support for media built - in or has great plugins for enabling those functions .
If your site is going to focus on an online store , then the platform you choose needs to be able to seamlessly integrate that online store without a ton of extra work .
While there is no size - fit - for - all option , it is worth investing your time and effort to find the best CMS for your eCommerce websites
2. A CMS needs to work intuitively .
When you average user opens up the backend of the site , they should be able to figure out how to do basic functions without too much instruction .
Different elements of the site should be clearly labeled .
The basics of posting a new page , editing a page , and even changing themes or sidebar elements should all be relatively simple to figure out for the average computer user .
3 . The backend needs to be standardized .
Things should all work basically the same way in the backend of the site .
A good CMS should have a standardized format for each section of the backend .
If one section uses a drop - down menu for selecting something , then all of the other sections should use the same type of menu for similar options — not radio buttons or some other selector .
The same goes for the way things are named or otherwise referred to .
If something is called a “ page ” in one place and a “ post ” in another , that ’s going to get confusing ( plus , most people consider those two different things ) .
If it ’s a “ sidebar ” in one place and a “ second column ” somewhere else , that ’s going to confuse your average user .
4 . The backend needs to be logical and well - organized .
Things should be laid out logically in the backend .
This means that all of the functions related to editing , or sidebars , or themes , or creating new content , should be grouped somehow or otherwise function the same .
Alternatively , some CMSs put all of the things related to pages in one place , sidebars in another , plugins in another , etc .
Either way , they ’re laid out logically and once you know the basic architecture , it ’s easy enough to figure out where things are supposed to be .
5 . The right CMS should n’t have a ton of extra functionality you ’ll never use .
This is a completely personal choice .
Some sites will make use of tons of advanced functionality .
Other sites wo n’t .
If you ’re never going to have an online store , why do you need a CMS that focuses on ecommerce ?
If you never plan to do anything beyond posting photos to your site , why have a CMS that does that plus a hundred other things ?
Instead , find a CMS that does the one thing you want to do really well and forget about the other features .
6 . The right CMS should be easy for non -geeks to use .
Web designers and developers are very good at using web - based applications and pretty much anything else computer - related .
A lot of their clients , on the other hand , probably are n’t .
While most of the end - users of any CMS are going to have at least basic computer knowledge , they ’re probably not super tech savvy .
While you might love a particular CMS and think it ’s the best thing since solid - state hard drives , your clients might find it confusing , hard to use , and overly complicated .
The question I always ask myself when considering this is , “ Could my mother use this ? ”
My mother is your typical business computer user .
She can do spreadsheets , word processing , and email , but she ’s definitely not a techy .
If I ’m confident that I could easily explain a CMS to her and she ’d then be able to use it with a minimum of later support , then I know it ’s going to be appropriate for 90 % of other likely users .
7 . It needs to include a WYSIWYG editor .
WYSIWYG editors make life easier for your clients .
Most clients do n’t know HTML and do n’t care to learn .
But they want to be able to use bold or italic text or use header tags to create sections within their pages .
A WYSIWYG editor makes that all possible for non -tech - savvy users .
8 . The pages it creates should be fast - loading and have simple code .
One of the major advantages of a CMS is that it simplifies the updating and management of a website .
So the pages it produces should also be simple .
There should n’t be a lot of extra code or provisions for unused functionality in the final page code .
All that serves to do is slow the load times for the page and increase the likelihood that something will render wrong or throw an error .
9 . The template engine should allow you complete creative control .
Some CMSs have very set ideas about what a website should look like .
There needs to be a sidebar for navigation .
You should n’t use navigation dropdowns .
The content has to be arranged in nice , neat columns .
Who ’s the designer here ?
Whatever CMS you choose should let you design pages the way you want and should work around your needs .
10 .
The right CMS should have adequate support and documentation .
In all likelihood , you ’re going to run into some sort of problems with any CMS you choose .
Whether this is caused by add - ons or in the course of customizing some bit of code , or whether the CMs is doing something unexpected , having somewhere you can turn to to get advice on how to fix the problem is invaluable .
This does n’t necessarily have to be some expensive tech support phone number or other paid support .
Sometimes you can get quicker and better responses from a user community .
Does the CMS you ’re considering have support forums frequented both by other users and by those involved in the project ?
Are there other , off - site forums dedicated to that particular CMS ?
The people who visit these forums can be a wealth of information for doing just about anything with your CMS of choice .
Thorough documentation for the CMS is also valuable .
It should provide information on everything from basic use of the CMS to customizations and advanced functionality .
In addition to being complete , it should also be easy to understand and accurate ( which can be hard to determine until you actually delve into doing some of what it suggests ) .
Ten Excellent CMS Options
WordPress has morphed from a basic blogging platform into a fully - functioning CMS .
WordPress ’ primary functionality is still blogging , though with plugins it ’s capable of doing everything from brochure sites to portfolio and gallery sites to fully - featured ecommerce sites .
For the most part , WordPress ’ backend is intuitive to use , with different functions laid out based on different sections of the site ( appearance , posts , pages , etc . )
The way things work in the backed , though , is very standardized and once you ’re used to doing things in one section , it ’s easy enough to figure them out in every other section .
Likewise , it ’s also well organized and finding where to perform different functions is very straight - forward in most cases .
The WYSIWYG editor provides all the basic functions you could need , including inserting images , video , and other media , and makes it easy to toggle back and forth between HTML and Visual mode .
Because a lot of WP ’s functionality comes from plugins , the basic platform is pretty simple , with support for pages , posts , and other standard content that will be used on the vast majority of sites .
You only need to add plugins as you need their functionality , meaning there is n’t a whole lot of unused “ stuff ” in the core installation .
WP is also simple enough to use for non-geeks ( my mother has no problem with it and she ’s running a complete ecommerce site with WP ) and the different user permissions means it ’s harder for users to break things ( just limit their access to things like themes and plugins ) .
WP is also completely standards - compliant .
The pages it creates are simple and quick - loading .
Of course , some plugins create not - so - small pages , especially those that put JavaScript and CSS right into the page instead of in separate files .
Just be aware of this when checking out plugins .
WP really makes it possible to design pages however you see fit .
From galleries to text - heavy sites and pretty much anything in between , WP can do it through the use of custom themes and page templates .
Where WP really shines , though , is in it ’s documentation .
The WordPress Codex is massive , covering everything from basic instructions for use to creating your own plugins and working with advanced features .
WP also has active forums where you can generally find fixes for any problems you might encounter from other users .
Radiant is built on Ruby on Rails .
It ’s really good at building basic sites with an unlimited number of pages .
Blogging and gallery functionality can be added through extensions .
The backend is simple and logically laid out , with pages , snippets , and layouts as the primary sections .
Functions work pretty much the same no matter which section you ’re in .
Currently , Radiant is rather limited in its functionality , so it ’s unlikely you ’ll end up with any unneeded functions .
Extensions can be built in Ruby On Rails , though , opening up huge possibilities for future functionality .
The WYSIWYG editor is basic but allows users to perform all of the basic functions .
Radiant has an extremely easy - to - use backend .
Basic functions like updating and add pages are really no more complicated than sending an email .
This makes it a great solution for clients who are n’t at all tech - savvy .
The code Radiant produces is simple and clean .
Pages can be built to look pretty much however you want based on a combination of snippets you create .
There also appears to be an active developer community with extensive documentation for developers .
End - user documentation is a bit light , but it ’s such simple to use CMS that it ’s not really a big issue .
SilverStripe is a full - featured CMS that ’s capable of just about anything you want it to do .
It ’s built in PHP on the Sapphire framework , making it more customizable .
One of SilverStripe ’s most interesting features is that designers can customize the backend for each of their clients , only showing content fields the clients actually need to access .
This makes it potentially one of the easiest - to - use CMSs for geeks and non-geeks alike .
And of course it includes a WYSIWYG editor .
SilverStripe is probably overkill for most very basic websites , but because of its ability to be customized , it ’s appropriate for most other sites .
SilverStripe also provides tons of great , free support , including documentation for both developers and end -users , forums and an IRC channel .
SilverStripe makes a point to stay out of the HTML / CSS portion of your site , making it possible to design pages to look however you want .
Joomla is widely considered to be the most popular open - source CMS currently available .
It runs on PHP and MySQL .
The backend is relatively simple and straightforward , with sections for managing articles , the front page , menus , media , and other content .
There ’s also a link to create a new article to save time .
Drop - down menus also give more options for those and other sections ( including extensions ) .
Joomla ’s WYSIWYG editor includes tons of formatting options — even emoticons .
Joomla is pretty powerful , so it ’s another CMS probably not well - suited to very simple sites , where it would have a lot of excess functionality .
It includes a number of provisions to make pages load faster , including caching and GZIP page compression .
Joomla also has a huge list of plugins available to extend its functionality , making it appropriate for just about any kind of site requiring advanced functionality .
One of the biggest drawbacks of Joomla , though , is it ’s use of tables for layout .
While there are workarounds to replace the tables with CSS , it might not be worth the effort considering how many other CMSs do n’t use tables to begin with .
TYPOlight uses PHP5 and Ajax and includes functionality for static pages , blogs , newsletters , and calendars , among other sections .
The backend is intuitive while still offering a ton of functionality .
There are shortcuts for doing everything from creating forms to including Flash content .
Content is displayed within modules , which can be styled with CSS .
The output is accessible XHTML Strict .
It also offers mootools and GZip support .
TYPOlight may be a bit overwhelming for those who are n’t at least a little bit tech - savvy .
It ’s not that it ’s complicated ; just that there ’s a lot of options and a lot of different ways to customize it .
It does include a complete WYSIWYG editor and other tools to make publishing content simple .
The interface is intuitive if you take a minute to look over what ’s there and everything is laid out logically .
Again , it ’s just that there ’s a lot of information in there !
TYPOlight does include some nice developer tools , including a built - in CSS generator and a form generator .
There ’s plenty of documentation on the site for both developers and end -users .
There are screencasts , forums , and a wiki for support .
There are also options for paid support through TYPOlight partners in case you ( or your clients ) really need advanced help .
Frog is basically a PHP - based version of Radiant CMS ( mentioned above ) .
Frog has a simplified UI that ’s very intuitive .
It allows for an unlimited hierarchy of pages and allows you to customize templates on a per-page basis .
It includes the requisite WYSIWYG editor , simplified and more like WP ’s than some of the more complex editors .
It also features reusable snippets for regularly - used bits of content .
The backend provides a very coherent and well - organized structure that ’s user - friendly while also being quite powerful .
The basic functionality is aimed at a site with an unlimited number of pages , but there are plenty of plugins to extend that functionality .
There are currently plugins for both admin functions and front - end improvements ( including a number for image galleries ) .
The code Frog creates is clean and semantic .
Frog has decent documentation , with plenty of how - to articles for both basic functions and development .
There ’s also an IRC channel to get answers to any questions you might have .
Textpattern uses a tabbed UI on the backend , which is surprisingly intuitive .
It automatically brings you to the content editor to add a new page when you login , a great feature for sites that add new content regularly .
The biggest drawback to Textpattern is its lack of a WYSIWYG editor .
It does use Textile , though , for content editing , which is easy enough for a new user to learn .
The pages output by Textpattern are very lightweight and quick - loading , so no issues there .
The thing I like most about Textpattern is that it feels like a real alternative type of CMS .
The rest of the options out there are all , to some extent at least , kind of the same .
The basic functionality of the CMS is very simple , without a ton of added features you ’re unlikely to ever use .
There ’s support for images , categories , and articles , and not a whole lot else .
But there are a ton of different plugins available to extend its functionality , including plugins for everything from media and gallery support to advanced navigation options and stats .
There are even a couple of different ecommerce plugins available .
There ’s a large community built around Textpattern , so documentation and support are surprisingly good .
There ’s at least one book available , plus a support forum , developers ’ weblog , and TextBook ( a community - powered user manual ) .
Expression Engine is one of the more powerful CMSs out there .
EE has support for just about every function you could ever need or want , either in the core package or through plugins .
The backend is very simple and intuitive ( the first time I used it I was able to figure out the backend within a couple of minutes ) .
It ’s probably overkill for very basic websites , but appropriate for pretty much anything else .
Modules are available for everything from statistics to user forums .
The built - in WYSIWYG editor is pretty standard and works well .
The pages created by EE are a bit bulkier than many of the other CMSs featured here , but still appear to be reasonably clean , with the exception of some JavaScript plugins .
Some of the plugins available ( or at least some of those used on sites powered by EE ) either stick the JavaScript in the header of the page or , worse , right in the middle of the page ’s code .
But there have to be some tradeoffs when working with a CMS with this much built - in functionality .
EE ’s biggest drawback is that , except in certain circumstances , it ’s quite expensive .
A personal license is $ 99.95 and a commercial license is $ 249.95 .
You can use the free Core Version , but only on personal , non-commercial or non-profit sites .
Drupal is another very powerful CMS that can be used for everything from corporate sites to ecommerce sites to social networking sites .
The backend of Drupal is incredibly simple , with logically organized links to create new content , manage accounts , and edit existing content .
One of Drupal ’s nicest features is their “ Book Page ” content type .
These pages can be grouped into collections , referred to as books , which are automatically linked together .
This is a huge advantage if working with this kind of content .
Drupal does n’t have a WYSIWYG editor in the core installation , but there is a module to add the functionality .
The amount of functionality available in the backend is astounding , especially considering how easy it is to access it all .
Drupal has tons of modules available , too , to add functionality beyond basic content management .
There really are plugins to be able to do just about anything you could think of .
The code output by Drupal is a bit more complex than some simpler CMSs , but still relatively semantic and easy to decipher .
Drupal has a huge user community with forums both on the main development site and elsewhere .
There ’s also extensive documentation for end -users and developers .
When they say “ Made Simple , ” they really mean it .
CMS Made Simple was the first CMS I ever used .
I literally set up my first CMS - powered website in the course of a single evening ( with a customized but out - of - the - box template ) .
It includes complete template support , an incredibly easy - to - use backend , and an unlimited content hierarchy .
There ’s support for “ global content blocks ” ( called snippets in a lot of other CMSs ) and plenty of options for site layout .
There ’s also access to help files right from the backend , including the wiki , IRC and forums .
This is another CMS with no built - in WYSIWYG editor , but there is a plugin to add that functionality .
The pages output by CMS Made Simple are all XHTML and CSS compliant in addition to being clean and quick - loading .
The core installation has all the basic content functionality you ’d need , with plugins available to add most other functionality , with one exception : there does n’t currently appear to be an ecommerce plugin for the platform .
There ’s good documentation available for CMSMS .
There ’s also extensive support options , including IRC and forums .
I 've written a small shell script to report how much disk space each table in a given MySQL database is using .
For example , below is the output of the script when run against this site 's database :

With a few small modifications I 'm sure it'd be possible to get the script working PostgreSQL or other RDBMSes .
The full code is below :

Have a great weekend everyone !
Oh , heavs forbids we try to protect American kids from being bullied in school … for being perceived as gay !
Fox & Friends — a show that , like The O’Reilly Factor , disguises its homophobia by adding question marks to the ends of their commentary — took to Fox News pundit ( and axed CNN and MSNBC commentator ) Tucker Carlson , who has an entirely misinformed view of how bullying and anti-gay animosity ( something taught by parents at home ! ) come together for brutality .
We applaud school districts for wanting to talk to students , of any age , about the perils of bullying .
This sort of preventative measure should be encouraged .
But Mr. Carlson this morning tells his enabling host Steve Doocy that he went and checked with the FBI !
And they told him they had no evidence of second - graders being tormented with anti-gay epithets .
So this mandatory instruction is n’t just a way to push the homosexual agenda , it ’s also pointless !
Except , Mr. Carlson , it is n’t .
What these schools are doing is providing a safe environment , early on in children ’s tenures as students , to discuss what is wrong with hating other boys and girls because they are LGBT , or are perceived as such .
We want the same conversations to take place about why it ’s wrong to pick on the Hispanic kid , and the white girl , as it is the effeminate boy or the butch girl .
And then maybe , just maybe , we wo n’t have to deal with this sort of thing .
Tucker :
Your advice is for schools to sit back and let students harm each other in horrible ways .
It ’s uninformed rhetoric like yours that spreads misinformation , and leads to years of endless , needless harassment .
The very reason we should be having these talks with young kids , sir , is to prevent them from turning into you .

Eight years , eight dreary , miserable , mind - numbing years , the years of the Age of Reagan , are at long last coming to an end .
These years have surely left an ominous legacy for the future : we shall undoubtedly suffer from the after - shocks of Reaganism for years to come .
But at least Himself will not be there , and without the man Reagan , without what has been called his “ charisma , ” Reaganism can not nearly be the same .
Reagan ’s heirs and assigns are a pale shadow of the Master , as we can see from the performance of George Bush .
He might try to imitate the notes of Reagan , but the music just ai n’t there .
Only this provides a glimmer of hope for America : that Reaganism might not survive much beyond Reagan .
Reagan the Man
Many recent memoirs have filled out the details of what some of us have long suspected : that Reagan is basically a cretin who , as a long - time actor , is skilled in reading his assigned lines and performing his assigned tasks .
Donald Regan and others have commented on Ronald Reagan ’s strange passivity , his never asking questions or offering any ideas of his own , his willingness to wait until others place matters before him .
Regan has also remarked that Reagan is happiest when following the set schedule that others have placed before him .
The actor , having achieved at last the stardom that had eluded him in Hollywood , reads the lines and performs the action that others – his script - writers , his directors – have told him to follow .
Sometimes , Reagan ’s retentive memory – important for an actor – gave his handlers trouble .
Evidently lacking the capacity for reasoned thought , Reagan ’s mind is filled with anecdotes , most of them dead wrong , that he has soaked up over the years in the course of reading Reader ’s Digest or at idle conversation .
Once an anecdote enters Reagan ’s noodle , it is set in concrete and impossible to correct or dislodge .
( Consider , for example , the famous story about the “ Chicago welfare queen ” : all wrong , but Reagan carried on regardless . )
In the early years of Reagan rule , the press busily checked out Reagan ’s beloved anecdotes , and found that almost every one of them was full of holes .
But Reagan never veered from his course .
Why ?
God knows there are plenty of correct stories about welfare cheats that he could have clasped to his bosom ; why stick to false ones ?
Evidently , the reason is that Reagan cares little about reality ; he lives in his own Hollywood fantasy world , a world of myth , a world in which it is always Morning in America , a world where The Flag is always flying , but where Welfare Cheats mar the contentment of the Land of Oz .
So who cares if the actual story is wrong ?
Let it stand , like a Hollywood story , as a surrogate for the welfare cheats whom everyone knows do exist .
The Betrayal of the Am ... Murray N. Rothbard , Mu ... Best Price : $ 11.20 Buy New $ 18.50 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The degree to which Reagan is out of touch with reality was best demonstrated in his concentration camp story .
This was not simply a slip of the tongue , a Bushian confusion of December with September .
When the Premier of Israel visited Reagan at the White House , the President went on and on for three quarters of an hour explaining why he was pro-Jewish : it was because , being in the Signal Corps in World War II , he visited Buchenwald shortly after the Nazi defeat and helped to take films of that camp .
Reagan repeated this story the following day to an Israeli ambassador .
But the truth was 180 - degrees different ; Reagan was not in Europe ; he never saw a concentration camp ; he spent the entire war in the safety of Hollywood , making films for the armed forces .
Well , what are we to make of this incident ?
This little saga stayed in the back pages of the press .
By that point the media had realized that virtually nothing – no fact , no dark deed – could ever stick to the Teflon President .
( Iran -Contra shook things up a bit , but in a few months even that was forgotten . )
There are only two ways to interpret the concentration camp story .
Perhaps Reagan engaged in a bald - faced lie .
But why ?
What would he have to gain ?
Especially after the lie was found out , as it soon would be .
The only other way to explain this incident , and a far more plausible one , is that Ronnie lacks the capacity to distinguish fantasy from reality .
He would , at least in retrospect , have liked to be filming at Buchenwald .
Certainly , it made a better story than the facts .
But what are we to call a man who cannot distinguish fantasy from reality ?
It is surely frightening to think that the most powerful position in the world has been held for eight years by a man who cannot tell fact from fancy .
Even more frightening is the defection of the media , who early lost heart and played the role of a submissive receptacle for photo opportunities and press - release handouts .
One reason for this defection was the discovery of Reagan ’s Teflon nature .
Another likely reason was that journalists who were too feisty and independent would be deprived of their precious access to the Presidential plane or to inside scoops or leaks from the White House .
And a third reason was probably the desire not to dwell on the vital and hair - raising fact that the President of the United States , “ the leader of the free world ” and all that jazz , is nothing more than a demented half - wit .
For a New Liberty : The ... Rothbard , Murray N. Best Price : $ 20.50 Buy New $ 66.60 ( as of 07:15 EST - Details )
But why the Teflon ?
Because of the incredible love affair that Ronald Reagan has enjoyed with the American people .
In all my years of fascination with American politics ( my early childhood memories are couched in terms of who was President or who was Mayor of New York City or who won what election ) , I have never seen anything remotely like it .
Anyone else universally beloved ?
Franklin D. Roosevelt was worshipped , to be sure , by most of the American electorate , but there was always a large and magnificent minority who detested every inch of his guts .
Truman ?
He was almost universally reviled in his time ; he has only been made an icon in retrospect by the conservative movement .
Jack Kennedy , too , is only a hero now that he has been safely interred ; before his assassination he was cordially detested by all conservatives .
Nobody ever loved Nixon .
The closest to universal lovability was Ike , and even he did not inspire the intense devotion accorded to Ronnie Reagan ; with Ike it was more of a tranquilized sense of peace and contentment .
But with Reagan , it has been pure love : every nod of the head ; every wistful “ We - e- ll , ” every dumb and flawed anecdote , every snappy salute , sends virtually every American into ecstasy .
From all corners of the land came the cry , “ I do n’t like his policies very much , but I lo-o -ve the man . ”
Only a few malcontents , popping up here and there , in a few obscure corners of the land , emerged as dedicated and bitter opponents .
As one of this tiny minority I can testify that it was a lonely eight years , even within the ranks of the libertarian movement .
Sometimes I felt like a lone and unheeded prophet , bringing the plain truth to those who refused to understand .
Very often I would be at free - market gatherings , from living rooms to conferences , and I would go on and on about the deficiencies of Reagan ’s policies and person , and would be met with responses like “ Well of course , he ’s not a PhD . ”
Me : “ No , no , that ’s not the point .
The man is a blithering idiot .
He makes Warren Harding tower like Aristotle . ”
Responder : “ Ronald Reagan has made us feel good about America . ”
Perhaps that ’s part of the explanation for the torrent of unconditional love that the American public has poured onto Ronald Reagan .
Lost in Hollywood loony - land , Ronnie ’s sincere optimism struck a responsive chord in the American masses .
The ominous fact that he “ made us ” feel good about the American State and not just about the country is lost even on many libertarians .
But , in that case , why did n’t Hubert Humphrey ’s egregious “ politics of joy ” evoke the same all - inclusive love ?
I do n’t know the answer , but I ’m convinced it ’s not simply because Hubert was captive to the dreaded “ L - word ’ whereas Ronnie is a conservative .
It ’s lot deeper than that .
One of the remarkably Teflon qualities of Reagan is that , even after many years as President , he is still able to act as if he were totally separate from the actions of the government .
He can still denounce the government in the same ringing terms he used when he was out of power .
And he gets away with it , probably because inside his head , he is still Ronnie Reagan , the mother of anti-government anecdotes as lecturer for General Electric .
In a deep sense , Reagan has not been a functioning part of the government for eight years .
Off in Cloud - Cuckoo - Land he is the obedient actor who recites his lines and plays his appointed part .
Some commentators have been critical of Reagan for napping in the afternoons , for falling asleep at crucial meetings , for taking long vacations at his beloved ranch .
Well , why not ?
What else does he have to do ?
Reagan does n’t actually have to do anything ; like Peter Sellers in his last film , all he has to do is be there , the beloved icon , giving his vital sanction to the governmental process .

Reagan ’s handlers perceived early on that one threat to Reagan ’s Teflon rule would be allowing him to mix it up with members of the press .
Away from his teleprompter , Ronnie was a real problem .
So very soon , any sort of real press conference , including uninhibited questions and answers , was done away with .
The only press “ conferences ” became shouted questions as Reagan walked quickly to and from the White House helicopter .
One of his handlers has written that , despite all efforts , they could n’t stop Reagan from exercising one peculiar personality trait : his compulsion to answer every question that he hears .
But fortunately , not much was risked , since the noise of the helicopter engines would drown out most of the repartee .
The worst moment for the Reagan handlers came , of course during the first debate with Mondale in 1984 .
For one glorious moment , during the give and take of the debate , the real Reagan emerged : confused , befuddled , out of it .
It was a shaky moment , but all the handlers needed to do was to reassure the shocked masses that their beloved President was still sentient , was still there to be a totem to his flock .
The handlers blamed Reagan ’s showing on “ over coaching ” they made sure that he slept a lot just before the second debate , and they fed him a snappy mock self - deprecating one - liner about his age .
The old boy could still remember his jokes : he got off his lovable crack , and the American masses , with a sigh of relief , clasped him to their bosoms once again .
The Reagan Years : Libertarian Rhetoric , Statist Policies
How did Reagan manage to pursue egregiously statist policies in the name of liberty and of “ getting government off our backs ? ”
How was he able to follow this course of deception and mendacity ?
Do n’t try to get Ronnie off the hook by blaming Congress .
Like the general public – and all too many libertarians – Congress was merely a passive receptacle for Ronnie ’s wishes .
Congress passed the Reagan budgets with a few marginal adjustments here and there – and gave him virtually all the legislation , and ratified all the personnel , he wanted .
For one Bork there are thousands who made it .
The last eight years have been a Reagan Administration for the Gipper to make or break .
There was no “ Reagan Revolution . ”
Any “ revolution ” in the direction of liberty ( in Ronnie ’s words “ to get government off our backs ” ) would reduce the total level of government spending .
And that means reduce in absolute terms , not as proportion of the gross national product , or corrected for inflation , or anything else .
There is no divine commandment that the federal government must always be at least as great a proportion of the national product as it was in 1980 .
If the government was a monstrous swollen Leviathan in 1980 , as libertarians were surely convinced , as the inchoate American masses were apparently convinced and as Reagan and his cadre claimed to believe , then cutting government spending was in order .
At the very least , federal government spending should have been frozen , in absolute terms , so that the rest of the economy would be allowed to grow in contrast .
Instead , Ronald Reagan cut nothing , even in the heady first year , 1981 .
At first , the only “ cut ” was in Carter ’s last - minute loony - tunes estimates for the future .
But in a few short years , Reagan ’s spending surpassed even Carter ’s irresponsible estimates .
Instead , Reagan not only increased government spending by an enormous amount – so enormous that it would take a 40 percent cut to bring us back to Carter ’s wild spending totals of 1980 – he even substantially increased the percentage of government spending to GNP .
That ’s a “ revolution ” ?
The much - heralded 1981 tax cut was more than offset by two tax increases that year .
One was “ bracket creep , ” by which just inflation wafted people into higher tax brackets , so that with the same real income ( in terms of purchasing power ) people found themselves paying a higher proportion of their income in taxes , even though the official tax rate went down .
The other was the usual whopping increase in Social Security taxes which , however , do n’t count , in the perverse semantics of our time , as “ taxes ” ; they are only “ insurance premiums . ”
In the ensuing years the Reagan Administration has constantly raised taxes – to punish us for the fake tax cut of 1981 – beginning in 1982 with the largest single tax increase in American history , costing taxpayers $ 100 billion .
Creative semantics is the way in which Ronnie was able to keep his pledge never to raise taxes while raising them all the time .
Reagan ’s handlers , as we have seen , annoyed by the stubborn old coot ’s sticking to “ no new taxes , ” finessed the old boy by simply calling the phenomenon by a different name .
If the Gipper was addled enough to fall for this trick , so did the American masses – and a large chuck of libertarians and self - proclaimed free - market economists as well !
“ Let ’s close another loophole , Mr. President . ”
“ We -e- ell , OK , then , so long as we ’re not raising taxes . ”
( Definition of loophole :
Any and all money the other guy has earned and that has n’t been taxed away yet .
Your money , of course , has been fairly earned , and should n’t be taxed further . )
Strictly Confidential :...
Murray N. Rothbard , Mu ... Best Price : $ 5.89 Buy New $ 10.50 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Income tax rates in the upper brackets have come down .
But the odious bipartisan “ loophole closing ” of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 – an act engineered by our Jacobin egalitarian “ free market ” economists in the name of “ fairness ” – raised instead of lowered the income tax paid by most upper - income people .
Again : what one hand of government giveth , the other taketh away , and then some .
Thus , President - elect Bush has just abandoned his worthy plan to cut the capital gains tax in half , because it would violate the beloved tax fairness instituted by the bipartisan Reganite 1986 “ reform . ”
The bottom line is that tax revenues have gone up an enormous amount under the eight years of Reagan ; the only positive thing we can say for them is that revenues as percentage of the gross national product are up only slightly since 1980 .
The result : the monstrous deficit , now apparently permanently fixed somewhere around $ 200 billion , and the accompanying tripling of the total federal debt in the eight blessed years of the Reagan Era .
Is that what the highly touted “ Reagan Revolution ” amounts to , then ?
A tripling of the national debt ?
We should also say a word about another of Ronnie ’s great “ libertarian ” accomplishments .
In the late 1970 ’s , it became obvious even to the man in the street that the Social Security System was bankrupt , kaput .
For the first time in fifty years there was an excellent chance to get rid of the biggest single racket that acts as a gigantic Ponzi scheme to fleece the American taxpayer .
Instead , Reagan brought in the famed “ Randian libertarian ” Alan Greenspan , who served as head of a bipartisan commission , performing the miracle of “ saving Social Security ” and the masses have rested content with the system ever since .
How did he “ save ” it ?
By raising taxes ( oops “ premiums ” ) , of course ; by that route , the government can “ save ” any program .
( Bipartisan : both parties acting in concert to put both of their hands in your pocket . )
The way Reagan - Greenspan saved Social Security is a superb paradigm of Reagan ’s historical function in all areas of his realm ; he acted to bail out statism and to co-opt and defuse any libertarian or quasi-libertarian opposition .
The method worked brilliantly , for Social Security and other programs .
How about deregulation ?
Did n’t Ronnie at least deregulate the regulation - ridden economy inherited from the evil Carter ?
Just the opposite .
The outstanding measures of deregulation were all passed by the Carter Administration , and , as is typical of that luckless President , the deregulation was phased in to take effect during the early Reagan years , so that the Gipper could claim the credit .
Such was the story with oil and gas deregulation ( which the Gipper did advance from September to January of 1981 ) ; airline deregulation and the actual abolition of the Civil Aeronautics Board , and deregulation of trucking .
That was it .
The Gipper deregulated nothing , abolished nothing .
Instead of keeping his pledge to abolish the Departments of Energy and Education , he strengthened them , and even wound up his years in office adding a new Cabinet post , the Secretary of Veterans Affairs .
Overall , the quantity and degree of government regulation of the economy was greatly increased and intensified during the Reagan years .
The hated OSHA , the scourge of small business and at the time the second most - hated agency of federal government ( surely you need not ask which is the first most - hated ) , was not only not abolished ; it too was strengthened and reinforced .
Environmentalist restrictions were greatly accelerated , especially after the heady early years when selling off some public lands was briefly mentioned , and the proponents of actually using and developing locked - up government resources ( James Watt , Anne Burford , Rita Lavelle ) were disgraced and sent packing as a warning to any future “ anti-environmentalists . ”
The Reagan Administration , supposedly the champion of free trade , has been the most protectionist in American history , raising tariffs , imposing import quotas , and – as another neat bit of creative semantics – twisting the arms of the Japanese to impose “ voluntary ” export quotas on automobiles and microchips .
It has made the farm program the most abysmal of this century : boosting price supports and production quotas , and paying many more billions of taxpayer money to farmers so that they can produce less and raise prices to consumers .

And we should never forget a disastrous and despotic program that has received unanimous support from the media and from the envious American public : the massive witch hunt and reign of terror against the victimless non-crime of “ insider trading . ”
In a country where real criminals – muggers , rapists , and “ inside ” thieves – are allowed to run rampant , massive resources and publicity are directed toward outlawing the use of one ’s superior knowledge and insight in order to make profits on the market .
In the course of this reign of terror , it is not surprising that freedom of speech was the first thing to go by the boards .
Government spies and informers busily report conversations over martinis ( “ Hey Joe , I heard that XYZ Corp. is going to merge with ABC . ” )
All this is being done by the cartelizing and fascistic Securities and Exchange Commission , the Department of Justice and its much - hailed Savanarola in New York , Rudolf Giuliani .
All this is the work of the beloved Gipper , the “ free - market , ” “ libertarian ” Reagan Administration .
And where are the “ conservative libertarians ” ?
Where are the “ free market economists ” to point this out and condemn it ?
Foreign aid , a vast racket by which American taxpayers are mulcted in order to subsidize American export firms and foreign governments ( mostly dictatorships ) , has been vastly expanded under Reagan .
The Administration also encouraged the nation ’s banks to inflate and pour money down Third World rat - holes ; then bailed out the banks and tin-pot socialist dictatorships at the expense of U.S. taxpayers ( via tax increases ) and consumers ( via inflation ) .
Since the discrediting of Friedmanite monetarism by the end of the first Reagan term , the original monetarist policy of allowing the dollar to fluctuate freely has been superseded by Keynesian Secretary of Treasury James Baker , who has concerted with foreign central banks to try to freeze the dollar within various zones .
The interference has been , as usual , futile and counterproductive , but that will not stop the soon - to - be even more powerful Baker from trying to fulfill , or at least move strongly toward , the old Keynesian dream of one world fiat paper currency ( or at least fixed exchange rates of the various national currencies ) issued by one world Central Bank – in short , economic world government .
But did n’t Ronnie “ bring down inflation ” ?
Sure , but he did it , not by some miracle , but the old - fashioned way : by the steepest recession ( read : depression ) since the 1930s .
And now , as a result of his inflationary monetary policies , inflation is back with a roar – which the Teflon President will leave as one of his great legacies to the Bush Administration .
And then there is another charming legacy : the reckless inflationary course , encouraged by the Reagan Administration , of the nation ’s savings - and - loan banks .
Virtually the entire industry is now bankrupt , and FDIC – the federal agency supposedly “ insuring ” S&L depositors – is bankrupt .
Instead of allowing the banks and their deluded depositors to pay the price of their profligacy , everyone of both parties , including our “ free - market ” Reaganauts , is prepared to use taxpayer money or the printing press to bail out the entire industry – to the tune of an estimated 50 to 100 billion dollars .
( These estimates , by the way , come from government sources , which notoriously underestimate future costs of their programs . )
I have been cleaving to the strictly economic realm because even the staunchest pro-Reagan libertarian will not dare to claim that Ronnie has been a blessing for civil liberties .
On the contrary .
In addition to his reign of terror on Wall Street ( who cares about the civil liberties of stock traders anyway ? ) , Reagan worked to escalate toward infinity the insane “ war against drugs . ”
Far from the 1970s movement toward repealing marijuana laws , an ever greater flow of men and resources – countless billions of dollars – are being hysterically poured into combating a drug “ problem ” that clearly gets worse in direct proportion to the intensity of the “ war . ”

The outbreak of drug fascism , moreover , is a superb illustration of the interconnectedness of civil liberty and economic freedom .
Under cover of combating drugs , the government has cracked down on our economic and financial privacy , so that carrying cash has become prima fade evidence of “ laundering ” drug money .
And so the government steps up its long - cherished campaign to get people to abstain from cash and into using government - controlled banks .
The government is already insinuating foreign exchange controls – now the legal obligation to “ report ” large amounts of cash taken out of the country – into our personal and economic life .
And every day more evil drugs are being found that must be denounced and outlawed : the latest is the dread menace of anabolic steroids .
As part of this futile war , we are being urged by the Reaganites to endure compulsory urine testing ( supervised , of course , since otherwise the testee might be able to purchase and substitute black market drug - free urine ) .
In this grotesque proposal , government is not only not off our backs , it is now also insisting on joining us in the bathroom .
And in the bedroom , too , if Ronnie has his way .
Although abortion is not yet illegal , it is not for lack of effort by the Reagan Administration .
The relentless Reaganite drive to conservatize the judiciary will likely recriminalize abortion soon , making criminals out of millions of American women each year .
George Bush , for less than twenty - four glorious hours , was moved to take a consistent position : if abortion is murder , then all women who engage in abortion are murderers .
But it took only a day for his handlers to pull George back from the abyss of logic , and to advocate only criminalizing the doctors , the hired hands of the women who get abortions .
Perhaps the Gipper cannot be directly blamed – but certainly he has set the moral climate – for the increasingly savage Puritanism of the 1980s : the virtual outlawry of smoking , the escalating prohibition of pornography , even the partial bringing back of Prohibition ( outlawing drunken driving , raising the legal drinking age to 21 , making bartenders – or friendly hosts – legally responsible for someone else ’s drunken driving , etc. ) .
Under Reagan , the civil liberties balance has been retipped in favor of the government and against the people : restricting our freedom to obtain government documents under the Freedom of Information Act and stepping up the penalties on privately printed and disseminated news about activities of the government , on the one hand ; more “ freedom ” for our runaway secret police , the CIA , to restrict the printing of news , and to wiretap private individuals , on the other .
And to cap its hypocrisy , as it escalated its war on drugs , the Reagan Administration looked the other way on drug running by its own CIA .
Conceived in Liberty ( ... Rothbard , Murray N. Best Price : $ 114.99 Buy New $ 419.79 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
On foreign policy , the best we can say about Ronnie is that he did not launch World War III .
Apart from that , his foreign policy was a series of murdering blunders :
His idiotic know - nothing intervention into the cauldron of Lebanon , resulting in the murder of several hundred US Marines .
His failed attempt – lauded by Reaganites ever since – to murder Colonel Khadafy by an air strike – and succeeding instead in slaying his baby daughter , after which our media sneered at Khadafy for looking haggard , and commented that the baby was “ only adopted . ”
His stumblebum intervention into the Persian Gulf , safeguarding oil tankers of countries allied to Iraq in the Iraq–Iran war .
( Ironically , the US .
imports practically no oil from the Gulf , unlike Western Europe and Japan , where there was no hysteria and who certainly sent no warships to the Gulf . )
In one of the most bizarre events in the history of warfare , the Iraqi sinking of the U.S.S.
Stark was dismissed instantly – and without investigation , and in the teeth of considerable evidence to the contrary – as an “ accident , ” followed immediately by blaming Iran ( and using the sinking as an excuse to step up our pro-Iraq intervention in the war ) .
This was followed by a US warship ’s sinking of a civilian Iranian airliner , murdering hundreds of civilians , and blaming – you guessed it !
– the Iranian government for this catastrophe .
More alarming than these actions of the Reagan Administration was the supine and pusillanimous behavior of the media , in allowing the Gipper to get away with all this .
As we all know only too well , the height of Reagan ’s Teflon qualities came with Iran - Contra .
At the time , I navely thought that the scandal would finish the bastard off .
But no one saw anything wrong with the Administration ’s jailing private arms salesmen to Iran , while at the very same time engaging in arms sales to Iran itself .
In Reagan ’s America , apparently anything , any crookery , any aggression or mass murder , is OK if allegedly performed for noble , patriotic motives .
Only personal greed is considered a no - no .
I have not yet mentioned the great foreign - policy triumph of the Reagan Administration : the invasion and conquest of tiny Grenada , a pitiful little island - country with no army , air force , or navy .
A “ rescue ” operation was launched to save US medical students who never sought our deliverance .
Even though the enemy consisted of a handful of Cuban construction workers , it still took us a week to finish the Grenadans off , during the course of which the three wings of our armed forces tripped over each other and our military distinguished itself by bombing a Grenadan hospital .
The operation was as much a botch as the Carter attempt to rescue the American hostages .
The only difference was that this time the enemy was helpless .
But we won did n’t we ?
Did n’t we redeem the US loss in Vietnam and allow America to “ stand tall ” ?
Yes , we did win .
We beat up on a teeny country ; and even botched that !
If that is supposed to make Americans stand tall , then far better we sit short .
Anyway , it ’s about time we learned that Short is Beautiful .
Egalitarianism as a Re ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 3.44 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The US war against the Sandinistas on the other hand , which has been conducted at enormous expense and waged hand - in - hand with Guatemalan , Honduran , and Salvadoran dictators , is going down the drain , despite illegal CIA mining of harbors and injury to neutral shipping .
Even the nearly comatose American public is giving up on the idea of supporting bandit guerrillas , so long as they are anti-Communist , despite the best efforts of Ollie and Secord and Singlaub and Abrams and all the rest of the war crowd .
The Reagan Administration ’s continued aid and support to Pol Pot in Cambodia , the most genocidal butcher of our time , is more reprehensible but less visible to most Americans .
As a result , Pol Pot ’s thugs are mobilizing at this very moment on the Thai border to return and take over Cambodia as soon as the Vietnamese pull out , presumably to renew their bizarre mass murders .
But you see , that ’s okay with the Reaganites because the Cambodian Commies are guerrilla fighters against the Vietnamese ( pro-Soviet ) Commies , who by definition are evil .
Pol
Pot ’s butchers as “ freedom fighters ” show us that , in the arsenal of the Reaganite Right , “ freedom , ” like “ taxes ” and many other crucial words , means , as in the case of Humpty Dumpty , whatever they choose it to .
Grenada was the perfect war as far as many conservatives ( and apparently much of the American public ) were concerned : it was quick and easy to win , with virtually no risk of loss , and allowed ample opportunities to promote the military ( and their Commander - in - Chief ) as heroes while bragging up the victory on television – in short , allowing the U.S. to glory in its status as a bully .
( It helped eradicate the awful memory of Vietnam , which was the perfect war for American centrist liberals : virtually impossible to win , horribly expensive in terms of men and property – and best of all , it could go on forever without resolution , like the War on Poverty , fueling their sense of guilt while providing safe but exciting jobs for members of their techno - bureaucratic class . )
While the American masses do not want war with Russia or even aid to the bandit Contras , they do want an ever - expanding military and other aggravated symbols of a “ strong , ” “ tough ” America , an America that will , John Wayne - like , stomp on teeny pests like Commie Grenada , or , perhaps , any very small island that might possess the tone and the ideology of the Ayatollah .
Setting the Stage : The Anti-Government Rebellion of the 1970s
I am convinced that the historic function of Ronald Reagan was to co-opt , eviscerate and ultimately destroy the substantial wave of anti-governmental , and quasi-libertarian , sentiment that erupted in the U.S. during the 1970s .
Did he perform this task consciously ?
Surely too difficult a feat for a man barely compos .
No , Reagan was wheeled into performing this task by his Establishment handlers .
The task of co-optation needed to be done because the 1970s , particularly 1973 – 75 , were marked by an unusual and striking conjunction of crisis – crises that fed on each other to lead to a sudden and cumulative disillusionment with the federal government .
It was this symbiosis of anti-government reaction that led me to develop my “ case for libertarian optimism ” during the mid-1970 ’s , in the expectation of a rapid escalation of libertarian influence in America .
1973 –74 saw the abject failure of the Nixon wage - price control program , and the development of something Keynesians assumed could never happen : the combination of double - digit inflation and a severe recession .
High unemployment and high inflation happened again , even more intensely , during the greater recession of 1979 – 82 .
Since Keynesianism rests on the idea that government should pump in spending during recessions and take out spending during inflationary booms , what happens when both occur at the same time ?
As Rand would say : Blankout !
There is no answer .
And so , there was disillusionment in the government ’s handling of the macro-economy , deepening during the accelerating inflation of the 1970s and the beginnings of recession in 1979 .
At the same time , people began to be fed up , increasingly and vocally , with high taxes : income taxes , property taxes , sales taxes , you name it .
Especially in the West , an organized tax rebel movement developed , with its own periodicals and organizations
However misguided strategically , the spread of the tax rebellion signaled a growing disillusion with big government .
I was privileged to be living in California during the election year of 1978 , when Proposition 13 was passed .
It was a genuinely inspiring sight .
In the face of hysterical opposition and smears from the entire California Establishment Democratic and Republican , Big Business and labor , academia , economists , and all of the press the groundswell for Prop 13 burgeoned .
Everyone was against it but the people .
If the eventual triumph of Ronald Reagan is the best case against “ libertarian populism , ” Prop. 13 was the best case in its favor .

Also exhilarating was the smashing defeat of US imperialism in Vietnam in 1975 – exhilarating because this first loss of a war by the United States , many of us believed , was bound to get Americans to rethink the disastrous warmongering bipartisan foreign policy that had plagued us since the unlamented days of Woodrow Wilson .
On the civil liberties front , the de facto legalization of marijuana was a sign that the nonsense of drug prohibition would soon be swept away .
( Ye gods !
Was that only a decade ago ? )
Inflationary recession ; high taxes ; prohibition laws ; defeat in foreign war ; across the board , the conditions seemed admirable for a growing and triumphant libertarianism .
And to top it off , the Watergate crisis ( my particular favorite ) destroyed the trust of the American masses in the Presidency .
For the first time in over a hundred years , the concept of impeachment of the President became , first thinkable , and then a living and glorious process .
For a while , I feared that Jimmy Carter , with his lovable cardigan sweater , would restore Americans ’ faith in their president , but soon that fear proved groundless .
Surely , it is no accident that it was precisely in this glorious and sudden anti-government surge that libertarian ideas and libertarian scholarship began to spread rapidly in the United States .
And it was in 1971 that the tiny Libertarian Party emerged , in 1972 that its first , embryonic presidential candidacy was launched , and 1973 when its first important race was run , for mayor of New York City .
The Libertarian Party continued to grow rapidly , almost exponentially , during the 1970s , reaching a climax with the Clark campaign for governor of California during the Prop 13 year of 1978 , and with the Clark campaign for the Presidency in 1980 .
The morning my first article on libertarianism appeared in the New York Times in 1971 , a very bright editor at Macmillan , Tom Mandel , called me and asked me to write a book on the subject ( it was to become For a New Liberty ) .
Not a libertarian himself , Mandel told me that he believed that libertarianism would become a very important ideology in a few years – and he turned out to be right .
So libertarianism was on a roll in the 1970s .
And then Something Happened .
Enter the Neocons
What happened was Ronald Wilson Blithering Reagan .
Obviously Reagan did not suddenly descend out of the clouds in 1980 .
He had been the cherished candidate of the conservative movement , its chosen route to power , ever since Goldwater ’s defeat .
Goldwater was too blunt and candid , too much an unhandleable Real Person .
What was needed was a lovable , manipulable icon .
Moreover , Goldwater ’s principles were too hard - edged : he was way too much a domestic libertarian , and he was too much an eager warmonger .
Both his libertarianism and his passion for nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union scared the bejesus out of the American masses , as well as the more astute leadership of the conservative movement .
A reconstituted conservative movement would have to drop any libertarian ideology or concrete policies , except to provide a woolly and comfortable mood for suitably gaseous anti-government rhetoric and an improved foreign policy that would make sure that many more billions would go into the military - industrial complex , to step up global pressure against Communism , but avoiding an actual nuclear war .
This last point was important :
As much as they enjoy the role of the bully , neither the Establishment nor the American people want to risk nuclear war , which might , after all , blow them up as well .
Once again , Ronnie Reagan looked like the Answer .
Two important new ingredients entered into , and helped reshape , the conservative movement during the mid 1970’s .
One was the emergence of a small but vocal and politically powerful group of neo-conservatives ( neocons ) , who were able , in a remarkably short time , to seize control of the think tanks , the opinion - molding institutions , and finally the politics , of the conservative movement .
As ex-liberals , the neocons were greeted as important new converts from the enemy .
More importantly , as ex-Trotskyites , the neocons were veteran politicos and organizers , schooled in Marxian cadre organizing and in manipulating the levers of power .
They were shrewdly eager to place their own people in crucial opinion molding and money - raising positions , and in ousting those not willing to submit to the neocon program .
Understanding the importance of financial support , the neocons knew how to sucker Old Right businessmen into giving them the monetary levers at their numerous foundations and think tanks .
In contrast to free - market economists , for example , the neocons were eager to manipulate patriotic symbols and ethical doctrines , doing the microequivalent of Reagan and Bush ’s wrapping themselves in the American Flag .
Wrapping themselves , also , in such patriotic symbols as The Framers and the Constitution , as well as Family Values , the neocons were easily able to outflank free - market types and keep them narrowly confined to technical economic issues .
In short the neocons were easily able to seize the moral and patriotic “ high ground . ”
Americau2019s Great De ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 4.93 Buy New $ 17.99 ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
The only group willing and able to challenge the neocons on their own moralizing on philosophic turf was , of course , the tiny handful of libertarians ; and outright moral libertarianism , with its opposition to statism , theocracy , and foreign war , could never hope to get to first base with conservative businessmen , who , even at the best of times during the Old Right era , had never been happy about individual personal liberty , ( e.g. allowing prostitution , pornography , homosexuality , or drugs ) or with the libertarians ’ individualism and conspicuous lack of piety toward the Pentagon , or toward the precious symbol of the Nation - State , the US flag .
The neocons were ( and remain today ) New Dealers , as they frankly describe themselves , remarkably without raising any conservative eyebrows .
They are what used to be called , in more precise ideological days , “ extreme right - wing Social Democrats . ”
In other words , they are still Roosevelt - Truman - Kennedy - Humphrey Democrats .
Their objective , as they moved ( partially ) into the Republican Party and the conservative movement , was to reshape it to become , with minor changes , a Roosevelt - Truman - etc. movement ; that is , a liberal movement shorn of the dread “ L ” word and of post - McGovern liberalism .
To verify this point all we have to do is note how many times Roosevelt , Truman , Kennedy , et al. , properly reviled by conservatives while they were alive , are now lauded , even canonized , by the current neocon - run movement , from Ronnie Reagan on down .
And no one calls them on this Orwellian revision of conservative movement history .
As statists - to - the - core the neocons had no problem taking the lead in crusades to restrict individual liberties , whether it be in the name of rooting out “ subversives , ” or of inculcating broadly religious ( “ Judeo - Christian ” ) or moral values .
They were happy to form a cozy alliance with the Moral Majority , the mass of fundamentalists who entered the arena of conservative politics in the mid-1970s .
The fundamentalists were goaded out of their quietist millenarian dreams ( e.g. , the imminent approach of Armageddon ) and into conservative political action by the accumulation of moral permissivism in American life .
The legalization of abortion in Roe v.
Wade was undoubtedly the trigger , but this decision came on top of a cumulative effect of the sexual revolution , the militant homosexual movement “ out of the closet ” and into the streets , the spread of pornography , and the visible decay of the public school system .
The entry of the Moral Majority transformed American politics , not the least by furnishing the elite cadre of neocons with a mass base to guide and manipulate .
In economic matter , the neocons showed no more love of liberty , though this is obscured by the fact that the neocons wish to trim the welfare state of its post - Sixties excrescences , particularly since these were largely designed to aid black people .
What the neocons want is a smaller , more “ efficient ” welfare state , within which bounds they would graciously allow the market to operate .
The market is acceptable as a narrow instrumental device ; their view of private property and the free market is essentially identical to Gorbachev ’s in the Soviet Union .
Why did the Right permit itself to be bamboozled by the neocons ?
Largely because the conservatives had been inexorably drifting Stateward in the same manner .
In response to the crushing defeat of Goldwater , the Right had become ever less libertarian and less principled , and ever more attuned to the “ responsibilities ” and moderations of Power .
It is a far cry from three decades ago when Bill Buckley used to say that he too is an “ anarchist ” but that we have to put off all thoughts of liberty until the “ international Communist conspiracy ” is crushed .
Those old Chodorovian libertarian days are long gone , and so is National Review as any haven for libertarian ideas .
War mongering , militarism , theocracy , and limited “ free ” markets – this is really what Buckleyism amounted to by the late 1970s .

The burgeoning neocons were able to confuse and addle the Democratic Party by breaking with the Carter Administration , at the same time militantly and successfully pressuring it from within .
The neocons formed two noisy front groups , the Coalition for a Democratic Majority and the Committee on the Present Danger .
By means of these two interlocking groups and their unusual access to influential media , the neocons were able to pressure the Carter Administration into breaking the détente with Russia over the Afghanistan imbroglio and influencing Carter to get rid of the dove Cyrus Vance as Secretary of State and to put foreign policy power into the hands of the Polish émigré hawk and Rockefeller Trilateralist , Zbigniew Brzezinski .
In the meantime , the neocons pushed the hysterically hawkish CIA “ B ” Team report , wailing about alleged Soviet nuclear superiority , which in turn paved the way for the vast gift of spending handed to the military - industrial complex by the incoming Regan Administration .
The Afghanistan and “ B ” Team hysterias , added to the humiliation by the Ayatollah , managed not only to kill off the bedeviled Carter Administration , but also to put the boots to non-intervention and to prepare the nation for a scrapping of the “ post - Vietnam syndrome ” and a return to the warmongering of the pre-Vietnam Era .
The Reagan candidacy of 1980 was brilliantly designed to weld a coalition providing the public ’s instinctive anti-government mood with sweeping , but wholly nonspecific , libertarian rhetoric , as a convenient cover for the diametrically opposite policies designed to satisfy the savvy and politically effective members of that coalition : the neocons , the Buckleyite cons , the Moral Majority , the Rockefellers , the military - industrial complex , and the various Establishment special interests always clustering at the political trough .
Intellectual Corruption
In the face of the stark record , how were the Reaganites able to get away with it ?
Where did Ronnie get his thick coat of Teflon ?
Why was he able to follow statist policies and yet convince everyone , including many alleged libertarians , that he was successfully pursuing a “ revolution ” to get government off our backs ?
The essential answer was provided a century ago by Lysander Spooner .
Why does the public obey the State , and go further to endorse statist policies that benefit the Power Elite at the public ’s own expense ?
The answer , wrote Spooner , is that the State is supported by three powerful groups : knaves , who know what is going on and benefit from State rule ; dupes , who are fooled into thinking that State rule is in their and everyone else ’s interest ; and cowards , who know the truth but are afraid to proclaim that the emperor has no clothes .
I think we can refine Spooner ’s analysis and merge the Knave and Coward categories ; after all , the renegade sellout confronts the carrot and the stick : the carrot of wealth , cushy jobs , and prestige if he goes along with the Emperor ; and the stick of scorn , exclusion from wealth , prestige , and jobs – and perhaps worse – if he fails to go along .
The reason that Reagan got away with it – in addition to his aw - shucks “ lovability ” – is that various powerful groups were either duped or knave - cowardly corrupted into hailing his alleged triumphs and deep - sixing his evident failures .
First , the powerful opinion - molding media .
It is conventional wisdom that media people are biased in favor of liberalism , No doubt .
But that is not important , because the media , especially elite media who have the most to lose , are also particularly subject to the knave / coward syndrome .
If they pander to Reaganism , they get the approval of the deluded masses , their customers , and they get the much - sought - after access to the President and to other big - wigs in government .
And access means scoops , carefully planted exclusive leaks , etc .
Any sort of effective opposition to the President means , on the other hand , loss of access ; the angering of Reagan - deluded masses ; and also the angering of their bosses , the owners of the press and television , who are far more conservative than their journalist employees .
One of Reagan ’s most notable achievements was his emasculation of the liberal media because of his personal popularity with the masses .
Note , for example , the wimpy media treatment of Iran - Contra as compared to their glorious attack on Watergate .
If this is liberal media bias , then the liberals need to be saved from their friends .

If the media were willing to go along with Reaganite duplicity and hokum , then so were our quasi-libertarian intellectual leaders .
It is true of the libertarian - inclined masses as it has been always true of the conservative masses : they tend to be not too swift in the upper story .
During the late 1970s , libertarian intellectuals and free - market economists were growing in number , but they were very few , and they had not yet established institutions with firm ties to journalistic and mass opinion .
Hence , the libertarian mood , but not the informed thought , of the masses , was ready for co-optation , especially if led by a charismatic , beloved President .
But we must not under weigh the importance of the traitorous role performed by quasi-libertarian intellectuals and free - market economists during the Reagan years .
While their institutions were small and relatively weak , the power and consistency of libertarian thought had managed to bring them considerable prestige and political influence by 1980 – especially since they offered an attractive and consistent alternative to a statist system that was breaking down on all fronts .
But talk about your Knaves !
In the history of ideological movements , there have always been people willing to sell their souls and their principles .
But never in history have so many sold out for so pitifully little .
Hordes of libertarian and free - market intellectuals and activists rushed to Washington to whore after lousy little jobs , crummy little grants , and sporadic little conferences .
It is bad enough to sell out ; it is far worse to be a two - bit whore .
And worst of all in this sickening spectacle were those who went into the tank without so much as a clear offer : betraying the values and principles of a lifetime in order to position themselves in hopes of being propositioned .
And so they wriggled around the seats of power in Washington .
The intellectual corruption spread rapidly , in proportion to the height and length of jobs in the Reagan Administration .
Lifelong opponents of budget deficits remarkably began to weave sophisticated and absurd apologias , now that the great Reagan was piling them up , claiming , very much like the hated left - wing Keynesians of yore , that “ deficits do n’t matter . ”
Shorn of intellectual support , the half - formed libertarian instincts of the American masses remained content with Reaganite rhetoric , and the actual diametrically opposite policies got lost in the shuffle .
Reagan ’s Legacy
Has the Reagan Administration done nothing good in its eight ghastly years on earth , you might ask ?
Yes , it has done one good thing ; it has repealed the despotic 55 - mile - per - hour highway speed limit .
And that is it .
As the Gipper , at bloody long last , goes riding off into the sunset , he leaves us with a hideous legacy .
He has succeeded in destroying the libertarian public mood of the late 1970 ’s , and replaced it with fatuous and menacing patriotic symbols of the Nation - State , especially The Flag , which he first whooped up in his vacuous reelection campaign in 1984 , aided by the unfortunate coincidence of the Olympics being held at Los Angeles .
( Who will soon forget the raucous baying of the chauvinist mobs : “ USA ! USA ! ” every time some American came in third in some petty event ? )
He has succeeded in corrupting libertarian and free - market intellectuals and institutions , although in Ronnie ’s defense it must be noted that the fault lies with the corrupted and not with the corrupter .
It is generally agreed by political analysts that the ideological mood of the public , after eight years of Reaganism , is in support of economic liberalism ( that is , an expanded welfare state ) , and social conservatism ( that is , the suppression of civil liberties and the theocratic outlawing of immoral behavior ) .
And , on foreign policy , of course , they stand for militaristic chauvinism .
After eight years of Ronnie , the mood of the American masses is to expand the goodies of the welfare - warfare state ( though not to increase taxes to pay for these goodies ) , to swagger abroad and be very tough with nations that can’t fight back , and to crack down on the liberties of groups they do n’t like or whose values or culture they disagree with .
It is a decidedly unlovely and unlibertarian wasteland , this picture of America 1989 , and who do we have to thank for it ?
Several groups : the neocons who organized it ; the vested interests and the Power Elite who run it ; the libertarians and free marketeers who sold out for it ; and above all , the universally beloved Ronald Wilson Reagan , Who Made It Possible .
As he rides off into retirement , glowing with the love of the American public , leaving his odious legacy behind , one wonders what this hallowed dimwit might possibly do in retirement that could be at all worthy of the rest of his political career .
What very last triumph are we supposed to “ win for the Gipper ” ?
He has tipped his hand : I have just read that as soon as he retires , the Gipper will go on a banquet tour on behalf of the repeal of the 22nd ( “ Anti- Third Term ” )
Amendment – the one decent thing the Republicans have accomplished .
In the last four decades .
The 22nd Amendment was a well - deserved retrospective slap at FDR .
It is typical of the depths to which the GOP has fallen in the last few years that Republicans have been actually muttering about joining the effort to repeal this amendment .
If they are successful , then Ronald Reagan might be elected again , and reelected well into the 21st century .
In our age of High Tech , I ’m sure that his mere physical death could easily have been overcome by his handlers and media mavens .
Ronald Reagan will be suitably mummified , trotted out in front of a giant American flag , and some puppet master would have gotten him to give his winsome headshake and some ventriloquist would have imitated the golden tones : “ We - e- ell … ” ( Why not ?
After all , the living reality of the last four years has not been a helluva lot different . )
Perhaps , after all , Ronald Reagan and almost all the rest of us will finally get our fondest wish : the election forever and ever of the mummified con King Ronnie .
Now there is a legacy for our descendants !
