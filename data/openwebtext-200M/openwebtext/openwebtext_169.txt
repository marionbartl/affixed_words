Officers said the crackdown reflected an awareness by top Army and Defense Department officials that desertions , which occurred among more than 1 percent of the active - duty force in 2000 for the first time since the post - Vietnam era , were in a sustained upswing again after ebbing in 2003 , the first year of the Iraq war .
At the same time , the increase highlights a cycle long known to Army researchers : as the demand for soldiers increases during a war , desertions rise and the Army tends to lower enlistment standards , recruiting more people with questionable backgrounds who are far more likely to become deserters .
In the 2006 fiscal year , 3,196 soldiers deserted , the Army said , a figure that has been climbing since the 2004 fiscal year , when 2,357 soldiers absconded .
In the first quarter of the current fiscal year , which began Oct. 1 , 871 soldiers deserted , a rate that , if it stays on pace , would produce 3,484 desertions for the fiscal year , an 8 percent increase over 2006 .
The Army said the desertion rate was within historical norms , and that the surge in prosecutions , which are at the discretion of unit commanders , was not a surprise given the impact that absent soldiers can have during wartime .
“ The nation is at war , and the Army treats the offense of desertion more seriously , ” Maj .
Anne D. Edgecomb , an Army spokeswoman , said .
“ The Army ’s leadership will take whatever measures they believe are appropriate if they see a continued upward trend in desertion , in order to maintain the health of the force . ”
Army studies and interviews also suggest a link between the rising rate of desertions and the expanding use of moral waivers to recruit people with poor academic records and low - level criminal convictions .
At least 1 in 10 deserters surveyed after returning to the Army from 2002 to mid-2004 required a waiver to enter the service , a report by the Army Research Institute found .
“ We ’re enlisting more dropouts , people with more law violations , lower test scores , more moral issues , ” said a senior noncommissioned officer involved in Army personnel and recruiting .
“ We ’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to get people to join . ”
( Army officials agreed to discuss the issue on the condition that they not be quoted by name . )
If Judge Samuel Alito Jr.'s confirmation hearings lacked drama , apart from his wife 's bizarrely over - covered crying jag , it is because they confirmed the obvious .
Judge Alito is exactly the kind of legal thinker President Bush wants on the Supreme Court .
He has a radically broad view of the president 's power , and a radically narrow view of Congress 's power .
He has long argued that the Constitution does not protect abortion rights .
He wants to reduce the rights and liberties of ordinary Americans , and has a history of tilting the scales of justice against the little guy .
As senators prepare to vote on the nomination , they should ask themselves only one question : will replacing Sandra Day O'Connor with Judge Alito be a step forward for the nation , or a step backward ?
Instead of Justice O'Connor 's pragmatic centrism , which has kept American law on a steady and well - respected path , Judge Alito is likely to bring a movement conservative 's approach to his role and to the Constitution .
Judge Alito may be a fine man , but he is not the kind of justice the country needs right now .
Senators from both parties should oppose his nomination .
It is likely that Judge Alito was chosen for his extreme views on presidential power .
The Supreme Court , with Justice O'Connor 's support , has played a key role in standing up to the Bush administration 's radical view of its power , notably that it can hold , indefinitely and without trial , anyone the president declares an " unlawful enemy combatant . "
' It certainly left me feeling good about the NHS .
I do believe it is a great institution '

Doctors in the British system are very efficient in terms of the number of people they see , but they spend a lot less time with each patient than in the US '
Karim Ahmed , 34 , A&E registrar
I really enjoyed the film , but in terms of the health service it is obviously showing just the very best side of our NHS and the very worst parts of the US system .
I came away feeling that what we have here , the basic principle of the NHS , is a very good thing , and that it is up to all of us to work really hard to make it better .
We need to concentrate on getting the quality up , but I think that is achievable .
Of course we do n't fund the NHS properly .
Americans pay far more for their health service than we do ; the tax we pay here is really not much compared with what they pay in insurance premiums .
In lots of ways we are a long way behind the US system .
For example , we are pretty good at accessibility - doctors in the British system are very efficient in terms of the number of people they see - but they spend a lot less time with each patient than in the US .
And my impression is that there are generally more resources per patient in the US than in the UK : more doctors , more nurses , more beds .
The problem they have , of course , is that access to all that is just not equitable .
Although there is a trend in terms of our overall economic ideas towards America there would be a lot of resistance to moving to an American system .
The government may look towards it for getting extra funding in the short term , but there is a huge amount of resistance from the public and the NHS itself .
Even though there are advantages in terms of pay and conditions people are still staunchly supportive of the NHS and worry about private finance initiatives .

' I do n't think we 'll end up going to the extremes of the American model ; people simply would n't put up with it '
Zhaleh Khaleeli , 32 , researcher
Overall the film is a good thing - Moore is bringing a lot of issues to the attention of the American public that they probably would not think about much otherwise .
But it does n't translate that well over here .
We 're used to a bit more sophistication , we want both sides of the picture .
As far as the NHS goes , you can see he is glossing over all sorts of problems .
That said , it makes you realise how lucky we are .
We all moan about the NHS , but watching this film makes you realise how fortunate you are .
By and large most UK doctors feel at home with the NHS model ; you can treat whoever needs the treatment , without any monetary considerations .
Doctors in the US must have to compromise their ethics ; it would be hugely frustrating for us to work in an environment where you have to turn people away because they do n't have the right insurance .
And the other side of that coin is that in the US people who have good insurance are often over - investigated , to make money .
Of course there are many areas for potential improvement in the NHS ; there has been an emphasis on making things " appear " better , by cutting waiting lists and improving performance targets and so on , rather than on improving medical care .
And there are big problems building up because of the overhaul of medical training ; a lot of people are worried that patient care will be compromised by faster training and less experience .
I think there is a danger that we could go more like the American system .
There 's certainly much more private involvement in the NHS now , and it has n't been very successful .
I hope people will resist any more moves in that direction .
But I do n't think we 'll end up going to the extremes of the American model ; people simply would n't put up with it .

' The NHS system where you pay £ 6.65 for virtually any drug is pretty amazing '
Muna Ahmed , 32 , clinical genetics specialist
You get the point of the film pretty quickly : the US system is terrible unless you 've got lots of money .
I do n't think I could be a doctor in a system like that of the US .
The film reinforced my view that the NHS is a world - class system and I 'm really proud of it and really proud to be working in it .
But I can see that even for someone very pro-NHS , Moore 's portrayal went a little over the top .
It was very rose - tinted .
But people do get very good treatment in the NHS .
The service is absolutely fantastic .
People complain , but it 's usually about the waiting ; once they 've actually seen someone you hardly hear any complaints .
A system where you pay £ 6.65 for virtually any drug is pretty amazing .
From the doctor 's point of view it is not bad either ; there certainly are GPs who earn £ 85,000 and have the kind of lifestyle of the NHS GP in Sicko .
One thing I would say , though : all those caricatured American fears about " socialised medicine " , with the government telling doctors where they have to go and what they have to specialise in , is becoming true here - the new applications system [ for junior doctors applying for training ] is an absolute nightmare .
You have very little choice now .
It was n't like that in the past , and in the long run the NHS will suffer for it .
I'm London born and bred , and I have no option but to move to Manchester for my career .

' No one who works in the NHS would pretend it 's perfect '
Ben Maguire , 28 , capital programme manager
Moore does paint a very black picture of the US system and a very rosy one of the NHS .
Even if we recognise what a great institution the NHS is , no one who works in it would pretend it 's perfect .
There are funding problems ; there are issues around schemes such as PBR [ payment by results ] and referral thresholds and so on .
Overall , I feel that in the US it often seems as if businessmen are trying to run medical clinics , and in Britain it can sometimes seem as if clinicians are trying to run businesses .
I 'm sure there 's a happy medium to be found .

' I do n't know how American doctors can work in a system that means they have to turn people away '
Haseena Iqbal , 30 , GP
The film was an amazing eye - opener .
Of course you see things in the media , but you really get no inkling of what the US system is really like .
It is astonishing that a country can be so advanced in some ways yet its health system can be so backward .
Moore 's basic point is very simple : the NHS is free at the point of use , and crucially , as a patient you will get seen .
I do n't know how American doctors can work in a system that means they have to turn people away .
I 've always thought the NHS was a very , very good system but , in fact , the way it 's going , plenty of people are beginning to lose confidence in it .
The core concepts are still absolutely valid , but doctors , for example , are beginning to get very disgruntled about the way jobs are allocated .
You always used to be able to choose what specialism you wanted to pursue , what area you wanted to work in ; these days government control over doctors ' careers is increasing , as is the paperwork and the bureaucracy .

' I really had no idea that US patients can just get kicked out of hospital , put in a taxi and dumped on the street '
Shazia Jalali , 29 , GP
Some of the film was absolutely unbelievable .
I found it really hard to understand how you can have such a different ethos in the same profession .
You could never imagine anyone in a British accident and emergency department saying to a patient , ' You 'll have to choose between us reattaching your ring finger and your middle finger according to how much you can afford . "
And I really had no idea that patients can just get kicked out of hospital , put in a taxi and dumped on the street .
It was really tragic .
But it certainly made me feel very good about the NHS , and about our society in general .
We may moan , but by comparison Britain is so much more fair and egalitarian .
It also made me feel very proud to work in the NHS : yes , there are waiting lists ; yes , there are funding issues ; yes , there are problems , particularly with patients with non life - threatening conditions .
I have a patient who has been waiting for a hearing aid for three years and that is just unacceptable .
But they are all relative .
On the other hand , American fears of " socialised medicine " and what it means for doctors ' freedom to choose what they want to do and where they want to do it are beginning to be realised here .
Nobody used to complain about not having a lifestyle choice ; now they do .
It is also true that there are some complex changes being made to the NHS with very little forward planning or thinking on the part of the government .
For example , in Brent over the past couple of years a very large number of our new patients have been from eastern Europe , which is fine except that Brent council chose that moment to withdraw interpretation services .
That kind of thing is just depressing .

' I much prefer the British system .
In spades .
We have huge advantages , and a lot of people get treatment who would n't otherwise '
David Curtis , 47 , consultant psychiatrist
The film was very one - sided , but a number of the points it made were valid , such as the advantages of a government - managed universal healthcare system as opposed to a patchier system provided by HMOs [ health maintenance organisations , which provide healthcare to consumers for a monthly fee ] .
Healthcare can be so expensive that an individual can't really afford to manage that risk themselves .
What we saw with the insurance companies is that they were only insuring low - risk people ; in a government , tax - funded system , the risk is spread out evenly .
Having said that , the Republican party had perfectly valid objections too : do you want the government to be in charge of healthcare provision ?
Do you want the government deciding what treatment you can get , where a doctor can live , where a doctor can work ?
What we have now is a situation where provision of healthcare depends on political will .
Take some of the American arguments about whether or not a treatment can be provided - one can see similar arguments in a government - funded system .
There is still a drive to contain costs , and though it is not as intense , it does not disappear completely .
I much prefer the British system .
In spades .
We have huge advantages , and a lot of people get treatment who would n't otherwise .
We have more emphasis on preventative medicine , so we have better overall levels of health .
It is true that Moore chose an easy target , because he used acute casualty departments - we 've always known the NHS is good at casualty .
If he had done this film 10 years ago and someone had an arthritic hip , he would have heard a completely different story .
Things have improved an awful lot , although one of the areas where you still see the longest waits is in psychotherapy .
I think that is one of the places where it is going to be most difficult to deliver target times , and where the biggest change will come .
In America , you could see an analyst tomorrow , if your HMO would pay for it .
In Britain there are quite long waits for psychological treatment .
A lot of good stuff about the NHS did not come through either .
For example , working in psychiatry often involves working in a multidisciplinary team in the community - doctors , nurses and social workers thinking of every aspect of a patient 's wellbeing .
I think Britain 's welfare state does a very good job of that sort of thing , and I 'm very proud of that .
There was some talk about Kaiser Permanente ( a US healthcare corporation ) here a while ago .
Some people talked favourably about the way these companies work and said the NHS should work like that and it was much cheaper .
But doctors have less clinical freedom and there is an expectation that the patient should be out after an operation in three to five days and it is a problem if they are not .
I think this is potentially worrying .
British doctors feel unease about that and feel they would be under undue pressure if it was adopted .

' The American system seems good only for the rich '

I found it shocking how bad the American system is .
I knew they had challenges but I did n't realise you could be refused treatment .
It seems unethical to me .

' Especially in emergency situations , the NHS is really good .
Kids are generally well looked after too '
Stephen Whyte , 22 , hospital pharmacist
I 've always thought the NHS was a really good thing but when you see the American health system against ours , it really makes you feel grateful for what we 've got .
People are quick to complain about things , especially waiting times and things like that , but when you get it into perspective - for example the woman in the film with broken ribs who went to hospital , and just because she did n't have insurance she was flung out on to the street - you would never see that here .
Especially in emergency situations , the NHS is really good .
Kids are generally well looked after too .
Working for the NHS is n't the most financially viable thing to do : I 've recently qualified and a newly qualified pharmacist can make £ 15,000 more working at Boots or Lloyds .
It was a deliberate choice for me - I think job satisfaction is more important than money in the bank at the end of the day .
I think people should watch Sicko - especially people who are sceptical of the NHS .
Hopefully it will make them proud of the system we have instead of constantly running it down .

' Thank God for the NHS .
Thank God the NHS did n't go the American way '
Ehsan Khondaker , 33 , GP
It 's incredible in this day and age , when we look to America for so much in the way of inspiration and ideas , that it should be ranked 37th in the world when it comes to healthcare .
It should n't be in that position .
Thank God for the NHS .
Thank God the NHS did n't go the American way .
I see quite a lot of privatisation in my job as a GP - in referrals , in prescribing .
GPs ' surgeries are increasingly run along privatised lines .
It worries me a little bit , but I think the basis of general practice is still intact .
The doctor has clinical autonomy , and patients have a say to a large extent .
They still have a voice .
A lot of complaints about the NHS are to do with the amount of bureaucracy , which is a mess because of decisions made by this government and previous governments .
There are still inequalities in healthcare .
For example , waiting lists - we tell patients that because of the strain on resources they have to wait many months .
But then you find other patients who are still somehow getting to the top of the waiting list because they can afford to .
I know of patients who can see a consultant privately and still end up high up on an NHS waiting list .
In very affluent areas where I 've worked that can happen .
It 's not as equal as it looks .
I do n't think there 's anything positive to learn from the American system .
Too much power lies in the hands of the HMOs and pharmaceutical companies - patients really are afraid and have no voice - and that 's something I would not like to see happen here .
I am an NHS doctor , but I am contracted through a company called Chilvers McCrea .
It is a private healthcare company and it has taken over 30 practices from the primary care trusts .
For doctors , it makes no difference .
I think the idea came from UnitedHealth , an American corporation .
It started the process in this country .
UnitedHealth has now withdrawn , but British companies are still doing it .
From a clinician 's point of view nothing has changed , but patients are mistrustful about what these companies are after .
They have not been around that long .
I think we should be worrying about American influence .
It is inching towards the American system .
It is a very slow process , but ultimately it will become more and more acceptable .
I think it is something we should fear .

' The US system really does have the best , the newest , the most advanced equipment and treatments available '
Mariam Pourshoushtari , 28 , American patient
I fear many Americans will react defensively to this film , and British audiences may see this as another excuse to bash America .
Personally , I 've had good experiences with the US health system .
I had meningitis when I was 20 and I happened to be in Minneapolis , which at that time was one of the only places in the world to have a brand - new machine that ended up saving my life .
Of course I was maxed out on my insurance within about three weeks , but the government agreed to pick up my bills .
I have also had very good experiences on the NHS , but then they did n't have to save my life - they 've been involved in the clean - up stuff , as it were .
The NHS is on a tightrope .
Free healthcare means more British people will go to a doctor when perhaps they do n't really need to ; GPs are like gatekeepers , they need to asses the motivations of the person in front of them rather than their medical need .
The specialists , when you get to see them , are great .
As an ideology , universal free healthcare is obviously preferable .
But the practicalities mean that the US and British systems are basically equal : medical care can't advance without money , and in a universal system that 's always going to be a scarce commodity .
As it stands , the NHS is unsustainable - maybe not now but at some stage in the future , it will hit a wall .
Doctors in the US system are n't corrupt or bad .
They are still very good doctors trying to help and save lives .
The problem is that the insurance companies are trying to tie their hands , trying to get out of paying for the care .
But they can only get away with that because the government has pretty much stepped out of healthcare .
The huge advantage of an element of privatisation is that it does bring in the money : the US system really does have the best , the newest , the most advanced equipment and treatments available .
It 's just that that private element has to be properly controlled and regulated , there have to be limits .

' Moore proves something that should be self - evident , that healthcare should be free , and is one of the basic pillars of a decent society '
Nikos Gorgoraptis , 26 , junior doctor
In the film , Michael Moore proves something that should be self - evident , that healthcare should be free , and is one of the basic pillars of a decent society .
Anything that 's not based on that one idea is immoral .
These things should be taken for granted but they are not .
What comes through from the film is that there are still some basic public benefits in Europe as opposed to the US , but having worked in this country , and also in France and Greece , I know that things are slowly but steadily changing towards privatisation , and it 's really sad .
I would n't expect a total abolition of public healthcare during my lifetime - at least I hope not .
But public healthcare is becoming less good in Europe in general , and even public hospitals are sometimes managed as private enterprises , with medical decisions based on cost , which is not always moral .
But we are still nowhere near the image presented by Moore of the US .

' The NHS has got its problems but , my God , it 's one of the best things in the world '

Before I saw the film , I had kind of thought , " Oh well , America 's got this private system , and there 's health insurance , and you pay and get treated . "
But when I saw what it was actually like , I was completely horrified .
I was telling my partner about the film when I came home , and she said , " God , you 're livid , are n't you ? "

' This film will alert people to the dangers of not cherishing and protecting the NHS from the ruthlessness and the worst excesses of the American system '
Karen Jennings , 54 , head of health for Unison
The film really awakens you to what is extraordinary about the NHS , that we have a health system that we do need to cherish and protect .
It blew out of the water some of the negative mythology about the NHS .
For example , doctors in the US are taught that NHS doctors are not paid very well , and that the system within which they work is not exciting or dynamic .
Yet doctors in the UK were interviewed and it is clear that they earned a good income and lived very comfortable lives .
At the same time , the British public have a better infant mortality rate , a British person lives longer than the average US citizen , and doctors here are incentivised in terms of things such as public health .
The film brings into perspective what happens when you have a system that is fragmented , that is for profit , in what is really a very flawed market and business environment .
It is important for Americans to see what is possible in countries where the systems are based on solidarity , a public sector ethos , and [ where people ] have principles about these things .
It made me feel very proud that Britain was portrayed as a society that cares about the vulnerable .
The global situation around the marketisation of health means there is huge pressure to open up the NHS to provide profits .
It is something we should resist as much as possible and this film will alert people to the dangers of not cherishing and protecting the NHS from the ruthlessness and the worst excesses of the American system .

' It does seem illogical to give undue attention to a country where the percentage of GDP spent on health exceeds most others , whereas its outcomes - such as life expectation - are well down the league '
Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians
It is very hard to judge the accuracy of the picture painted of the United States .
I suspect there is more than an element of truth in it .
Similarly , although the picture of the NHS was rosy , I thought it was reasonably fair - we are proud of the fact that our healthcare is free at the point of delivery .
Certainly there are always concerns about the rising costs of healthcare , and American models have been looked at in order to try to limit costs .
But I think that all the models looked at in this country do stick to the principle of being free at the point of delivery , or certainly most of the models do .
Some of the models of care that have been looked at do change the way healthcare is delivered quite fundamentally , but they do n't move away from that fundamental principle .
Our discussions are much more about what should be available on the NHS to everyone , rather than who can afford treatment .
Every new form of treatment is scrutinised very closely as to whether it should be available , but availability is not judged solely on cost - it is judged on effectiveness .
We have n't got it absolutely right , but the way we look at new healthcare developments , particularly drugs , through the National Institute of Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) , is a model admired across the world .
In my view , undue attention has been paid to some aspects of healthcare policy in the US by UK government in recent years when there are many examples nearer home , within Europe , of alternative models of healthcare .
All systems , wherever the funding comes from ( taxation , personal insurance , etc ) have been struggling with cost containment as technology and , in particular , new drug developments - especially cancer drugs - add to rising expectation and patient knowledge of what is available .
It does seem illogical to give undue attention to a country where the percentage of GDP spent on health exceeds most others whereas its outcomes - such as life expectation - are well down the league .
That does n't mean that we should n't examine their solutions , but not to the exclusion of those of many other countries that are faring better .

From After Downing Street
By David Swanson
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has said that if three more Congress Members get behind impeachment he will start the impeachment proceedings .
I was a guest today on Bree Walker ‘s radio show .
She ’s the progressive radio host from San Diego who purchased Cindy Sheehan ’s land from her in Crawford , Texas .
Bree attended an event on Friday in San Diego at which Congressman Conyers spoke about impeachment .
Her report was extremely interesting .
I had already heard reports that Conyers had said : “ What are we waiting for ?
Let ’s take these two guys out ! ”
But , of course , what we ’re waiting for is John Conyers .
Is he ready to act ?
It was hard to tell from that comment .
In January , Conyers spoke at a huge rally on the National Mall and declared “ We can fire them ! ” but later explained that what he meant was that we could wait for two years and Bush and Cheney ’s terms would end .
Was this week ’s remark just more empty rhetoric ?
It appears to be more than that .
Bree Walker told me , on the air , that Conyers said that all he needs is three more Congress Members backing impeachment , and he ’ll move on it , even without Pelosi .
I asked whether that meant specifically moving from 14 cosponsors of H Res 333 to 17 , or adding 3 to the larger number of Congress Members who have spoken favorably of impeachment but not all signed onto bills .
Bree said she did n’t know and that Conyers had declined to take any questions .
Either way , this target of three more members seems perfectly doable .
It ’s safe to assume , I think , that we ’re talking about impeaching Cheney first .
But , even if Conyers is talking about Bush , the target is perfectly achievable .
First , there are Congress Members like Jesse Jackson Jr. who have spoken out for impeachment but not signed onto H Res 333 .
They should be urged to act now !
Second , there are dozens of members who signed onto H Res 635 a year and a half ago , Conyers ’ bill for an investigation into grounds for impeachment , who have not signed onto H Res 333 yet .
Third , one of the excuses citizens often hear from lots of Congress Members for not signing onto articles of impeachment is that not enough of their colleagues have signed on and therefore “ we do n’t have the votes . ”
Well that just changed .
Now three more votes is all that ’s needed to get this machine rolling .
Fourth , many of the 14 Congress Members backing H Res 333 have used similar excuses to justify refraining from lobbying their colleagues to join them .
That can now end .
Our 14 leaders can do more than just put down their names .
Now , if Conyers begins impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee , we should all be clear on what that will mean .
If it is serious , it will not mean sending any subpoenas or contempt citations to the emperors ’ court .
Bush and Cheney have already repeatedly refused to comply with subpoenas .
President Richard Nixon did the same , of course , and his refusal to comply with subpoenas constituted the offense cited in one of the three Articles of Impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27 , 1974 as warranting “ impeachment and trial , and removal from office . ”
But Bush and Cheney have gone further , ordering former staffers not to comply with subpoenas , and announcing that the Justice Department will not enforce any contempt of Congress proceedings .
What the impeachment of Cheney or Bush will be is very , very fast .
It will not disrupt or distract from the important business of passing nonbinding resolutions and holding all - night gripe sessions over bills destined to be vetoed .
Impeachment in the case of Dick Cheney need not take the three months it did for Nixon or the two months it did for President Bill Clinton .
In fact , it could take a day .
Here ’s why :
Bush and Cheney ’s lies about Iraqi ties to al Qaeda are on videotape and in writing , and Bush and Cheney continue to make them to this day .
There was no al Qaeda in Iraq until the invasion .
Their claims about Iraqi weapons have been shown in every detail to have been , not mistakes , but lies .
Their threats to Iran are on videotape .
Bush being warned about Katrina and claiming he was not are on videotape .
Bush lying about illegal spying and later confessing to it are on videotape .
A federal court has ruled that spying to be a felony .
The Supreme Court has ruled Bush and Cheney ’s system of detentions unconstitutional .
Torture , openly advocated for by Bush and Cheney and their staffs , is documented by victims , witnesses , and public photographs .
Torture was always illegal and has been repeatedly recriminalized under Bush and Cheney .
Bush has reversed laws with signing statements .
Those statements are posted on the White House website , and a GAO report found that with 30 percent of Bush ’s signing statements in which he announces his right to break laws , he has in fact proceeded to break those laws .
For these and many other offenses , no investigation is needed because no better evidence is even conceivable .
This impeachment will be swift .
And it will require only a simple majority .
We already know that the Democrats can vote as a block if they want to , and that a few brave Republicans might join them .
Whether the Senate will then convict Cheney will depend on how much pressure citizens apply and how much information the House manages to force onto television sets .
The latter could be surprisingly large and substantive , since the conflict of an impeachment is certain to generate incredible ratings .
But even an acquittal would identify the Senators to be removed from office by voters in 2008 .
And Cheney ( or Bush ) would still have been 100 % impeached .
Al Gore did n’t run for president pretending he ’d never met Bill Clinton and pick Senator Joe Lieberman as a running mate because the Senate convicted Clinton ( it acquitted ) .
The timing of Conyers ’ remark may be related to the steps the White House has recently taken to assert “ unitary executive ” dictatorial power .
Bush has commuted the sentence of a subordinate who obstructed an investigation into matters involving Bush and Cheney .
And , as mentioned above , neither subpoenas nor contempt citations will go anywhere .
Impeachment is no longer merely the appropriate step that it has been for the past six years .
It is now the only tool left to the Congress for use in asserting its very existence as a functioning body of government .
But the timing is also quite helpful to the grassroots movement for impeachment , and rather symbolic .
Five years ago this Monday , the meeting was held at # 10 Downing Street that produced the Downing Street Minutes .
Over two years ago , then Ranking Member Conyers held a hearing in the basement of the Capitol , the only space the Republican leadership would allow him .
At that hearing , several Democratic Congress Members for the first time began talking about impeachment .
The witnesses at the hearing were Ambassador Joseph Wilson , attorney John Bonifaz , former CIA analyst Ray McGovern , and a then unknown gold star mother named Cindy Sheehan .
They discussed the evidence of the Downing Street documents , which added significantly to the growing body of evidence that Bush and Cheney misled the Congress about the case for war .
This Monday , Sheehan and McGovern and a great many leaders of the movements for peace and impeachment will lead a march at 10 a.m. at Arlington National Cemetery .
We will march to Congressman Conyers ’ office and ask to talk with him about impeachment .
We will refuse to leave without either a commitment to begin at once the impeachment of Cheney or Bush or both , or our arms in handcuffs .
The same day , groups in several states around the country will be sitting in and risking arrest for impeachment in the district offices of their congress members .
Not everyone will be able to take part .
But everyone can take two minutes on Monday and do two things : phone Chairman Conyers at 202-225-5126 and ask him to start the impeachment of Dick Cheney ; and phone your own Congress Member at 202-224-3121 and ask them to immediately call Conyers ’ office to express their support for impeachment .
Your Congress Member might just be one of the three needed , not just to keep us out of jail but to keep this nation from devolving into dictatorship .

A convicted child - sex offender found to have a soundproof cell in his Rosewood backyard has been evicted from Australia and returned to New Zealand .
New Zealand - born Brent Joseph Groves , 49 , is living in Wellington after he was banned from Australia in April .
Groves , who moved to Australia in 1969 , was jailed there in 2002 for drug offences and for indecently treating a child under 16 .
Morrison worked as an expert forensic psychologist in court cases
Gene Morrison , 48 , who left school with no qualifications , was described in court as a charlatan who had tricked judges , lawyers and police .
About 700 cases he worked on will now have to be re-assessed , Manchester 's Minshull Street Crown Court was told .
Morrison , of Martin Street , Hyde , was told a jail sentence was inevitable .
The court heard he was paid at least £ 250,000 in taxpayers ' money for giving apparently expert advice .
Morrison 's firm , Criminal and Forensic Investigations Bureau ( CFIB ) , was hired to give evidence in court .
I think he's a delusional character - the depths to which he sunk are unbelievable
Det Supt Martin Bottomley
His firm 's website - bearing the motto Exposing unrighteousness for the sake of righteousness - claimed he had more than 20 years experience .
Morrison admitted to police he began working as a forensic investigator in 1977 after buying certificates by post for a BSc in Forensic Science , a Masters with excellence in Forensic Investigation and a Doctorate in Criminology .
Despite this , during his trial he insisted on being called Dr Morrison .
He also told police he learned his skills from a retired West Yorkshire detective and a mysterious Mr X , a member of the Czech Republic 's defence ministry .
Morrison worked out of an office in Hyde
Morrison told police he started an Open University ( OU ) degree , but in court revealed he only actually phoned for a brochure and recorded OU programmes from BBC2 in the 1970s .
In the beginning , Morrison hired real forensic scientists to carry out handwriting and fingerprint analysis which he would pass off as his own and charge clients double .
But later he simply cut and pasted old reports together and changed details , the court heard .
Morrison 's clients included legal firms , insurance companies , private businesses and individuals .
He gave evidence in cases involving armed robbery , rape , death by dangerous driving , unexplained death and drugs offences .
' Walter Mitty '
Greater Manchester Police is sending a report to the attorney general on Morrison 's work to examine any possible miscarriages of justice .
The force is also investigating hundreds of cases .
Det Supt Martin Bottomley , speaking outside court , described Morrison as a Walter Mitty - type character .
" His professional life has been based on a web of deceit and lies and he 's fleeced many victims out of hundreds of thousands of pounds , " said the detective .
" I think he 's a delusional character .
The depths to which he sunk are unbelievable , really . "
Morrison was found guilty of 20 offences including obtaining a money transfer by deception , obtaining property by deception , perverting the course of justice and perjury .
He admitted a further two charges .
He was cleared of one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception .
The guilty verdicts followed two days of deliberation by the jury .
Judge Jeffrey Lewis remanded Morrison in custody and told him a custodial sentence was inevitable .
Morrison will be sentenced on Thursday .
In recent years , Australian - born billionaire Rupert Murdoch has used the U.S. government ’s increasingly lax media regulations to consolidate his hold over the media and wider political debate in America .
Consider Murdoch ’s empire : According to Businessweek , " his satellites deliver TV programs in five continents , all but dominating Britain , Italy , and wide swaths of Asia and the Middle East .
He publishes 175 newspapers , including the New York Post and The Times of London .
In the U.S. , he owns the Twentieth Century Fox Studio , Fox Network , and 35 TV stations that reach more than 40 % of the country …
His cable channels include fast - growing Fox News , and 19 regional sports channels .
In all , as many as one in five American homes at any given time will be tuned into a show News Corp. either produced or delivered . "
But who is the real Rupert Murdoch ?
As this report shows , he is a far - right partisan who has used his empire explicitly to pull American political debate to the right .
He is also an enabler of the oppressive tactics employed by dictatorial regimes , and a man who admits to having hidden money in tax havens .
In short , there more to Rupert Murdoch than meets the eye .
In 2003 , Rupert Murdoch told a congressional panel that his use of " political influence in our newspapers or television " is " nonsense . "
But a close look at the record shows Murdoch has imparted his far - right agenda throughout his media empire .
MURDOCH THE WAR MONGER : Just after the Iraq invasion , the New York Times reported , " The war has illuminated anew the exceptional power in the hands of Murdoch , 72 , the chairman of News Corp …
In the last several months , the editorial policies of almost all his English - language news organizations have hewn very closely to Murdoch ’s own stridently hawkish political views , making his voice among the loudest in the Anglophone world in the international debate over the American - led war with Iraq . "
The Guardian reported before the war Murdoch gave " his full backing to war , praising George Bush as acting ‘ morally ’ and ‘ correctly ’ and describing Tony Blair as ‘ full of guts ’ " for his support of the war .
Murdoch said just before the war , " We ca n’t back down now – I think Bush is acting very morally , very correctly . "
[ New York Times , 4/9/03 ; Guardian , 2/12/03 ]
MURDOCH THE NEOCONSERVATIVE : Murdoch owns the Weekly Standard , the neoconservative journal that employed key figures who pushed for war in Iraq .
As the American Journalism Review noted , the circulation of Murdoch ’s Weekly Standard " hovers at only around 65,000 .
But its voice is much louder than those numbers suggest . "
Editor Bill Kristol " is particularly adept at steering Washington policy debates by inserting himself and his views into the discussion . "
In the early weeks of the War on Terror , Kristol " shepherded a letter to President Bush , signed by 40 D.c= opinion - makers , urging a wider military engagement . "

MURDOCH THE OIL IMPERIALIST : Murdoch has acknowledged his major rationale for supporting the Iraq invasion : oil .
While both American and British politicians strenuously deny the significance of oil in the war , the Guardian of London notes , " Murdoch was n’t so reticent .
He believes that deposing the Iraqi leader would lead to cheaper oil . "
Murdoch said before the war , " The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy … would be $ 20 a barrel for oil .
That ’s bigger than any tax cut in any country . "
He buttressed this statement when he later said , " Once [ Iraq ] is behind us , the whole world will benefit from cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else . "

MURDOCH THE INTIMIDATOR : According to Agence France - Press , " Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox News Channel threatened to sue the makers of ‘ The Simpsons ’ over a parody of the channel ’s right - wing political stance …
In an interview this week with National Public Radio , Matt Groening recalled how the news channel had considered legal action , despite the fact that ‘ The Simpsons ’ is broadcast on sister network , Fox Entertainment .
According to Groening , Fox took exception took a Simpsons ’ version of the Fox News rolling news ticker which parodied the channel ’s anti-Democrat stance with headlines like ‘ Do Democrats Cause Cancer ? ’ "

MURDOCH THE NEWS EDITOR : " When The New York Post tore up its front page on Monday night to trumpet an apparent exclusive that Representative Richard A. Gephardt would be Senator John Kerry ’s running mate , the newspaper based its decision on a very high - ranking source : Rupert Murdoch , the man who controls the company that owns The Post , an employee said yesterday .
The Post employee demanded anonymity , saying senior editors had warned that those who discussed the Gephardt gaffe with other news organizations would lose their jobs . "
[ NY Times , 7/9/04 ]
Just as Fox claims to be " fair and balanced , " Rupert Murdoch claims to stay out of partisan politics .
But he has made his views quite clear – and used his media empire to implement his wishes .
As a former News Corp. executive told Fortune Magazine , Murdoch " hungered for the kind of influence in the United States that he had in England and Australia " and that meant " part of our political strategy [ in the U.S. ] was the New York Post and the creation of Fox News and the Weekly Standard . "
MURDOCH THE BUSH SUPPORTER : Murdoch told Newsweek before the war , Bush " will either go down in history as a very great president or he ’ll crash and burn .
I ’m optimistic it will be the former by a ratio of 2 to 1 … One senses he is a man of great character and deep humility . "
[ Newsweek , 2/17/03 ]
MURDOCH THE BUSH FAMILY EMPLOYER : As Slate reports , Murdoch " put George W. Bush cousin John Ellis in charge of [ Fox ’s ] Election Night vote - counting operation : Ellis made Fox the first network to declare Bush the victor " even as the New Yorker reported that Ellis spent the evening discussing the election with George W. and Jeb Bush .
After the election , Fox bragged that it attracted 6.8 million viewers on Election Night , meaning Ellis was in a key position to tilt the election for President Bush .

MURDOCH THE MIXER OF BUSINESS AND POLITICS : James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly points out that most of Murdoch ’s actions " are consistent with the use of political influence for corporate advantage . "
In other words , he uses his publications to advance a political agenda that will make him money .
The New York Times reports that in 2001 , for example , The Sun , Britain ’s most widely read newspaper , followed Murdoch ’s lead in dropping its traditional conservative affiliation to endorse Tony Blair , the New Labor candidate .
News Corp.’s other British papers , The Times of London , The Sunday Times and the tabloid News of the World , all concurred .
The papers account for about 35 % of the newspaper market in Britain .
Blair backed " a communications bill in the British Parliament that would loosen restrictions on foreign media ownership and allow a major newspaper publisher to own a broadcast television station as well a provision its critics call the ‘ Murdoch clause ’ because it seems to apply mainly to News Corp . "
[ Atlantic Monthly , 9/03 ; New York Times , 4/9/03 ]
MURDOCH THE NEW YORK CITY POLITICAL BOSS : The Columbia Journalism Review reported that during New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ’s first term " News Corp. received a $ 20.7 million tax break for the mid-Manhattan office building that houses the Post , Fox News Channel , TV Guide and other operations .
During Giuliani ’s 1997 reelection campaign , News Corp. was also angling for hefty city tax breaks and other incentives to set up a new printing plant in New York City .
Most dramatically , Giuliani jumped in to aggressively champion News Corp. when it battled Time Warner over a slot for the Fox News Channel on Time Warner ’s local cable system …
Three years into Giuliani ’s first term , veteran Village Voice political reporter Wayne Barrett asked Post editorial page editor Eric Breindel if the paper had run a single editorial critical of the administration ; Breindel , he says , admitted it had not .
According to Barrett , the paper pulled off a perfect four - year streak " of not one critical editorial .

Rupert Murdoch thinks of himself as a staunch anti-communist .
But a look at the record shows that when his own profits are on the line , he is willing to do favors for the most repressive regimes on the planet .
MURDOCH THE DEFENDER OF REPRESSIVE REGIMES :
The last governor of Hong Kong before it was handed back to China , Chris Patten , signed a contract to write his memoirs with Murdoch ’s publishing company , HarperCollins .
But according to the Evening Standard , when " Murdoch heard that the book , East and West , would say unflattering things about the Chinese leadership , with whom he was doing satellite TV business , the contract was cancelled .
It caused a furor in the press – except , of course , in the Murdoch papers , which barely mentioned the story . "
According to BusinessWeek , internal memos surfaced suggesting the canceling of the contract was motivated by " corporate worries about friction with China , where HarperCollins ’ boss , Rupert Murdoch , has many business interests . "
[ Evening Standard , 8/13/03 ; BusinessWeek , 9/15/98 ]
MURDOCH THE APOLOGIST FOR DICTATORSHIPS : Time Magazine reported that while Murdoch is supposedly " a devout anti-Soviet and anti-communist " he " became bewitched by China in the early ’ 90s . "
In an effort to persuade Chinese dictators that he would never challenge their behavior , Murdoch " threw the BBC off Star TV " ( his satellite network operating in China ) after BBC aired reports about Chinese human rights violations .
Murdoch argued the BBC " was gratuitously attacking the regime , playing film of the massacre in Tiananmen Square over and over again . "
In 1998 Chinese President Jiang Zemin praised Murdoch for the " objective " way in which his papers and television covered China .
[ Source : Time Magazine , 10/25/99 ]
MURDOCH THE PROPAGANDIST FOR DICTATORS :
While Murdoch justifies his global media empire as a threat to " totalitarian regimes everywhere , " according to Time Magazine , Murdoch actually pays the salary of a top TV consultant working to improve the Chinese government ’s communist state - run television CCTV .
As Time notes , " nowadays , News Corp. and CCTV International are partners of sorts , " exchanging agreements to air each other ’s content , even though CCTV is " a key propaganda arm of the Communist Party . "
[ Source : Time Magazine , 7/6/04 ]
MURDOCH THE ENABLER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATORS : According to the LA Times , Murdoch had his son James , now in charge of News Corp . ’s China initiative , attack the Falun Gong , the spiritual movement banned by the Chinese government after 10,000 of its followers protested in Tiananmen Square .
With Rupert in attendance , James Murdoch called the movement a " dangerous " and " apocalyptic cult " and lambasted the Western press for its negative portrayal of China ’s awful human rights record .
Murdoch " startled even China ’s supporters with his zealous defense of that government ’s harsh crackdown on Falun Gong and criticism of Hong Kong democracy supporters . "
Murdoch also " said Hong Kong democracy advocates should accept the reality of life under a strong - willed ‘ absolutist ’ government . "
It " appeared to some to be a blatant effort to curry favor " with the China ’s repressive government .

MURDOCH THE HIDER OF MONEY IN COMMUNIST CUBA : Despite a U.S. embargo of communist Cuba , the Washington Post reports , " News Corp . ’s organizational chart consists of no less than 789 business units incorporated in 52 countries , including Mauritius , Fiji and even Cuba . "

From union busting to tax evading , Rupert Murdoch has established a shady business record that raises serious questions about his corporate ethics .
MURDOCH THE UNION BUSTER : The Economist reported that in 1986 Murdoch " helped smash the British print unions by transferring the production of his newspapers to a non-union plant at Wapping in East London . "
The move " proved to be a turning - point in Britain ’s dreadful industrial relations . "
AP reported Murdoch specifically " slashed employment levels " at the union plant and said he would " dismiss the 6,000 striking workers " who were trying to force concessions out of the media baron .
The London Evening Standard called the tactics " the biggest union - busting operation in history . "

MURDOCH THE CORPORATE TAX EVADER :
The BBC reported that " Mr. Murdoch ’s die - hard loyalty to the tax loophole has drawn wide criticism " after a report found that in the four years prior to June 30 , 1998 , " Murdoch ’s News Corporation and its subsidiaries paid only $ 325 million in corporate taxes worldwide .
That translates as 6 % of the $ 5.4 billion consolidated pre-tax profits for the same period …
By comparison another multi-national media empire , Disney , paid 31 % .
The corporate tax rates for the three main countries in which News Corp. operates – Australia , the United States and the UK – are 36 % , 35 % and 30 % respectively .
Further research reveals that Mr. Murdoch ’s main British holding company , News Corp .
Investments , has paid no net corporation tax within these shores over the past 11 years .
This is despite accumulated pre-tax profits of nearly $ 3 billion . "
[ Source : BBC , 3/25/99 ]
MURDOCH THE LOVER OF OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS :
When a congressional panel asked if he was hiding money in tax havens , including communist Cuba , Murdoch responded " we might have in the past , I ’m not denying that . "
The Washington Post reports , " through the deft use of international accounting loopholes and offshore tax havens , Murdoch has paid corporate income taxes at one - fifth the rate of his chief U.S. rivals throughout the 1990s , according to corporate documents and company officials . "
Murdoch " has mastered the use of the offshore tax haven . "
His company " reduces its annual tax bill by channeling profits through dozens of subsidiaries in low - tax or no -tax places such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda .
The overseas profits from movies made by 20th Century Fox , for instance , flow into a News Corp. - controlled company in the Caymans , where they are not taxed . "
[ Source : Congressional Testimony , 5/8/03 ; Washington Post , 12/7/97 ]
MURDOCH THE ABUSER OF TAX LOOPHOLES : Even though Murdoch changed his citizenship in order to comply with U.S. media ownership rules , many of his companies have remained Australian , allowing them " to utilize arcane accounting rules that have pumped up reported profits and greatly aided Murdoch ’s periodic acquisition sprees . "
IRS officials point out that " U.S. - based companies face U.S. taxes on their offshore subsidiaries in the Caymans and elsewhere if more than 50 percent of the subsidiary is controlled by American shareholders .
But that does n’t apply to News Corp. , an Australian company . "

IBM switching to Linux destops in Germany according to a Linux Forum 2006 presentation by their head of open source and Linux sales in Germany .
Interesting news from LinuxForum 2006
During a presentation on IBM 's involvement with Open Source , Andreas Pleschek from IBM in Stuttgart , Germany , who heads open source and Linux technical sales across North East Europe for IBM made a very interesting statement ...
" Andreas Pleschek also told that IBM has cancelled their contract with Microsoft as of October this year .
That means that IBM will not use Windows Vista for their desktops .
Beginning from July , IBM employees will begin using IBM Workplace on their new , Red Hat - based platform .
Not all at once - some will keep using their present Windows versions for a while .
But none will upgrade to Vista . "
The question is , does this only apply to IBM in Germany , or IBM world wide ?
If ALL of IBM switches to Linux desktops and OpenOffice ... that would be a very significant loss to Microsoft ; not only in direct licensing revenues , but also in speeding adoption of Linux by other companies .
After all , if IBM can run on Linux desktops ...

The robust Chinese response followed a front - page report in the Financial Times saying Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) hackers broke into a US defence department network in June , taking data and causing the shutdown of a system serving the secretary of defence , Robert Gates .
" The Chinese government has consistently opposed and vigorously attacked according to the law all internet - wrecking crimes , including hacking , " the foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu was quoted by Reuters as saying .
" Some people are making wild accusations against China ...
These are totally groundless and also reflect a cold war mentality . "
According to the FT , a senior US official said the Pentagon had pinpointed the exact origin of the attack .
Another official told the paper there was a " very high level of confidence ... trending towards certainty " that the PLA was responsible .
The paper quoted a former US official as saying the PLA was able to disrupt and even disable the Pentagon 's computer system .
" The PLA has demonstrated the ability to conduct attacks that disable our system ... and the ability in a conflict situation to re-enter and disrupt on a very large scale , " the former official told the FT .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , has raised similar concerns about Chinese hackers infecting German government ministries with spying programs .
In the attack against the Pentagon , the FT said , hackers from several locations in China spent several months probing the Pentagon system before overcoming its defences .
The Pentagon was forced to take down the network for more than a week during the attacks .
" There are multiple wake - up calls stirring us to levels of more aggressive vigilance , " Richard Lawless , the Pentagon 's top Asia official , told the FT at the time .
The report comes as the US president , George Bush , is to meet Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , tomorrow in advance of the Apec summit of Pacific rim leaders .
In May , the small Baltic country of Estonia was subjected to a three - week wave of hacking that disabled websites of government ministries , political parties , newspapers , banks and companies .
The attacks led to Nato urgently examining the offensive and its implications .
They came amid a row over Estonia 's removal of the " bronze soldier " Soviet war memorial in central Tallinn .
The issue brought relations between Russia and Estonia to their lowest ebb since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Advisers said yesterday that they had begun corralling donors to build quickly on the formidable $ 14 million that Mrs. Clinton already had in the bank .
They predicted that they would outpace Mr. Obama , though they acknowledged that he is moving impressively to try to match Mrs. Clinton ’s national fund - raising network , which has been in the making far longer than his .
Mrs. Clinton faces some fatigue among donors after more than 15 years of Clinton fund - raising , Democratic contributors and strategists said , and some skepticism about whether she can win .
Yet she has the Democrats ’ most popular rainmaker at her full disposal , former President Bill Clinton , and she has influential friends like the lawyer and power broker Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to help keep African - American donors and others by her side .
Notably , no prominent Clinton fund - raiser has moved to Mr. Obama ’s camp ( though his aides are working on it ) .
Mrs. Clinton has also lined up a powerful roster of fund - raising and economic advisers in New York , including the financiers Roger Altman , Steven Rattner , Blair W. Effron , Alan Patricof and Mr. Rattner ’s wife , Maureen White , a former finance chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee .
“ Maureen and I will happily do everything we can to help her , ” Mr. Rattner said .
“ Based on our long relationship with her , we feel that she has demonstrated incontrovertibly that she would be an effective candidate and a terrific president . ”
For all of the attention swirling around Mr. Obama , meanwhile , he faces many obstacles as he seeks to become the nation ’s first black president .
His background , including a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas , has elevated his appeal , but it does little to answer questions about whether he has the experience to serve in the White House .
Picking off Clinton loyalists is no easy task , either .
Hours after opening his fund - raising committee on Tuesday , Mr. Obama convened separate conference calls with donors in Chicago and on the East and West Coasts ; in the East Coast phone call , according to participants , Mr. Obama asked them to keep an open mind about his candidacy even if they had been allies of Mrs. Clinton .
Image Clintons Web site , HillaryClinton.com , Saturday morning .
James Torrey , chairman of the global hedge fund Torrey Funds , said he signed on with Mr. Obama not as a snub to Mrs. Clinton , but because he believed that the Illinois senator had the best chance of inspiring Democrats and other voters .
“ It ’s been 10 years since the blog was born , ” said a Wall Street Journal headline on Saturday .
The article that followed declared , “ We are approaching a decade since the first blogger — regarded by many to be Jorn Barger — began his business of hunting and gathering links … ”
The article admits that “ The dating of the 10th anniversary of blogs , and the ascription of primacy to the first blogger , are imperfect exercises ” — but it barely lifts a finger to try to sort out the truth .
Writer Tunku Varadarajan really would n’t have had to look very far : Declan McCullagh ’s CNET piece earlier this year was not perfect , but it got a lot more of the story right than Varadarajan did .
Who be these “ many ” who regard Barger as the first blogger ?
Can Varadarajan name a single one ?
Barger ’s Robot Wisdom was indeed the first site to call itself a “ Weblog . ” ( “ Blog ” came later , via Peter Merholz . )
But Barger was nowhere near the first person to create a Web page with frequent updates sorted in reverse chronological order — if you wish to define “ blog ” on the basis of that key design feature .
Dave Winer ’s Scripting News was going full bore well before Barger ’s site started up ; Winer , in turn was preceded by semi- bloggish sites like Ric Ford ’s Macintouch .
Others choose to define blogging more in terms of content .
( None of them names Barger as the first blogger , either . )
The problem is that , from this angle , too , there are multiple roots : blogs are commonly vehicles for self - revelation — so maybe Justin Hall , the inspiring pioneer of link - filled Web diaries , was the ur - blogger .
But others see the heart of blogging as being the assembly of a list of annotated links — in which case the first blog might well be , as Dave Winer has said , Tim Berners - Lee ’s very first web page at CERN .
( Similarly , Marc Andreessen jokes that the original NCSA “ What ’s New ” page from 1993 was his first blog . )
Then there are those who see blogs primarily as fast - moving sources for news and rumors ; these people ( I tend to disagree with them , but they ’re out there ) will typically point to Matt Drudge as a blogging progenitor .
Since the Journal article came out , the blogosphere ’s self - correction mechanism has been going at full tilt .
As happens in this medium , lots of good suggestions are coming to light .
Still , I think there ’s a lot of needless effort being dedicated toward a pointless goal — the identification of a “ first ” that is really only of use to old - fashioned editors eager to fill slow - news days with anniversary features .
The hunt for “ the first blog ” or “ the day blogging started ” will be in vain .
Like many significant phenomena in our world , blogging does not have a single point of origin .
Blogging as we know it today slowly accreted from multiple input streams .
It ’s a set of practices built around a set of tools , and the practices and tools co-evolved .
There are a handful of central figures in the story .
They ’re all important .
Why argue about “ firsts ” when the thing whose first instance you are hunting down is impossible to strictly define ?
The Journal piece , which included brief essays by a dozen celebrities and high - profile bloggers , tilts heavily toward the political wing of the blogosphere , which is only one galaxy in this continuously expanding multiple universe .
That distortion is perhaps understandable from a newspaper that lies at the nexus of conservative American power and money .
But , sheesh , ye Journal - ites , you ought to get your facts right .
Ironically , the Journal ’s biggest - name essayist , Tom Wolfe , arrogantly dismisses the blogosphere for its “ narcissistic shrieks and baseless ‘ information . ' ”
His chief complaint , oddly , is aimed not at blogs at all but at Wikipedia , which apparently contains an anecdote about him that he says is false ( I should say “ contained ” — the page has of course been updated based on his complaint ) .
Blogs , Wikipedia , what ’s the difference ?
To Tom , it ’s all that crazy stuff on the Internet , and to hell with it .
Plainly , we should forget about what we read online and trust titans like the Journal — they ’re so rock - solid reliable on the facts !

The 15 - year - old Husky mix , who is deaf and blind , had wandered away from his owner , Bill Hurley , during a walk on Monday night .
Hurley , his wife Christine , and their daughter Elizabeth had searched for their beloved pet until 1 a.m. Tuesday .
After a couple hours of sleep , the family resumed their search , posting signs in the town forest Tuesday morning asking other dog owners for help .
And while many in the Rye community had answered that call for help and had searched all day , it was Zamboni Hurley , Elizabeth 's year - old Collie mix , who sniffed out Fulton and led Elizabeth to him just before dark Tuesday night .
" It was like finding a needle in a haystack , " said Fulton 's owner , Chris Hurley .
She said Fulton was lying in the swamp surrounded by a thicket in the woods about a half - mile from her home .
The drama had begun Monday evening , when Bill Hurley took Fulton out for a walk along with Gigi , his other dog .
" I used to walk him in the woods but stopped because he would bump into things , " he said of Fulton .
" I started walking him in Parsons Field because then I could let him wander around . "
Hurley said he was looking at Gigi and , before he noticed , Fulton had slipped into the trees .
" We stayed up looking until 1 a .m. and we were right back out this morning , " said William Hurley on Tuesday .
" It 's hard because it 's not like we can yell his name . "
Before Fulton had been found , the Hurleys said they were very worried , knowing Fulton 's limitations .
The dog wears a tag that says " I am deaf and blind .
Please help me . "
" We are beside ourselves , " said Christine Hurley before Fulton was found .
" He 's like our child .
We have eight people out looking for him now . "
She said Fulton was " dog of the week " at a paper in Richmond , Va . " Elizabeth adopted him , " she said .
" She is a big baseball fan , and the Atlanta Braves were playing in Fulton Stadium — hence the name . "
Fulton was not the only Hurley to get an ice cream before bed Tuesday , said Bill .
" We also bought one for Zamboni , " he said .
" He also had vanilla . "
plists is a drop - in replacement for the Erlang module lists , making most list operations parallel .
It can operate on each element in parallel , for IO - bound operations , on sublists in parallel , for taking advantage of multi-core machines with CPU - bound operations , and across erlang nodes , for parallizing inside a cluster .
It handles errors and node failures .
It can be configured , tuned , and tweaked to get optimal performance while minimizing overhead .
Almost all the functions are identical to equivalent functions in lists , returning exactly the same result , and having both a form with an identical syntax that operates on each element in parallel and a form which takes an optional “ malt ” , a specification for how to parallize the operation .
fold is the one exception , parallel fold is different from linear fold .
This module also include a simple mapreduce implementation , and the function runmany .
All the other functions are implemented with runmany , which is as a generalization of parallel list operations .
plists makes it easy to parallize list operations .
Suppose you have a list of Erlang nodes , and want to know which are actually up :
NodeList = [ apple@laptop , orange@desktop ] , UpNodes = lists : filter ( fun ( Node ) -> % net_adm : ping returns pong if it can connect % to a node , pang otherwise net_adm : ping ( Node ) =:= pong end , NodeList ) ,
This works .
It goes over every element in the node list , and remove those that do n’t respond .
However , it checks only one node at a time , and even if a node is up it could take a while to respond .
If a node is down , you sit waiting for a timeout , you sit waiting on every single down node in its turn .
UpNodes2 = plists : filter ( fun ( Node ) -> % net_adm : ping returns pong if it can connect % to a node , pang otherwise net_adm : ping ( Node ) =:= pong end , NodeList ) ,
Almost exactly the same , except for two differences .
We are storing the result in UpNodes2 , and we used plists : filter instead of lists : filter .
plists : filter spawns a process for every single node we want to check , and takes no longer than the longest response , or the timeout if there is a downed node .
This is the easiest way to use plists .
Simple replace your call to a function in lists with a call to the corresponding method in plists .
plists operates on each element in parallel .
For more advanced use invoke the plists method with an optional parameter , the malt .
The malt describes how to parallize the list operation .
Suppose we have a huge list of numbers and we need to find the square root and the factors of each one .
Suppose we also have a dual - core machine we want to use to full effect .
HugeList = lists : seq ( 1 , 100000 ) , SquareRoots = plists : map ( fun math : sqrt/1 , HugeList , { processes , 2} ) , Factors = plists : map ( fun find_factors / 1 , HugeList , 10 ) ,
The last parameter on the plists : map call is the malt .
For computing square roots , we used a malt of {procesess , 2} .
This malt caused the huge list to be split into two sublists , each of which was processed by its own process , allowing both cores to be used for finding sqrts at once .
This would not have been a good way to find the factors however , because the time it takes to compute factors depends on the size of the number .
Bigger numbers take longer to factor , and if one processes gets small numbers and the other large numbers , the one with the smaller numbers would finish first , leaving the processes with bigger numbers to keep working on one core .
Our list is sorted , so we can be certain that if we split it in half that would be the case .
Instead we use the malt 10 , which splits the huge list into 10 - element sublists , each processed by its own process .
If it turns out factoring uses large amount of memory , and so we do n’t want to processes each sublist at once , we could use the malt [ 10 , { processes , 2} ] .
The huge list is split into 10 - element sublists , but plist is careful to run only two processes at once .
If we wanted to compute with an erlang cluster we could use the malt [ 10 , {nodes , [ {apple@laptop , 2} , {orange@desktop , 3} ] } ] .
This would run five processes at once , two on apple and three on orange .
Just because we started many parallel processes does n’t mean we have to wait for them all to finish .
If any error occurs , plists prematurely terminates all processes and returns , a feature we can [ ab ] use to find the Node in our NodeList we have the smallest ping time to .
NodeList = [ apple@laptop , orange@desktop ] , try plists : foreach ( fun ( Node ) -> % net_adm : ping returns pong if it can connect % to a node , pang otherwise case net_adm : ping ( Node ) of pong -> exit( {closest , Node} ) ; pang -> ok end end , NodeList ) of ok -> exit( all_nodes_dead ) catch exit : {closest , Closest} ->
Closest end , % Closest is now bound to the closest node .
This pings all nodes in parallel , but as soon as one responds it terminates and returns with exit .
We catch the exit and recover the closest node .
This introduction has only covered the most basic features plists offers .
Complete documentation is available at http://freeyourmind.googlepages.com/plists.html, and the project page with downloads and source repository on code.google.com .
Plists shows off not only Erlang ’s powerful concurrency , but also how ready functional programming is for concurrent programming .
Because operations are already abstracted , it is easy to change how they operate without changing their meaning .
Changing Erlang code to work with plists is very easy , optimising malts is a small extra step .
Writing plists itself was easy .
But parallelizing even a single loop in C would cause enormous code expansion , and there would still be no mechanism to allow all loops to be optimized .
Higher - order functions encourage code reuse of code solely devoted to code flow , an absolutely necessary feature for building real concurrent software .
His remarks had an impact on markets in the US , Europe and Asia , fanning already prevalent fears of a slowdown in China 's booming economy .
Signs that Beijing was trying to rein in its startling growth earlier this year led to a temporary fall in shares .
But markets have since risen to levels Mr Greenspan said were " unsustainable " .
Market bubble ?
The Shanghai Composite Index dropped as much as 1.5 % following Mr Greenspan 's comments before closing down 22.58 points , or 0.5 % , at 4151.13 .
He said Chinese markets had risen by 50 % since the start of the year and that this trend could not continue for much longer .
Analysts were divided over Mr Greenspan 's comments , some fearing a bursting of the stock market bubble but others suggesting his views were overstated .
" The Chinese market is something that Greenspan does not know very well , " commented Zhou Fengwu , an analyst at Orient Securities .
" Many Chinese industries have huge potential to expand in coming years and long - term prospects for the market are still very bullish . "
Since the beginning of the year , millions of ordinary Chinese citizens have invested in the stock market , many taking money from their savings accounts , where interest rates are relatively low .
The Chinese government recently made it clear it would not intervene to prop up the market .
Other global markets were affected by nervousness over China with Australia 's benchmark index falling more than 1 % and Japan 's main exchange trading flat .
In Europe , markets in London , Frankfurt and Paris were all down on the day in afternoon trading .
A traditional tattoo .
Neither Singer nor Pinter would let us photograph their animated tattoos , but we do have photos of the technology behind them .
Tattooing is one of the oldest forms of body modification known to man .
These days , getting a tattoo is a much safer and more standardized procedure then it once was .
Modern tattoo artists use a tattoo machine ( which is like a small , handheld sewing machine gun ) to do the work .
The tattoo machine has remained relatively unchanged since its invention in the late 1800s .
In fact , outside of improvements in safety and sterilization methods , there really have n't been any great leaps forward in tattoo technology .
That is , of course , until the recent introduction of the animated tattoo .

Animated tattoos are just what they sound like -- implanted images that actually move under the skin .
HowStuffWorks got to examine this technology closely and talk to Jay Sean Singer and Carl A. Pinter , the people who created it .
In this article , we 'll explain the hardware behind animated tattoos , learn how they are implanted in the body and discuss some of the safety issues associated with animated tattoos .
PSVI Tattoos
The technical name for an animated tattoo is Programmable Subcutaneous Visible Implant , or PSVI .
The PSVI is a small , specially - made LCD implanted into the skin and used to display pre-programmed images .
LCDs , or Liquid Crystal Displays , are used in a number of everyday things like TVs , computer monitors and digital watches .
Jay Sean Singer , the man who brought PSVI to life , has altered this common technology so that it can be used to display simple , one - color , animated images from underneath the skin .
PSVI tattoos have two major advantages over traditional tattoos .
The most obvious advantage is that they are animated , bringing body art to a whole new level .
The second advantage is that while the implant surgery is fairly permanent , the images are not .
Because PSVIs are programmable , a person with a PSVI tattoo can change the image whenever they like by simply having their tattoo " reprogrammed . "
" " A Programmable Subcutaneous Visible Implant
A PSVI has three major hardware components :
The LCD
The control module
The power supply
Now let 's look at each of these components closely and see how they work together to make animated tattoos .
Meet Jay Sean Singer Kentucky native Jay Sean Singer has a life - long passion for tinkering with electronics .
The son of an electrician , Singer 's first gadget was an alarm system he built to keep people out of his father 's tool box .
The amazing thing is that Jay Sean was only six years old when he built it !
It took Singer three years to build the first successful animated tattoo prototype .
However , Singer did not actually patent the idea .
The idea for PSVI was patented by two other men nearly seven years before Singer ever even thought about trying it .
Singer explains , " You really can't fabricate the device with the information in that patent .
Obviously if you could , these two cats would have already done it .
They may have thought of it , but I made it a reality ... "
Singer 's early concepts for an animated tattoo involved a design that was similar to a Magna Doodle .
" I was going to carve channels into the flesh and have these magnetic particles held in a liquid suspension .
You 'd shake your arm to make that tattoo move ... yeah , I know it 's stupid . "

Hot Chips
Hoping to improve the state of server software , Sun Microsystems has confirmed that it will include support for transactional memory with the first generation of its
Rock processors due out in the second half of next year .
Sun 's research and development teams have spent years working on a type of transactional memory that combines software and hardware aids .
Now , the company looks set to be the first mainstream chip maker to build transactional memory hooks into its chips .
By leading the market , Sun hopes to foster early ISV and developer support for its technology , resulting in more multi- threaded code capable of using all the horsepower available in many core processors such as Rock , which will have 16 cores and support for 32 software threads .
" There are two , main goals here , " Marc Tremblay , the CTO of Sun 's chip business , told us in an interview .
" One is that you get higher software and system performance .
The other is that you enable parallel software .
You help programmers coming out of school think in parallel concepts and end up with better applications . "
The transactional memory ( TM ) technology borrows heavily from work done over the decades in the database field .
At its most basic level , TM routes around today 's lock - based programming model where developers use a variety of techniques to stop software threads from accessing shared data at the same time .
Rather than assuming that software threads will charge after the same information , TM bets on the notion that in many cases a single software thread will seek a unique chunk of data .
Tremblay compares the scenario to a bunch of chefs trying to make a soup .
In today 's world , only one chef can grab an ingredient from the cupboard at any given time and add it to the soup , unlocking and then locking the cupboard each time .
While in the TM scenario , chefs can grab unique ingredients at the same time and add them to the soup .
Should two chefs happen to add salt to the soup concurrently , the TM model provides a mechanism for rolling back the soup to its pre-salted state .
( Our more savvy readers will please excuse this analogy . )
In terms a bit closer to developers ' hearts , you can picture writing code where tens or hundreds of instructions are part of a transaction .
The TM technology creates a checkpoint at the start of the transaction and maintains all of the involved instructions until there 's a commit .
At that point , you see an all or nothing scenarios where either all the loads and stores go through or none do .
The lock - based programming model proves tough for developers and often leads to system issues such as dead - locking where an interdependency of software locks is created stalling the code .
So , Sun has embraced a so - called hybrid transactional memory model where it cap tap into both hardware - based and software - based TM tools .
" HyTM exploits HTM support if it is available to achieve higher performance for transactions that do not exceed the HTM 's limitations , and transparently executes transactions that do in software , " Sun explains on its website .
" Thus HyTM can use best - effort HTM to boost performance but does not depend on HTM .
Programmers can therefore develop and test transactional programs in existing systems today and enjoy the benefits of HTM support as it becomes available . "
Sun 's own Solaris operating system and Java virtual machine are already set to use TM .
But to make TM really pay off , Sun will need the support of the software community .
According to Tremblay , the company has already started reaching out to the likes of Oracle , BEA and IBM for help .
Intel , AMD , Microsoft and IBM have all discussed TM technology as well , making this one of the hottest hardware / software fields .
It does , however , look like Sun will lead the market with the technology , since it will ship limited TM support with the Rock chips next year .
" For the other companies , it will be harder because an Intel or AMD do n't have all the pieces , " Tremblay said , returning to Sun 's favorite systems company refrain .
With any luck , all of the vendors will succeed in their push around TM technology , and we 'll see multi - threaded code that can tap all of the horsepower in coming chips .
" That is the big carrot , " Tremblay said .
" If we all rally around this , we will have much better software written by the genius and the common programmers . "
There 's more information on Sun 's transactional memory approach here . ®
A mob of Cyprian honeybees will form a ball around an intruding hornet to suffocate this arch - enemy to death ( Image : Emmanouil Filippou )

Certain honeybees may suffocate an enemy insect to death , new research suggests .
Cyprian honeybees will swarm together around a threatening hornet , forming a tightly - packed ball that kills the would - be - invader , but exactly how this happened was unknown .
Now – by a process of elimination – a study suggests that the honeybees kill by depriving their enemy of oxygen .
Advertisement
Hornets are particularly nasty predators and will chop off the head of a bee before carrying it back to their nest to eat .
Often greedy hornets will go so far as to invade the honeybee hive to obtain food such as larvae .
“ They can slaughter whole colonies in a few hours , ” says Alexandros Papachristoforou of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece .
After a particularly dry summer the bees can become so weak from lack of nutrition they become unable to defend themselves against an attack .
In such years , some beekeepers loose 30 % of their colonies to hornet invasions , says Papachristoforou
Honeybee roast
Beekeepers have long observed that when bees guarding a hive are in good health they will instantly form a lemon - sized ball of about 150-300 bees to engulf any hornet that ventures too close to the entrance .
But the bees cannot penetrate the hornet ’s tough armour with their stings , so exactly how the insects killed the hornets remained a mystery .
In the mid-1990s , researchers used thermal imaging equipment and showed that a hornet caught in a ball of Japanese honeybees gets roasted to death by the bees ’ body heat .
So Papachristoforou and his colleagues assumed that the Cyprian honeybee Apis mellifera cypria similarly killed its arch - enemy the Oriental hornet Vespa orientalis .
However , when the team poked a thermal probe into a ball of Cyprian bees holding a hornet , they found that the temperature ( 44° C ) was lower than that measured inside balls of Japanese honeybees ( 49° C ) .
Oxygen deprivation
Moreover , the temperature inside the ball of Cyprian honeybees was too cool to kill their particular hornet predator , which dies at 50° C .
This led Papachristoforou and his teammates to conclude that Cyprian honeybees use another method to murder their enemy : suffocation .
The ball of bees forms in a matter of seconds and traps the wasp inside , depriving it of oxygen for about an hour until it dies .
“ To a human being it all looks the same , ” comments Stan Schneider , who studies bee behaviour at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte , North Carolina , US .
“ But it ’s interesting that there is this other way that the balling behaviour kills the hornets . ”
Exactly how the bees coordinate to form the ball remains unclear , although Papachristoforou suspects the insects might use chemical signals known as alarm pheromones .

Severe drought in the 1970s and ’ 80s , coupled with a population explosion and destructive farming and livestock practices , was denuding vast swaths of land .
The desert seemed determined to swallow everything .
So Mr. Danjimo and other farmers in Guidan Bakoye took a small but radical step .
No longer would they clear the saplings from their fields before planting , as they had for generations .
Instead they would protect and nurture them , carefully plowing around them when sowing millet , sorghum , peanuts and beans .
Today , the success in growing new trees suggests that the harm to much of the Sahel may not have been permanent , but a temporary loss of fertility .
The evidence , scientists say , demonstrates how relatively small changes in human behavior can transform the regional ecology , restoring its biodiversity and productivity .
In Niger ’s case , farmers began protecting trees just as rainfall levels began to rise again after the droughts in the 1970s and ’ 80s .

Another change was the way trees were regarded by law .
From colonial times , all trees in Niger had been regarded as the property of the state , which gave farmers little incentive to protect them .
Trees were chopped for firewood or construction without regard to the environmental costs .
Government foresters were supposed to make sure the trees were properly managed , but there were not enough of them to police a country nearly twice the size of Texas .
But over time , farmers began to regard the trees in their fields as their property , and in recent years the government has recognized the benefits of that outlook by allowing individuals to own trees .
Farmers make money from the trees by selling branches , pods , fruit and bark .
Because those sales are more lucrative over time than simply chopping down the tree for firewood , the farmers preserve them .
The greening began in the mid-1980s , Dr. Reij said , “ and every time we went back to Niger , the scale increased . ”
How is Blackle saving energy ?
Blackle saves energy because the screen is predominantly black .
" Image displayed is primarily a function of the user 's color settings and desktop graphics , as well as the color and size of open application windows ; a given monitor requires more power to display a white ( or light ) screen than a black ( or dark ) screen . "
( Roberson et al , 2002 )
In January 2007 a blog post titled Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt - hours a Year proposed the theory that a black version of the Google search engine would save a fair bit of energy due to the popularity of the search engine .
In 2020 the majority of monitor sales are LED backlit LCD 's which do not light up the parts of the screen that are black .
Some older CCFL LCD monitors worked by wastefully backlighting the entire screen .
Since 2005 manufacturers have moved away from CCFL's .

A 22 % drop in prescriptions for antidepressants for teens and children following government warnings about hazards of the drugs led to a sharp increase in suicides the following year , according to Chicago researchers .
The change in labeling in 2003 warned that use of the drugs could increase suicidal thoughts and behavior among youths , but the labeling seems to have backfired , according to a report in the September issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .
In the year after the change in labeling , the suicide rate rose 14 % among those younger than 19 , the largest increase since the government started collecting suicide statistics in 1979 , said biostatistician Robert D. Gibbons and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
A similar drop in prescriptions in the Netherlands led to a 49 % increase in youth suicides over a two - year period , the team reported .
They estimated that every 20 % drop in antidepressant use among all ages in the U.S. would lead to a nearly 10 % increase in suicides , an additional 3,040 deaths per year .

Gibbons ’ data is “ compelling , ” Dr. James F. Leckman and Dr. Robert A. King of the Yale University School of Medicine wrote in an editorial accompanying the paper .
Unfortunately , they said , Gibbons did not examine data from the previous decade to determine whether the increasing use of antidepressants was linked to a drop in suicides .
Dr. Thomas R. Insel , director of the National Institute of Mental Health , which funded the research , told the Washington Post that “ we may have inadvertently created a problem by putting a ‘ black - box ’ warning on medications that were useful .
If the drugs were doing more harm than good , then the reduction in prescription rates should mean the risk of suicide should go way down , and it has n’t gone down at all -- it has gone up . ”
The drugs involved are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or SSRIs , and include Prozac , Zoloft and Paxil .
About 16 million Americans take such drugs , according to the Mental Health Assn. , an advocacy group .
In 2003 and 2004 , the Food and Drug Administration mandated the black - box warning on them after research indicated that youths who took the drugs had an increase in suicidal thinking .
The warning applied to patients younger than 19 .
Advertisement
Earlier this year , the warning was changed to include adults younger than 25 .
Many experts had argued against such warnings , contending that it would cause many patients to abandon treatment that they desperately needed .
At least 3 million Americans now do not receive any treatment for their depression .
The study , which includes data from the Netherlands , provides the strongest evidence yet that the drugs are useful in preventing suicide , Gibbons said .
“ If the intent of the black - box warning was to save lives , the warning failed , ” the team wrote . " . . .
What should be considered instead is better education and training of physicians . ”

BBC News diplomatic correspondent
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner has again raised the spectre of a conflict with Tehran , warning the world " to prepare for the worst ... and the worst means war " .
Iran 's nuclear programme remained secret for years
The hardening of France 's position towards Tehran was first signalled by the new president in a speech to French ambassadors last month .
Then he called for tougher economic sanctions against Tehran and warned that if these failed to halt Iran 's nuclear programme , there would be , as he put it " a catastrophic choice " between " an Iranian bomb or the bombardment of Iran " .
So what is going on ?
In the US , the Bush administration certainly has established war plans for a conflict with Iran , as it has for so many other contingencies .
There are still hawkish voices within the administration who , despite all of the chaos in Iraq , still believe that Iran should be the next target in the Pentagon 's sights .
Nonetheless , there still remains considerable leeway for diplomatic action .
Much attention is focused on Moscow , the government with the strongest potential " sanction " against Tehran - namely its refusal to supply nuclear fuel for Iran 's first power - generating reactor .
Sanctions
In recent weeks though there have been signs that the diplomatic pressure on Tehran has been weakening , just as the Americans in particular are pushing for additional UN Security Council sanctions .
[ This ] is part of a broader change of diplomatic gear under a young and dynamic president who carries little of the anti-American baggage of his predecessor
Mr ElBaradei's intervention , which has led Iran to accept a plan of action to gradually shed light on its past nuclear activities , is seen by these governments as too lenient .
They say it gives the Iranians yet more time to make a full disclosure of their nuclear programme while failing to insist that they halt uranium enrichment as the UN Security Council has demanded .
The French want to see stronger European Union sanctions whatever the UN might do .
And Mr Kouchner is signalling that France is willing to pay a price by encouraging French firms to limit their dealings with Tehran .
US financial sanctions , both formal and informal , are seen as beginning to have an impact on the Iranian economy .
However , critics of such moves argue that this simply panders to the siege mentality of Iranian hard - liners , and rallies popular support around the government in Tehran .
New attitude
The shift in Paris , though , is significant .
It is part of a broader change of diplomatic gear under a young and dynamic president who carries little of the anti-American baggage of his predecessors .
IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES
And there has even been speculation that France might rejoin the alliance 's integrated military command , which it walked out of in 1966 .
But it is the tougher rhetoric aimed at Tehran which will please Washington the most .
It is bound to cause divisions within the European Union and complicate discussions on Iran within the governing coalition in Germany .
Until now there has been a good deal of talk about Iran 's nuclear programme - and some modest sanctions .
But the Iranians have largely stayed ahead of the game , pursuing their research activities whatever the wider international community might say .
The French government , for one , is now saying that this situation cannot continue .
The overall message is still diplomatic : the UN and others need to get much tougher towards Tehran .
If they do not then the subtext is clear : the thinly - veiled military threat could become the only alternative .
The researchers hope to scale the work up to the whole of the genome
The study , which was carried out on just 1 % of our DNA code , challenges the view that genes are the main players in driving our biochemistry .
Instead , it suggests genes , so called junk DNA and other elements , together weave an intricate control network .
The work , published in the journals Nature and Genome Research , is to be scaled up to the rest of the genome .
Views transformed
The Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements ( Encode ) study was a collaborative effort between 80 organisations from around the world .
It has been described as the next step on from the Human Genome Project , which provided the sequence for all of the DNA that makes up the human species ' biochemical " book of life " .
We are now seeing the majority of the rest of the genome is active to some extent
Tim Hubbard , Sanger Institute
The researchers focussed on 1 % of the human genome sequence , carrying out 80 different types of experiments that generated more than 600 million data points .
The surprising results , explained Tim Hubbard from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , " transform our view of the genome fabric " .
THE DNA MOLECULE
The double - stranded DNA molecule - wound in a helix - is held together by four chemical components called bases Adenine ( A ) bonds with thymine ( T ) ; cytosine ( C ) bonds with guanine ( G ) Groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; a code that is very nearly universal to all Earth 's organisms Written in the DNA are genes which cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies
The other 97 % or so of the genome was said to be made up of " junk " DNA - so called because it had no known biological function .
However , junk DNA may soon need a new moniker .
Dr Hubbard said : " We are now seeing the majority of the rest of the genome is active to some extent . "
He explained that the study had found junk DNA was being transcribed , or copied , into RNA - an active molecule that relays information from DNA to the cellular machinery .
He added : " This is a remarkable finding , since most prior research suggested only a fraction of the genome was transcribed . "
' Complex picture '
Dr Birney added that many of the RNA molecules were copying overlapping sequences of DNA .
He said : " The genome looks like it is far more of a network of RNA transcripts that are all collaborating together .
Some go off and make proteins ; [ and ] quite a few , although we know they are there , we really do not have a good understanding of what they do .
" This leads to a much more complex picture . "
The researchers now hope to scale up their efforts to look at the other 99 % of the genome .
By finding out more about its workings , scientists hope to have a better understanding of the mechanics of certain diseases .
Dr Birney said that in the future , they would hope to combine their findings with some of the larger studies that are currently investigating genes known to be associated with particular conditions .
He added : " As we understand these things better , we get better insight into disease , and when we get better insight into disease , we get better insight into diagnosis and the chances to create new drugs . "

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
An old ulcer operation is getting new attention as a possible alternative obesity surgery : a quick snip of a nerve that helps control hunger .
It 's far from clear if cutting the vagus nerve really helps — initial pilot studies in a few dozen patients have just begun .
Skeptics abound , and even proponents say it would n't lead to nearly as much weight loss as more traumatic operations that shrink the stomach and reroute intestines .
It 's part of a hunt for middle - ground options for people scared of today 's surgery , or those not quite fat enough to qualify for it .
" By no means do I think this is a panacea , " cautions Dr. Robert Lustig of the University of California , San Francisco , who is studying the method along with University of Rochester surgeons .
" But I think this will be a rational alternative for a cadre of patients that are sort of in the middle there .
With as much obesity as we have in this country , that 's a big middle . "
More than 177,000 people underwent obesity surgery last year , according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery .
The most popular method is gastric bypass , stapling the stomach to create a tiny pouch .
Options include placing an adjustable band around the stomach , or cutting off the stomach 's side and rerouting the intestines .
Surgery can produce life - altering weight loss , if recipients adhere to diet and exercise advice , but each method comes with varying degrees of pain and risk , including a rare chance of death .
So doctors are searching for alternatives .
Enter the vagus nerve , which snakes from the brain to the abdomen , with fibers reaching into multiple organs with different effects .
Among them :
The nerve spurs gastric acid production , and in the 1970s , surgery to cut where it attaches to the front and back of the stomach brought ulcer sufferers great relief — after they recovered from open - abdominal surgery .
Once better acid-reducing medications came along , this arduous operation was abandoned .
Yet surgeons at the time noticed , and subsequent animal studies confirmed , that these vagotomies could trigger weight loss .
In addition to a less acidic stomach 's slower digestion , the vagus helps control appetite - stimulating brain hormones and signals our bodies to store more fat , Lustig explains .
Since doctors today can snip the nerve far less invasively , through just five pencil - sized cuts in the abdomen , it was time to test in the obese .
Thirty patients had a vagus snip at UCSF or the University of Rochester .
The study is n't complete .
But of the 11 who are a year past surgery , all but one are shedding pounds , losing an average of 18 % of excess weight so far , Lustig and Rochester 's Dr. Thad Boss reported at last month 's bariatric society meeting .
They suffered no serious side effects , and went home hours later with little pain .
" Every patient who had the vagus nerve cut says they 're not hungry , " adds Lustig — although the one who did n't respond got hungry again six weeks after surgery , perhaps because the nerve healed .
That 's less than half the weight loss of standard surgeries , warns Dr. Neil Hutcher of Bon Secour St. Mary 's Hospital in Richmond , Va. , and a past president of the bariatric society .
" I have my doubts that vagotomy alone is going to be a significant weapon , " says Hutcher , who often cuts the nerve during standard gastric bypasses for a different reason — to help those patients avoid the side effect of heartburn - causing acid buildup .
But , when Greensboro , N.C. , surgeons added a vagotomy to 25 patients getting bands on their stomachs , the nerve - snip seemed to make that usually more modest operation about as effective as a gastric bypass — with 43 % loss of excess weight at six months , and counting .
For a more rigorous study , Rochester 's Boss is about to recruit 60 more patients headed for band surgery , giving half a vagotomy as well .
The pilot studies were funded by a start - up medical device company called EndoVx Inc. that hopes one day to further simplify vagotomies , cutting the nerve by beaming high - intensity ultrasound waves down the throat .
Other doctors are testing if implants that treat epilepsy by stimulating the vagus nerve also might trigger weight loss , with mixed results so far .
For now , Boss stresses that vagus nerve - snipping remains highly experimental .
He and Lustig will track their 30 patients for 18 months to check if ultimate weight loss is enough to warrant further study , and who responds best .
The goal is to help people like Garth Michaels of Walnut Creek , Calif. , who twice backed out of standard obesity surgery , fearful of side effects and a long recovery .
Thirteen months after he volunteered for the vagotomy experiment , he has dropped 66 pounds , to 246 .
That 's a much more gradual loss than with regular surgery , but Michaels says having his hunger curbed help him finally learn to exercise .
He spends a half - hour on an exercise bike most days .
And he learned to avoid former diet saboteurs — french fries , sweets — that caused foul burping after his vagotomy , in favor of fruits and vegetables .
" I will lose more , there 's no doubt about it , " says Michaels , 56 , whose goal is 175 pounds .
" It has given me such hope . "

The Danish culture minister , Brian Mikkelson , who was in Dublin to participate in celebrations marking the arrival of a replica Norse longboat , apologised for the invasion and destruction inflicted .
" In Denmark we are certainly proud of this ship , but we are not proud of the damages to the people of Ireland that followed in the footsteps of the Vikings , " Mr Mikkelson declared in his welcoming speech delivered on the dockside at the river Liffey .
" But the warmth and friendliness with which you greet us today and the Viking ship show us that , luckily , it has all been forgiven . "
The Havhingsten ( Sea Stallion ) sailed more than 1,000 miles across the North Sea this summer with a crew of 65 men and women in what was described as a " living archaeological experiment " .
The reconstructed longboat was based on a ship found at the bottom of the Roskilde Fjord , south of Copenhagen .
The original vessel was believed to have been built in Dublin - then a Viking city - in 1042 and to have sunk 30 years later .
The wreck was discovered in 1962 and tests on the timbers enabled archaeologists to trace the wood to trees from Glendalough , County Wicklow .
The first Viking raiding parties arrived in Ireland in 795 , targeting wealthy monasteries on outlying islands such as Rathlin , County Antrim and Inishmurray , County Sligo .
By 841 , Vikings were over - wintering in fortified settlements such as Dublin , Wexford and Waterford and over the next two centuries these cities were gradually absorbed into local Irish kingdoms .
The replica ship - built using tools of the era - is 30 metres long and the largest reconstructed longboat ever built .
Guile rather than brute strength was needed to ensure that the Sea Stallion completed its voyage from Roskilde to Dublin in time for the celebrations .
The Vikings relied upon sail and rowing power .
When the winds failed this summer , the longboat was towed for 345 miles .
However , archaeologists advising the project insisted that the experiment had proved the seaworthiness of Viking vessels .
Diarmuid Murphy , 34 , from Bantry , Co Cork , one of the sailors on the ship , admitted he almost gave up at the outset .
" About 18 hours into it I was just so cold and wet and I said there 's no way I 'll do this , " he said .
The crew survived on a diet of dried food and had to sleep in the exposed and cramped conditions of an open boat for six weeks - with occasional respite on a support vessel .
" There was cold , lashing rain on some days from the morning until the following morning , " the ship 's project manager , Prieben Rather Sorensen , said .
" We did not have the time that the Vikings had as we had to be here today .
That was one of the challenges . "
The longboat is due to make the return voyage next summer .
Throttle me this :
An introduction to DPI
Imagine a device that sits inline in a major ISP 's network and can throttle P2P traffic at differing levels depending on the time of day .
Imagine a device that allows one user access only to e-mail and the Web while allowing a higher - paying user to use VoIP and BitTorrent .
Imagine a device that protects against distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks , scans for viruses passing across the network , and siphons off requested traffic for law enforcement analysis .
Imagine all of this being done in real time , for 900,000 simultaneous users , and you get a sense of the power of deep packet inspection ( DPI ) network appliances .
Although the technology is n't yet common knowledge among consumers , DPI already gives network neutrality backers nightmares and enables American ISPs to comply with CALEA ( government - ordered Internet wiretaps ) reporting requirements .
It also just might save the Internet ( depending on who you believe ) .
Ars recently had the chance to talk with executives from DPI vendors Ellacoya and Procera Networks about their offerings and how they are already being deployed around the world , and we got a look at the newest boxes on offer from each company .
Their top - of - the - line products can set you back several hundred thousand dollars , but some of them can inspect and shape every single packet — in real time — for nearly a million simultaneous connections while handling 10 - gigabit Ethernet speeds and above .
That 's some serious horsepower , and when major ISPs deploy these products in their networks , they suddenly know a whole lot more about their users and their traffic .
They also gain the ability to block , shape , monitor , and prioritize that traffic — in any direction .
That makes it suddenly simple to , say , prioritize all incoming traffic from any web site that has handed over a briefcase stuffed with unmarked bills while leaving every other site to fight its way through the tubes as best it can .
It also becomes trivial to start blocking or actively degrading services that a company dislikes — like VoIP , for example .
Not that this would ever happen .
But that 's not how the technology is marketed , and there 's little evidence that it 's currently being used this way .
DPI is generally sold on the premise that network operators can control entire classes of traffic ( P2P , VoIP , e- mail , etc. ) on a group or per-user basis .
Let 's take a look at how that happens and what it means for both network neutrality and legal interception ( CALEA ) compliance .
Inspecting packets , deeply
The " deep " in deep packet inspection refers to the fact that these boxes do n't simply look at the header information as packets pass through them .
Rather , they move beyond the IP and TCP header information to look at the payload of the packet .
The goal is to identify the applications being used on the network , but some of these devices can go much further ; those from a company like Narus , for instance , can look inside all traffic from a specific IP address , pick out the HTTP traffic , then drill even further down to capture only traffic headed to and from Gmail , and can even reassemble e-mails as they are typed out by the user .
But this sort of thing goes beyond the general uses of DPI , which is much more commonly used for monitoring and traffic shaping .
Before an ISP can shape traffic , it must know what 's passing through its system .
Without DPI , that simple - sounding job can be all but impossible .
" Shallow " packet inspection might provide information on the origination and destination IP addresses of a particular packet , and it can see what port the packet is directed towards , but this is of limited use .
Shallow inspection does n't help much with modern applications , especially with those designed to get through home and corporate firewalls with a minimum of trouble .
Such programs , including many P2P applications and less - controversial apps like Skype , can use many different ports ; some can even tunnel their traffic through entirely different protocols .
So looking at the port does n't give ISPs enough information anymore , and looking just at the IP address can't identify P2P traffic , for instance .
Even for applications like web browsers that consistently use port 80 , more information is needed .
How much of that HTTP traffic is video ?
Ellacoya , which recently completed a study of broadband usage , says that 20 percent of all web traffic is really just YouTube video streams .
This is information an ISP wants to know ; at peak hours , traffic shaping hardware might downgrade the priority of all streaming video content from YouTube , giving other web requests and e-mails a higher priority without making YouTube inaccessible .
OSI layer model
This only works if the packet inspection is " deep . "
In terms of the OSI layer model , this means looking at information from layers 4 through 7 , drilling down as necessary until the nature of the packet can be determined .
For many packets , this requires a full layer 7 analysis , opening up the payload and attempting to determine which application generated it ( DPI gear is generally built as a layer 2 device that is transparent to the rest of the network ) .
Procera explains the need for this approach in marketing materials , saying that " layer 7 identification is a necessity today when most client software , like P2P file sharing , is customizable to communicate over any given port to avoid traditional port - based firewalls and traffic management systems . "
But how does this work ?
Data packets do n't often contain metadata saying that they were generated from eDonkey ; the DPI appliances need to figure out this out .
In real - time .
For hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections .
Putin said Moscow was unilaterally withdrawing from the Soviet - era Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty because of ' extraordinary circumstances that affect the security of the Russian Federation ' , the Kremlin said .
These required ' immediate measures ' .
The treaty governs where Nato and Russia can station their troops in Europe .
Moscow 's decision to bin it suggests that Putin 's talks earlier this month with President George Bush came to nothing , and that the Kremlin has reverted to its earlier belligerent mood .
The Kremlin has for months been bitterly incensed by the Bush administration 's decision to site elements of its missile defence shield in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Putin has derided American claims that the Pentagon system is designed to shoot down rogue missiles fired by Iran and North Korea .
Instead he says the target is Russia .
Last month he said the US could use a former Soviet radar system in Azerbaijan instead .
But during his seaside summit this month with Putin at the Bush family 's Maine home , President Bush rejected this offer - a snub that appears to have triggered Putin 's latest defiant gesture .
' The detente lasted two weeks , ' Pavel Felgenhauer , a Moscow - based defence analyst , told The Observer yesterday , referring to the short - lived thaw .
Putin 's decision to leave the treaty will come into effect in 150 days after the parties of the treaty have been notified .
It comes against a backdrop of rapidly deteriorating relations between Russia and the West .
In particular , Russia 's relations with Britain are at their lowest point since the Seventies following Moscow 's refusal last week to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , the former KGB agent charged with poisoning Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London .
The Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , is expected to announce punitive counter - measures this week .
They could see the mass expulsion of diplomats from Russia 's embassy in London , and tit - for - tat reprisals by Moscow .
In Brussels , Nato bluntly condemned Russia 's decision to abandon the treaty , under which Nato and the Warsaw Pact agreed to reduce their conventional armed forces immediately after the Cold War .
' It 's a step in the wrong direction , ' said spokesman James Appathurai .
' The allies consider this treaty to be an important cornerstone of European stability . '
Estonia said it deplored the move .
The Kremlin insisted , however , it had been left little choice .
Russia 's Foreign Ministry called the treaty ' hopelessly outdated ' .
It said restrictions on Russian troop deployment were now ' senseless ' and prevented ' more efficient measures against international terrorism ' .
Under the treaty , signed by the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 , Russia agreed to scrap much of its military hardware in Eastern Europe and limit the number of troops stationed on its northern and southern flanks .
The treaty was amended in 1999 , calling on Russia to withdraw its troops from the former Soviet republics of Moldova and Georgia .
Russia ratified the treaty but did not pull out its troops , prompting the US and other Nato members to refuse to ratify the treaty until Russia withdraws .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov yesterday said Russia could no longer tolerate a situation where it had ratified and its partners had not .
Yesterday analysts said that Putin 's move would probably not make much difference to Russia 's military capacities , but it would allow Russian generals to carry out exercises without informing their Western counterparts and keep Russian troops in the breakaway regions of Georgia and Moldova .
Moscow 's ferocious anti-Western rhetoric is set to continue ahead of parliamentary elections in December and presidential elections next year to choose Putin 's successor .
Some analysts , however , believe Moscow 's move is largely symbolic .
The moratorium probably would n't result in any major build - up in heavy weaponry in European Russia , Felgenhauer said .
But it would annoy Washington , he conceded .
' This will be a major irritant .
It will seriously spoil relations . '

Sales fell 5 % year - over - year to $ 19.6 billion , said the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , a London - based group that represents the major record labels .
Against a backdrop of shrinking CD sales and piracy , the value of physical music shipments tumbled 11 % to $ 17.5 billion last year , the IFPI reported in its Recording Industry in Numbers 2007 study .
Digital shipments through mobile services and the 500 - plus recognized online music services jumped 85 % to $ 2.1 billion .
The results “ reflect an industry in transition , ” IFPI chairman and CEO John Kennedy said .
“ We hoped that the decline in physical sales would be offset by the increase in digital sales , giving us the ‘ holy grail . ’
But while digital sales have grown as expected , physical sales have fallen by more than expected , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately , this trend has continued in 2007 , ” he added .
“ Physical sales continue to drop at a faster pace than we had hoped for , particularly in the U.S. ( down 7.3 % ) and now also in the U.K. ( off 6.7 % ) -- a market that had shown incredible resilience . ”
The lion ’s share of blame , Kennedy said , should be leveled at piracy , which he described as the biggest problem the industry faces .
Thanks in no small part to the industry ’s legal actions to shunt copyright pirates , illicit file sharing is relatively stable , he said .
However , with about 20 billion illegal files downloaded last year , the volume of illegally distributed works remains “ unsustainably high , ” he noted .
During the same period , 795 million single tracks were legally downloaded online .
Regarding digital shipments , the IFPI tracks online , mobile and subscription services but does not include monophonic and polyphonic ringtone revenue .
Digital formats accounted for 11 % of total global shipments in 2006 , compared with 2 % of the overall pie in 2004 .
Record labels ’ income from performance rights collections in 2006 improved 8 % to $ 728 million .
“ We believe this sector has tremendous potential , ” Kennedy said .
“ Synchronization , ad - funded business models and artist / label joint ventures are also areas showing exciting growth . ”
Despite the global decline , 12 countries -- Japan , Russia , South Africa , South Korea , Ireland , Argentina , Indonesia , Hungary , Malaysia , India , China and Venezuela -- posted growth in their respective recorded music markets during the year .
The top 10 respective recorded music markets in the world last year were the U.S. , Japan , the U.K. , Germany , France , Canada , Australia , Italy , Spain and Mexico .
On digital value alone , the top 10 markets were the U.S. , Japan , the U.K. , South Korea , France , Germany , Canada , China , Italy and Australia .

France 's unemployment rate dropped to 8.2 percent last month , hitting a 24 - year low , the employment ministry said in its latest report .
The unemployment rate stood at 8.2 percent in April , down by 1.1 percentage points year on year and representing the lowest level since 1983 , the ministry said .
Registered job seekers totaled 2.01 million in April , according to the report .
France 's job seekers exceeded 2 million in 1983 and the number has since been growing .
Although France 's jobless rate dropped , it is still the highest in the eurozone .
France 's new President Nicolas Sarkozy has promised to continue the free market economy and urged tax cuts for enterprises to spur growth and cut the unemployment rate .
In recent years the French government has taken a host of measures to encourage employers to hire more people , including easing the procedures for hiring people and providing free training to those out of work for a long time .

AIG is not alone in offering premium service for higher premiums .
Several companies , including Chubb and Fireman ’s Fund , will help prepare homes in advance of wildfires by creating plans for clearing the kind of brush and branches that become fire fuel and , for a fee , sometimes hiring contractors to do the work .
Insurers provide similarly specialized service to limit damage from hurricanes , such as specifying what kind of shutters a house should have and which valuable furnishings should be moved where in the event of flooding and quickly coming out to cover damaged roofs .
But out West , AIG is taking special treatment to a new level .
It has a contract with Firebreak Spray Systems to deploy crews to apply retardant wherever policy holders are threatened by wildfire .
This year , the fire season has been so busy and widespread that Firebreak has had to subcontract work in Idaho to Mr. Futral , a distributor of Phos - Chek , the fertilizer - like retardant Firebreak uses .
Firebreak and Mr. Futral also install permanent sprinkler systems that can be activated remotely , even by cellphone , to spray retardant on homes when their owners are away .
The Phos - Chek used by the companies is clear , but Firebreak says it is chemically similar to the red - dyed retardant wildfire crews have been dropping on parts of Bald Mountain and the Sawtooth National Forest since the fire , known as the Castle Rock fire , broke out last week .
The fire has expanded to about 25,000 acres , though part of the increase is because of “ burn - back ” efforts to keep fire from reaching populated areas .
So far no structures have been lost .
Jeanne Pincha - Tulley , the incident commander with the United States Forest Service who was overseeing the crew of 1,300 that was fighting the fire over the weekend , is based in fire - prone California and said that in three decades of firefighting she had never heard of an insurance company showing up to spray retardant on homes while a fire is threatening .
“ That ’s a first , I have to admit , ” Ms. Pincha - Tulley said .
“ But that ’s the kind of affluence there is here . ”
Mr. Futral said he and an employee expected to treat 40 or more of the approximately 200 houses that AIG Private Client Group insures in the area , and that his list was growing rapidly as people had heard about the service or simply seen neighbors being given the treatment .
Should I Make a Flash Site ?
Flash Website Flowchart .
One of the most common questions that I get asked by web designers and web site owners is whether or not they should create all flash websites .
The process of making the decision about flash web sites for SEO ( search engine optimization ) purposes is actually quite difficult , so I took the time to create a flow chart on whether or not you should create an all flash web site .
As you can see , it gets pretty complicated , but hopefully you can apply this flash website flowchart the next time you are trying to decide whether or not you should create a flash web site .

Jon Stewart : Bush 's message is ' that Iraq is just like Vietnam , but in a good way ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 24 , 2007
Print This Email This On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart commented on President Bush 's speech the previous day in defense of his Iraq War policies , beginning with clips of Bush saying on many past occasions , " This is a different kind of war . "
" Obviously , we invaded Iraq initially because this war is historically unprecedented , " Stewart observed .
" That 's why we had to do a preemptive invasion .
And yesterday , the president explained to us why we must stay in Iraq -- historical precedent . "
" There is a precedent for the hard and necessary work we 're doing , " said Bush .
He then referred to " a time when thousands of Americans were murdered in a surprise attack , " before adding that " what I have described is the war machine of imperial Japan in the 1940's . "
" And that 's why in 1941 , America invaded China , " noted Stewart .
" With the pivotal Petraeus surge report just weeks away , " Stewart continued , " Bush began his surge to gain support for the Iraq War the only way left : by talking up a bunch of other wars . "
A montage of clips from the speech followed , with Bush citing " World War II ... Korean War ... Soviets and Chinese Communists ... militaristic Japan ... Nazis ... "
" At least we know one place the president is not going to go , " said Stewart , playing a clip of Bush saying in 2004 , " I think the [ Vietnam ] analogy is false .
I also happen to think that analogy sends the wrong message to our troops .
It sends the wrong message to the enemy " " You know what 's next , " said Stewart .
" In what is perhaps the strangest turn in the president 's effort to rally support , he agreed that Iraq is just like Vietnam , but in a good way -- and that our only mistake was not starting that war , but ending it . "
Stewart then turned to Aasif Mandvi , who suggested that " the message of today 's speech was , clearly , we should have stayed in Vietnam for that 13th or 14th year , if only to send a powerful message about our will to a teenaged Osama bin Laden -- that 's when they 're most impressionable . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 23 .
This chapter examines aspects of threads and multiprocessing ( and multithreading ) .
We will firts study a little theory of threads and also look at how threading can be effectively used to make programs more efficient .
The C thread libraries will then be introduced .
The following chapters will look at further thead issues sucj a synchronisation and practical examples .
We can think of a thread as basically a lightweight process .
In order to understand this let us consider the two main characteristics of a process :
Unit of resource ownership -- A process is allocated : a virtual address space to hold the process image
control of some resources ( files , I /O devices ... )
Unit of dispatching - A process is an execution path through one or more programs : execution may be interleaved with other processes
the process has an execution state and a dispatching priority
If we treat these two characteristics as being independent ( as does modern OS theory ) :
The unit of resource ownership is usually referred to as a process or task .
This Processes have : a virtual address space which holds the process image .
protected access to processors , other processes , files , and I /O resources .
or task .
This Processes have :
The unit of dispatching is usually referred to a thread or a lightweight process .
Thus a thread :
Has an execution state ( running , ready , etc. )
Saves thread context when not running Has an execution stack and some per-thread static storage for local variables
Has access to the memory address space and resources of its process
or a lightweight process .
Thus a thread : all threads of a process share this when one thread alters a ( non-private ) memory item , all other threads ( of the process ) sees that a file open with one thread , is available to others
If implemented correctly then threads have some advantages of ( multi ) processes , They take :
Less time to create a new thread than a process , because the newly created thread uses the current process address space .
Less time to terminate a thread than a process .
Less time to switch between two threads within the same process , partly because the newly created thread uses the current process address space .
Less communication overheads -- communicating between the threads of one process is simple because the threads share everything : address space , in particular .
So , data produced by one thread is immediately available to all the other threads .
Just a we can multiple processes running on some systems we can have multiple threads running :
Single threading -- when the OS does not recognize the concept of thread Multithreading -- when the OS supports multiple threads of execution within a single process
Figure 28.1 shows a variety of models for threads and processes .
Fig. 28.1 Threads and Processes Some example popular OSs and their thread support is :
MS - DOS -- support a single user process and a single thread UNIX -- supports multiple user processes but only supports one thread per process Solaris -- supports multiple threads
Multithreading your code can have many benefits :
Improve application responsiveness --
Any program in which many activities are not dependent upon each other can be redesigned so that each activity is defined as a thread .
For example , the user of a multithreaded GUI does not have to wait for one activity to complete before starting another .
Use multiprocessors more efficiently -- Typically , applications that express concurrency requirements with threads need not take into account the number of available processors .
The performance of the application improves transparently with additional processors .
Numerical algorithms and applications with a high degree of parallelism , such as matrix multiplications , can run much faster when implemented with threads on a multiprocessor .
Improve program structure --
Many programs are more efficiently structured as multiple independent or semi-independent units of execution instead of as a single , monolithic thread .
Multithreaded programs can be more adaptive to variations in user demands than single threaded programs .
Use fewer system resources -- Programs that use two or more processes that access common data through shared memory are applying more than one thread of control .
However , each process has a full address space and operating systems state .
The cost of creating and maintaining this large amount of state information makes each process much more expensive than a thread in both time and space .
In addition , the inherent separation between processes can require a major effort by the programmer to communicate between the threads in different processes , or to synchronize their actions .
Figure 28.2 illustrates different process models and thread control in a single thread and multithreaded application .
Fig. 28.2 Single and Multi- Thread Applicatiions
Example : A file server on a LAN
It needs to handle several file requests over a short period
Hence more efficient to create ( and destroy ) a single thread for each request
Multiple threads can possibly be executing simultaneously on different processors
Example 2 : Matrix Multiplication
Matrix Multilication essentially involves taking the rows of one matrix and multiplying and adding corresponding columns in a second matrix i.e :
Fig. 28.3 Matrix Multiplication ( 3x3 example )
Note that each element of the resultant matrix can be computed independently , that is to say by a different thread .
We will develop a C++ example program for matrix multiplication later ( see Chapter ) .
There are two broad categories of thread implementation :
User -Level Threads -- Thread Libraries .
Kernel - level Threads -- System Calls .
In this level , the kernel is not aware of the existence of threads --
All thread management is done by the application by using a thread library .
Thread switching does not require kernel mode privileges ( no mode switch ) and scheduling is application specific
Kernel activity for ULTs :
The kernel is not aware of thread activity but it is still managing process activity
When a thread makes a system call , the whole process will be blocked but for the thread library that thread is still in the running state
So thread states are independent of process states
Advantages and inconveniences of ULT
Advantages :
Thread switching does not involve the kernel -- no mode switching
Scheduling can be application specific -- choose the best algorithm .
ULTs can run on any OS -- Only needs a thread library
Disadvantages :
Most system calls are blocking and the kernel blocks processes --
So all threads within the process will be blocked
The kernel can only assign processes to processors --
Two threads within the same process cannot run simultaneously on two processors
Advantages and inconveniences of KLT
Advantages
the kernel can simultaneously schedule many threads of the same process on many processors blocking is done on a thread level
kernel routines can be multithreaded
Disadvantages :
thread switching within the same process involves the kernel , e.g if we have 2 mode switches per thread switch this results in a significant slow down .
Idea is to combine the best of both approaches
Solaris is an example of an OS that combines both ULT and KLT ( Figure 28.4 :
Thread creation done in the user space
Bulk of scheduling and synchronization of threads done in the user space
The programmer may adjust the number of KLTs
Process includes the user 's address space , stack , and process control block
User - level threads ( threads library ) invisible to the OS are the interface for application parallelism
Kernel threads the unit that can be dispatched on a processor
Lightweight processes ( LWP ) each LWP supports one or more ULTs and maps to exactly one KLT
Fig. 28.4 Solaris Thread Implementation
The interface to multithreading support is through a subroutine library , libpthread for POSIX threads , and libthread for Solaris threads .
They both contain code for :
creating and destroying threads
passing messages and data between threads
scheduling thread execution
saving and restoring thread contexts
Use the function pthread_create ( ) to add a new thread of control to the current process .
It is prototyped by :
int pthread_create ( pthread\_t * tid , const pthread \_attr\_t * tattr , void *( * start_routine ) ( void * ) , void * arg ) ;
When an attribute object is not specified , it is NULL , and the default thread is created with the following attributes :
It is unbounded
It is nondetached
It has a a default stack and stack size
It inhetits the parent 's priority
You can also create a default attribute object with pthread_attr_init ( ) function , and then use this attribute object to create a default thread .
See the Section 29.2 .
An example call of default thread creation is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_attr_t tattr ; pthread_t tid ; extern void * start_routine ( void * arg ) ; void * arg ; int ret ; /* default behavior */ ret = pthread_create ( &tid , NULL , start_routine , arg ) ; /* initialized with default attributes */ ret = pthread_attr_init ( &tattr ) ; /* default behavior specified */ ret = pthread_create ( &tid , &tattr , start_routine , arg ) ;
The pthread_create ( ) function is called with attr having the necessary state behavior .
start_routine is the function with which the new thread begins execution .
When start_routin e returns , the thread exits with the exit status set to the value returned by start_routine .
When pthread_create is successful , the ID of the thread created is stored in the location referred to as tid .
Creating a thread using a NULL attribute argument has the same effect as using a default attribute ; both create a default thread .
When tattr is initialized , it acquires the default behavior .
pthread_create ( ) returns a zero and exits when it completes successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
Use the pthread_join function to wait for a thread to terminate .
It is prototyped by :
int pthread_join ( thread_t tid , void ** status ) ;
An example use of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid ; int ret ; int status ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " with status */ ret = pthread_join ( tid , &status ) ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " without status */ ret = pthread_join ( tid , NULL ) ;
The pthread_join ( ) function blocks the calling thread until the specified thread terminates .
The specified thread must be in the current process and must not be detached .
When status is not NULL , it points to a location that is set to the exit status of the terminated thread when pthread_join ( ) returns successfully .
Multiple threads cannot wait for the same thread to terminate .
If they try to , one thread returns successfully and the others fail with an error of ESRCH .
After pthread_join ( ) returns , any stack storage associated with the thread can be reclaimed by the application .
The pthread_join ( ) routine takes two arguments , giving you some flexibility in its use .
When you want the caller to wait until a specific thread terminates , supply that thread 's ID as the first argument .
If you are interested in the exit code of the defunct thread , supply the address of an area to receive it .
Remember that pthread_join ( ) works only for target threads that are nondetached .
When there is no reason to synchronize with the termination of a particular thread , then that thread should be detached .
Think of a detached thread as being the thread you use in most instances and reserve nondetached threads for only those situations that require them .
The main thread wants the results of the lookup but has other work to do in the meantime .
So it does those other things and then waits for its helper to complete its job by executing pthread_join ( ) .
An argument , pbe , to the new thread is passed as a stack parameter .
This can be done here because the main thread waits for the spun - off thread to terminate .
In general , though , it is better to malloc ( ) storage from the heap instead of passing an address to thread stack storage , which can disappear or be reassigned if the thread terminated .
The source for thread.c is as follows :
void mainline (... ) { struct phonebookentry * pbe ; pthread_attr_t tattr ; pthread_t helper ; int status ; pthread_create ( &helper , NULL , fetch , &pbe ) ; /* do something else for a while */ pthread_join ( helper , &status ) ; /* it 's now safe to use result */ } void fetch ( struct phonebookentry * arg ) { struct phonebookentry * npbe ; /* fetch value from a database */ npbe = search ( prog_name ) if ( npbe != NULL ) * arg = * npbe ; pthread_exit( 0 ) ; } struct phonebookentry { char name [ 64 ] ; char phonenumber [ 32 ] ; char flags [ 16 ] ; }
The function pthread_detach ( ) is an alternative to pthread_join ( ) to reclaim storage for a thread that is created with a detachstate attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE .
It is prototyped by :
int pthread\_detach ( thread\_t tid ) ;
A simple example of calling this fucntion to detatch a thread is given by :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid ; int ret ; /* detach thread tid */ ret = pthread_detach ( tid ) ;
The pthread_detach ( ) function is used to indicate to the implementation that storage for the thread tid can be reclaimed when the thread terminates .
If tid has not terminated , pthread_detach ( ) does not cause it to terminate .
The effect of multiple pthread_detach ( ) calls on the same target thread is unspecified .
pthread_detach ( ) returns a zero when it completes successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions are detected , pthread_detach ( ) fails and returns the an error value .
Single - threaded C programs have two basic classes of data : local data and global data .
For multithreaded C programs a third class is added : thread - specific data ( TSD ) .
This is very much like global data , except that it is private to a thread .
Thread - specific data is maintained on a per - thread basis .
TSD is the only way to define and refer to data that is private to a thread .
Each thread - specific data item is associated with a key that is global to all threads in the process .
Using the key , a thread can access a pointer ( void *) that is maintained per-thread .
The function pthread_keycreate( ) is used to allocate a key that is used to identify thread - specific data in a process .
The key is global to all threads in the process , and all threads initially have the value NULL associated with the key when it is created .
pthread_keycreate( ) is called once for each key before the key is used .
There is no implicit synchronization .
Once a key has been created , each thread can bind a value to the key .
The values are specific to the thread and are maintained for each thread independently .
The per -thread binding is deallocated when a thread terminates if the key was created with a destructor function .
pthread_keycreate( ) is prototyped by :
int pthread_key_create( pthread_key_t * key , void ( * destructor ) ( void * ) ) ;
A simple example use of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_key_t key ; int ret ; /* key create without destructor */ ret = pthread_key_create( &key , NULL ) ; /* key create with destructor */ ret = pthread_key_create( &key , destructor ) ;
When pthread_keycreate ( ) returns successfully , the allocated key is stored in the location pointed to by key .
The caller must ensure that the storage and access to this key are properly synchronized .
An optional destructor function , destructor , can be used to free stale storage .
When a key has a non-NULL destructor function and the thread has a non- NULL value associated with that key , the destructor function is called with the current associated value when the thread exits .
The order in which the destructor functions are called is unspecified .
pthread_keycreate ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions occur , pthread_keycreate ( ) fails and returns an error value .
The function pthread_keydelete( ) is used to destroy an existing thread - specific data key .
Any memory associated with the key can be freed because the key has been invalidated and will return an error if ever referenced .
( There is no comparable function in Solaris threads . )
pthread_keydelete( ) is prototyped by :
int pthread_key_delete( pthread_key_t key ) ;
A simple example use of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_key_t key ; int ret ; /* key previously created */ ret = pthread_key_delete( key ) ;
Once a key has been deleted , any reference to it with the pthread_setspecific ( ) or pthread_getspecific ( ) call results in the EINVAL error .
It is the responsibility of the programmer to free any thread - specific resources before calling the delete function .
This function does not invoke any of the destructors .
pthread_keydelete( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When the following condition occurs , pthread_keycreate ( ) fails and returns the corresponding value .
The function pthread_setspecific( ) is used to set the thread - specific binding to the specified thread - specific data key .
It is prototyped by :
int pthread_setspecific( pthread_key_t key , const void * value ) ;
A simple example use of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_key_t key ; void * value ; int ret ; /* key previously created */ ret = pthread_setspecific ( key , value ) ;
pthread_setspecific ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions occur , pthread_setspecific ( ) fails and returns an error value .
Note : pthread_setspecific ( ) does not free its storage .
If a new binding is set , the existing binding must be freed ; otherwise , a memory leak can occur .
Use pthread_getspecific ( ) to get the calling thread 's binding for key , and store it in the location pointed to by value .
This function is prototyped by :
int pthread_getspecific( pthread_key_t key ) ;
A simple example use of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_key_t key ; void * value ; /* key previously created */ value = pthread_getspecific ( key ) ;
Thread - Specific Data Global but Private
Consider the following code :
body ( ) { ... while ( write ( fd , buffer , size ) == - 1 ) { if ( errno != EINTR ) { fprintf ( mywindow , " %s
" , strerror ( errno ) ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } } ... }
This code may be executed by any number of threads , but it has references to two global variables , errno and mywindow , that really should be references to items private to each thread .
References to errno should get the system error code from the routine called by this thread , not by some other thread .
So , references to errno by one thread refer to a different storage location than references to errno by other threads .
The mywindow variable is intended to refer to a stdio stream connected to a window that is private to the referring thread .
So , as with errno , references to mywindow by one thread should refer to a different storage location ( and , ultimately , a different window ) than references to mywindow by other threads .
The only difference here is that the threads library takes care of errno , but the programmer must somehow make this work for mywindow .
The next example shows how the references to mywindow work .
The preprocessor converts references to mywindow into invocations of the mywindow procedure .
This routine in turn invokes pthread_getspecific ( ) , passing it the mywindow_key global variable ( it really is a global variable ) and an output parameter , win , that receives the identity of this thread 's window .
Turning Global References Into Private References
Now consider this code fragment :
thread_key_t mywin_key ; FILE * _mywindow ( void ) { FILE * win ; pthread_getspecific ( mywin_key , &win ) ; return ( win ) ; } # define mywindow _mywindow ( ) void routine_uses_win( FILE * win ) { ... } void thread_start ( ... ) { ... make_mywin( ) ; ... routine_uses_win( mywindow ) ... }
The mywin_key variable identifies a class of variables for which each thread has its own private copy ; that is , these variables are thread - specific data .
Each thread calls make_mywin to initialize its window and to arrange for its instance of mywindow to refer to it .
Once this routine is called , the thread can safely refer to mywindow and , after mywindow , the thread gets the reference to its private window .
So , references to mywindow behave as if they were direct references to data private to the thread .
We can now set up our initial Thread - Specific Data :
void make_mywindow ( void ) { FILE ** win ; static pthread_once_t mykeycreated = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT ; pthread_once ( &mykeycreated , mykeycreate ) ; win = malloc ( sizeof ( * win ) ) ; create_window ( win , ... ) ; pthread_setspecific( mywindow_key , win ) ; } void mykeycreate ( void ) { pthread_keycreate ( & mywindow_key , free_key ) ; } void free_key ( void * win ) { free ( win ) ; }
First , get a unique value for the key , mywin_key .
This key is used to identify the thread - specific class of data .
So , the first thread to call make_mywin eventually calls pthread_keycreate ( ) , which assigns to its first argument a unique key .
The second argument is a destructor function that is used to deallocate a thread 's instance of this thread - specific data item once the thread terminates .
The next step is to allocate the storage for the caller 's instance of this thread - specific data item .
Having allocated the storage , a call is made to the create_window routine , which sets up a window for the thread and sets the storage pointed to by win to refer to it .
Finally , a call is made to pthread_setspecific ( ) , which associates the value contained in win ( that is , the location of the storage containing the reference to the window ) with the key .
After this , whenever this thread calls pthread_getspecific ( ) , passing the global key , it gets the value that was associated with this key by this thread when it called pthread_setspecific ( ) .
When a thread terminates , calls are made to the destructor functions that were set up in pthread_key_create ( ) .
Each destructor function is called only if the terminating thread established a value for the key by calling pthread_setspecific ( ) .
The function pthread_self ( ) can be called to return the ID of the calling thread .
It is prototyped by :
pthread_t pthread_self ( void ) ;
It is use is very straightforward :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid ; tid = pthread_self ( ) ;
The function pthread_equal ( ) can be called to compare the thread identification numbers of two threads .
It is prototyped by :
int pthread_equal ( pthread_t tid1 , pthread_t tid2 ) ;
It is use is straightforward to use , also :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid1 , tid2 ; int ret ; ret = pthread_equal ( tid1 , tid2 ) ;
As with other comparison functions , pthread_equal ( ) returns a non-zero value when tid1 and tid2 are equal ; otherwise , zero is returned .
When either tid1 or tid2 is an invalid thread identification number , the result is unpredictable .
Use pthread_once ( ) to call an initialization routine the first time pthread_once ( ) is called -- Subsequent calls to have no effect .
The prototype of this function is :
int pthread_once ( pthread_once_t * once_control , void ( * init_routine ) ( void ) ) ;
The function sched_yield ( ) to cause the current thread to yield its execution in favor of another thread with the same or greater priority .
It is prototyped by :
int sched_yield ( void ) ;
It is clearly a simple function to call :
#include < sched.h > int ret ; ret = sched_yield ( ) ;
sched_yield ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Otherwise - 1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error condition .
Use pthread_setschedparam ( ) to modify the priority of an existing thread .
This function has no effect on scheduling policy .
It is prototyped as follows :
int pthread_setschedparam ( pthread_t tid , int policy , const struct sched_param * param ) ;
and used as follows :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid ; int ret ; struct sched_param param ; int priority ; /* sched_priority will be the priority of the thread */ sched_param.sched_priority = priority ; /* only supported policy , others will result in ENOTSUP */ policy = SCHED_OTHER ; /* scheduling parameters of target thread */ ret = pthread_setschedparam ( tid , policy , ¶m ) ;
pthread_setschedparam ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When either of the following conditions occurs , the pthread_setschedparam ( ) function fails and returns an error value .
int pthread_getschedparam ( pthread_t tid , int policy , struct schedparam * param ) gets the priority of the existing thread .
An example call of this function is :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t tid ; sched_param param ; int priority ; int policy ; int ret ; /* scheduling parameters of target thread */ ret = pthread_getschedparam ( tid , & policy , ¶m ) ; /* sched_priority contains the priority of the thread */ priority = param.sched_priority ;
pthread_getschedparam ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When the following condition occurs , the function fails and returns the error value set .
Signal may be sent to threads is a similar fashion to those for process as follows :
#include < pthread.h > # include < signal.h > int sig ; pthread_t tid ; int ret ; ret = pthread_kill ( tid , sig ) ;
pthread_kill ( ) sends the signal sig to the thread specified by tid .
tid must be a thread within the same process as the calling thread .
The sig argument must be a valid signal of the same type defined for signal ( ) in < signal.h > ( See Chapter 23 )
When sig is zero , error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent .
This can be used to check the validity of tid .
This function returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When either of the following conditions occurs , pthread_kill ( ) fails and returns an error value .
The function pthread_sigmask ( ) may be used to change or examine the signal mask of the calling thread .
It is prototyped as follows :
int pthread_sigmask ( int how , const sigset_t * new , sigset_t * old ) ;
Example uses of this function include :
#include < pthread.h > # include < signal.h > int ret ; sigset_t old , new ; ret = pthread_sigmask ( SIG_SETMASK , &new , &old ) ; /* set new mask */ ret = pthread_sigmask ( SIG_BLOCK , &new , &old ) ; /* blocking mask */ ret = pthread_sigmask ( SIG_UNBLOCK , &new , &old ) ; /* unblocking */
how determines how the signal set is changed .
It can have one of the following values :
SIG_SETMASK --
Replace the current signal mask with new , where new indicates the new signal mask .
SIG_BLOCK --
Add new to the current signal mask , where new indicates the set of signals to block .
SIG_UNBLOCK --
Delete new from the current signal mask , where new indicates the set of signals to unblock .
When the value of new is NULL , the value of how is not significant and the signal mask of the thread is unchanged .
So , to inquire about currently blocked signals , assign a NULL value to the new argument .
The old variable points to the space where the previous signal mask is stored , unless it is NULL .
pthread_sigmask ( ) returns a zero when it completes successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When the following condition occurs , pthread_sigmask ( ) fails and returns an errro value .
A thread can terminate its execution in the following ways :
By returning from its first ( outermost ) procedure , the threads start routine ; see pthread_create ( )
By calling pthread_exit( ) , supplying an exit status
, supplying an exit status
By termination with POSIX cancel functions ; see pthread_cancel ( )
The void pthread_exit ( void * status ) is used terminate a thread in a similar fashion the exit ( ) for a process :
#include < pthread.h > int status ; pthread_exit ( &status ) ; /* exit with status */
The pthread_exit ( ) function terminates the calling thread .
All thread - specific data bindings are released .
If the calling thread is not detached , then the thread 's ID and the exit status specified by status are retained until the thread is waited for ( blocked ) .
Otherwise , status is ignored and the thread 's ID can be reclaimed immediately .
The pthread_cancel ( ) function to cancel a thread is prototyped :
int pthread_cancel ( pthread_t thread ) ;
and called :
#include < pthread.h > pthread_t thread ; int ret ; ret = pthread_cancel( thread ) ;
How the cancellation request is treated depends on the state of the target thread .
Two functions ,
pthread_setcancelstate( ) and pthread_setcanceltype( ) ( see man pages for further information on these functions ) , determine that state .
pthread_cancel ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When the following condition occurs , the function fails and returns an error value .
Solaris have many similarities to POSIX threads , In this sectionfocus on the Solaris features that are not found in POSIX threads .
Where functionality is virtually the same for both Solaris threads and for pthreads , ( even though the function names or arguments might differ ) , only a brief example consisting of the correct include file and the function prototype is presented .
Where return values are not given for the Solaris threads functions , see the appropriate man pages .
The Solaris threads API and the pthreads API are two solutions to the same problem : building parallelism into application software .
Although each API is complete in itself , you can safely mix Solaris threads functions and pthread functions in the same program .
The two APIs do not match exactly , however .
Solaris threads supports functions that are not found in pthreads , and pthreads includes functions that are not supported in the Solaris interface .
For those functions that do match , the associated arguments might not , although the information content is effectively the same .
By combining the two APIs , you can use features not found in one to enhance the other .
Similarly , you can run applications using Solaris threads , exclusively , with applications using pthreads , exclusively , on the same system .
To use the Solaris threads functions described in this chapter , you must link with the Solaris threads library - lthread and include the < thread.h > in all programs .
Let us begin by looking at some functions that are unique to Solaris threads :
Suspend Thread Execution
Continue a Suspended Thread
Set Thread Concurrency Level
Get Thread Concurrency
The function thr_suspend ( ) immediately suspends the execution of the thread specified by a target thread , ( tid below ) .
It is prototyped by :
int thr_suspend ( thread_t tid ) ;
On successful return from thr_suspend ( ) , the suspended thread is no longer executing .
Once a thread is suspended , subsequent calls to thr_suspend ( ) have no effect .
Signals cannot awaken the suspended thread ; they remain pending until the thread resumes execution .
A simple example call is as follows :
#include < thread.h > thread_t tid ; /* tid from thr_create ( ) */ /* pthreads equivalent of Solaris tid from thread created */ /* with pthread_create( ) */ pthread_t ptid ; int ret ; ret = thr_suspend ( tid ) ; /* using pthreads ID variable with a cast */ ret = thr_suspend ( ( thread_t ) ptid ) ;
Note : pthread_t tid as defined in pthreads is the same as thread_t tid in Solaris threads .
tid values can be used interchangeably either by assignment or through the use of casts .
The function thr_continue ( ) resumes the execution of a suspended thread .
It is prototypes as follows :
int thr_continue ( thread_t tid ) ;
Once a suspended thread is continued , subsequent calls to thr_continue ( ) have no effect .
A suspended thread will not be awakened by a signal .
The signal stays pending until the execution of the thread is resumed by thr_continue ( ) .
thr_continue ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When the following condition occurs , thr_continue ( )
The following code fragment illustrates the use of the function :
thread_t tid ; /* tid from thr_create ( )*/ /* pthreads equivalent of Solaris tid from thread created */ /* with pthread_create ( ) */ pthread_t ptid ; int ret ; ret = thr_continue ( tid ) ; /* using pthreads ID variable with a cast */ ret = thr_continue ( ( thread_t ) ptid )
By default , Solaris threads attempt to adjust the system execution resources ( LWPs ) used to run unbound threads to match the real number of active threads .
While the Solaris threads package cannot make perfect decisions , it at least ensures that the process continues to make progress .
When you have some idea of the number of unbound threads that should be simultaneously active ( executing code or system calls ) , tell the library through thr_setconcurrency ( int new_level ) .
To get the number of threads being used , use the function thr_getconcurrencyint ( void ) :
thr_setconcurrency ( ) provides a hint to the system about the required level of concurrency in the application .
The system ensures that a sufficient number of threads are active so that the process continues to make progress , for example :
#include < thread.h > int new_level ; int ret ; ret = thr_setconcurrency ( new_level ) ;
Unbound threads in a process might or might not be required to be simultaneously active .
To conserve system resources , the threads system ensures by default that enough threads are active for the process to make progress , and that the process will not deadlock through a lack of concurrency .
Because this might not produce the most effective level of concurrency , thr_setconcurrency ( ) permits the application to give the threads system a hint , specified by new_level , for the desired level of concurrency .
The actual number of simultaneously active threads can be larger or smaller than new_level .
Note that an application with multiple compute - bound threads can fail to schedule all the runnable threads if thr_setconcurrency ( ) has not been called to adjust the level of execution resources .
You can also affect the value for the desired concurrency level by setting the THR_NEW_LW flag in thr_create ( ) .
This effectively increments the current level by one .
thr_setconcurrency ( ) a zero when it completes successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions are detected , thr_setconcurrency ( ) fails and returns the corresponding value to errno .
Readers / Writer locks are another unique feature of Solaris threads .
They allow simultaneous read access by many threads while restricting write access to only one thread at a time .
When any thread holds the lock for reading , other threads can also acquire the lock for reading but must wait to acquire the lock for writing .
If one thread holds the lock for writing , or is waiting to acquire the lock for writing , other threads must wait to acquire the lock for either reading or writing .
Readers / writer locks are slower than mutexes , but can improve performance when they protect data that are not frequently written but that are read by many concurrent threads .
Use readers / writer locks to synchronize threads in this process and other processes by allocating them in memory that is writable and shared among the cooperating processes ( see mmap ( 2 ) ) and by initializing them for this behavior .
By default , the acquisition order is not defined when multiple threads are waiting for a readers / writer lock .
However , to avoid writer starvation , the Solaris threads package tends to favor writers over readers .
Readers / writer locks must be initialized before use .
Initialize a Readers / Writer Lock
The function rwlock_init ( ) initialises the readers / writer lock .
it is prototypes in < synch.h > or < thread.h > as follows :
int rwlock_init ( rwlock_t * rwlp , int type , void * arg ) ;
The readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp and to set the lock state to unlocked .
type can be one of the following
USYNC_PROCESS --
The readers / writer lock can be used to synchronize threads in this process and other processes .
USYNC_THREAD --
The readers / writer lock can be used to synchronize threads in this process , only .
Note : that arg is currently ignored .
rwlock_init ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions occur , the function fails and returns the corresponding value to errno .
Multiple threads must not initialize the same readers / writer lock simultaneously .
Readers / writer locks can also be initialized by allocation in zeroed memory , in which case a type of USYNC_THREAD is assumed .
A readers / writer lock must not be reinitialized while other threads might be using it .
An example code fragment that initialises Readers / Writer Locks with Intraprocess Scope is as follows :
#include < thread.h > rwlock_t rwlp ; int ret ; /* to be used within this process only */ ret = rwlock_init ( &rwlp , USYNC_THREAD , 0 ) ; Initializing Readers / Writer Locks with Interprocess Scope #include < thread.h > rwlock_t rwlp ; int ret ; /* to be used among all processes */ ret = rwlock_init ( &rwlp , USYNC_PROCESS , 0 ) ;
Acquire a Read Lock
To acquire a read lock on the readers / writer lock use the rw_rdlock ( ) function :
int rw_rdlock ( rwlock_t * rwlp ) ;
The readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp .
When the readers / writer lock is already locked for writing , the calling thread blocks until the write lock is released .
Otherwise , the read lock is acquired .
rw_rdlock ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions occur , the function fails and returns the corresponding value to errno .
A function rw_tryrdlock ( rwlock_t * rwlp ) may also be used to attempt to acquire a read lock on the readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp .
When the readers / writer lock is already locked for writing , it returns an error .
Otherwise , the read lock is acquired .
This function returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
Acquire a Write Lock
The function rw_wrlock ( rwlock_t * rwlp ) acquires a write lock on the readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp .
When the readers / writer lock is already locked for reading or writing , the calling thread blocks until all the read locks and write locks are released .
Only one thread at a time can hold a write lock on a readers / writer lock .
rw_wrlock ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
Use rw_trywrlockrwlock_t * rwlp ) to attempt to acquire a write lock on the readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp .
When the readers / writer lock is already locked for reading or writing , it returns an error .
rw_trywrlock ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
Unlock a Readers / Writer Lock
The function rw_unlock ( rwlock_t * rwlp ) unlocks a readers / writer lock pointed to by rwlp .
The readers / writer lock must be locked and the calling thread must hold the lock either for reading or writing .
When any other threads are waiting for the readers / writer lock to become available , one of them is unblocked .
rw_unlock ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
Destroy Readers / Writer Lock State
The function rwlock_destroy ( rwlock_t * rwlp ) destroys any state associated with the readers / writer lock pointed to by rlwp .
The space for storing the readers / writer lock is not freed .
rwlock_destroy ( ) returns zero after completing successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
The following example uses a bank account analogy to demonstrate readers / writer locks .
While the program could allow multiple threads to have concurrent read - only access to the account balance , only a single writer is allowed .
Note that the get_balance ( ) function needs the lock to ensure that the addition of the checking and saving balances occurs atomically .
rwlock_t account_lock ; float checking_balance = 100.0 ; float saving_balance = 100.0 ; ... rwlock_init(&account_lock , 0 , NULL ) ; ... float get_balance ( ) { float bal ; rw_rdlock ( &account_lock ) ; bal = checking_balance + saving_balance ; rw_unlock ( &account_lock ) ; return ( bal ) ; } void transfer_checking_to_savings( float amount ) { rw_wrlock ( &account_lock ) ; checking_balance = checking_balance - amount ; saving_balance = saving_balance + amount ; rw_unlock ( &account_lock ) ; }
Here we simply list the similar thread functions and their prototype definitions , except where the complexity of the function merits further exposition . .
The thr_create ( ) routine is one of the most elaborate of all the Solaris threads library routines .
It is prototyped as follows :
int thr_create ( void * stack_base , size_t stack_size , void *(* start_routine ) ( void * ) , void * arg , long flags , thread_t * new_thread ) ;
Thjis function adds a new thread of control to the current process .
Note that the new thread does not inherit pending signals , but it does inherit priority and signal masks .
stack_base contains the address for the stack that the new thread uses .
If stack_base is NULL then thr_create ( ) allocates a stack for the new thread with at least stac_size bytes .
stack_size Contains the size , in number of bytes , for the stack that the new thread uses .
If stack_size is zero , a default size is used .
In most cases , a zero value works best .
If stack_size is not zero , it must be greater than the value returned by thr_min_stack ( void ) inquiry function .
There is no general need to allocate stack space for threads .
The threads library allocates one megabyte of virtual memory for each thread 's stack with no swap space reserved .
start_routine contains the function with which the new thread begins execution .
When start_routine returns , the thread exits with the exit status set to the value returned by start_routine
arg can be anything that is described by void , which is typically any 4 - byte value .
Anything larger must be passed indirectly by having the argument point to it .
Note that you can supply only one argument .
To get your procedure to take multiple arguments , encode them as one ( such as by putting them in a structure ) .
flags specifies attributes for the created thread .
In most cases a zero value works best .
The value in flags is constructed from the bitwise inclusive OR of the following :
THR_SUSPENDED --
Suspends the new thread and does not execute start_routine until the thread is started by thr_continue ( ) .
Use this to operate on the thread ( such as changing its priority ) before you run it .
The termination of a detached thread is ignored .
THR_DETACHED --
Detaches the new thread so that its thread ID and other resources can be reused as soon as the thread terminates .
Set this when you do not want to wait for the thread to terminate .
Note -
When there is no explicit synchronization to prevent it , an unsuspended , detached thread can die and have its thread ID reassigned to another new thread before its creator returns from thr_create ( ) .
THR_BOUND --
Permanently binds the new thread to an LWP ( the new thread is a bound thread ) .
THR_NEW_LWP --
Increases the concurrency level for unbound threads by one .
The effect is similar to incrementing concurrency by one with thr_setconcurrency ( ) , although THR_NEW_LWP does not affect the level set through the thr_setconcurrency ( ) function .
Typically , THR_NEW_LWP adds a new LWP to the pool of LWPs running unbound threads .
When you specify both THR_BOUND and THR_NEW_LWP , two LWPs are typically created -- one for the bound thread and another for the pool of LWPs running unbound threads .
THR_DAEMON --
Marks the new thread as a daemon .
The process exits when all nondaemon threads exit .
Daemon threads do not affect the process exit status and are ignored when counting the number of thread exits .
A process can exit either by calling exit ( ) or by having every thread in the process that was not created with the THR_DAEMON flag call thr_exit ( ) .
An application , or a library it calls , can create one or more threads that should be ignored ( not counted ) in the decision of whether to exit .
The THR_DAEMON l flag identifies threads that are not counted in the process exit criterion .
new_thread points to a location ( when new_thread is not NULL ) where the ID of the new thread is stored when thr_create ( ) is successful .
The caller is responsible for supplying the storage this argument points to .
The ID is valid only within the calling process .
If you are not interested in this identifier , supply a zero value to new_thread .
thr_create ( ) returns a zero and exits when it completes successfully .
Any other returned value indicates that an error occurred .
When any of the following conditions are detected , thr_create ( ) fails and returns the corresponding value to errno .
The int thr_self ( void ) to get the ID of the calling thread .
void thr_yield ( void ) causes the current thread to yield its execution in favor of another thread with the same or greater priority ; otherwise it has no effect .
There is no guarantee that a thread calling thr_yield ( ) will do so .
The following functions exist and operate as do pthreads .
int thr_kill ( thread_t target_thread , int sig ) sends a signal to a thread .
int thr_sigsetmask ( int how , const sigset_t * set , sigset_t * oset ) to change or examine the signal mask of the calling thread .
The void th_exit ( void * status ) to terminates a thread .
The int thr_join ( thread_t tid , thread_t * departedid , void ** status ) function to wait for a thread to terminate .
Therefore to join specific threads one would do :
#include < thread .h > thread_t tid ; thread_t departedid ; int ret ; int status ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " with status */ ret = thr_join ( tid , &departedid , ( void * * ) &status ) ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " without status */ ret = thr_join ( tid , & departedid , NULL ) ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " without return id and status */ ret = thr_join ( tid , NULL , NULL ) ;
When the tid is ( thread_t ) 0 , then thread_join ( ) waits for any undetached thread in the process to terminate .
In other words , when no thread identifier is specified , any undetached thread that exits causes thread_join ( ) to return .
To join any threads :
#include < thread .h > thread_t tid ; thread_t departedid ; int ret ; int status ; /* waiting to join thread " tid " with status */ ret = thr_join ( NULL , & departedid , ( void **) &status ) ;
By indicating NULL as thread id in the thr_join ( ) , a join will take place when any non detached thread in the process exits .
The departedid will indicate the thread ID of exiting thread .
Except for the function names and arguments , thread specific data is the same for Solaris as it is for POSIX .
int thr_keycreate ( thread_key_t * keyp , void ( * destructor ) ( void * value ) ) allocates a key that is used to identify thread - specific data in a process .
int thr_setspecific ( thread_key_t key , void * value ) binds value to the thread - specific data key , key , for the calling thread .
int thr_getspecific ( thread_key_t key , void ** valuep ) stores the current value bound to key for the calling thread into the location pointed to by valuep .
In Solaris threads , if a thread is to be created with a priority other than that of its parent 's , it is created in SUSPEND mode .
While suspended , the threads priority is modified using the int thr_setprio( thread_t tid , int newprio ) function call ; then it is continued .
An unbound thread is usually scheduled only with respect to other threads in the process using simple priority levels with no adjustments and no kernel involvement .
Its system priority is usually uniform and is inherited from the creating process .
The function thr_setprio( ) changes the priority of the thread , specified by tid , within the current process to the priority specified by newprio .
By default , threads are scheduled based on fixed priorities that range from zero , the least significant , to the largest integer .
The tid will preempt lower priority threads , and will yield to higher priority threads .
For example :
#include < thread.h > thread_t tid ; int ret ; int newprio = 20 ; /* suspended thread creation */ ret = thr_create ( NULL , NULL , func , arg , THR_SUSPEND , &tid ) ; /* set the new priority of suspended child thread */ ret = thr_setprio( tid , newprio ) ; /* suspended child thread starts executing with new priority */ ret = thr_continue ( tid ) ;
Use int thr_getprio( thread_t tid , int * newprio ) to get the current priority for the thread .
Each thread inherits a priority from its creator .
thr_getprio( ) stores the current priority , tid , in the location pointed to by newprio .
Historically , most code has been designed for single - threaded programs .
This is especially true for most of the library routines called from C programs .
The following implicit assumptions were made for single - threaded code :
When you write into a global variable and then , a moment later , read from it , what you read is exactly what you just wrote .
This is also true for nonglobal , static storage .
You do not need synchronization because there is nothing to synchronize with .
The next few examples discuss some of the problems that arise in multithreaded programs because of these assumptions , and how you can deal with them .
Traditional , single - threaded C and UNIX have a convention for handling errors detected in system calls .
System calls can return anything as a functional value ( for example , write returns the number of bytes that were transferred ) .
However , the value - 1 is reserved to indicate that something went wrong .
So , when a system call returns - 1 , you know that it failed .
Consider the following piece of code :
extern int errno ; ... if ( write ( file_desc , buffer , size ) == - 1 ) { /* the system call failed */ fprintf ( stderr , " something went wrong , error code = %d
" , errno ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; }
Rather than return the actual error code ( which could be confused with normal return values ) , the error code is placed into the global variable errno .
When the system call fails , you can look in errno to find out what went wrong .
Now consider what happens in a multithreaded environment when two threads fail at about the same time , but with different errors .
Both expect to find their error codes in errno ,
, but one copy of errno cannot hold both values .
a
This global variable approach simply does not work for multithreaded programs .
Threads solves this problem through a conceptually new storage class : thread - specific data .
This storage is similar to global storage in that it can be accessed from any procedure in which a thread might be running .
However , it is private to the thread : when two threads refer to the thread - specific data location of the same name , they are referring to two different areas of storage .
So , when using threads , each reference to errno is thread - specific because each thread has a private copy of errno .
This is achieved in this implementation by making errno a macro that expands to a function call .
There are many options to consider for header files , define flags , and linking .
The following items are required to compile and link a multithreaded program .
A standard C compiler ( cc , gcc etc )
etc ) Include files : < thread.h > and < pthread.h > < errno.h > , < limits.h > , < signal.h > , < unistd .h >
The Solaris threads library ( libthread ) , the POSIX threads library ( libpthread ) , and possibly the POSIX realtime library ( libposix4 ) for semaphores
) , the POSIX threads library ( ) , and possibly the POSIX realtime library ( ) for semaphores MT - safe libraries ( libc , libm , libw , libintl , libnsl , libsocket , libmalloc , libmapmalloc , and so on )
The include file < thread.h > , used with the - lthread library , compiles code that is upward compatible with earlier releases of the Solaris system .
This library contains both interfaces : those with Solaris semantics and those with POSIX semantics .
To call thr_setconcurrency ( ) with POSIX threads , your program needs to include < thread .h >.
The include file < pthread.h > , used with the - lpthread library , compiles code that is conformant with the multithreading interfaces defined by the POSIX 1003.1 c standard .
For complete POSIX compliance , the define flag _POSIX_C_SOURCE should be set to a ( long ) value , as follows :
cc [ flags ] file ...
- D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=N ( where N 199506L )
You can mix Solaris threads and POSIX threads in the same application , by including both < thread.h > and < pthread.h > , and linking with either the - lthread or - lpthread library .
In mixed use , Solaris semantics prevail when compiling with - D_REENTRANT flag set and linking with - lthread , whereas POSIX semantics prevail when compiling with D_POSIX_C_SOURCE flag set and linking with - lpthread .
Defining _REENTRANT or _POSIX_C_SOURCE
Linking With libthread or libpthread
For POSIX threads behavior , load the libpthread library .
For Solaris threads behavior , load the libthread library .
Some POSIX programmers might want to link with - lthread to preserve the Solaris distinction between fork ( ) and fork1 ( ) .
All that - lpthread really does is to make fork ( ) behave the same way as the Solaris fork1 ( ) call , and change the behavior of alarm ( ) .
To use libthread , specify - lthread last on the cc command line .
To use libpthread , specify - lpthread last on the cc command line .
Do not link a nonthreaded program with - lthread or - lpthread .
Doing so establishes multithreading mechanisms at link time that are initiated at run time .
These slow down a single - threaded application , waste system resources , and produce misleading results when you debug your code .
Note : For C++ programs that use threads , use the - mt option , rather than - lthread , to compile and link your application .
The - mt option links with libthread and ensures proper library linking order .
( Using - lthread might cause your program to crash ( core dump ) .
Linking with - lposix4 for POSIX Semaphores
The Solaris semaphore routines ( see Chapter 30.3 ) are contained in the libthread library .
By contrast , you link with the - lposix4 library to get the standard POSIX semaphore routines ( See Chapter 25 )
The following list points out some of the more frequent oversights and errors that can cause bugs in multithreaded programs .
Passing a pointer to the caller 's stack as an argument to a new thread .
Accessing global memory ( shared changeable state ) without the protection of a synchronization mechanism .
Creating deadlocks caused by two threads trying to acquire rights to the same pair of global resources in alternate order ( so that one thread controls the first resource and the other controls the second resource and neither can proceed until the other gives up ) .
Trying to reacquire a lock already held ( recursive deadlock ) .
Creating a hidden gap in synchronization protection .
This is caused when a code segment protected by a synchronization mechanism contains a call to a function that frees and then reacquires the synchronization mechanism before it returns to the caller .
The result is that it appears to the caller that the global data has been protected when it actually has not .
Mixing UNIX signals with threads -- it is better to use the sigwait ( ) model for handling asynchronous signals .
model for handling asynchronous signals .
Forgetting that default threads are created PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE and must be reclaimed with pthread_join ( ) .
Note , pthread_exit ( ) does not free up its storage space .
and must be reclaimed with . , does not free up its storage space .
Making deeply nested , recursive calls and using large automatic arrays can cause problems because multithreaded programs have a more limited stack size than single - threaded programs .
Specifying an inadequate stack size , or using non -default stacks .
And , note that multithreaded programs ( especially those containing bugs ) often behave differently in two successive runs , given identical inputs , because of differences in the thread scheduling order .
In general , multithreading bugs are statistical instead of deterministic .
Tracing is usually a more effective method of finding order of execution problems than is breakpoint - based debugging .

Comment Substitute teacher Julie Amero faces up to 40 years in prison for exposing kids to porn using a classroom computer , but the facts strongly suggest that she was wrongfully convicted .
Many issues remain , from the need for an independent computer forensics investigation and the presence of spyware and adware on the machine , to bad or incomplete legal work on both sides of this criminal case .
A recent criminal case in Connecticut points out the problems of computer forensics and aggressive law enforcement .
It also points out how companies can get themselves and their employees into legal hot water by failing to take reasonable computer security procedures .
Take the case of Julie Amero , a 40 - year - old substitute teacher from Windham , Connecticut .
On October 19 , 2004 Ms Amero , reportedly four months pregnant , was asked to substitute for Michael Napp 's seventh grade language arts class at Kelly Middle School .
Classrooms in this suburb of Norwich , Connecticut , apparently have PCs connected to the internet , but substitute teachers do n't get passwords .
Therefore , Mr Napp logged in , and stayed logged in under his UserID and password .
Mr Napp logged into a few websites , and then turned the class and the computer over to Julie .
He advised her not to turn off the computer , as she had no password to log back in .
It was n't the first time Amero had used a computer in the classroom .
Indeed , she frequently used the computers in the classroom when she was supposed to be substitute teaching – many times in lieu of actually interacting with the 12 and 13 year old kids .
Julie Amero logged in to look at her AOL mail and , about six minutes later , either she or one of the students visited various websites about hair products or hair styles .
Now one can reasonably ask why Julie was checking email , or for that matter surfing the web while she was supposed to be teaching .
In fact , she spent most of the day logged on to the internet – not just logged on , but actively surfing .
And why were her students allowed to be surfing internet websites about hair styles ?
In fact , Julie Amero had been reprimanded for not paying enough attention to the students and instead just web browsing while in class .
However , on this particular date , it appears that one of the sites that either she or one of the students browsed to had caused a series of " pop - up " ads to be displayed on the classroom computer – and displayed a series of hard - core pornographic sites .
She stated that she saw a bunch of the students giggling at the screen , and saw the pornographic sites .
The substitute teacher said she immediately stepped in and shielded the children from the images , pushing them away or physically blocking them from seeing the images .
As she tried to close the pop-ups down , new ones would pop-up .
She walked down the hall to get the assistance of another faculty member , who advised her that there was nothing that could be done .
Meanwhile , of course , the hard - core porn was popping up on the computer for all the seventh graders to see .
The substitute asked one of the teachers to call for the school principal to help , but no help was forthcoming .
At the end of the day , Amero reported the problem to the assistant principal , who told her " not to worry " .
Apparently , the incident was not seen as all that significant , and the log data indicates that Amero had continued to use the computer for the rest of the day – browsing lots of other sites , unrelated to porn .
Oh yeah , and unrelated to her work as a substitute teacher .
In fact , it appears that Julie continued to browse the web all day – even after the pop -up incident .
When the students told their parents what had happened , they told the administration , who vowed that Julie would never work in the classroom again .
But they went further .
The 40 - year - old substitute teacher was arrested , indicted , tried – and here is the kicker – on January 5 , 2007 , she was convicted of four counts of risk of injury to a minor , or impairing the morals of a child ( Conn . Gen. Stat. § 53 - 21 ) .
Indeed , she was originally charged with exposing 10 children in the seventh grade class to the materials on the internet , but six of the charges were dropped .
The statute punishes " [ a ] ny person who ... unlawfully ... permits any child under the age of 16 years to be placed in such a situation that ... the morals of such child are likely to be impaired , or does any act likely to impair the ... morals of any such child " .
Julie faces 40 years in the slammer for exposing the kids to porn .
This despite the fact that a recent study by the University of New Hampshire , published in the journal Pediatrics , which indicates that 42 per cent of children ages 10 to 17 have been exposed to pornography on the internet in the last year , with two - thirds of them saying this exposure was inadvertent – due to pop-ups , bad URLs , or bad search results .
Amero will be sentenced 2 March , 2007 .
What Would Happen if the Administration Continues to Defy the Subpoenas ?

Several year ago , I read about the experiment showing that average faces are judged more beautiful than non-average faces .
In Judith Rich Harris ’s No Two Alike there is an arresting figure which demonstrates .
With a little search on the web I was able to duplicate the figure , which is based on the original research .
The top two pictures are the averages of two faces , the next two are averages of 4 , 8 , and 16 faces and the final picture is an average of 32 faces .
Wow , now I will no longer be upset when people say I have average looks .

I just finished listening to a lecture by Carol Dweck at IT Conversations , Dweck , a Stanford psychologist , is the author of Mindset : The New Psychology of Success .
Dweck ’s idea is straightforward , though widely applicable .
She starts with the premise that there are two kinds of people , those with “ fixed mindsets ” and others with “ growth mindsets . ”
Those with fixed mindsets see their lives as being about proving themselves and not making mistakes .
It is important to them that they look smart at all times .
Those with “ growth mindsets ” have deep - seated beliefs in cultivating and developing their own qualities .
Their lives are about stretching and growing , a process that is not thwarted ( and is sometimes actually enhanced ) by making mistakes .
How do you tell which mindset you have ?
During the interview , Dweck offered this simple test : “ True or false , you ca n’t change how smart you are . ”
If you think this is true , you probably have a fixed mindset .
This distinction important because there are adverse consequences to having a fixed mindset .
If you have a fixed mindset , failures label you as a failure for the rest of your life .
People with fixed mindsets develop inaccurate views of themselves .
They block out negative information for the sake of their egos .
Compare this to growth mindsets , where failures are not self defining , but merely bumps along the way .
Failures are , indeed , opportunities for growth .
Those with growth mindsets actually crave negative information .
They stay in touch with their own liabilities in order to make adjustments .
Dweck has conducted research showing that mindset is critically important when it comes to the ability of children to learn .
Self - esteem is not a bad thing , but it ca n’t be simply “ pumped into a child ” by telling the child how good he or she is .
Admittedly , telling a child that she is smart or talented will make her happy for a short while .
Making these sorts of statements to a child , however , put the child into a fixed mindset .
When that same child encounters future hurdles ( difficult tests , for example ) she will be unable to cope with setbacks as well as a child with a growth mindset .
For her ( with a fixed mindset ) the name of the game is to look smart .
These fixed mindset children “ crash ” when they encounter difficult new tasks .
Rather than attempt new tasks , they would rather re-do familiar tasks over and over .
Compare this with what happens when you praise the effort or the strategies employed by a child ( instead of praising how “ smart ” the child is ) .
When you praise the effort or strategy , 90 % of the students are more willing to attempt to learn new things .
When growth mindset children encounter difficult new problems , they do n’t rely upon how “ smart ” they are ( they have n’t framed their past successes in that way ) .
Rather , they try harder .
They work their ways out of problems .
Especially difficult hurdles simply mean they need to reach deeper and try even harder .
Through her work , Dweck has evidently discovered real - life reasons for avoiding the fundamental attribution error .
Dweck has studied adult students as well , including medical students .
Even as adults , those with growth mindsets are more resilient , more willing to immerse themselves deeper into their work when things get tough .
Those with fixed mindsets also stumble when it comes to mate choice .
They tend to look for the perfect mate .
They have difficulty tolerating disagreements or mistakes in relationships .
The good news , according to Dweck , is that people can change their mindsets .
Although she did not discuss the method of doing that in this interview , she indicates that her book contains a series of exercises for getting out of the fixed mindset mode and cultivating a growth mindset .
These are politically charged times , and I could n’t resist applying Dweck ’s work to politicians who are of the view that God has annointed them to do God ’s work .
It would certainly seem that this sort of belief would give rise to a fixed mindset , leading to repeatedly asserting their infallibility and fearing mistakes above all else .

Eating a small amount of dark chocolate every day could be good for you , scientists say .
A study has found that a regular 2 oz dose can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke - without any weight gain .
But before you reach for the king - size bar , beware .
The effects are cancelled out if more than 30 calories are consumed each day , the researchers warn .
It was already known that chemicals in chocolate called polyphenols can reduce blood pressure .
But the German study shows that the fat content does not cancel out the beneficial effects - at least where small portions are concerned .
Blood pressure lowered in this way could reduce the risk of death from a stroke by 8 per cent and from coronary artery disease by 5 per cent , the University of Cologne scientists found .
It would also reduce risk of death generally by 4 per cent .
A daily diet of a little chocolate had the same effect as more complicated diets designed to lower blood pressure , according to the authors of the study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
" Although the magnitude of the blood pressure reduction was small , the effects are clinically noteworthy , " they said .
" Adoption of small amounts of flavanol - rich cocoa into the habitual diet is a dietary modification that is easy to adhere to , and therefore may be a promising behavioural approach to lower blood pressure in individuals with above - optimal blood pressure . "
However , Sara Stanner , a nutritionist at the British Heart Foundation , was cautious .
" This study suggests that small quantities of dark chocolate might have beneficial effects on blood pressure .
However , it is important to remember that chocolate is also high in fat and calories - so over - indulgence is not good for your heart . "
Polyphenols are also found in fruit and vegetables - and can be consumed without the risks associated with over - indulging , she added .
THE ancestry of the world 's household cats can be traced to just five lineages that lived alongside ancient settlers in the Fertile Crescent , an area stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to the Gulf .
The earliest archaeological evidence for cat domestication dates to 9500 years ago , when cats were thought to have been kept as pets in parts of Cyprus .
But researchers believe it started 3000 years earlier , with the family feline having broken ranks with its wild relatives as long as 130,000 years ago .
Unlike pigs , cows and sheep , which were domesticated for agriculture , and horses and donkeys , which were exploited to pull farming equipment , cats began co-existing beside humans by feeding on mice , rats and other pests that infested the grain stores of the first farmers .

ohinkka has posted about a port of the classic shoot 'em up , Quake , to S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 phones ( Nokia N95 , Nokia 6120 , Nokia 6110 ) .
You will need an original Quake datafile along with the ported application engine ( full details are in the forum thread ) .
Of interest to developers is the fact that the port uses Symbian 's PIPS libraries and the source code is also available .
This is a good example of how the availability of standard C libraries ( PIPS ) can ease application porting to the Symbian OS platform .
Here is a YouTube video showing Quake running on the Nokia N95 :

This is part two of my series on making IT workers less angry by improving their job satisfaction .
Part one ( go and read it if you have n’t already ) gave an overview of the three major factors in job satisfaction : environment , quality of work and pay / compensation .
As I have not yet been silenced by the paid killers hired by the Cabal Of Disaffected and Exploited Information Technology ( CODE - IT ) workers , I will provide more detailed secret IT workers ’ business in this post .
Today ’s topic is the work environment .
For IT workers , environment includes the physical space you work in , the facilities available , the people you work with and the “ vibe ” of the workplace .
Physical space is one of the most important elements contributing to an IT worker ’s productivity and at the same time one of the aspects most ignored by employers .
Simply making sure there is enough desk space to spread out the required machines , screens , peripherals , manuals , folders , notebooks and “ quirky ” knick - knacks can work wonders .
Saving a few square metres of floor space at the cost of pissing off CODE - IT workers is a dumb trade - off .
The worst example of screwing up the working environment that I have personally experienced happened , tragically enough , in one of the better workplaces I have enjoyed .
This place had many of the components of nerd paradise : a huge converted warehouse for the office , big desks , open relaxation / reading areas festooned with bean bags , a gym , great kitchen facilities and an in - house cafeteria with good quality food .
But one bad decision ( really a series of smaller bad decisions compounded by lies ) poisoned the whole environment .
Expansion of the workforce meant some new desks had to be built .
This meant we would lose one of the open areas but we could see this was unavoidable .
The plan was explained thusly : new desks would be built right next to the development team ( subjecting us to weeks of noise and disruption ) , we would move into the newly constructed area temporarily while our area was also remodelled and then we would move back .
A pain but we could live with it .
Things started to come apart almost immediately .
The first time we saw actual plans it was obvious the new desks were way smaller than our existing ones .
This would be bad but we could probably put up with it temporarily .
Then construction started and the news got worse : these were n’t open desks , they were high - walled cubicles from Dilbert ’s worst nightmare .
Still , it was only going to be temporary , right ?
Yeah , right .
We were told the new area would be occupied by the marketing group .
Our existing area was near the windows , lots of natural light and good views .
This was much more desirable than the new section , isolated in the middle of the warehouse .
Can you guess where this is going ?
I have never been lucky enough to work in a company where the CODE - IT brigade had more power than the marketing division .
This place was no exception .
Rumours started almost immediately that marketing was refusing to move to the new area and wanted our window seats .
We were assured this was n’t true .
Right until the day after we moved to our “ temporary ” home .
Then we were told it would be permanent .
But hey , marketing would get the same cubicle environment right ?
Not so much .
They ended up with much larger desks with less oppressive cubicle walls .
And all through this process and even afterwards , the facilities manager refused to admit he had done anything wrong .
So we were forced into a smaller space that had a direct negative effect on productivity and performance because it simply made it harder for everyone to work efficiently .
And we were lied to every step of the way .
The facilities manager was never made to answer for his actions and the CODE - IT team were made to feel totally marginalised .
This sort of behaviour sends a very clear message to staff .
You .
Are. Not. Valued .
Even though the other environment aspects were good , the damage done by this misadventure was pretty severe .
Within 4 months , 20 % of the CODE - IT team had left , myself included .
And this was a comparatively good workplace .
For contrast , here ’s how my worst - ever workplace handled the working environment .
When an opportunity to move to cheaper offices presented itself , they grabbed it with two hands .
The actual desks were n’t too bad although they did cram more people into a smaller space .
The new desks had some positives and some negatives but overall they were n’t terrible .
Lower cubicle walls made the environment less oppressive but did make noise levels worse .
And you can probably imagine how some cave - dwelling CODE - IT types reacted to having to interact with actual humans more often .
The real giveaway of what this place thought of staff was in the other facilities provided in the new environment .
On a floor containing about 100 staff , the kitchen “ facilities ” consisted of a bench about 2 metres long adorned with a single microwave .
That was pretty bad but what was worse was this was located right next to the toilets .
And I mean you did n’t have to stretch out your arms very far to touch both the kitchen bench and toilet door .
This has bad connotations relating to hygiene ( I was n’t alone in thinking this ) but it got worse than this .
The faint of heart and / or easily mortified may not want to read this next part .
Most male toilets have some sort of vestibule or at least a corner between the exterior door and the urinals .
Not this one .
A straight line view from the kitchen to the urinals .
So the distance from you making coffee to someone standing at a urinal is about 5 metres with only a small wall next to the urinals obstructing your view if someone opens the toilet door while you ’re at the kitchen bench .
So all it took was for someone to step back before zipping up and , well , you learned more about your cow - orkers than you wanted to know .
Penny pinching that leads to such an appalling environment is a ridiculous business decision .
The money saved on rent will be blown in the cost of having to continually recruit new staff when existing staff resign because they can’t deal with the environment any more .
The people in the workplace are a significant factor when considering the quality of the environment .
If you degrade the physical environment to the point where you ca n’t retain staff , you can never build up a positive “ vibe ” between the staff and in the workplace overall .
It can be very hard for potential recruits to gauge this quality so if someone is already happy with the vibe of their workplace they are that much more likely to stay where they are .
If your goal is to maintain a stable workforce ( and if this does n’t seem important to you – go the hell away ) then investing in a quality work environment makes a lot of sense .
It is usually far cheaper than endless recruiting .
It seems I have more to say on this topic than I realised when I started .
So far I have only covered physical environment and badly implemented environment decisions at that .
In the interests of keeping these posts manageable , I will continue evaluating environmental factors in another post .
The next part in this series will highlight good environmental decisions that make CODE - IT workers love coming into work and staying at work for long hours .
Even more important , make the right decisions and you can boost morale to the point where the majority of your CODE - IT legions will not even think of looking for another job .
Including those all - important decisions regarding what software and hardware tools to provide .

AMD announced a $ 7.5 million investment in Transmeta yesterday , bolstering the stock prices of both companies , with Transmeta up $ 0.24 to $ 0.94 while AMD rose $ 0.20 to $ 14.39 .
AMD will receive preferred stock in exchange for its investment .
The investment is a badly - needed shot in the arm for Transmeta , who reported earnings of just $ 2.1 million at the end of its first quarter in May , compared to $ 19.5 million the year previous .
The company will cut its workforce by 15 to 20 percent in this quarter in order to help stem such losses .
The company is on the ropes , and there are lots of questions about its future .
Transmeta no longer actively designs or manufacturers processors , but has transitioned , obviously not without cost , into a licenser of its CPU technology .
AMD did not specify what technologies or licenses the new investment covers , but it praised Transmeta as an industry innovator .
" Transmeta has been an innovative force in the industry for more than a decade , " said Dirk Meyer , president and COO of AMD .
" Transmeta was a key ally in helping to bring our highly - successful AMD64 technology to market and has supported the widespread industry adoption of both AMD64 and AMD 's HyperTransport technology .
Our investment will support Transmeta 's technology development work and AMD 's efforts to leverage Transmeta 's innovative energy - efficient technologies to the benefit of AMD 's customers . "
AMD 's investment is likely to further cement ties between the two companies .
Sunnyvale has already agreed to sell Transmeta Efficeon processors as part of Microsoft 's FlexGo project and has previously licensed Transmeta IP for use in the Athlon 64 / Opteron products .
The cynic will note , of course , that Transmeta is also in the middle of a legal battle against Intel .
The lawsuit , filed in US District Court in Delaware , alleges that Intel 's entire x86 microprocessor line , from the Pentium Pro on down to the present day , infringes on one or more of ten patents .
In the suit , Transmeta is seeking treble damages and a licensing deal .
The company says that Intel has made over $ 100 billion on the processors at issue in this case , so we suspect that if Transmeta can build a strong suit , Intel might opt to just buy the beleaguered company .
It may seem counterintuitive , but for some types of applications , the query cache , especially if set to be large , can reduce performance .
MySQL ’s query cache stores the results of previously executed queries .
In theory , the cache exists to speed up your application by responding to the same query with results directly from memory instead of parsing , optimizing , and re-executing the query against the database .
However , the query cache is only useful in certain scenarios .
A fairly static database which is hit by the same SELECT queries often will benefit from the result set coming directly from the cache instead of hitting the tables .
However , there are many scenarios that result in the query cache being bypassed :
The SELECT query does n’t match exactly .
Checking the query cache is the first thing MySQL does when processing the query .
It checks the cache before doing any optimization of the query , so whitespace , capitalization differences , comments in the query , etc. will all cause the cache to be bypassed .
Only full queries are cached .
Subqueries , parts of a UNION , etc. will not match the cached query and wo n’t benefit from the cached results .
Stored procedures are not cached , even if they return a result set .
Prepared statements are not checked against the cache .
Queries that contain non-deterministic functions are n’t cached .
That includes CURDATE ( ) , RAND ( ) , or any other function where the output is n’t always the same .
Any query which changes a table touched by a cached query invalidates all of those queries .
That last exception is the important one .
Any INSERT or UPDATE query will invalidate all cached SELECTs against a table .
If your database is frequently hit by INSERT and UPDATE queries , it ’s going to be spending precious time checking the query cache and invalidating cached queries .
If your query cache is large , your SELECT queries may be noticeably slowed waiting on a response from the query cache while it ’s busy removing invalidated queries by some other thread .
You ’ll also be wasting valuable memory on a cache you ’re not using while you could be allocating that memory to more valuable buffers or caches , to the application , or to the operating system .
If that describes the average usage for your database , you may see a small performance boost by disabling the query cache altogether .
To do so , edit your my.cnf configuration file and set the query_cache_size to 0 and query_cache_type to 0 .
My pharmaceutical insurance company has been pressuring me constantly to change one of my medications because it is not on their " preferred list . "
They want me to take the generic alternative .
They call me and send me letters telling me how much money I will save .
The problem is that my doctor , who actually went to medical school and has an M.D. , and I have determined that the non-preferred non-generic medication , which is the re-engineered version of the now - generic precursor , works perfectly fine for me while the generic version does not .
But it does n't just end at phone calls and letters trying to get me to switch my medication , they actually charge me more for my medication than the normal practice of a flat fee for a month 's dosage .
They have decided that 20 mg of my " non-preferred " medication is the correct dosage for my condition , so when my doctor and I decide to bump it up to 30mg a day , they charge me more .
So they are making it cost - prohibitive for me to take a medication that has been approved for my diagnosed condition , because they do n't prefer it .
I do n't know who the people are who are making these decisions at my pharmaceutical insurance company .
I have never met them .
I do n't know if they have M.D.s or not .
But they certainly can't diagnose me when they have n't even met me , can they ?
And is n't making certain medications cost - prohibitive a de-facto practice of medicine ?
I know that you care about issues like this , Gov. Spitzer .
Can you let me know when state and federal laws will outlaw insurance companies from practicing medicine ?
Sincerely ,
Wry Twinger
Some managers envision in their heads , the perfect rows of 3x6 cubicles .
The grey walls , and blue grey fabric , with the metal railing tops , stacked side by side , aisle by aisle as far as the eye can see from the manager 's office .
The 15 inch monitor , occupying half the desk space , the Qwerty keyboard , and two button mouse , and phone , another third , leaving just enough room for a piece of paper and pen to jot notes on .
No room for personal items , cups of coffee , glasses of water , not even work related files .
The tower workstation sits on the floor , under the desk , it 's blinking green and amber lights signaling that work is getting down , and there is not nearly enough room for legs and feet to fit comfortably under the desk besides it .
The armless chairs protruding partially into the aisles , in which the trained worker monkeys sit ; headset in position , fingers poised to type , the data entry screen flickering in anticipation , waiting for the ACD to route the next call in the phone system roulette .
There is no extraneous thought , there is only work ; take the call , type the information , save to the system , hang up , Repeat .
Some managers might envision this as the perfect world ; maybe , but only if you work with trained monkeys .
So read on for five surefire ways to kill morale and productivity :
Treat them like trained monkeys .
–
Behave as if they , the workers , have the brain capacity of a legume , and that you , the monkey trainer , are far superior to them .
Micro Manage . -
This also is part of monkey trainer syndrome .
If you want to micro manage , you must specify in agonizing minutia , what you want done and how you want it done .
This may sound like a good idea , but miss one small detail and the whole thing will be a mess .
If you need to micro manage , you should probably be doing it yourself , because it will never get done to your standards .
Always Criticize , Condemn , and Complain .
- Trained monkeys will never really understand what you are saying , however , they will usually cower in some manner due to the tone of your voice .
Things may change in their performance and behavior , but it is usually only temporarily , until you have to do it again , or they escape .
Do n't Praise Anyone . - Trained monkeys do n't need praise , they need treats , like bananas , so why waste the time on using praise , when it wo n't be appreciated anyway .
You have more important things to do .
Let them know that monkeys are a dime a dozen .
–
Make it very clear to all your monkeys that they are very easily replaced .
They should be grateful to you that you spend all your time : training , micro managing , criticizing , complaining , and condemning , and occasionally throwing bananas .
Employees are people .
They have feelings , independent thought , and aspirations to be more than a trained monkey ; as shocking as that may seem to some .
Treat them like a trained monkey and you will ensure that you wo n't get anything more from them than performing the basic trained task .
They wo n't contribute to the profitability or growth of the organization .
They wo n't be empowered , feel appreciated , or make any effort to help in your advancement or the company's .
If you treat your employees like trained monkeys , they may just act like it , and they will treat your customer as if they were trained monkeys too .
On August 1 , the Imperial capitals conservative daily , the Washington Times , carried an interesting opinion piece .
Paul Belien , author of A Throne in Brussels , warned against the peril of " liberal politicians , like Hillary Clinton " seeking to transform the U.S. into a more Europe - like welfare state .
Welfare statism , warned Belien , is a " dreaded affliction " that has destroyed Europe .
Secularism and liberalism alike seek to " replace God by the state . "
It is a bit disingenuous to blame " liberals " alone for the worship of State as god , when " conservatives " have been as guilty of it since 1945 .
To Belien , America must look like a land of true liberty .
But when you compare it to the tyranny in Brussels , that s not hard .
A Dreaded Affliction
Belien argues , convincingly , that the American revolution was about liberty , while the European revolutions that followed were about replacing absolute monarchies with totalitarian republics .
( Hans - Hermann Hoppe has done a superb analysis of just how " tyrannical " those old monarchies were , in Democracy : The God That Failed . )
From Jacobins to Bolsheviks , with each " revolution " Europe became less free .
Now , however , Belien sees the same hankering for an omnipotent State among American politicians as exists among their European counterparts .
More welfare , more planning , more control , more taxes , more laws if that were truly a solution , wouldnt Europeans have felt it by now ?
In fact , they have  only nowhere near the way American admirers of European welfare - statism would want people to think :
" Contemporary Europe is in crisis .
Its welfare systems are running out of money .
Its moral and legal order is breaking down , while the influence of radical Islam is growing .
Its nation - states are being undermined by the European Union .
Most Europeans look on passively .
After three generations of welfare dependency , they have lost the ability to take their fate into their own hands . " [ ]
" Europe does not particularly care about the future :
It is only interested in enjoying the present .
This attitude also explains why Europes demographics have collapsed .
People who are not prepared to make sacrifices for the future do not invest in children . "
Swapping Totalitarianisms
What about Eastern Europe , and all the countries that were under Soviet domination for decades ?
Havent they all been the most enthusiastic proponents of joining the EU ?
Far from being freedom - loving and principally opposed to tyranny , nations of Eastern Europe rose up against Communism because it failed to deliver on its promises of prosperity .
Very few dissidents from Lithuania to Bulgaria actually believed in individual liberty , and the general populace not at all .
After decades of indoctrination in public schools , the notion that individuals existed to serve the State had become as ingrained as the need to breathe .
Eastern Europeans embrace the EU precisely because it resembles the USSR : a promise of a welfare paradise .
Having only been the subjects of Brussels for a few years , they have not yet felt the effects of the system failing .
They will soon enough .
" EUrosis : A Critic of New Eurocentrism " ( Evroza : kritika novog evrocentrizma ) , a study by Slovenian culturologist Mitja Velikonja , was recently published in Belgrade .
Velikonja notes the uncanny similarity between the Slovenians worship of Europe and the worship of socialism in Yugoslavia ; the yellow stars of EU have replaced the Communist red , but its the same single - mindedness that has completely taken over society , a new totalitarianism in place of the old .
Once State has been accepted as god , it doesnt matter which state one serves , after all .
Suppressed Voices
Many American thinkers have warned of the dangers of statism .
Randolph Bourne wrote about war and the " the health of the State " in 1918 .
In the 1940s , F.A. Hayek illustrated the process in his Road to Serfdom , and Albert Jay Nock wrote of " Our Enemy , the State . "
Just as human beings breathe , eat and drink to survive , the State draws on conflict to not just maintain its existence , but to grow in size and scope .
This is very well illustrated by Robert Higgs in Crisis and Leviathan , a study of government expansion in times of crisis .
Few Americans know of these works today  courtesy , not surprisingly , of the state - monopolized education .
Instead of Mises and Rothbard , they are taught Keynes .
Instead of Jefferson , their idols are Lincoln , Wilson and FDR .
How soon before America goes the way of Europe ?
Will to Power
Part of the reason the Washington Times published Paul Beliens op - ed was surely to caution Americans from voting for " liberals . "
Yet no one in their right mind can argue that the past seven years of Emperor Bush have seen anything but an explosion of government power , scope and size .
All the " mainstream " candidates we incessantly hear about are squabbling over how to use Leviathans power , not whether that power should exist in the first place .
Only one candidate opposes the welfare - warfare state on principle , and he is deliberately and systematically ignored in the official discourse .
Meanwhile , the Emperor and his entourage are completely insouciant about the outcome of the 2008 presidential elections .
Perhaps  and this is going out on a limb  because they have no intention whatsoever of giving up power ?
After all , they have not built a massive apparatus of coercion over the past six years just to hand it over to Hillary Clinton !
Far - fetched ?
So was the notion of Iraqi WMDs .
Those who follow Bush in the corridors of power boast that their will shapes reality .
Imagining itself as God , the State accepts no limitations to its power .
It could happen here .
Maybe it already has .

We always get reports of sites that are down or somehow " wrong " .
Quite often it's a localized routing problem , other times it is a browser rendering issue , but when we get a report of a site down , more often than not there is no malicious activity .
Not this time .
After investigation by ISC Handlers Don Smith and Joel Esler in combination with site owner Jay Beale , Jay issued a statement here that began :
" Dear Bastille Linux Users ,
On the morning of September 11th , 2007 , alerted by handlers from the Internet Storm Center , I learned that one Mykhaylo Perebiynis purchased our Bastille Linux domain and is demanding $ 10,000 to return it to the project .
He appears to be in business as a domain squatter . "
Please make sure you read the full text of Jay 's announcement which includes the PGP fingerprint for the key he will be using to sign any downloads and critical e-mail announcements going forward .
At SANSFIRE this year , one of the comments during the Handlers forum panel discussion was that the reader was concerned about sending in reports that turn out to be incorrect ( because of a routing problem , browser issue , user error ... ) and " bother us " .
Do n't be .
This is a perfect example of how something that you might think we consider " routine " and not important turns out to be ( for Jay ) a major event .
In incident handling , the sooner the compromise is detected , the sooner it can be contained , eradicated and recovered from .
This time , the issue is relatively limited .
Next time ...

To achieve a very low refractive index , silica nanorods are deposited at an angle of precisely 45 degrees on top of a thin film of aluminum nitride .

A team of researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has created the world ’s first material that reflects virtually no light .
Reporting in the March issue of Nature Photonics , they describe an optical coating made from the material that enables vastly improved control over the basic properties of light .
The research could open the door to much brighter LEDs , more efficient solar cells , and a new class of " smart " light sources that adjust to specific environments , among many other potential applications .
Most surfaces reflect some light — from a puddle of water all the way to a mirror .
The new material has almost the same refractive index as air , making it an ideal building block for anti-reflection coatings .
It sets a world record by decreasing the reflectivity compared to conventional anti-reflection coatings by an order of magnitude .
From top , light reflecting off surfaces made from aluminum , silicon , and aluminum nitride .
At bottom is a piece of aluminum nitride coated with the new anti-reflection material .

A fundamental property called the refractive index governs the amount of light a material reflects , as well as other optical properties such as diffraction , refraction , and the speed of light inside the material .
" The refractive index is the most fundamental quantity in optics and photonics .
It goes all the way back to Isaac Newton , who called it the ‘ optical density , ’ " said E. Fred Schubert , the Wellfleet Senior Constellation Professor of the Future Chips Constellation at Rensselaer and senior author of the paper .
Schubert and his coworkers have created a material with a refractive index of 1.05 , which is extremely close to the refractive index of air and the lowest ever reported .
Window glass , for comparison , has a refractive index of about 1.45 .
Incredible New Things in Optics and Photonics
Scientists have attempted for years to create materials that can eliminate unwanted reflections , which can degrade the performance of various optical components and devices .
" We started thinking , there is no viable material available in the refractive index range 1.0 - 1.4 , " Schubert said .
" If we had such a material , we could do incredible new things in optics and photonics . "
So the team created one .
Using a technique called oblique angle deposition , the researchers deposited silica nanorods at an angle of precisely 45 degrees on top of a thin film of aluminum nitride , which is a semiconducting material used in advanced light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) .
From the side , the films look much like the cross section of a piece of lawn turf with the blades slightly flattened .
The technique allows the researchers to strongly reduce or even eliminate reflection at all wavelengths and incoming angles of light , Schubert said .
Conventional anti-reflection coatings , although widely used , work only at a single wavelength and when the light source is positioned directly perpendicular to the material .
A Broad Spectrum of Applications
The new optical coating could find use in just about any application where light travels into or out of a material , such as :
-- More efficient solar cells .
The new coating could increase the amount of light reaching the active region of a solar cell by several percent , which could have a major impact on its performance .
" Conventional coatings are not appropriate for a broad spectral source like the sun , " Schubert said .
" The sun emits light in the ultraviolet , infrared , and visible spectral range .
To use all the energy provided by the sun , we do n’t want any energy reflected by the solar cell surface . "
-- Brighter LEDs .
LEDs are increasingly being used in traffic signals , automotive lighting , and exit signs , because they draw far less electricity and last much longer than conventional fluorescent and incandescent bulbs .
But current LEDs are not yet bright enough to replace the standard light bulb .
Eliminating reflection could improve the luminance of LEDs , which could accelerate the replacement of conventional light sources by solid - state sources .
-- " Smart " lighting .
Not only could improved LEDs provide significant energy savings , they also offer the potential for totally new functionalities .
Schubert ’s new technique allows for vastly improved control of the basic properties of light , which could allow " smart " light sources to adjust to specific environments .
Smart light sources offer the potential to alter human circadian rhythms to match changing work schedules , or to allow an automobile to imperceptibly communicate with the car behind it , according to Schubert .
-- Optical interconnects .
For many computing applications , it would be ideal to communicate using photons , as opposed to the electrons that are found in electrical circuits .
This is the basis of the burgeoning field of photonics .
The new materials could help achieve greater control over light , helping to sustain the burgeoning photonics revolution , Schubert said .
-- High - reflectance mirrors .
The idea of anti-reflection coatings also could be turned on its head , according to Schubert .
The ability to precisely control a material ’s refractive index could be used to make extremely high - reflectance mirrors , which are used in many optical components including telescopes , optoelectronic devices , and sensors .
-- Black body radiation .
The development could also advance fundamental science .
A material that reflects no light is known as an ideal " black body . "
No such material has been available to scientists , until now .
Researchers could use an ideal black body to shed light on quantum mechanics , the much - touted theory from physics that explains the inherent " weirdness " of the atomic realm .
Schubert and his coworkers have only made several samples of the new material to prove it can be done , but the oblique angle evaporation technique is already widely used in industry , and the design can be applied to any type of substrate — not just an expensive semiconductor such as aluminum nitride .
Schubert is featured in an interview about the research in the same issue of Nature Photonics .
Several other Rensselaer researchers also were involved with the project : Professors Shawn - Yu Lin and Jong Kyu Kim ; and graduate students J.-Q. Xi , Martin F. Schubert , and Minfeng Chen .

A NYT article about the .01 Percent had a quote from Warren Buffet that caught my attention : " ' This is a significantly richer country than 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years ago , ' he declared , backing his assertion with a favorite statistic .
The national income , divided by the population , is a very abundant $ 45,000 per capita , he said , a number that reflects an affluent nation but also obscures the lopsided income distribution intertwined with the prosperity . "
This graph was an attempt to visualize that statistic .
( Keep in mind that the numbers are in 2000 US $ ) { Click on the graph to take a closer look}
The US Gross National Income ( GNI ) represents the total buying power of citizens of the United States .
This buying power can be transferred around the economy by taxation and lending .
GNI includes Wages and Salaries + Rents + Interest + Profits ( also includes Depreciation of Capital + Sales taxes - Subsidies ) .
Since it is " National " it measures income from resources owned by the citizens of the United States , regardless where the production occurs .
Gross national income is identical to gross national product ( GNP ) .

When the Wall Street Wizard could n’t unload his mortgage backed securities anymore , he started to scrap bits and pieces his weirder paper generating machinery :
Finance America : Gone
BNC : Gone
Aurora Loan Services : Uh , what ’s left of it will see a name change
Lehman Brothers bought these firms because they generated paper , and lots of it .
Lehman repackaged and sold that paper to other institutions — like foreign banks — that were flush with cash .
And who would n’t want a piece of that big , fat , juicy U.S. real estate bubble ?
What could possibly go wrong …
As long as interest rates were low and there were buyers for the debt products that Lehman was peddling , the band played on .
But as interests rates rose and terms like f@cked buyer and liar loan entered the discussion of the real estate bubble , one by one , Lehman closed down its paper mills and fired employees .
As we know , of course , the music stopped playing and Lehman got caught without a chair .
The fact that they have been forced to take several billion dollars worth of that dog shit paper onto their own books — as the supply of greater fools willing to buy it from them evaporated — seems like a semi-happy ending to this diabolical tale .
Not so fast .
The problem is that the $ 10.3 billion in paper that Lehman was forced eat represents just the tail end of the thing as the music stopped playing and their racket collapsed .
They have been generating and selling that stuff for years .
Where did it wind up , and when is it going to blow ?
I think that when might be easier to know than where :
Higher bars = more foreclosures = more liquidity problems months later
We are definitely not out of the woods with the subprime debacle .
In fact , we are in for a year of steady increases in foreclosures and liquidity problems .
There are no buyers for these securities now .
If banks are holding these bombs , they ’re stuck with them and the clock is ticking .
As those teaser rate loans reset , and f*cked buyers go bankrupt in increasing numbers ( see chart above ) , banks are going to have serious problems .
Which banks will be affected ?
I do n’t know .
Oh yeah , Lehman has decided to stop hiding behind the names of the mom and pop shops it acquired to run this game .
From here on out , it ’s going to be Lehman Mortgage Capital .
Man , if that ’s not a name you can trust , I do n’t know what is .
Via : Wall Street Journal :
Lehman , a big player in the bond market hit hard by the recent trouble in the “ subprime ” business of issuing risky mortgages that has shaken the broader stock market , set the tone in terms of markdowns , taking a $ 700 million loss on assets that have fallen in value in recent months .
At the same time , Chief Financial Officer Christopher O’Meara said “ the worst of the credit correction is behind us . ”
The $ 700 million in markdowns were cushioned , Mr. O’Meara said , by a combination of short , or bearish , positions on certain securities and a variety of hedges Lehman used to protect itself .
More broadly , he added , the firm ’s diverse business mix shielded it from more significant losses during the quarter .
Still , Mr. O’Meara said the difficulty of selling loan commitments to third parties and the lack of buyers for securitized mortgages caused Lehman to take $ 10.3 billion in assets onto its balance sheet , a move it would n’t likely have make under calmer market conditions .
Of that total , $ 4 billion is deal financing , and most of the remaining $ 6.3 billion is newly originated home loans that have n’t been sold off as part of securitized products , he said .
Bringing such loans and securities onto its books could subject Lehman to losses if markets continue to erode .
The move also ties up a portion of the firm ’s balance sheet it might have wanted to deploy elsewhere .
One data point investors focused on yesterday was the percentage markdown Lehman appeared to be taking on its leveraged loan commitments as it tried to sell off deal financing to third parties at depressed prices .

They can usually be seen pedaling madly on Manhattan streets , often against traffic , rushing to satisfy New Yorkers ’ capacious appetites for cold sesame noodles and General Tso ’s chicken .
But nowadays these restaurant deliverymen can increasingly be seen standing defiantly on the city ’s sidewalks , hoisting protest signs and shouting that they should be paid the minimum wage .
Call it the deliverymen ’s rebellion .
These workers , almost all of them immigrants from China , have picketed several Saigon Grill , Ollie ’s and Our Place outlets , accusing these well - known Asian restaurants of paying them as little as $ 1.40 an hour , far less than the federal and state minimum wage .
The workers have filed federal wage lawsuits in Manhattan against those restaurant companies , and their advocates say they will soon sue a dozen other restaurants in the city .
“ The conditions are pretty bad in all the restaurants , so there ’s no real advantage to switch to another restaurant , ” said Yu Guan Ke , a deliveryman who said Saigon Grill usually paid him just $ 120 in wages for his 75 - hour weeks .
“ Before we would accept whatever wages they would give us , but now we see we should stand up for what we ’re entitled to under the law . ”

Keith Olbermann and terrorism analyst Roger Cressey knocks down the lies and spin of Bush 's increasingly delusional assertions of al Qaeda in Iraq .
...it's completely misleading .
The organization that attacked us on 9/11 is still trying to attack us .
That is the group that is primarily on the Afghan / Pakistan border that you 've seen all the intelligence community assessments about in the past few days .
The group inside Iraq is very indigenous .
It 's a function of what happened in Iraq after Saddam was overthrown .
In effect , we 've actually helped create the conditions that allowed al Qaeda to take root in Iraq .
It 's clear that al Qaeda in Iraq has ideological sympathies with al Qaeda Central that clued there 's been some communication between the two , but it is false and misleading for the president to make that direct linkage that he did .
Even WaPo makes the distinction that Bush does not ( though , to my dismay , burying the lede deep within the article ) :
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s “ ganja guru ” will not have to go to jail but still plans to appeal felony marijuana convictions with the aim of renewing a courtroom fight over state and federal laws that are sharply at odds .
In this file photo medical marijuana patient Julian Gonzalez shows support for marijuana guru Ed Rosenthal outside the Federal building in San Francisco , January 31 , 2003 .
Rosenthal will not have to go to jail but still plans to appeal felony marijuana convictions with the aim of renewing a courtroom fight over state and federal laws that are sharply at odds .
REUTERS / Justin Sullivan
Ed Rosenthal , author of “ Why Marijuana Should Be Legal ” and other books , said on Saturday his battle with U.S. government is far from over and that he would appeal his conviction on marijuana cultivation , distribution and conspiracy charges .
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer on Friday sentenced Rosenthal , 62 , to a single day behind bars , saying the Oakland , California activist thought he was legally growing and distributing marijuana with the approval of Oakland city officials when he was arrested in 2002 .
Because of time already served , he faces no jail time .
Rosenthal was one of the first prominent marijuana activists tried by federal prosecutors for growing and distributing marijuana for medical purposes after California voters in 1996 approved that use .
“ I find marijuana to be exceptionally helpful , ” Rosenthal said , noting that while tangling in court with the U.S. government for the past five years he routinely used the drug for a medical condition , which he declined to detail .
Rosenthal predicted the U.S. government faces a losing fight against medical marijuana use in California despite having federal law on its side .
In a case involving a California woman who smokes marijuana to ease pain from an inoperable brain tumor , the San Francisco - based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in March found no fundamental right to marijuana for medical purposes and backed the 1970 federal Controlled Substances
Act barring the drug .
Californians do not seem to care about that ban to judge by the growing roster of “ cannabis clubs ” and medical marijuana dispensaries across the state , Rosenthal said .
“ They ’re so out of touch with the reality on the ground , ” Rosenthal said , referring to the federal government .
“ Are people in general going to stop ?
Yeah , just the way they stopped producing alcohol during Prohibition . ”
American Conservative , Thomas E. Woods Jr. —
“ Both liberals and at least some conservatives must share the blame for contributing to an ideological climate of which the inevitable outcome is the unrestrained executive under which our Republic now groans .
Ultimately , though , apportioning responsibility for this transformation of the presidency , in which its occupant can flagrantly and defiantly violate the law , is of much less urgency than addressing - and , one hopes , correcting - the present debacle . ”

Women who receive implants for breast enhancement are three times more likely to commit suicide , according to a new report that offered a sobering view of an increasingly popular surgery .
Deaths related to mental disorders , including alcohol or drug dependence , also were three times higher among women who had the cosmetic procedure , researchers said .
The report in the Annals of Plastic Surgery ’s August issue was the most recent to detect a higher suicide rate among women who had their breasts enlarged , providing a gloomy counterpoint to studies that showed women felt better about themselves after getting implants .
Though the study did not look at the reasons behind the suicides , senior author Joseph McLaughlin , a professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , said he believed that many had psychological problems before getting implants and that their conditions did not improve afterward .

Previous studies have shown that as many as 15 % of plastic surgery patients have body dysmorphic disorder , a condition marked by severe distress over minor physical flaws .
People with the disorder have a higher rate of suicidal thoughts and rarely improve after surgery .
Breast augmentation is the most popular cosmetic surgery in the U.S. , followed by liposuction and eyelid surgery .
Last year , 329,396 enlargements were performed , up 13 % from 2005 , according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons .
Controversy has long dogged the surgery .
Last year , the Food and Drug Administration lifted a 14 - year ban on silicone - filled implants after finding little evidence they were unsafe .
But the agency required manufacturers to run 10 - year studies of 10,000 women each to look for long - term consequences , including possible suicides .
The latest study analyzed data from 3,527 Swedish women who got implants between 1965 and 1993 .
Breast cancer patients who received reconstructive implants were not included .

Scientists tracked the women for as long as 29 years after their implant surgeries and found the suicide risk increased over time .
There was no higher risk in the first 10 years afterward , they said , but the risk was 4.5 times higher after 10 to 19 years and six times higher after 20 years .
David B. Sarwer , a University of Pennsylvania psychologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the report , said the results suggested that women experienced psychological improvement after surgery , but that it was not sustained .
Researchers said the results may have limited applicability to women today because breast augmentation is more acceptable than it was 40 years ago .
McLaughlin said the study underscored the need for the psychological screening of women seeking breast enhancement .

Back home in New York .
We had about 75 - 100 people come to the New York demo yesterday , along with an army of Fog Creek technical staff in matching sky blue kiwi polo shirts .
When I got back to my desk on Monday afternoon , I turned into the prototypical bastard client from hell .
Our web designers probably hate me .
I did the one thing that drives web design firms completely crazy : I suddenly took a look at the new web design they ’ve done for us , which I ’ve been approving every step of the way , and did n’t like it any more , so I told them we had to start over .
In one of Gerald Weinberg ’s books , probably The Secrets of Consulting , there ’s the apocryphal story of the giant multinational hamburger chain where some bright MBA figured out that eliminating just three sesame seeds from a sesame - seed bun would be completely unnoticeable by anyone yet would save the company $ 126,000 per year .
So they do it , and time passes , and another bushy - tailed MBA comes along , and does another study , and concludes that removing another five sesame seeds would n’t hurt either , and would save even more money , and so on and so forth , every year or two , the new management trainee looking for ways to save money proposes removing a sesame seed or two , until eventually , they ’re shipping hamburger buns with exactly three sesame seeds artfully arranged in a triangle , and nobody buys their hamburgers any more .
This is sort of what happened with our new web design .
We ’ve been tweaking it and polishing it and changing things carefully , and the firm we hired to design it has been taking us step - by - step through information architecture , site maps , wireframes , initial designs , and several rounds of design .
All with a carefully - designed process to get our buy - in at every step along the way .
And so far every step I thought the design was converging and we ’d get a nice web design out of it .
And then I came back after a week on the road , took one look at it , and thought , oh crap .
We ca n’t go public with that .
And they said , “ but wait , look here , it ’s right in Basecamp , you said that this design was ‘ excellent work ’ and you were ‘ elated ’ to have the ‘ best web design ever in the history of the universe . ' ”
True that .
I did say that .
I even thought that .
But a week later , the same basic design just looked terrible .
We ’ve been removing sesame seeds from the initial design they did in hopes of making things better , and , lo and behold , at some point the design flipped from being good to being bad .
Links had sprouted up all over the place , making it hard to tell where to go next and where you ’ve already been .
Most of the elegant whitespace in the original design was lost when we went from the original 1024 pixel wide design to an 800 pixel design .
The web designers had presumably been working on Macs and showing us bitmaps , but since the antialiasing technology is different , when we finally got the HTML , the page just felt completely different and had crossed into the realm of plain and , subjectively , ugly .
Ah , well .
We ’ll start over .
It ’s better to have something we ’re both proud off than to try and salvage the work done so far .
Sometimes you have to go all the way through the design process before you realize that you ’ve built the wrong thing , but it ’s ok , it ’s a learning experience , it ’s not the end of the world to take a deep breath and go back to step 1 .
Go to the fairground , get taken for a ride .
Yep , those sneaky Real Hustlers are at it again .
This time they 've been uncovering the basic tricks and cons performed by your friendly neighborhood fairground staff .
I looked these up before going to a fair ( just doing my homework , as any good Wisebread reader should ) and was quite glad I did .
Of course , I 'm not implying ALL carnivals rip you off .
No no no .
That would be a terrible thing to imply ( wink ) .
But take a look at some of the ' oldest tricks in the book ' and then decide for yourself whether you want to give your money away next time you fancy winning a giant teddy bear for the love of your life .
Note :
All of these videos were filmed in my home country , good old England , but the same rules apply around the world .
Where there 's a carnival or a fairground , there 's a con just waiting for a ' punter . '
Here we go ...
1 : The Steadfast Stack of Cans
Looks easy for any eagle - eyed ball thrower .
Just knock 'em down with three balls .
No problem .
Until you find out that three of the cans are light and three are heavy .
And the way they are stacked makes all the difference .
Check it out .
2 : One Dart , Many Balloons ... No Chance .
I can play darts .
No shock there , I spent many years after work in many a public house in London .
But I challenge even the sharpest of sharp shooters to pop one of these balloons .
The reason ... they 're really underinflated , making the skin thicker , and the dart is as blunt as a butter knife .
3 : Bottle Bowling BS
They were doing this trick hundreds of years ago on the streets of old London town , and it 's still working today .
The reason is that it looks very very easy to win , but it is in fact almost impossibe .
Knocking down two bottles with one ball is simple if the bottles are set - up evenly .
Bt if you offset them , one bottle takes all the energy out of the shot and the other bottle will almost always be left standing .
4 : Hoops Hoopla
I 'll be honest .
I 've tried this one a few times .
Most of the time , I did n't even get close .
Once I got so close I almost cheered .
But it was still a failure .
And that 's because the way the trick is set up makes the chances of winning almost zero .
The secret lies in the base ... an offset bunch of blocks covered in velvet that grab the hoop and stop it from sliding down .
Sneaky ?
You bet .
Would you like fries with that ? —
We ’ve all heard the line , but have you ever tried upselling when you ’re out facepainting ?
Alot of you would probably answer no , and some of you might be unclear about what up selling really is .
So before I go any further here is a definition from Wikipedia :
Up - selling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the consumer purchase more expensive items , upgrades , or other add - ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale .
Up - selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products , but up - selling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options he or she may not have considered previously .
If all you ’re doing is giving the customer what they asked for instead of giving the customer what they ’ve asked for AND asking them if they ’d like more — then you could be losing some serious money !
It ’s a known fact that if somebody is willing to spend money on a particular product or service , thirty percent of the time they ’ll spend even more , if the opportunity arises infront of them .
And it ’s your job to makesure that opportunity arises , you have to makesure that everyone who comes to your face painting booth , knows about your other services .
Now , you ’re probably thinking … but what can I offer as an upsell , what other services can I offer ?
And it ’s much simpler than you ’d think !
Temporary tattoos , stickers , extra body painting , glitter hair spray can all be used as upsells to squeeze a little extra cash out of your customers .

And it ’s done !
But you ’ve got to ask for it , otherwise the parent would n’t have known .
And remember if a sixteen year old at McDonalds can do it , then so can you !

But roundness , he said , is not a very interesting attribute to use in classifying astronomical bodies .
“ A Plutophile is well served by this definition , ” he said .
“ It is one of the few that allow you to utter Pluto and Jupiter in the same breath . ”
But Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo. , called the definition “ a nice solution that works both inside and outside the solar system . ”
Everybody agrees that a little clarity is needed when it comes to categorizing the members of the solar system .
The proposed definition would come as a relief to schoolchildren and others who have rallied to the cause of Pluto .
The planet ( if that is what it is ) has been an oddball ever since Clyde Tombaugh spied it wandering in the outer reaches of the solar system beyond Neptune in 1930 .
Not only is it much smaller than the other eight planets , only a fiftieth the mass of Earth , but its orbit is unusually elliptical and inclined to the plane that marks the orbits of the other planets .
In recent decades , however , other objects with orbits like Pluto ’s have been discovered in the Kuiper Belt , a junkyard of icy debris beyond Neptune .
Many astronomers began to argue that it made more sense to think of Pluto as a Kuiper Belt object , a minor planet instead of a planet .
When it was reported that the Hayden Planetarium had done just that in its new Rose Center , which opened in 2000 , a firestorm erupted .
Schoolchildren rushed to the defense of lonely little Pluto .
Two years ago , the International Astronomical Union appointed a group to come up with a definition that would resolve this tension .
The group , led by Iwan Williams of Queen Mary University in London , deadlocked .
This year a new group with broader roots took up the problem .
After a sleepless night in Paris this spring , what Dr. Gingerich calls a miracle took place : “ We had reached unanimous agreement . ”
In a nod to the idea of classifying Pluto with the Kuiper Belt , the group proposed calling planets with elongated orbits beyond Neptune “ Plutons , ” while emphasizing that they would still be planets .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
An elderly man nearing death who wants to give something back to the world , or just a prankster ?
The mystery of who is leaving envelopes of 10,000 yen ( $ 82 ) bills in men ’s toilets at government offices around Japan has gripped the nation this week despite the existence of far weightier issues , such as a looming election .
Since April 9 , some 4 million yen ( $ 32,720 ) has been found in men ’s rooms from the northernmost island of Hokkaido to the southern island of Okinawa , Japanese media say .
Virtually all has been found in government office buildings .
The bills are individually wrapped in traditional Japanese “ washi ” paper with the word “ remuneration ” handwritten on the outside in ink .
Each comes with a handwritten letter in formal wording evoking Buddhist language , saying the giver hopes the money will be “ useful for your pursuit of knowledge . ”
Newspapers have devoted lengthy articles to speculation about the identity of the unknown benefactor , and the mystery dominated evening news programs on Wednesday .
One domestic news agency even sent out urgent alerts as the number of bills found mounted .
The only thing everyone agrees on , given where the money is found , is that the person leaving them is a man .
The wording of the letter suggests a man with strong religious beliefs to some experts quoted in the media , while others think he is a former civil servant trying to cheer those in the same job , often the target of citizen anger .
Still others believe the message may actually be a sarcastic reproof telling civil servants to clean up their act .
Handwriting experts say the letters are all written by the same person , whose shaky handwriting suggests somebody elderly or seriously ill , and note that the writing has worsened over the months since the first set of bills was found .
“ The fact that the letters end with the phrase ‘ please be happy ’ points to somebody who ’s unhappy themselves -- who ’s perhaps facing up to their death and wants to give something back to the world , ” the Asahi Shimbun quoted one expert as saying .
But others think the man is a prankster who wants to create a stir in society while remaining unknown .
Their proof is that the envelopes are left in toilets -- which lack security cameras .
The money has been handed to the police , but if nobody claims the cash within six months it will be given to the finders .
Never before did I witness the Congress of the United States of America working so tirelessly and feverishly to undermine the American people as they were trying to do through this illegal immigration bill .
It offends the senses as they many of them were looking to place this country further in debt by allowing for these illegal immigrants to enroll in our Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid programs .
Those programs are paid for by the American people through their hard earned wages in which a great percentage of it goes to the federal government .
Americans are being taxed right out of their homes as property taxes continue to rise .
They are being hit the hardest when it comes to increased food prices due to increased gasoline prices and we want to know ; where is our federal government to help those who are legal citizens of this country ?
I want to know exactly where congress is to confront this price gouging by the oil companies .
How about going after the profits made by these oil companies and returning those profits to the American people through rebates ?
You want our support in your re-election , then you must do so with a veto proof bill .
How about a veto proof jobs bill that will put many Americans back to work who have lost their jobs due to outsourcing ?
What about the repeal of NAFTA and other programs like it ?
Yes , we live in a global society , but does our participation in it have to come at the expense of the American people ?
How about going after offshore bank accounts that shield corporations from paying federal income taxes to help the Middle Class ?
We need a break !
As many Americans still go without health care ; how about going after the HMOs and other insurance companies to demand they implement programs in which all Americans will be covered with at least some form of health insurance ?
Americans are growing increasingly angry at these special interest groups being in the pockets of our elected officials .
Corporations are not people .
In regards to the war in Iraq , over 3,500 of our soldiers have now died and I would like to know where the outrage of our congress in totality to end this war is .
I would like to see coming from our congress a veto proof bill that will finally end this war and its bloodletting .
How many more soldiers must give of their life for companies like Halliburton , KBR , Bechtel and the list is endless .
To our congress distance yourselves from these special interest groups .
For once in your life be on the side of the American tax payer who is funding this illegal war .
When the Iraq War Resolution was being debated , Senator Robert Byrd made an impassioned speech before an empty senate on March 19th , 2003 and yet it seems that every senator was on hand to make his / her thoughts known concerning this illegal immigration bill .
Where were their voices to halt this illegal invasion of Iraq ?
No where to be seen .
Only the brave stood on the side of truth and the others cowered in their complicity .
Speaking of our military , where was your fervor when it was reported that our soldiers were only given a $ 6 dollar raise in pay ?
They who put their lives on the line along with their family members should come before those who illegally entered this country .
All of you speak of securing this nation ; yet where is your voice when it comes to two border agents , Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean who were locked up in prison and who are now serving 11 to 12 years respectively for doing their jobs ?
Both of these men were only protecting all of us from a recidivist drug dealer , Osbaldo Aldrete - Davila .
Oh and the last I heard he is suing for his injuries to the tune of $ 5 million dollars .
Enough is enough and he should be incarcerated and our border agents given a pardon by President Bush .
Those border agents should and must be returned to duty to help protect the American people from illegal drugs that are coming across our broken borders .
Terrorist organizations are funded through the sale of these illegal drugs that are killing our citizens .
Through this illegal immigration bill , if a gang member severed his / her ties with gangs , they would have been allowed to stay in our country .
Excuse me ?!
Whose brilliant idea was that one ?
This illegal immigration bill would have driven down the wages earned by legal citizens of this country since employers would have chosen illegal immigrants to work for them over tax paying American citizens .
Also speaking of the funding of this illegal war , the hike in the minimum wage was added onto that bill .
Where is a veto proof bill that would have increased the minimum wage for legal citizens of this country ?
When so many tax paying Americans find it increasingly hard to send their children to college this ‘ Grand Compromise ’ as Lou Dobbs has called it , would have helped to fund college tuition for illegal immigrants .
I do not see that as being fair to those who elected these people into office .
It has been reported on Lou Dobbs Tonight that the number of independent voters is increasing due to this run-away freight train known as the federal government .
I have since left the Democratic Party and was also a member of the Republican Party .
I am one of those newly independent voters within the United States that is not seeing real leadership coming from both parties on behalf of the American people .
To those who are angry at those of us who did not support this bill and may see us as being racist , nothing is farther from the truth .
All we wanted to see was equal treatment under the law .
It is the laws of this nation that should and must be upheld if this republic is to survive .
To do otherwise would have been treasonous to the American people .
In closing , I was only happy to see those who backed this horrific bill publicly humiliated .
To the presidential candidates of both parties , it is your primary duty to stand on the side of legal citizens of this country .
After all , it will be legal citizens of this country who will be going to the polls .
My message to congress is get back to work on behalf of legal American citizens .
We have spoken and now you must listen .

Beckham had his right knee bandaged after being substituted
The 32 - year - old is expected to be out for six weeks , meaning he will not return until mid-October .
England name their squad on Friday for matches against Israel at Wembley on 8 September and Russia four days later .
Beckham , who only recently recovered from an ankle injury , hurt his knee in LA Galaxy 's Superliga final defeat to Pachuca on Wednesday .
The Galaxy lost the match to the Mexicans 4 - 3 on penalties .
After a scan on Thursday , the team said in a statement that Beckham had suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee .
606 : DEBATE
It means Beckham faces a race to be fit in time for the culmination of the Galaxy 's season .
Their last game of the regular season is on 21 October .
The Galaxy 's website said : " Beckham was diagnosed with a sprained right knee and is scheduled to undergo further tests to determine the extent of the injury today but said after the match that he felt discomfort . "
It added : " He now might miss some significant time for the Galaxy and England . "
Beckham joins Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney on the sidelines while Steven Gerrard is a doubt for the crucial Euro 2008 qualifiers .
Remember the film of Nick Hornby 's High Fidelity ?
In it , John Cusack pulls out a CD and , turning to his colleagues at Championship Vinyl , soberly states : " I will now sell four copies of The Three EPs by the Beta Band . "
One 30 second burst of said CD later and , sure enough , customers are bobbing their heads , a queue has formed and the cash register is ringing .
Broadly speaking , this is how music recommendation used to work .
A combination of record shop gurus , radio playlists , media taste makers and ( perhaps most importantly ) mates with cool record collections did most of the groundwork in determining what we , as consumers , would listen to .
Now , of course , in the Long - Tailed bottom - up Web 2.0 world that - allegedly - thrust the Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen into the limelight , the old model is supposedly being turned on its head .
Certainly , a recent study by the web traffic measurement company Hitwise appears to confirm significant patterns in online consumer behaviour ; in particular , that social networking sites such as MySpace and Bebo are now established as key vehicles to discovering new music .
The intention of the survey , which tracked the movements of approximately 8.43 m UK internet users in the week ending November 18 , was to map the UK's online music ecosystem ( consisting of some 3,436 websites ) and illustrate the interconnectedness between music websites .
In a nutshell , it would reveal where music - related traffic was coming from and where it was going to - tracing the complex click flow between major portals such as MySpace , Yahoo ! and BBC Radio 1 right out to the peripheries ( such as the homepages for Hanson and the McFly bassist , Dougie Poynter ) .
Influential sites
The resulting network maps are " a bit of a bird 's nest " , admits Heather Hopkins , Hitwise UK 's director of research .
But , she adds , " the social network sites , the online music retailers , the lyric sites , the download sites are all part of this music ecosystem .
Some sites are obviously more influential than others , but to some extent they all rely on one another . "
In fact , the nest could have been messier still .
Because Hitwise can only measure traffic travelling between websites , the network maps do not include activity from desktop applications such as iTunes - or , come to think of it , illegal P2P networks - while services classed as online radio stations were also off the radar .
Nevertheless , despite being dominated by Google ( a third of all visits to UK music websites start at the world 's most popular search engine ) the most intriguing aspect of Hitwise 's analysis is the data returned from community and chat sites , which accounted for 10.4 % of all visits to music websites .
Of these , 61 % were " downstream " - that is , coming - from MySpace , 10 % from Bebo and 4 % from YouTube .
In that particular week , Hitwise recognised MySpace Music as the UK 's number one music website .
" That 's the thing that really jumps off - the importance of social networks and how integrated they are into people 's activity online in discovering and doing music - related activity , " says Hopkins .
The other key insight was the informed nature of music consumers ' online search processes .
" Rather than being driven by links , we 're seeing a lot of traffic that 's simply from people naturally navigating through the Web . "
Gateways to discovery
How revealing such statistics are is perhaps open to question .
With music and taste being so completely subjective , discovery and recommendation is a very complicated business , says Tim Grimsditch , strategy director at the music strategy agency Frukt .
These days , he says , web - savvy consumers are likely to simply forage for information .
" You 'll have a little session on MySpace and either it 's fruitful or it's not .
If it 's not then you 'll be off checking the Guardian music site or Channel 4 or whatever .
It seems a bit simplistic to say that the order [ of importance ] is Google and then MySpace and so on . "
Grimsditch agrees that social networks have become key gateways to music discovery .
This should not be viewed as a wholly new phenomenon , but rather an extension of traditional human recommendation relationships .
So , instead of mates with cool record collections , users of MySpace and Bebo can access the knowledge of huge volumes of " friends " on a global scale .
" MySpace is interesting because it lets you learn about new bands through the people you like , " says Grimsditch .
" That 's more like social recommendation , as opposed to a direct search .
So I think that MySpace probably is quite important , and I know anecdotally of people who do find new bands through using it . "
The same basic principles are also evident in the growth of Last.fm , says Martin Stiksel , chief operating officer and cofounder of the service - a social network for music recommendation which can also work as an online radio station .
It captures ( or " scrobbles " ) the music played by its 15 m users and connects them to others with similar tastes .
" In the real world , you go round to a friend 's place and he or she plays you a tune and that 's that .
You trust their judgment because you know what else they listen to .
If you know that some guy is into redneck rock 'n ' roll and you 're into dance , then maybe you wo n't trust their judgement , but Last . fm will filter those people out . "
But it is not only fans who are benefiting from social recommendation .
When they 're not chasing them through the courts , record labels are also harnessing the power of community sites to propagate marketing campaigns - usually by creating free content that can be embedded into a fan 's MySpace or Bebo page , and shared with other users on the network .
A good example was the special Flash video player created for Kasabian 's single Shoot The Runner .
Hosted on the MySpace pages and blogs of more than 2,000 fans , the players garnered far more views collectively than the band 's official website .
For Daniel Ayers , head of digital marketing at Columbia Records , this is simply an acknowledgement that fans are shifting away from artists ' websites .
" The rationale is that fans do n't come to us any more , " he says .
" They 've got their own sites where they want to stay and do their talking . "
Having rolled out this strategy across the label , the obvious next step , says Ayers , is to get fans to do the thing the label values - sell content .
" We 've got all these people acting as ambassadors for our artists and so , in exactly the same way as Amazon has an affiliate sales scheme , we could , theoretically , start putting links to buy whatever the product is into the player .
And we then make everyone using them an affiliate and give them a cut . "
A variation on this concept of " super- distribution " - where , rather than search for the music , the music will find you - is being trialled by EMI with the recently - launched eListeningpost service .
This system allows fans to email " secure " tracks or video to their friends .
These can be played up to five times before being forwarded to the next user , with the option of buying directly from the label or artist .
Rumours abound that superdistribution may feature as part of a commission - based strategy for Microsoft 's Zune - rewarding those who share content with Zune Marketplace Points .
Of course , while we wait for this viral evolution , the concept of top - down recommendation will not be relegated completely .
Indeed , for the cash - rich time - poor consumer , one side effect of having an inbox overloaded with new music may well be a return to more trusted and familiar filters .
Certainly , Nokia 's Recommenders service , which collates tips from over 40 independent record shops worldwide , could n't be more traditional ; while , with over 30 years ' retail experience and plans to migrate its Album Club subscription service online in 2007 , the new MP3 store of Rough Trade records in London has made staff recommendations a key USP .
" We 've built our reputation as a destination for introducing new music on the merits of the music alone , and for our ability to pluck out the gems and pass them on , " says shop co-director Stephen Godfrey .
" We want to bring some of that treasure trove feel , where people come into the shop for one thing , but leave with four things that they 've never heard of .
That 's the authority of recommendations we provide and recognition that people like to discover things in a slightly more human way . "
Evidence , perhaps , that nothing beats the personal touch .
And while social networks are opening the floodgates to new music , the spirit of Nick Hornby will probably live on for some time yet .

I asked about the new chief justice , and Stevens compared him with his predecessor , William H. Rehnquist .
He praised Roberts as “ obviously very , very smart , a very , very nice guy ; he ’s got a wonderful sense of humor . ”
He continued , “ He does a fine job of running the conference , as Bill Rehnquist did , although I ’m not sure I ’m going to agree with him any more than I agreed with Bill Rehnquist . ”
I asked whether Roberts would succeed in his stated goal of persuading his colleagues to issue narrow , unanimous opinions .
“ I do n’t think so , ” Stevens replied .
“ I just think it takes nine people to do that . ”
He noted that Roberts had “ a bit of a honeymoon period ” during his first term .
“ I think maybe the first few months we all leaned over backward to try to avoid writing separately in a couple of opinions , ” he said , “ but I do n’t think that will last . ”
In general , Stevens said , the idea that a justice can sway his colleagues through collegiality and personal lobbying — a talent often attributed to Justice William J. Brennan Jr. — is exaggerated .
He suggested that in most cases , justices cannot be swayed to change their votes once they make up their minds , and when they can be swayed , it is only as a result of legal arguments , not charm or charisma .
“ I was very fond of Bill Brennan — loved the guy and had great admiration for him , ” Stevens said .
“ But it ’s simply not right to say that he was able to craft the majority .
He just had five votes on his side ! ”
Stevens himself , however , has been notably successful in building majorities by courting his fellow justices — in particular , Kennedy .
His methods of persuasion are intellectual rather than personal , and they are closely tied to the court ’s procedure for deciding cases .
After the justices hear the oral arguments , they meet in a private conference to deliberate .
After the chief justice speaks , each of the remaining justices speaks in order of seniority , so that Stevens speaks second .
Then the justices vote , and the majority opinion is assigned .
The majority opinion later circulates among the justices , and on rare occasions a justice may then change his or her vote , and a majority can become a dissent .
But “ you very rarely win votes if there are n’t five votes persuaded after our conference , ” Stevens stressed .
“ Very rare . ”
When he is in the majority , Stevens is careful not to lose votes that start off on his side , often assigning the opinion to Kennedy when Kennedy seems to be on the fence .
“ Sometimes , ” he told me , “ in all candor , if you think somebody might not be solid ” after casting a vote in conference , “ it might be wiser to let that person write the opinion , ” because after defending a position at length , people “ tend to become even more convinced ” than when they started .
For example , Stevens was effective in winning over Kennedy by asking him to write the majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas , the 2003 decision striking down sodomy laws , which many liberals consider the Brown v. Board of Education of the gay rights movement .
“ It worked out O.K. , ” Stevens told me , with typical understatement .
“ I do n’t know if I ’m entitled to the credit or Tony ’s entitled to the credit , because he wrote an exceptional opinion . ”
In other cases , Stevens has written the majority opinion himself in an effort to shore up Kennedy ’s vote .
In April , for example , in a 5 - to - 4 case , the court allowed a lawsuit to proceed against the Environmental Protection Agency for its refusal to regulate global warming under the Clean Air Act ; by citing several of Kennedy ’s previous opinions in his own opinion , Stevens persuaded Kennedy to stay in the liberal camp .
On the issue of abortion , however , Stevens has failed to persuade Kennedy to vote consistently with the liberals .
I asked Stevens about the decision last term in which Kennedy , writing for the five more conservative justices , upheld the federal ban on partial - birth abortion .
Stevens said that the federal ban was deeply flawed and that Kennedy ’s rhetoric about the need to protect women from the emotional trauma of abortions was frustrating .
But he noted that the real - world effect of the defeat was minimal because of the widespread availability of alternative abortion procedures .
“ The statute is a silly statute , ” he said .
“ It ’s a silly statute . ”
He added , “ It ’s just a distressing exhibition by Congress , but what we decided is n’t all that important . ”
I asked whether Stevens thought the right to abortion recognized in Roe v.
Wade would survive in his lifetime .
“ Well , it ’s up to Justice Kennedy , ” he replied .
“ I do n’t know about the two new justices ” — Roberts and Alito — “ but I kind of assume it may well be up to him . ”
Abortion rights supporters may take solace in the fact that Stevens indicated that Kennedy seemed to view the regulation of so - called partial - birth abortions as consistent with Planned Parenthood v. Casey , which upheld the central holding of Roe v. Wade .
“ I do n’t think he thinks this ” — the recent abortion opinion — “ requires him to change his views at all , ” Stevens said .
“ We ’ll have to wait and see .
I suppose there are a lot of people out there praying I get out of the way . ”
Stevens was born on April 20 , 1920 , the youngest of four boys .
His paternal grandfather , James W. Stevens , made a fortune as the founder of the Illinois Life Insurance company , and in 1927 , his father , Ernest J. Stevens , built the Stevens Hotel in Chicago , now the Hilton Chicago , which he called “ the largest and finest hotel in the world . ”
Built for a staggering price of $ 30 million , the Stevens hotel included 3,000 guest rooms , a movie theater and an ice cream factory .
As Charles Lane reported in a Washington Post article in 2005 about Stevens ’s childhood , young Stevens and his brothers posed as models for the bronze sculptures by the grand stairway .

A four - year study on iron metabolism within cells , an essential process that impacts both iron deficiency and iron toxicity , conditions responsible for a multitude of human diseases , is underway at the University at Buffalo funded by a $ 1.16 million grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) .
Daniel Kosman , Ph.D. , professor of biochemistry in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences , is lead researcher on the study .
" The concern about how iron is managed in our cells has never been more acute , " said Kosman .
" The reasons for this are three - fold .
First is the endemic problem of iron deficiency that the World Health Organization estimates afflicts 80 percent of the world 's population , or more than 5 billion people .
" Iron deficiency is not confined to developing nations .
In the U.S. , 5 percent of newborns and 7 percent of new mothers have clinical symptoms of iron deficiency .
Reducing the incidence of this nutritional deficit is one of the objectives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ' Healthy People 2010 program .
" Second is the broad recognition that the ' corrosive chemistry ' associated with iron and oxygen interactions is a major factor in a multitude of human diseases . "
Too much iron in tissues , called iron - loading , is thought to increase the risk of tumor development , infection , cardiomyopathy , joint disorders and several endocrine and neurodegenerative disorders .
" And third , we now have an increasingly sophisticated knowledge and understanding of iron metabolic pathways , the proteins involved in these pathways and how these pathways are regulated in all organisms , making this issue ripe for investigation , " he said .
Kosman proposes that a general mechanism of cellular iron metabolism requires that iron - handling proteins involved in sequential steps in the pathway must be " architecturally arranged " contiguously in the cell 's membranes , at the interfaces between membranes and soluble compartments or within soluble compartments .
The researchers will test this form - function model of ionic iron metabolism by focusing on three steps critical to maintaining the proper balance of iron in cells : 1 ) the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron and the subsequent transport of ferrous iron into a cell ; 2 ) the " hand - off " of this ferrous iron from a membrane protein to iron chaperones in the cell 's cytoplasm ; and 3 ) the utilization of this ionic iron for the activation of essential iron - containing enzymes .
" These three components of cellular iron metabolism are relatively under - investigated , " said Kosman , " yet they represent the essence of cell iron metabolism in all organisms . "
Understanding the intermediary metabolism of iron is one of the primary objectives of a program announcement from NIH titled " Metals In Medicine , " he noted .
This announcement encourages studies that lead to the " identification and characterization of the macromolecular players and vesicular compartments involved in metal ion homeostasis and metal trafficking . "
Arvinder Singh , Ph.D. , a post - doctoral research associate in Kosman 's lab ; and William E. Wiltsie , a doctoral candidate in biochemistry , also will be involved in the research .
In a demonstration of the stubborn arrogance and denial that have characterized this Administration , embattled Attorney General Gonzales said he 1 ) did n't know why two of the U.S. Attorneys ( Daniel Bogden and Margaret Chiara ) were purged , 2 ) never looked at the eight U.S. Attorneys ' performance reviews , 3 ) could n't remenber his Oct. 11 meeting with Bush , who has publicly confirmed the meeting , 4 ) could n't remember the high - level November 27 meeting in his office suite to finalize the firings , and 5 ) could n't remember when de decided to execute the firings ( " I recall making the decision .
I do n't recall when the decision was made " ) . . . but maintains that it was the " right decision . "
He said with a straight but strained face , " While the process that led to the resignations was flawed , I firmly believe that nothing improper occurred . "
Then , in the carefully - crafted denial he had memorized , he said , " It would be improper to remove a U.S. Attorney to interere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan political gain . "
Here , he used the crucial words he needed to utter to keep his ass out of jail : improper , interfere , influence , partisan , political -- hitting all the elements in one sentence .
After having three weeks to practice not lying , one would think he would have done a better job " recalling " and " remembering " key details of his involvement in the massacre , which he said he could not recollect 71 times , including a crucial conversation with his buddy and co-conspirator , Bush , who " was pleased with the Attorney General 's testimony " yesterday .
But the Republicans said it best .
Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) asked , " Is this really performance - based , or did these people just run afoul of personality conflicts in the office and we were trying to make up reasons to fire them because we wanted to get rid of them ? "
Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) said , " I 'm really concerned about your recollection , really , because it 's not that long ago .
It was an important issue . "
John Conryn ( R - Tex ) said , " I have to tell you that the way that this investigation has been handled has just been -- been really deplorable . "
The most conservative committee member , Republican Tom Coburn ( R - Okla ) told Gonzo , " I believe there 's [ sic ] consequences for mistakes . . .
And I believe the best way to put this behind is your resignation . "
But Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the ranking Republican on the Committee and the main one whose words really matter , said " The reality is that your characterization of your participation is just significantly , if not toally , at variance with the facts , " but stopped short of publicly calling for Gonzales ' resignation .
The Justice Department viewed Specter 's restraint as a " positive barometer " ( their words ) , which sets the bar so low that it 's under two inches of dirt .
I suggest that we now apply to Gonzales his own criteria for removal of the ousted U.S. Attorneys : " These were not the right people at the right time . "
Earlier this year , after many years of anticipation , I , too , reached Kisangani .
Conrad recounted how , as a nine - year - old , he had been fascinated by the empty map of Africa and had longed to go to this country .
I , too , had imagined the great walls of trees , the river sweeping 1,000 miles up from the south and then bending west towards the Atlantic , the Pygmies , the diamonds and what many writers have referred to as the " green heart of the world " .
Unlike Conrad , I had to make the journey by plane .
A decade of civil war that began in the 1990s has cost a conservative two million lives and led to endless destruction and political turmoil since .
Central Congo is no longer at war , but Kisangani and the upper Congo are more isolated and harder to reach than they were 100 years ago .
Instead of the 10 or more river boats that every day used to ply between the capital , Kinshasa , and Kisangani , there are only a few barges now .
Kisangani is not a disappointment .
There 's nothing left of the trading station of the 1890s , and precious little of the once - prosperous Stanleyville built for 5,000 colonials in the 20s .
The whole of the city in the jungle is now crumbling in the steaming heat and most of its buildings are pockmarked after three major battles in 10 years , fought in its streets , between Ugandan and Rwandan armies .
It is a beleaguered , impoverished , shot - up hole , a dangerous frontier town with a busted economy , but it is still one of Africa 's great trading centres and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's ( DRC ) third largest city .
There are streets of diamond dealers waiting for the many miners who slip in with their small hidden packages in hope of riches ; ivory traders , fishers , coffee growers , former soldiers , nuns , cloth merchants and chancers .
Perhaps 400,000 people live here today , and while the palm oil and clothing factories have shut , activity hums around the great Catholic cathedral and the mile - wide river it overlooks .
There are few cars , the parks have been dug up , and roads to the city are mostly passable only on a motorbike .
But the mobile phones work even if the electricity does not and the whole place throbs with life .
Apart from Kisangani 's setting , above Stanley Falls , on the great bend of the river Congo , Conrad would recognise little , mainly because the dense jungle that framed his novel and reached to the edge of Kurtz 's trading post is being felled at an alarming rate .
The only way to find out what is happening in Congo 's jungles today is to go by boat with locals .
I hook up with René Ngongo , a young Congolese academic who runs Ocean , an ecological group based in Kinshasa .
With us come Stephan Van Praet , Greenpeace International Africa forest campaign coordinator , and Jean - Faustin Lakondo and Joel Bofando , two young MPs who have just been elected to Equator province 's first parliament .
We hire a 30 ft - long pirogue , or dugout canoe , and set off down river for the village of Isangi , their home territory , on the edge of the great forest a day away .
Isangi is spread along the banks of the Congo at its junction with the river Lomami .
All seems calm when we arrive , but it is clear from a meeting held outside the school at dusk that people are greatly agitated .
Four years ago , Safbois , a part - American , part Belgian - owned conglomerate , was awarded a massive logging concession of more than 100,000 square miles just to the south of the town , and it is now felling the forest for the precious afrormosia tree - African teak .
One by one in the sweaty night , members of local human rights groups , churchmen , villagers and government officers stand up to condemn the company which they say will profit from their trees while providing little or nothing for them : their hunting grounds are being destroyed , their access to wild food denied , there are no jobs .
" I see the logs going down the river , and it makes me cry , " one villager says .
" Our forests are being stolen from us , " says another .
" It is misery for the communities .
Safbois has come in and is taking our future .
We do not know what to do . "
" With the loss of forest we have much more death and illness , " says a third .
" But it is with our complicity , if foreigners profit from our forests , " says a teacher .
They accuse the government of harassment and Safbois of failing to keep its promises .
When a company is granted a concession from central government to log in Congo , it must sign an agreement with the local chiefs and hereditary landowners who give permission for it to extract the trees in return for development packages .
In this case , on September 15 2004 , Safbois signed a contract with three villages to build three schools and hospitals , to repair roads , employ some local people , and provide four motorbikes and 160 bicycles for the village .
Many recognise echoes of the past in this arrangement .
In Conrad 's day , Congo was the Congo Free State , the personal property of King Leopold of Belgium - later , in 1908 , the Belgian state took over and it became Belgian Congo .
The king , together with the explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley ( famed for his supposed greeting , " Dr Livingstone , I presume " ) , devised the concession system whereby the country was carved up into vast tranches for companies to do with what they liked , so long as they paid the king 50 % of their income .
Stanley himself persuaded 450 chiefs to sign treaties allowing companies access to their resources .
Few had any idea what they were signing away in exchange for the cloth , trinkets , alcohol and other cheap goods they were given .
" History is repeating itself , " Bofando says .
" We are being forced to hand over our forests for nothing .
It is leading to misery . "
Yafunga , four or more hours away , is one of the villages promised a school by Safbois .
We make our way to the village , but there is clearly no new school .
There is a makeshift shelter made of greenwood , half - covered in the thinnest imaginable corrugated iron , but it has no sides , no floor , no windows .
One big storm would bring it down .
" This is meant to be the new school for 120 students , " says the headteacher , Give Juvenal Lomata .
" Look at it .
They promised us a school and signed a contract 30 months ago .
Nothing has happened .
It is an insult .
It would have been better if they had given us the materials .
They broke their promises to children . "
The villagers convene a meeting in Yafunga church .
Here , they discover for the first time how much their afrormosia wood is worth in Europe .
One tree trunk , Van Praet says , can sell for $ 2,000 in Kinshasa and , when sawn , $ 10,000 or more in Europe - many times what a whole village could earn in a year .
They are angry and shocked .
" Did you know the value of the trees when the contract was signed ? " I ask .
" No , no , no , " the crowd shout .
" Did the company tell the community the value ? "
" No , " they say .
" Did the chief tell you ? "
" No . "
They send for the chief , who is in his 50s and clearly upset .
" I did not know , " he says .
" I had no idea of the profits that can be made from the trees .
A grave injustice has been done . "
Almost in tears , he tells people in the church how the contract was signed .
" We were forced to sign the paper .
We really had no say .
The meeting with the company started at 11 pm and finished at 3 am .
The police were there and the military and the authorities .
We felt threatened .
We were not allowed to ask questions .
It was intimidation .
The next day we were told we could say nothing .
We are afraid of the authorities .
We had to sign it . "
So we go to see Safbois , accompanied by a crowd of villagers .
The company has built a small port where once there was a graveyard and a village shop on the edge of the pristine Lomami river ; there is no one around .
Later we find Florimont Ugalomaswa , the company 's personnel officer , at its logging camp , where hundreds of huge afrormosia logs are waiting in the yard to be shipped to Kinshasa , then exported to Europe .
Ugalomaswa tries to defend the company against charges that it employs few people from the villages nearby .
" When we came here we needed people with experience .
We could not find chauffeurs , drivers or chainsaw men , " he says .
" We employ 83 people , including 30 - 35 day workers from the communities . "
" They are paid less than $ 1 a day , " one man says .
" Where is the school that you promised two and a half years ago ? " asks an angry woman .
" The school is there ! " Ugalomaswa says .
The villagers laugh .
" We have said we would build a school in each community , but we have had three directors of the company here in three years .
The problem has been changes in management .
Things happen now .
We are building the schools . "
" Where are the hospitals ? " another woman asks .
" It was not a hospital we promised .
It was a dispensary , " Ugalomaswa says .
" But it says here that you will provide hospitals , plural , " one man says , brandishing a copy of the agreement .
" Where is it ? "
" The community has n't told us yet where to put it . "
" You are joking with us , " the villager says .
It is a brave but hopeless performance .
The next day we set off by pirogue back up the Congo towards Kisangani .
" The European perception of the Congo as the dark heart of Africa or the world is completely wrong , " René Ngongo says .
" For us , the river and the forest have always been the heart of life .
We are all here thanks to the river .
The forest is full of riches .
We have fish weighing 100 kilograms .
At night it lives .
People are beginning to understand that the exploitation must benefit local people .
For us the forest has always been our mother .
It can be compared to your supermarkets .
Everyone depends on it .
What is happening is that the exploiters promise to improve living conditions by cutting down the forest .
It 's a paradox we do not understand . "
After several hours ' slow passage against the current , a speedboat comes towards us in the middle of the river .
Two white men and a black woman are on board .
It swerves into us and nearly swamps our fragile pirogue with its wash .
One man photographs us , the other steers and gives V - signs .
The boat comes back a second time .
This time we almost capsize .
" It 's the loggers , " Ngongo says .
" They are warning us . "
In Conrad 's day , 40 companies between them shared an area larger than France as their personal fiefdoms .
King Leopold took 50 % of the profits of all the ivory , rubber , gold , diamonds or wood that the concessionaries traded .
The companies in turn used slave labour , floggings , mutilation and even murder to extract the resources .
Today , the state has effectively collapsed and the World Bank in Washington has been funding the reconstruction of the country 's shattered economy .
It has decided to go along with the concession system .
Today a dozen large , mostly European , companies dominate the industry and have vast concessions ; Trans -M has Lebanese owners ; another group , which controls around 15 m acres , is owned by the Portuguese Trinidade brothers ; the American Blattner family has more than 2 m acres ; the German Danzer Group has 5 m .
To make worthwhile the tricky task of exporting wood over the rapids near Kinshasa , the demand is for the highest quality wood for European kitchens , floors and furniture .
Peace has exacerbated the problem , opening up the forest to smaller companies .
" Logging in Congo is out of control , " Ngongo says .
" There is now a rush for the trees .
The war protected the forests . "
Greenpeace research shows that the country has been carved up , just as in King Leopold 's day , and there are now 156 concessions covering nearly 75,000 square miles of mostly intact rainforest - far bigger than England and Wales put together .
Kisangani is completely surrounded by concessions , as is most of the land near the rivers .
In theory , the companies must pay central government nearly £ 9 m rent a year for these concessions , of which 40 % should be returned to provincial governments for development .
In practice , Van Praet says , " There is very little evidence that companies pay either on time or in full , and little or nothing goes back to the provinces . "
" What is at stake is enormous , " Ngongo says .
" Two - thirds of the people in Congo , 40 million people , depend on this forest to provide food , medicines and building materials .
It is critical for the survival of the people and animals .
This is also one of the biggest stores of carbon in the world , so it is critical , too , for climate change .
Yet the companies are being encouraged to take what they can . "
Most of the concessions , Van Praet says , have been awarded in violation of the new forest laws and after the World Bank imposed a moratorium on new concessions in 2002 , in return for $ 90 m of development aid .
The government is now reviewing their legality and will decide whether to cancel them later this year .
But in reality the companies know they will be able to appeal , and log , for many years .
Greenpeace and Ocean are adamant that the industrial logging concession system in Congo will destroy the forest , impoverish the people and undermine the state .
" All are in areas inhabited by people dependent on the forest , many have Pygmies living in them , and a third are in areas identified as vital for conservation , " Van Praet says .
The system of concessionaries offering gifts to communities in return for permission to log is now the basis of the whole forestry operation in Congo .
Research by Ngongo and Ocean shows that isolated communities , which have seldom had contact with outsiders , are being persuaded to sign away , for just a few machetes and bags of salt , the rights to the forests on which they have depended for millions of years .
One company gave a community 18 bars of soap , four packets of soup , 24 bottles of beer and two bags of sugar .
Another signed a deal for 20 sacks of sugar , 200 bags of salt , 200 machetes and 200 spades .
In Orientale province , another company promised a school , a clinic and enough wood to provide for their coffins .
" It is happening everywhere , " Ngongo says .
" Concessions are being given out , and the villagers are not being told what the chiefs are signing up to .
Communities are in chaos and there is more and more social conflict .
It is a cruel system that continues the injustices and atrocities of the colonial system but it is even worse because it deprives communities of their resources and consigns them to perpetual poverty . "
The concessionary system is so far found only in Africa - in francophone Africa , in fact - but it may yet spread to the great forest areas of , say , South America .
Back in Kinshasa , we call on the World Bank and see an official who asks to speak anonymously .
" Clearly the companies are the root of the problem , " he says .
" They are taking advantage of the chaos .
They exploit the poor .
It 's normal .
They are businessmen .
It 's a very small group of people who get rich and the very large group stay poor .
Because the government is weak , it can not take them on .
Nothing much has changed since King Leopold 's day .
All this started in colonial times .
The government continued the same old ways after independence .
It 's still a system of colonialism . "
Corruption , he says , is rife at every level of government and business .
" Businesses pay the government , " he says .
" They are corrupt .
You see a minister , you see the air - conditioning is not working , you say you will fix it .
Or you give a present to the minister 's wife .
It can be very subtle .
Perhaps you arrange visas for an official 's children .
There are hundreds of different ways to be corrupt .
We , the bank , cannot replace the government , so we try to equip and help the ministries .
We buy them motorbikes , computers . "
He assures me that the bank does not support the companies - but this is not strictly true .
Although the bank 's website says its private credit organisation , the International Finance Corp , " has no client in the field of forests in DRC " , it emerged last month that the IFC had invested $ 15 m in Olam International - a Singaporean company with an annual turnover of $ 1.6 bn that pays small - scale artisanal loggers to cut for it in Congo and has two large concessions obtained well after the moratorium .
Olam said that it was unaware of the moratorium at the time it received its allotments , but in a statement to journalists said : " We will abide by the World Bank 's decision about the contracts ' legality . "
The bank maintains full confidence in Olam , stating on its website : " Although a small proportion of overall company revenue , Olam trades in timber but promotes sustainable forest management practices and its operations are considered fully consistent with the requirements of the November 2002 World Bank Forests Policy . "
Next on our agenda : the companies .
Françoise van de Ven , a Belgian woman who has lived in Congo for many years , is secretary general of the Fédération des Industriels du Bois , which represents 14 of the biggest timber companies in Congo .
" Are we legal ?
Are we illegal ? " she says .
" No one knows .
But what I do know is that the forest is coming down .
It 's terribly alarming and there is no solution .
It 's mainly in the east of Congo and no one sees it . "
She shifts the blame to small - scale logging operations .
" The situation is worse than you think .
Right now there are 8,000 small - scale wood exporters , each felling 50 hectares a year , mainly in the east .
That 's 400,000 hectares [ approaching a million acres ] being clear - felled a year - or five million cubic metres of wood .
There could be 500 chainsaws working in one forest like Ituri .
The timber goes to Rwanda , Uganda , wherever . "
She blames international companies such as Olam which pay , quite legally , for the permits of these small artisans .
" They give chainsaws to people , then buy the wood from them .
They are doing 10,000 cubic metres a year .
They only export some .
It makes my heart cry .
" I have run a company in Congo , so I know how it works .
If you pay all the taxes , you would not exist .
Safbois pays 164 different taxes .
There are so many small , stupid taxes .
Some get declared on and some do n't .
It 's normal .
Taxes drive you nuts .
You hit a brick wall every two weeks . "
She represented Safbois at the meeting with the villages near Isangi .
" You give them [ people ] the chance to have good housing , you give them timber and cement .
But if you do n't see anything come of it , it 's because they have sold it on .
The chiefs get the money .
They wanted rifles for hunting , sugar and salt .
I said , ' But in 25 years ' time , when all the logs are gone , what will you say ? '
I tried to make them see the future .
" Safbois invested about $ 10,000 in that school .
We had an agreement that we would supply all the bricks .
We said we will build the school but we need five people to work in week one , three in week two .
Nobody came .
We gave them the possibility to make the bricks , but they never made them .
You get very frustrated .
You pull your hair out .
It goes from worse to worse .
There is a solution - give them work , give them schooling , give them medicines , and all this will stop . "
At last we go to Safbois ' headquarters in Kinshasa .
The inner sanctum of one of the most powerful companies in Africa is the office of David Blattner , its financial director .
It is furnished like a hotel room , with pictures of the great Congolese forests and mountains .
There is a plaque , signed by President Kabila , awarding the company the highest civilian honour , the Gold Medal of the Republic .
The company cuts trees , but it also builds roads and provides most of the gas for the capital city .
" Congo can only do sustainable forestry , " Blattner says .
" The infrastructure is so poor , and the costs of extracting wood so great , that you cannot clear - cut .
We take just a few logs per acre .
After five years you can't see the difference .
And the money goes to the country . "
Five minutes later , his brother Daniel , who runs Safbois , comes into the room with Olivier Megare , the company 's production chief .
Daniel Blattner is already angry : " You went [ to our camp ] without warning .
We were shocked .
It was simple politeness to ask .
We have good relations with the community .
We are there for decades .
We are employing people .
We are developing the regions , we are building schools and roads .
There is no infrastructure .
It 's not simple ! "
Soon everyone is shouting .
" This country has one renewable resource .
Wood .
Trees are renewable , " Blattner shouts .
" We are working to achieve everything we agreed .
We have invested money .
We have paid workers .
We are not substitutes for the state .
We are totally legal .
We are the invited in this country .
We have no interest in razing the forest , just taking a few trees from every hectare .
Why is it not in our interests to have good relations with the communities ?
Tell me why ? "
He is shouting very loudly now .
" There were logistical problems ... We work legally ! " he repeats .
He 's right - up to a point .
What he does n't say is that to take out just one valuable tree requires roads to be built deep into the forest , which means hundreds of other trees are cut or smashed down - often the very ones that the communities use and need for medicines and foods .
The companies do not replant - the trees they cut down may be 100 years old - and they leave the forest vulnerable to floods of hunters and other farmers moving in to pull down more .
" You can never replace the big trees , " Ngongo says .
" The forest will never recover the wildlife .
In Conrad 's day , traders such as Kurtz took only the ivory .
Now the companies are taking everything , including the chance to develop . "
The situation is far from how it was in Conrad 's day .
Blattner is no ranting Kurtz , nor are there atrocities being carried out .
The Congolese are not doomed to labour for a colonial king or a mad trader who employs slaves .
What is happening , though , is unjust and ecologically cruel .
The same concessionary system that Conrad found is now accepted by the World Bank and western governments .
It deprives millions of people of their resources , encourages corruption , prevents development and divides communities .
The real scandal today is that , for a few square metres of flooring , or a kitchen door , or a bedpost , the second greatest forest in the world is being destroyed , probably for ever .
I have to let Rabbi Heschel speak for himself ( he 's far more eloquent than I am ! ) , so there are a lot of quotes .
I have a copy of the book " Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity " which is a collection of his speeches & essays edited by his daughter Susannah Heschel .
I 'm quoting from two separate works reprinted in that book .
They are n't available online in the original sources , but I 'll provide the sources at the end of the diary .
From " Required : A Moral Ombudsman "
" A military court has declared Captain Calley guilty of manslaughter and for a few days the nation was in a state of dismay .
The question which agonized many people was :
Who else is guilty ?
...snip ...
To whitewash our deeds simply by maintaining our innocence is to defy God , who hears the cry of the guiltless killed in Vietnam .
...snip ...
Of the many problems involved , religious leaders face a special problem .
How were such crimes possible ?
Ten or twenty years ago no one would have believed that American boys could have acted in such a way .
I was a little kid during Vietnam , but I understand this outrage .
When the photos from Gitmo came out , I could n't believe that American soldiers would ever do something like that .
Holy cow , guys ( and gals ) !!
We 're AMERICANS !
We 're the good guys !
At this hour , a major lesson implied in the teaching of the ancient prophets of Israel assumed renewed validity :
Few are guilty , but all are responsible
...snip ...
Responsibility is the capability of being called up on to answer , or to make amends , to someone for something , without necessarily being directly connected with or involved in a criminal act .
Tomorrow , I have to atone for the sin of not being loud enough , not persuasive enough , not committed enough to stop Bush & company 's assault on the Constitution and the world community .
Some are guilty , but all are responsible .
If we remain silent in the face of this challenge , greater atrocities will take place in the days to come .
Here 's where I got the chills .
We were warned .
Not just by Rabbi Heschel , but by other moral voices .
Even now , people defend our involvement in Vietnam and efforts to prop up other dictators around the world .
Collectively , we just never learn the lessons of history .
This is from " A Prayer For Peace . "
It reads like something from our High Holiday 's prayer book where we confess our personal and community sins :
Most of us prefer to disregard the dreadful deeds we do over there .
The atrocities committed in our name are too horrible to be credible .
It is beyond our power to react vividly to the ongoing nightmare , day after day , night after night .
so we bear graciously other people 's suffering .
Oh Lord , we confess our sins , we are ashamed of the inadequacy of our anguish , of how faint and slight is our mercy .
We are a generation that has lost the capacity of outrage .
We must continue to remind ourselves that in a free society all are involved in what some are doing .
SOME ARE GUILTY , ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE
Ok , so it 's almost Yom Kippur and I'm " supposed " to be feeling guilty anyway , but I 've always been a firm believer that a book , essay , or even a quick conversation with a stranger sometimes happens just when you 're at a place where you need to read or hear a certain message .
So I 'm dedicating myself in the new year to do more .
More than just read Daily Kos & post , more than send checks to political candidates , more than just the easy stuff .
Thank you , Rabbi Heschel , I 'm accepting my responsibility - as I hope we all will .
NOTE : I certainly do n't mean to imply that we 're a bunch of slackers on this issue , but I know that personally it 's easier to feel outrage than act on outrage .
Rabbi Heschel 's writings gave me a good kick in the pants .
Maybe others will be similarly galvanized .

Anti-War Dems Near Defeat on Spending Bill
The most outspoken critics of the $ 124 billion wartime spending bill in the House are facing withering support in their fight to defeat it .
California Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters and Lynn Woolsey said that many of their liberal colleagues were caving under pressure from Democratic leaders who , according to at least one congressman , have threatened to block requests for new funds for his district .

They also cited MoveOn.org 's endorsement of the measure Monday as a blow to their efforts .
" This is the process : people who feel strongly about this issue hold out as long as they can , " said Waters .
" A lot of pressure comes to bear and they can't hold up under the pressure . "
The $ 124 billion emergency spending bill , backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , includes not only more funds this year for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also new military readiness standards , benchmarks for the Iraqi government and an Aug. 31 , 2008 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
A floor vote is planned for Thursday .
Democratic leaders have also added billions in funds not related to wartime spending in a bid for more support .
That additional money was attractive for at least one lawmaker , Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D - Ore. ) , an Out of Iraq Caucus member .
His spokeswoman , Danielle Langone , cited $ 400 million for a one - year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self - Determination Act .
" That 's pretty vital for our district , so we 'll be voting for the bill , " Langone said .
Waters said that she and other opponents of the spending measure had entered the weekend with 20 to 25 members on their side but that they had suffered " a lot of damage " as Democratic leaders aggressively urged members to support the bill .
Vowing to step up her efforts to hold the opposition , Waters said it was clear that Democratic leaders were mounting an all - out whip effort beyond the earlier informal surveying by Democratic Whip James Clyburn ( S.C. ) .
" This is a vote of conscience , " Waters said .
" Jim Clyburn said he was doing an assessment , so that 's what I was doing .
Now that he 's whipping , I 'm going to start whipping . "
Clyburn disputed her assertion .
" That 's not what she told me , " he said .
" I beg to differ that there 's anybody whipping against this bill . "
One congressman , who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from leaders , bristled at how aggressively he was being pressured to vote for the bill , singling out Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) as especially forceful .
" I really resent this , " the lawmaker said .
" Rahm Emanuel told us a vote against this bill is a vote to give the Republicans victory . "
The congressman also noted that Democratic leaders had " made clear " to him that they might yank funding requests he had made for projects in his district if he did not support the measure .
Democratic whips , all deputies of Clyburn , approached members on the House floor Monday night .
A jovial Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger went up to fellow Maryland Rep. Albert Wynn as he sat off the floor with a reporter and told Wynn that a vote against the bill was a vote for Republican victory .
He waved a copy of the MoveOn.org press release backing the measure .
" Have you seen this ? " Ruppersberger asked .
" Yeah , who did that ? " replied Wynn , a member of the Out of Iraq Caucus .
" Some people we asked to put out a press release to get you to vote for the bill , " Ruppersberger joked .
He razzed the noncommittal Wynn a few moments longer , pretending to twist his arm , then headed off to reprise the routine with another Out of Iraq Caucus member , Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings .
Other undecided Democrats were also feeling the heat .
Rep. Yvette D. Clarke ( D - N.Y. ) said she had been approached several times and was " still very undecided . "
" This will establish to a large degree who I am .
... I 'm really trying to make sure I have an understanding of the supplemental in practicality and balancing that with my own concerns about the war and my constituents who are very opposed to the war , " Clarke said .
" The sentiment I 'm getting from my constituents is that I 'm beyond benchmarks now .
… The administration has proven to be untrustworthy . "
Some anti-war activists assailed MoveOn.org 's approach to the Iraq bill , alleging that the organization had used a skewed poll to conclude that 85 percent of its members backed the measure .
" MoveOn put out a dishonest poll that did not offer its members a real choice to end the war , and now the peace movement is lobbying activists to reform MoveOn or drop off its list , " David Swanson , a board member of Progressive Democrats of America , said in an e-mail to The Politico .
" I unsubscribed from MoveOn this morning . "
In the poll , MoveOn.org gave its members a choice of supporting , opposing or being " not sure " of the plan proposed by the Democratic leadership , according to an e-mail sent to members Sunday by MoveOn.org official Eli Pariser .
It did not mention a more aggressive withdrawal proposal backed by Woolsey , Waters and Rep. Barbara Lee ( D - Calif . ) .
Pariser said MoveOn.org had held out as long as possible before backing the leadership proposal .
" We were basically declining to take a position as long as we could to strengthen the hand of the progressives .
We did the poll at the last time we felt we could have an impact on the final vote . "
He said he would support the progressive proposal if it came to a vote .
" We 'll encourage people to vote for that and for the supplemental , " he said .
" We are trying to end the war .
That 's the mandate . "
Democratic leaders are pressing hard on the bill even though some members of their whip operation are themselves opposed .
Waters , one of nine chief deputy whips , has said she will not whip for a bill she staunchly opposes .
But other members have been more willing to help .
Rep. Diane E. Watson ( D - Calif. ) , who remains " solidly " opposed to the bill , was still serving as a regional whip .
" I told Jim Clyburn I 'm a team player .
I 'm a whip .
I 'll do the whipping , " Watson said .
But , she added , " My whipping is just a survey . …
If I believed in what I was whipping on , I 'd do more . "

Editor 's note :
This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming , six - hour television event , " God 's Warriors , " hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour .
Sondra Oster Baras : " Israel has many enemies .
We have to take advantage of every single one of our friends . "
MELBOURNE , Florida ( CNN ) -- Sondra Oster Baras is an Orthodox Jew doing an unorthodox job .
" If you had asked me 10 years ago what I would be doing with my life , I do n't think I would have told you I 'd be in church , " she said .
Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel .
A recent stop finds her in Melbourne , Florida , visiting Pastor Gary Christofaro at his First Assembly Church of God .
Christofaro and his flock take their Jewish roots so seriously that on Friday nights they observe the Jewish Sabbath with Hebrew prayers .
This is not just religious ritual .
They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank .
Church members tour settlements with Baras and have donated more than a $ 100,000 to support them .
" If it was n't for what the Jews brought to Christianity , there would be no Christianity , " Christofaro said .
" There is a promise to those who bless Israel to be blessed .
Those who curse it will be cursed . "
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis .
Watch the bond between observant Jews and evangelical Christians »
A recent poll found that 59 percent of American evangelicals believe Israel is the fulfillment of biblical prophecy .
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates 85 million evangelicals believe God tells them to support Israel -- more than six times the world 's Jewish population .
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers , Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein , raised $ 39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements .
Christian Zionists often converge on Washington by the thousands to lobby members of Congress in support of Israel .
Sen . Joseph Lieberman , I - Connecticut , was among the speakers at last month 's convention of Christians United for Israel .
" There are a lot more Christian Zionists in America than Jewish Zionists , " the former Democratic vice presidential candidate told the group .
" The support of Christian Zionists today is critical to Israel 's security and strength and to America 's security and strength . "

Back in church , Baras told the congregation : " We need to stand together so that our governments will believe that the land of Israel , the entire land of Israel , belongs to the Jewish people . "
Baras said God called her to this work .
She left her high - powered , high - paid job as a Wall Street lawyer and moved to Israel in 1984 .
" I was never fully American , " she explained .
" I was Jewish . "
Judaism was not only her religion but also her nationality .
" We learned how to read Hebrew before we learned how to read English , " she said .
Her parents , who narrowly escaped the Holocaust , sent her to Zionist summer camps that championed the Jewish homeland .
" My parents felt very safe in America ... but there was always a part of them that said there needs to be an Israel in the event that we have another Hitler .
Put it all together and I could n't help but be a Zionist . "
Baras moved her family to Karnei Shomron , a settlement deep inside the West Bank .
" Just by building my house ... I was strengthening the Jewish presence here in Samaria , " she said , referring to a biblical name for the northern part of the West Bank .
In 2002 , a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up inside a pizza parlor in her neighborhood , killing three children .
She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America .
" If we give any part of that land to the Arabs , we are looking at terrorism , " she told a church audience .
Christofaro's Florida congregation responded with money -- all while singing a prayer for peace in perfect Hebrew .
Their money builds parks , child care centers and music therapy programs -- projects that make Jewish life in the settlements more comfortable .
And more permanent .
" If you do n't live somewhere , if you do n't take possession of it , it is not yours , " Baras said .
Some people say Jews and evangelical Christians make strange bedfellows , given historical anti-Semitism .
" Because of this doctrine of a Jew being a Christ - killer ... so much hatred and anti-Semitism has been propagated throughout the Earth , " Christofaro said .
Now such historic anti-Semitism has given way to an urgent support of Israel among some evangelicals , many of whom believe that when Jews live in all of the Holy Land -- what they call Greater Israel -- only then will Christ return and true believers be raptured up to heaven .
" It is a controversial issue here in Israel as to whether we should be partnering with the Christians in any way , " Baras said .
It 's controversial in part because in the judgment day scenario embraced by some evangelicals , Jews who do n't convert to Christianity burn in hell .
But Baras said she is n't worried .
" I know that I 'm not going to burn in hell because I did n't accept Jesus , because I do n't believe Jesus is the Messiah , " she said .
" So how could I possibly be threatened ? "
Baras concedes the alliance between God 's Jewish and Christian warriors may seem odd to some people .
But if Baras is anything , she 's practical .
" Israel has many enemies , " she said .
" We have to take advantage of every single one of our friends . "

BAGHDAD – Many Iraqis believe the dramatic escalation in the U.S. military ’s use of air power is a sign of defeat for the occupation forces on the ground .
U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft dropped five times as many bombs in Iraq during the first six months of this year as over the first half of 2006 , according to official information .
They dropped 437 bombs and missiles in Iraq in the first half of 2007 , compared to 86 in the first half of 2006 .
This is also three times more than in the second half of 2006 , according to Air Force data .
The Air Force has also been expanding its air bases in Iraq and adding entire squadrons .
It is now preparing to use a new robotic fighter known as the Reaper .
The Reaper is a hunter - killer drone that can be operated by remote control from thousands of miles away .
" We find it strange that the big strategists of the U.S. military have actually failed in finding solutions on the ground and are now back to air raids that kill more civilians than militants , " former Iraqi army brigadier - general Ahmed Issa told IPS .
" On the other hand , they are giving away the land to local forces that they know are incapable of facing the militants , who will grab the first chance of U.S. withdrawal to bases to hit back and hold the ground again . "
" Going back to air raids is an alarming sign of defeat , " Salim Rahman , an Iraqi political analyst from Baghdad , told IPS .
" To bombard an area only means that it is in the hands of the enemy . "
" Our area is under threat of air raids all the time , " Mahmoud Taha from the Arab Jboor area southwest of Baghdad told IPS .
" Each time they bombed our area , civilians were killed by the dozens , and civilians ’ houses were destroyed .
They could not fight the resistance face to face , and so they take revenge from the air . "
May 2007 was the most violent month for U.S. forces in Iraq in nearly three years , according to the U.S. Department of Defense .
There were 6,039 attacks on U.S. and Iraqi government forces , 1,348 roadside bombs detonated under their vehicles , 286 " complex ambushes " involving roadside bombs and coordinated teams of attackers were carried out , 102 car bombs exploded , 126 U.S. soldiers were killed , and 652 were wounded .
The U.S. forces have been hitting back at predominantly Sunni areas such as those around Fallujah .
But the forces have also targeted Shia pilgrims around Najaf in the south .
" Air raids are back even in Shia areas like Sadr City in Baghdad and many southern cities like Diwaniya , Samawa , and Kut where the al - Mahdi militia [ of cleric Moqtada al - Sadr ] controls the ground , " Abbas Abdul - Mehdi from Diwaniya told IPS while on a visit to Baghdad .
" Their bombs fall on our heads , while the militiamen know how to hide and escape . "
The U.S. forces are looking to do more of all this .
" There are times when the Army wishes we had more jets , " F - 16 pilot Lt. Col .
Steve Williams , commander of the 13th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron , told reporters .
" What the U.S. forces are doing now is increasing their Air Force potential in a last attempt to crush the fighters with the minimum casualties possible , " retired Iraqi army colonel Mustafa Abbood from Baghdad told IPS .
" It is a desperate attempt to make Iraqis turn against their fellow fighters .
It failed in Fallujah , and I do not see how it will work elsewhere . "
Iraqis around Baghdad say they have noticed more air traffic in recent months .
" There is a notable increase in the number of airplanes flying in the Iraqi skies , " Amjad Fadhil , a farmer from Latifiya , south of Baghdad , told IPS .
" F - 16s and helicopters are roaring like monsters everywhere . "
There are more than 100 U.S. aircraft crisscrossing Iraqi air space at any one time .
Air Force engineers are working long hours to upgrade Balad air base , just north of Baghdad , which already supports 10,000 air operations per week .

A team of University of British Columbia researchers has contributed to the greatest advancement in superconductor research in a decade by " growing " the purest samples of superconductors to date .
Superconductors are a class of materials that conduct electricity with no resistance .
They are already used in MRI medical imaging scanners , levitating trains , and power lines .
High temperature superconductors have no resistance at temperatures as high as - 140 degrees Celsius , but advances in this area have been stalled due to a lack of understanding of their fundamental properties .
" Up to now , it was unclear whether these materials were metals or insulators , " said UBC Physics Prof .
Douglas Bonn , adding that the materials are extremely sensitive to contamination - the slightest trace of dirt or impurity can alter their properties completely .
" We were able to supply our collaborators with the purest sample ever developed , leading to the discovery of quantum oscillations , " said Bonn .
" This provides unequivocal proof that these materials are metals . "
" The results are crystal clear , " said Louis Taillefer .
" High - temperature superconductors were discovered in 1987 , and only now do we finally have concrete knowledge about their deep nature .
This discovery gives both theorists and experimentalists something real to work with . "
Despite their name , high - temperature superconductors cannot function in temperatures higher than 100 degrees Celsius below zero .
The discovery brings scientists one step closer to the ultimate goal of creating room - temperature superconductors , which could result in laptop - sized MRI machines , loss - less power lines , and vast improvements in computers and wireless communications .
The UBC team also includes Prof. Emeritus Walter Hardy and Materials Scientist Ruixing Liang .
Findings of the project , led by Université de Sherbrooke physicist Louis Taillefer and involving researchers and funding from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research ( CIFAR ) , are published in the journal Nature .
The experiments were carried out at the National Pulsed Magnetic Field Laboratory in Toulouse , France .
In Elyria , Ohio , 18 - year - old Willie Evans IV is standing trial as an adult for the 2006 murder of Michael Smith .
Evans , who was a minor when the crime was committed , is being tried as an adult and faces the possibility of a life sentence .
Ohio is one of a number of states in which polygraph “ evidence ” may be admissible at trial if both the prosecution and the defense stipulate to its admissibility .
The way this usually works is that a criminal suspect is offered the opportunity to prove his innocence by submitting to a government - administered lie detector test , with the stipulation that — pass or fail — the results will be admissible in court .
Often , the prosecution will suggest that the case may be dismissed if the suspect passes .
Willie Evans accepted such an arrangement and failed his lie detector test .
Elyria Chronicle - Telegram reporter Brad Dicken summarized the case in an article published last week :
ELYRIA — Willie Evans IV has denied having anything to do with the shooting death of 64 - year - old Michael Smith last year , but the man who administered a lie - detector test to him testified Tuesday that Evans was lying .
Evans , 18 , showed signs of deception when William Evans II asked him whether he ever held Smith ’s wallet , whether he shot Smith , whether he was at the trunk of the car in which Smith was found dying and whether he pulled the trigger , William Evans testified .
Willie Evans and William Evans are not related .
Polygraph examinations typically are n’t admissible in court , but Willie Evans and prosecutors reached an agreement that he would take the test and whatever the results were would be allowed into his aggravated murder trial .
Michael A. Smith was found dying in the trunk of his car April 13 , 2006 .
That agreement did n’t stop defense attorney Paul Griffin from questioning the validity of the tests and asking county Common Pleas Judge Christopher Rothgery to bar the results , a request Rothgery denied .
Griffin suggested that external events such as explosions , thunder and lightning , or a police presence could throw off a test , but William Evans said that was n’t the case with the examination he gave Willie Evans .
If Griffin ’s best argument against the validity of polygraphy was the foregoing , then he has done a poor job defending his client .
With or without “ external events , ” polygraph testing has no scientific basis to begin with .
If Griffin is the same lawyer who gave defendant Evans the remarkably bad legal advice of accepting the stipulation agreement , then he has a conflict of interest in now arguing against the reliability of polygraphy .
The only thing that happened to throw off the test , William Evans said , was that Willie Evans burped once during the test , and he had to repeat a question because of it .
Smith was found shot in the trunk of his wife ’s car shortly after midnight on April 13 , 2006 .
The retired steelworker had gone outside to move his wife ’s car , which she had left on the street at his request while he was at a horse racing track for the evening .
Evans is accused , along with Tyrone Young and Barry Williams , of confronting Smith and stealing his wallet , which was found by police 15 months later about a block away .
The three men all face life in prison if convicted , but Williams is listed as a witness in Evans ’ case and may have cut a deal with prosecutors for a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony . …
In today ’s Chronicle - Telegram , reporter Michael Baker follows up with a feature article titled , “ Do Polygraphs Detect the Truth , or Are They Pseudo Science ? ” AntiPolygraph.org co-founder George Maschke is among those interviewed for this article :
When the 12 men and women determine the fate of 18 - year - old Willie Evans IV , they will certainly look back to the testimony delivered on Sept. 11 . Last Tuesday , professional polygraphist William Evans II ( who is not related to the defendant ) testified that the defendant had failed the polygraph test he administered .
Does this seal the fate of Willie Evans , charged with first - degree murder of Michael A. Smith ?
Should it ?
The use of polygraph results in court cases , which has been hotly debated for decades , has eluded a clear consensus on their accuracy .
Actually , while Ohio courts may not have reached a clear consensus on the accuracy of polygraphs , there is no raging debate amongst scientists : polygraph testing is junk science .
A recent article submitted by the Committee of Concerned Social Scientists concludes after significant research that polygraph testing is a “ valid application of psychological science ” with a “ known but acceptable error rate , ” and that it does not overwhelm jurors .
The Committee of Concerned Social Scientists prepared a pro-polygraph amicus brief in U.S. v. Scheffer , a federal case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the admissibility of scientists .
One of the “ concerned social scientists ” who co-signed the brief is American Polygraph Association past president Edward I. Gelb of Los Angeles , who has been unmasked as a phony Ph.D .
Many people , though , still stand firmly opposed to allowing polygraph results to be used as evidence in court cases .
“ These polygraph results should not be considered evidence at all , ” said George Maschke , co-founder of antipolygraph.org .
“ It can play a major role in determining if this kid will spend his life free or imprisoned , and there ’s just no scientific data to support that it should , ” he said .
But Charles Honts , a professor of psychology at Boise State University and a licensed polygraphist for more than 30 years , believes that there is .
“ This is an empirical question , and it can be answered with data — polygraphs have proven time and time again to be accurate .
I have testified in court for years that they should be admissible , ” he said .
It ’s true that Charles Honts has argued for years that polygraph results should be admissible as evidence in court .
But he is one of only a handful of academics to hold such a fringe viewpoint .
In a 2005 case , a federal judge discredited him , calling his intellectual honesty into serious question .
Honts admits there are ambiguities .
“ There are people involved .
Just like in psychological tests , there could be human error , ” he said .
“ A polygraph is only as good as the person operating it , ” said Donnie Todd , owner of Quest Consultants in Delaware , Ohio .
“ An examiner can drastically affect the accuracy of polygraph results , ” said Todd , who has administered more than 4,000 examinations .
William D. Evans II has a great deal of polygraph experience under his belt .
For more than 30 years , he has performed polygraph tests and has become convinced over time of their accuracy .
“ They ’re amazing investigative tools .
Polygraph accuracy far exceeds eyewitness testimony , which has been measured as 70 to 75 percent accurate — tops , ” Evans said .
“ Polygraphs are 95 to 98 percent accurate , ” he said .
“ Assuming I could pick my examiner , I would stake my freedom on a polygraph , ” he said .
The National Academy of Sciences sharply disagrees with polygrapher Evans regarding the accuracy of polygraphy .
In its landmark 2003 report , The Polygraph and Lie Detection , the Academy concluded :
Polygraph Accuracy
Almost a century of research in scientific psychology and physiology provides little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy .
The physiological responses measured by the polygraph are not uniquely related to deception .
That is , the responses measured by the polygraph do not all reflect a single underlying process : a variety of psychological and physiological processes , including some that can be consciously controlled , can affect polygraph measures and test results .
Moreover , most polygraph testing procedures allow for uncontrolled variation in test administration ( e.g. , creation of the emotional climate , selecting questions ) that can be expected to result in variations in accuracy and that limit the level of accuracy that can be consistently achieved .
Theoretical Basis
The theoretical rationale for the polygraph is quite weak , especially in terms of differential fear , arousal , or other emotional states that are triggered in response to relevant or comparison questions .
We have not found any serious effort at construct validation of polygraph testing .
Research Progress Research on the polygraph has not progressed over time in the manner of a typical scientific field .
It has not accumulated knowledge or strengthened its scientific underpinnings in any significant manner .
Polygraph research has proceeded in relative isolation from related fields of basic science and has benefited little from conceptual , theoretical , and technological advances in those fields that are relevant to the psychophysiological detection of deception .
Future Potential
The inherent ambiguity of the physiological measures used in the polygraph suggest that further investments in improving polygraph technique and interpretation will bring only modest improvements in accuracy .
Reporter Michael Baker continues :
Maschke , though , would not [ stake his freedom on a polygraph ] .
“ They ’re junk science , ” he said .
“ Voodoo .
The only people who say that polygraphs have 98 percent accuracy have a vested , financial interest in them , ” he said .
Honts strongly disagrees with this claim .
Honts , as a polygraph practitioner , is among those who have a “ vested , financial interest ” in polygraphs .
“ Although there is ambiguity involved , the study of polygraphs has become a lot more scientific in recent years , ” he said .
This was made clear in a study published just this year .
In an attempt to compare polygraph studies with strictly scientific tests ( like X - rays and ultrasound ) and psychological studies ( like personality tests ) , the polygraph performed surprisingly well — equal to or better than the other two in various tests , according to “ A Comparative Analysis of Polygraph with other Screening and Diagnostic Tools , ” Honts said .
“ The world community is recognizing the accuracy and reliability of polygraphs .
Their use is growing worldwide — fast , ” Honts said .
In response to these studies , Maschke said that the author , Philip E. Crewson , “ errs by saying that polygraph ‘ testing ’ is scientifically comparable to others . ”
The study in question was funded by the federal government ’s polygraph school and reproduced ( not this year , but in 2003 ) in Polygraph , a trade journal published by the American Polygraph Association .
It should be greeted with the same skepticism with which one would receive a tobacco industry study into the linkage between cigarette smoking and cancer .
Quoting another study , Maschke said Dr. Alan Zelicoff examined polygraph results in real - world conditions and found that “ if a subject fails a polygraph , the probability that she is , in fact , being deceptive is little more than chance alone . ”
“ It ’s basically a coin flip , ” Maschke said .
See “ Positive and Negative Predictive Values of Polygraphs : Results from published ‘ field ’ studies ” ( 255 kb PDF ) by Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff , M.D .
As Willie Evans can do little more than sit back and watch , he is certainly hoping that his freedom will not be determined by an unlucky coin flip .
In Ohio , polygraph results are only admissible in court if both the prosecution and defense agree before the test .
The jury will certainly consider the importance of the fact that , according to William D. Evans , the polygraph detected “ signs of deception ” when the defendant was asked whether he shot Smith , ever held Smith ’s wallet and whether he was present at the trunk of the car in which Smith was found dying .
The jury should properly accord no significance to Willie Evans ’s polygraph results .
It should be recalled that in a 1978 Ohio murder case in which the results of a “ stipulated ” polygraph were admitted into evidence , Floyd “ Buzz ” Fay of Perrysburg , Wood County , was wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison .
It was only through the diligence of his public defender , Adrian Cimerman , that the Fay was conclusively exonerated and ultimately freed after having spent two years in prison .
Anthony Nici , a veteran attorney with an offices in Avon , has had extensive experience with polygraphs .
He said that the tests — while notoriously variable and infrequently admitted as evidence — do hold a large amount of sway when it comes to the jury .
“ In high - profile cases , ” Nici said , “ I often immediately test my clients so that I can know .
And if they pass , I try and get them submitted as evidence . ”
Nici said it is difficult — but of the utmost importance — to find a reliable examiner .
“ There are only a couple of reliable examiners in the whole state .
They ’re becoming harder and harder to find , ” he said .
Under terms of attorney - client privilege , a defense lawyer can shop a client around from polygrapher to polygrapher until he / she “ passes ” one .
The results of any “ failed ” polygraphs need never be disclosed .
One wonders what Nici considers to be a “ reliable ” examiner — one who will reliably deliver the desired result ?
Evans , who has worked for both prosecution and defense attorneys , said the results of his exams help put the guilty in jail and keep the innocent out — and are a lot more reliable and complex than “ heads or tails . ”
Evans ’s exams may also help put the innocent in jail and keep the guilty out .
In most cases , he will have no way of knowing .
New Jersey polygrapher Peter J. Brannon , a past president of the American Association of Police Polygraphists , recently learned that a case he considered a feather in his cap actually resulted in an innocent man spending 22 years in prison .
Jeff Gamso , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio , has some doubts about this analysis .
“ In general , we do n’t trust the results of polygraphs .
There are just too many factors that can affect the outcome .
And it ’s all too easy for a jury to be misled by them . ”
Willie Evans ’ attorney , Paul Griffin , also raised concerns about the validity of the tests and asked county Common Pleas Judge Christopher Rothgery to bar the results .
Griffin suggested that external factors such as explosions , thunder or a police presence could affect the results of a test .
Rothgery denied the request .
“ The defense attorney ’s critique was woefully inadequate , ” Mashke [ sic ] said .
“ He did n’t attack the fundamental shortcomings of polygraphs at all . ”
“ I do n’t know many defense attorneys who would readily consent to a polygraph examination for their clients due to the concerns about their validity , ” Gamso said .
“ It certainly indicates a bad gamble on the part of the defense , ” he said .
Indeed , it is a bad gamble .
The late David T. Lykken , author of the seminal treatise on polygraphy A Tremor in the Blood : Uses and Abuses of the Lie Detector , noted that “ an innocent suspect has nearly a 50:50 chance of failing a CQT [ Control Question Test — the most commonly used polygraph technique ] administered under adversarial circumstances , and those odds are considerably worse than those involved in Russian roulette .
For examples of the kind of arguments that have been successfully used to rebut polygraph “ evidence , ” see Professor William G. Iacono ’s article , “ Forensic ‘ Lie Detection ’ : Procedures Without Scientific Basis , ” Dr. Drew C. Richardson ’s “ Evaluation and Opinion of CQT Polygraphy , ” and Professor Emeritus John J. Furedy ’s “ The North American Polygraph and Psychophysiology : Disinterested , Uninterested , and Interested Perspectives . ”
While we will eventually be informed of the fate of Willie Evans IV , we may never know what role the “ gamble ” — the polygraph — played in the jury ’s decision .
Judge Rothgery ’s unfortunate decision to admit the results of a pseudoscientific procedure roundly discredited by the scientific community should be considered reversible error in the event that Evans is convicted .

JRuby / 高井さん Ruby 1.8.5 と互換性 Javaとの統合 ( クラスを埋め込み ) JVM , YARV , Rubinius の3 VM が使える JavaやYARVやRubiniusのバイトコードへコンパイルしている
JavaへのコンパイルはASM Rubyのソースを、JVMバイトコードにし、javaコマンドで動かす
IronPython / 荒井さん pythonのクラス をJavaScriptから呼ぶデモ 後は、単なるMicrosoftのCM (笑) * 2
Pnuts / 戸松さん 9年くらいが経過。独りで開発 Luaがライバル(!) 。JVMとの親和性とシンプルさ、速さ Javaでできるものがメイン なぜVM？ ・・・ GC , JIT , Fast Locking , Security , 移植性の恩恵を受ける。 ただし 、JVMとLLの間の仕様のミスマッチが起きうる LLは生き物で、発生したり死んだりを繰り返す。新しいLLは古いLLのいいとこを取り込む。
LLを使いたいだけなら、VMは不要では？ Rhino。Javaの機能を使いたかったから PnutsはJavaのテストツールとして始まった。main() 関数を書くのは嫌だ。
JRuby 。Rubyが好きだった。Javaに別のパラダイムをいれたかった。DSL等。 Jython。コンソールからJavaを読むのは面倒。javaの人にLLの良さを気がついて欲しい。 IronPython。コンパイルしない価値を、.NET上で表現できる。手軽に試して、不要なものを捨てられる
ネイティブのLLと比べると、どうなの？？ バグは？ JRuby。オーバヘッドはある。が、初期化など、オーバヘッドの許容できる部分では実用的。
IronPython。ファーストクラスの環境になると思われる。ASP.NETの対応言語になっていくだろうと予想
Grooby。大人数でやるのならJavaはいい。一人でやるならLLは向いている。これらの共存をする。大きい根幹はJava、末端は一人でLL。
いびきがすごくなってきた(笑)
プロトタイピングについて 鈴木さ ん「 LLはプロトタイピング。方向性が決まったら、Javaで行く。昔のsmalltalkも？ 」 高井さん「日本はRuby、インドでJava、ってのは暗い。Rubyでそのまま動けばいい」
Pnuts をビジネスで使いたいって話は？？ サーバサイドや、ユーザから見えにくいところ。
Pnutsはどのくらい速いの？？ JVMの有効活用により、速くしている。JRubyよりもちろん速い
IronPython は c-python より速い？ ほんと？？ ほんとうにそう。ただ、 IronPython は c-python の 10 % 程度しか実装してない。オープンソースプロジェクトでは 95 % くらい移植してい る
IronPython は .NET が駄目なことを証明するために作られたけど、速かった？？ いろんな手段を試して、最速の方法を実装している。VM側にもフィードバックしていく。IronPythonのために.NETも進化する
Java陣営は？ JVMはLL にあわせて進化するの？？ 戸松さん「 PnutsはJVMのボクシング等の仕様の影響を受けて速度の制約を受けている。不便ではあるが、JVMの制約の元で色々考えている。JVMの仕様変更は難しい。利用範囲が大き過ぎる。 」 戸松さん「LLはどうしても動的なメソッド探索が必要で遅い。だが、JVMの命令に動的呼び出し命令を追加すると言う話があったが、反対した。実装でカバーできるので、JVMに命令を加えるのはいいアイディアではない」
JVM が突然ダイナミックになったりする？ 戸松さん 「 なったりしないことを願っている 」 高井さ ん 「 AOP 等の、バイトコードエンジニアリングが発達している。その先の最適化で駄目な時に、初めてJVMの見直しが必要」
JVMと.NETのライバル心はあるのか？？ 荒井さん「RoRもIronRuby上で動かしたい。どんなプラットフォームでも動くべき。ただ、IronRubyのプレアルファ版は実装としてはまだまだ」
開発者リソースの奪い合いをしているのが心配
話で はGroovy だったのに、 Rhinoが入ってるのはなぜ？？ 安全な実装が選ばれた 。JavaScript1.5が動くのは魅力的だが、開発環境としては弱い。
JRubyは戦略的に流行らせようとされている？？ Rubyと名前を出すと、資金が出やすい(笑) 。熱意的な人がいる
Java7 にJRubyはつく？？ 鈴木さん 「 多分つかないでしょう。制約が厳しい。 」 高井さ ん「 Rubyは実装と仕様が一緒になっている。JRubyの人も困っている」
質疑応答 「 JRubyのコンパイル手段として、ASMってのは本質的じゃないのでは？」「本質的ではないですが、最適化と言う面ではASMが原因な気がします 」
「 IronRubyの実装はソースを見ないとできない。MicroSoft は OSS のソースを読むと即解雇という噂がある。ほんとなら、どう実装しているのか 」
「 Matzさんと制作者間で取り決めがある。そこから言語仕様を起こしている 」
「その言語仕様を公開すると言う話はないのか？？」「話は未定だが、社員であれば見れる。存在することは証明する。公開できるかは不明。 」 「 ほんとうにOSSを読むとクビ？MicroSoftでもOSSをやろうとしているのでは？」「ライセンスによっては問題ない。商用で販売するような製品のOSSは読むとまずい。知的財産の入り込みを防いでいる 」
「 DLRを利用して、サーバ上とクライアント上で同じ言語を使うという方向性はあるのか」「やりたければなんでもできる。VM上でライフサイクルの長いものを動かすと、JITやGCに悪い影響を与える可能性がある。色々試してから実施したい。」

COSMIC VIEW : The Universe in 40 Jumps
by Kees Boeke
Kees Boeke 's Cosmic
View is a classic on learning about the scale of things .
It is similar to the Morrison 's Powers of Ten , but aimed at a younger audience .
Its legacy includes Charles Eames 's film Powers of Ten , the resulting book by Philip and Phylis Morrison , and several similar books which followed .
Unfortunately , the problems Kees hoped to address , including peoples ' understanding being fragmented by scale , remain as pressing today as they were in 1957 .
I place it online in the hope of encouraging awareness and activity in this area .

The images in the book were intentionally 15 cm across .
Rather than trying to make this happen on your screen , I have included a ruler for calibration .
My images are smaller than the originals , and of lower quality .
This week in Second Life , I swam with a dolphin , line - danced with six other women at a saloon and test - rode a horsie that I am considering buying .
I also received an offer to " have the sex " with a young man who was wearing his penis outside his pants .
One of the great joys of a virtual world like Second Life is the ability to indulge in fantasy limited only by your own patience and skill with the tools .
But there 's nothing virtual about the anxiety felt by Second Life residents these days .
Some are even saying it's the beginning of the end of the true Second Life .
Linden Lab has come under fire recently on a number of fronts .
German police reportedly found real child pornography in - world ; a group in France is demanding that Second Life be banned in its entirety to protect the children ; several European countries are cracking down on residents ' ability to create childlike avatars and wear them in Mature areas of the game .
And then director of community affairs Daniel Linden set a match to an already smoldering pile when he " clarified " the Second Life policies around Mature content in the official Linden Lab blog :
Real - life images , avatar portrayals , and other depiction of sexual or lewd acts involving or appearing to involve children or minors ; real - life images , avatar portrayals , and other depictions of sexual violence including rape ; real - life images , avatar portrayals , and other depictions of extreme or graphic violence , and other broadly offensive content are never allowed or tolerated within Second Life .
Residents all over the globe rebelled : Since when did Linden Lab meddle in content ?
And what happens to the Mature sims and merchants if people are afraid to express their sexual fantasies for fear of being reported and even banned ?
" What is ' broadly offensive ' ? " asks Amethyst Rosecrans , a long - time resident and founder of Sensations , an adult - content creation company .
" They need to be more specific .
It is almost impossible with such a large and international community to come to a consensus on these types of issues . "
The controversy centers around sexual " age play , " which proponents are quick to distinguish from pedophilia by saying everyone involved is a consenting adult and no children are present or harmed .
Opponents believe that depicting children in sexual situations with adults is never , ever acceptable – whether in public or private – and that " age play " should not be tolerated as " just another sexual fantasy . "
The fear is that by stepping in to ban age play specifically and " broadly offensive " sex and violence in general , Linden Lab is starting down a slippery slope of censorship and censure , destroying everything the virtual universe stands for .
Many of those worried about protecting freedom of expression are not supporters of age play , yet they are n't willing to ban it outright .
" ' Your world , your imagination ? '
Not anymore , " says Noche Kandora , whose alter ego Cheri Horton covers Second Life sexuality in Pixel Pulse magazine .
But Stroker Serpentine , a long - time resident famous for the SexGen animation system he co-developed , believes the uproar is unfounded .
" Short of developing some type of bot police regime to do nothing but go around and check grid by grid , plot by plot , for ' offensive ' content , they have to address it as it is reported , " he says .
" We have an abuse - reporting system .
It may be flawed but it 's what we have . "
That 's how the German investigation began , when a reporter received an invitation in - world to view child pornography .
Apparently it was n't just avatars either – it was the real thing – although avatars would have been enough to bring a case against the publishers .
Whether " broadly offensive " or not , age play is already illegal in many European countries , and Europeans make up about 60 percent of the Second Life population .
( For a good summary of the legal issues , see Virtually Blind . )
The more people I talk to , the more forums , blogs and sensational mainstream articles I read , the more I realize an anticlimactic truth : I just do n't know where I stand .
But I do think the fears of " if they ban age play , will they ban my kink next ? " are exaggerated .
The objection to age play is a healthy revulsion against sexual fantasy involving children .
It is not an objection to sexual fantasy in general .
And sexual fantasy may just be the elephant – if not the turtle – that holds up the virtual world in the first place .
No one will give a figure for exactly how much of Second Life 's economy depends on the Mature areas .
Everyone is quick to point out that residents have built a number of entertaining , informative and practical things to do other than sex .
And then everyone smirks .
But Second
Life is one of the few places on earth where not much can happen to us without our consent – including rape , so it is odd that Linden singled that out as an example .
It takes more than one mouse click just to take off your clothes , much less allow your avatar to be animated in any way .
You have Ignore and Ban tools to prevent you from seeing , hearing and touching folks you 'd rather not .
Teleporting is a fast way out of any sim .
Second Life is also an adults - only experience ; teens are relegated to their own grid , no gr'ups allowed .
Even so , sexual content and conduct on the adult grid takes place in areas clearly flagged as " Mature " – and unless you proactively set your user preferences to permit yourself to enter Mature areas , you 'll never even see them .
I think " broadly offensive " is a purposely vague catchall to give Linden Lab support if they are required by law to address specific content in the future .
At the moment , no one is sure what direction things will take .
The common complaint among residents , regardless of their opinions about content policies or age play or sex , is that Linden Lab has been inexcusably unresponsive and incommunicative about it all ( and they did n't respond to my requests for comment , either ) .
" As a content provider , I would like to see the policy clarified so I can be sure that I do n't risk account termination for things that had previously been acceptable , " says Rosecrans .
Kandora thinks even that goes too far .
" It is unreasonable for Linden Lab to impose bans on certain types of content or behavior on the grounds they are offensive or objectionable , " he says .
" There are too many cultural differences in a global environment , not to mention individual preferences and orientations . "
I know I would n't keep going back just for the dolphins and horses .
See you next Friday ,

There ’s a caustic substance common to our environment whose very presence turns iron into brittle rust , dramatically increases the risk of fire and explosion , and sometimes destroys the cells of the very organisms that depend on it for survival .
This substance that makes up 21 % of our atmosphere is Diatomic oxygen ( O 2 ) , more widely know as just oxygen .
Of course , oxygen has its good points .
Besides being necessary for respiration and the reliable combustion engine , it can be liquefied and used as rocket fuel .
Oxygen is also widely used in the world of medicine as a means to imbue the body with a greater amount of the needed gas .
But recent studies indicate that administering oxygen might be doing less good than hoped⁠ — and in fact be causing harm .
No one is immune to the dangers of oxygen , but the people who might most suffer the ill effects are infants newly introduced to breathing , and those who are clinically dead .
There are a variety of injuries and ailments for which modern medicine dictates oxygen therapy .
The common wisdom is that by filling the lungs with pure O 2 , one is pushing more of the vital gas into the blood , and thus to organs that are weakened and in need of support .
It has also long been known that even at partial pressures , pure oxygen can be toxic⁠ — a fact with which scuba divers and astronauts are intimately familiar .
Recent studies have indicated that the human body responds to pure oxygen , even at normal pressures , in a negative way .
Liquid Oxygen
When pure O 2 is introduced to the lungs , autonomic reflex increases respiration .
The increased rate of breathing means that a much larger load of carbon dioxide is released from the body , which causes the blood vessels to constrict .
Despite the increased amount of available oxygen in the lungs , the circulatory system is hampered , and cannot deliver precious O 2 as well as it could when breathing normal atmosphere .
Ronald Harper , a neurobiology professor at UCLA , conducted observations on a group of healthy teenagers breathing various gas mixes using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
His findings showed that in some subjects the pure O 2 caused the brain to go clinically bonkers .
Brain structures such as the hippocampus , the insula , and the cingulate cortex all displayed an adverse reaction ; they in turn spurred the hypothalamus , the body ’s main regulatory gland , into a fervor .
The hypothalamus regulates a myriad of things , including heart rate , body temperature , and is the master of a variety of other glands .
The introduction of pure oxygen prompts the hypothalamus to flood the body with a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters which serve to hamper heart rate , and further reduce the circulatory system ’s effectiveness .
But Harper also found that by adding a mere 5 % CO2 , all the detrimental effects found in pure oxygen are negated .
There are circumstances , however , where even the proper mix of gases would prove inadequate .
Modern medicine has long taught that after respiration stops , the brain can only survive for six minutes without oxygen before its cells begin to die in droves .
In order to combat this , standard procedure has been to aggressively attempt to restore breathing and heartbeat immediately upon cessation .
The base premise on which this protocol is designed may be in error .
Programmed cell death
Upon examining heart cells and neurons deprived of oxygen under a microscope , Dr Lance Becker of the University of Pennsylvania found there was no indication that the cells were dying after five or six minutes .
In fact , they seemed to endure the state for up to an hour without adverse affect .
Given this unexpected observation , the researchers were forced to investigate why human resuscitation becomes impossible after only a few minutes of clinical death .
The answer they uncovered was that the body ’s cells were not dying of oxygen starvation ; they were expiring due to reperfusion⁠ — the sudden reintroduction of oxygen to a dormant cell .
Inside the cells , the culprit seems to be in the mitochondria , which is the cell ’s power plant where sugar and oxygen are converted to usable energy .
Mitochondria are also responsible for apoptosis⁠ — the organized , controlled self - destruction of a cell .
Normally apoptosis occurs in situations such as the cell being damaged beyond repair , infected by a virus , an attempt to prevent cancer , or aiding in initial tissue development .
The process effectively kills and dismantles the cell allowing the body ’s usual waste management functions to carry the cell ’s remains away .
For reasons not entirely clear , reperfusion triggers apoptosis⁠ — the oxygen intended to save the cell actually causes cellular suicide .
Armed with this new information about how cells react to oxygen , it is clear that current emergency care is not altogether ideal , and new protocols are under investigation .
Dr Becker proposes that induced hypothermia may slow cell degradation , and if a means can be found to safely reintroduce oxygen to tissues , a clinically dead person⁠ — who still has trillions of living cells⁠ — could be resuscitated after being an hour dead .
This glorious future is still on the horizon , but to imagine the practical application leads one to ponder the multitude of accidents and injuries that are currently fatal , but will one day be treatable .
Emergency Medical Personnel could arrive on the scene , and inject the patient with a slurry of ice and salt that lowers the body temperature to about 92° F .
In a hypothermic state , the patient is hauled to the hospital , where instead of frantically trying to restart the heart , doctors patch up the problem , prevent apoptosis , and then restart the heart .
Though it wo n’t save everyone , these findings may lead to a future where a person made up of perfectly good human cells is not written off as dead merely because their heart has stopped beating .
The miracle of modern medicine , it seems , is on the cusp of determining the true distinction between dead and mostly dead .
Comment Every coming trend or market needs a good name to define it , so let ’s try this one : DIYBI , the Do IT Yourself Business Intelligence system .
The premise being put forward by companies looking to move into DIYBI is that BI so far is only being performed by the largest enterprises , and then only by white - coated rocket scientists operating as something close to a secret society .
Now , they say , it is time for BI to be open to ` the masses ’ as a self - service offering that no longer requires a trip to the BI Masonic lodge .
Microsoft is , of course , the big name player that is now starting to sniff round the BI honeypot currently sweetening business for the likes of SAS Institute , Business Objects , Oracle , Information Builders , SAP and Cognos .
These companies mainly pitch BI at the high - end enterprises , and are accused of creating an environment where mere mortals such a business managers are obliged to ask the BI `rocket scientists ’ for any information they require .
But the trend towards empowering those massed mere mortals is now well underway , though they will need to look carefully at what they think they are buying , for not all BI tools are born equal .
This is not to knock them , however .
More it is just important for users to understand that , for example , an analytical presentation tool will only be as good as the data - and the data management environment - that underpins it .
As the direct interface to the user presentation tools are vitally important and as Dan Vesset , research director of IDC , has been quoted as saying in a press release from Spotfire , “ reporting and dashboarding software often falls short in providing true decision support functionality for business professionals . ”
True enough , and Spotfire is claiming that its new DXP ( Data Experience ) offering helps overcome that problem , not least by packaging up some of the common queries business people need to make .
So there is a range of `solution - configured ’ packages for sales , marketing and portfolio management .
The company has also introduced Guided Analytics as part of DXP .
This allows users to publish a guided walk - through of their view of an information set - a BI `slideshow ’ in a way , that seems like a potentially useful tool .
There is also DXP Metrics , a collection of embedded statistical routines together with a tool for building statistical expressions .
Built on .NET , DXP can connect to whatever databases or data results the user needs .
Quality assurance
By packaging up statistical routines and standard queries for common market sectors DXP will certainly take the masses some of the way towards BI , though it is not unreasonable to observe that it will only be as good as the management of the raw data on which it draws - the validity and quality of which is the equally important alter ego of BI , and something the `rocket scientists ’ tend to take quite seriously as an integral part of the BI mix .
Quality assurance of the data used is really the crux of BI and usually one of the expensive parts of the process .
Poor or zero data QA management will invalidate the reason for having BI at all , and could be seriously damaging to a business in the hands of the naïve or unscrupulous .
Because front - end systems need a back - end to drive them , one trend that will be seen as vendors jockey for a share of the BI - for - the - masses market is rationalisation via acquisition .
The latest example of this has been the move by Applix to acquire Temtec International BV .
The latter ’s Executive Viewer is an analysis and reporting front - end tool aimed at the self - service - analysis sector .
It integrates with a number of back end systems , such as Hyperion Essbase , Microsoft Analysis Services and SAP .
Applix plans to use it to provide a single interface to performance management systems that can be applied across a diverse range of business monitoring and management requirements .
And is all this Business Intelligence needed ?
Well , according to a survey conducted by Vanson Bourne for Microsoft , the answer is yes .
This report sets out to establish that businesses - and UK businesses in particular - have very bad Business IQ because they are not using BI properly or at all .
One of the problems it identifies is a traditional one , and not necessarily a BI one at all : namely , that much business information and intelligence is held by people rather than the system , and that there is a need to break down these information silos .
That , however , is arguably more a cultural and knowledge management issue than a BI one .
According to the press release , it does seem that the report uses some strangely irrelevant statistics to help make its point , such as `63 per cent of organisations using BI technology deploy Microsoft SQL Servers while 33 per cent use Business Objects ’ , which does seem to be a `car / combine harvester ’ comparison .
But despite that , there is a point to it - that there is a need for DIYBI , and for it to really take off there is still a good deal of end user education required . ®

In Brief
Over a ten - month period , the Center for Media and Democracy ( CMD ) documented television newsrooms ' use of 36 video news releases ( VNRs ) — a small sample of the thousands produced each year .
CMD identified 77 television stations , from those in the largest to the smallest markets , that aired these VNRs or related satellite media tours ( SMTs ) in 98 separate instances , without disclosure to viewers .
Collectively , these 77 stations reach more than half of the U.S. population .
The VNRs and SMTs whose broadcast CMD documented were produced by three broadcast PR firms for 49 different clients , including General Motors , Intel , Pfizer and Capital One .
In each case , these 77 television stations actively disguised the sponsored content to make it appear to be their own reporting .
In almost all cases , stations failed to balance the clients ' messages with independently - gathered footage or basic journalistic research .
More than one - third of the time , stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety .
Report highlights include :
Summary
Although the number of media formats and outlets has exploded in recent years , television remains the dominant news source in the United States .
More than three - quarters of U.S. adults rely on local TV news , and more than 70 percent turn to network TV or cable news on a daily or near - daily basis , according to a January 2006 Harris Poll .
The quality and integrity of television reporting thus significantly impacts the public 's ability to evaluate everything from consumer products to medical services to government policies .
To reach this audience — and to add a veneer of credibility to clients ' messages — the public relations industry uses video news releases ( VNRs ) .
VNRs are pre-packaged " news " segments and additional footage created by broadcast PR firms , or by publicists within corporations or government agencies .
VNRs are designed to be seamlessly integrated into newscasts , and are freely provided to TV stations .
Although the accompanying information sent to TV stations identifies the clients behind the VNRs , nothing in the material for broadcast does .
Without strong disclosure requirements and the attention and action of TV station personnel , viewers cannot know when the news segment they 're watching was bought and paid for by the very subjects of that " report . "
In recent years , the U.S. Congress , the Federal Communications Commission , journalism professors , reporters and members of the general public have expressed concern about VNRs .
In response , public relations executives and broadcaster groups have vigorously defended the status quo , claiming there is no problem with current practices .
In June 2005 , the president of the Radio - Television News Directors Association ( RTNDA ) , Barbara Cochran , told a reporter that VNRs were " kind of like the Loch Ness Monster .
Everyone talks about it , but not many people have actually seen it . "
To inform this debate , the Center for Media and Democracy ( CMD ) conducted a ten - month study of selected VNRs and their use by television stations , tracking 36 VNRs issued by three broadcast PR firms .
Key findings include :
VNR use is widespread .
CMD found 69 TV stations that aired at least one VNR from June 2005 to March 2006 — a significant number , given that CMD was only able to track a small percentage of the VNRs streaming into newsrooms during that time .
Collectively , these 69 stations broadcast to 52.7 percent of the U.S. population , according to Nielsen Media figures .
Syndicated and network - distributed segments sometimes included VNRs , further broadening their reach .

VNRs are aired in TV markets of all sizes .
TV stations often use VNRs to limit the costs associated with producing , filming and editing their own reports .
However , VNR usage is not limited to small - town stations with shoestring budgets .
Nearly two - thirds of the VNRs that CMD tracked were aired by stations in a Top 50 Nielsen market area , such as Detroit , Pittsburgh or Cincinnati .
Thirteen VNRs were broadcast in the ten largest markets , including New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia and Boston .

TV stations do n't disclose VNRs to viewers .
Of the 87 VNR broadcasts that CMD documented , not once did the TV station disclose the client ( s ) behind the VNR to the news audience .
Only one station , WHSV - 3 in Harrisonburg , VA , provided partial disclosure , identifying the broadcast PR firm that created the VNR , but not the client , DaimlerChrysler .
WHSV - 3 aired soundbites from a Chrysler representative and directed viewers to websites associated with Chrysler , without disclosing the company 's role in the " report . "

TV stations disguise VNRs as their own reporting .
In every VNR broadcast that CMD documented , the TV station altered the VNR 's appearance .
Newsrooms added station - branded graphics and overlays , to make VNRs indistinguishable from reports that genuinely originated from their station .
A station reporter or anchor re-voiced the VNR in more than 60 percent of the VNR broadcasts , sometimes repeating the publicist 's original narration word - for - word .

TV stations do n't supplement VNR footage or verify VNR claims .
While TV stations often edit VNRs for length , in only seven of the 87 VNR broadcasts documented by CMD did stations add any independently - gathered footage or information to the segment .
In all other cases , the entire aired " report " was derived from a VNR and its accompanying script .
In 31 of the 87 VNR broadcasts , the entire aired " report " was the entire pre-packaged VNR .
Three stations ( WCPO - 9 in Cincinnati , OH ; WSYR - 9 in Syracuse , NY ; and WYTV - 33 in Youngstown , OH ) removed safety warnings from a VNR touting a newly - approved prescription skin cream .
WSYR - 9 also aired a VNR heralding a " major health breakthrough " for arthritis sufferers — a supplement that a widely - reported government study had found to be little better than a placebo .

The vast majority of VNRs are produced for corporate clients .
Of the hundreds of VNRs that CMD reviewed for potential tracking , only a few came from government agencies or non-profit organizations .
Corporations have consistently been the dominant purveyors of VNRs , though the increased scrutiny of government - funded VNRs in recent years may have decreased their use by TV newsrooms .
Of the VNRs that CMD tracked , 47 of the 49 clients behind them were corporations that stood to benefit financially from the favorable " news " coverage .

Satellite media tours may accompany VNRs .
Broadcast PR firms sometimes produce both VNRs and satellite media tours ( SMTs ) for clients .
SMTs are actual interviews with TV stations , but their focus and scope are determined by the clients .
In effect , SMTs are live recitations of VNR scripts .
CMD identified 10 different TV stations that aired SMTs for 17 different clients with related VNRs .
In only one instance was there partial disclosure to viewers .
An anchor at WLTX - 19 in Columbia , SC , said after the segment , " This interview ... was provided by vendors at the consumer trade show , " but did not name the four corporate clients behind the SMT .
In sum , television newscasts — the most popular news source in the United States — frequently air VNRs without disclosure to viewers , without conducting their own reporting , and even without fact checking the claims made in the VNRs .
VNRs are overwhelmingly produced for corporations , as part of larger public relations campaigns to sell products , burnish their image , or promote policies or actions beneficial to the corporation .
Walter is so self - evidently right that you wonder how this " debate " can still be taking place .
The reason - and the problem - is that the feminist critique has consistently failed to account for women's own complicity in the genre .
The Nuts website , for example , features a page called Assess My Breasts , inviting men to study photos of naked breasts and rank them - which does n't seem particularly respectful .
But the thousands of images have been uploaded by ordinary women - " entirely voluntarily " , for free , as the spokeswoman took pleasure pointing out .
Without these willing armies of female volunteers , there would be no breasts for any readers of Nuts to assess - or any of the " Real Girls ! " beloved of porn shoots , and no " High Street Honeys " for FHM porn scouts to find .
" A lot of young women feel very angry " about lad mag culture , Walter still insisted - but the evidence is , regrettably , against her .
Circulation figures for lad mags have actually been plummeting ; fewer and fewer men are buying them , and the genre 's bubble is widely believed to have burst .
More and more women , however , are giving every impression that they would consider it a compliment - indeed a triumph - to be objectified in the manner of a cover girl .
A recent American book , Pornified , chronicles countless cases of schoolchildren videoing themselves having sex - on the school bus , surprisingly often - and distributing the footage via their mobile phones .
I had hoped this was a peculiarly American phenomenon , but at a London school where a teacher I know works , a pupil recently videoed a younger girl giving him a blowjob in the school toilets , then uploaded her performance straight on to YouTube .
I used to think that rumours about normal , well - adjusted teenage girls posting topless pictures in chat rooms for boys they had never even met were alarmist myths .
But I spent some time around 12 - year - olds this summer , and it turns out they are absolutely true .
This week FHM was censured for publishing a photograph of a topless 14 - year - old without her consent - but the real shock came in FHM 's revelation that it receives more than 1,200 submissions of women topless or in lingerie every single week .
It is no wonder a lot of men now genuinely believe that women want to be treated as sex objects .
Who could blame them when so many of us have internalised an exhibitionistic ideal of our own objectification ?
You could argue , I suppose , that women who put headless photos of their naked torsos on to the internet are still suffering the legacy of millennia of male sexual oppression .
But there must come a point where it is simply implausible to keep blaming men .
" The beauty industry is a monster , selling unattainable dreams .
It lies , it cheats , it exploits women . "
The woman who said that was mourned this week as a progressive feminist heroine - so it 's a pity , and a puzzle , that Anita Roddick spent her life encouraging women to buy into it - but she was far from alone .
Postfeminists in the 90s assured women they could safely re-embrace their " femininity " without sacrificing equality or credibility .
And so manicures , and Brazilian bikini waxes and pole - dancing classes were all reintroduced under the guise of harmless girly " fun " .
Barely 10 years later , we look in the mirror and mistake ourselves for sex workers .
If we do not want to find channels like Nuts TV on our televisions , we are going to have to stop lying to ourselves and each other .
That would mean we have to stop buying pre-teen daughters T - shirts that say Babe In Training or Born To Shop , or taking them to see Bratz : The Movie .
It means not reading any more magazines devoted to laughing at a celebrity for having a sweatmark on her dress , and not watching any more Living TV - the closest female equivalent on cable to Nuts TV , being targeted explicitly at women and consisting almost exclusively of programmes about breast enlargement .
It is hard to see how men can be expected to notice a distinction between professional sex objects and the vast majority of women if we can't tell the difference ourselves .

Certain laser printers used in offices and homes release tiny particles of toner - like material into the air that people can inhale deep into lungs where they may pose a health hazard , scientists are reporting .
Their study is scheduled for the August 1 online issue of the American Chemical Society 's Environmental Science & Technology ( ES&T ) , a semi-monthly journal .
Lidia Morawska , Ph.D. , and colleagues in Australia classified 17 out of 62 printers in the study as " high particle emitters " because they released such elevated quantities of particles , which the researchers believe to be toner , the ultrafine powder used in laser printers instead of ink to form text and images .
One of the printers released particles into an experimental chamber at a rate comparable to the particle emissions from cigarette smoking , the report stated .
Thirty - seven of the 62 printers , on the other hand , released no particles that diminished air quality .
Six released only low levels , and 2 medium levels .
All printers were monitored in an open office , and the researchers recorded data on three laser printers in an experimental chamber .
The study included popular models in the U. S. and Australia sold internationally under the Canon , HP Color Laserjet , Ricoh and Toshiba brand names .
Most of the printer - generated particles detected were ultrafine , Morawska said , explaining that such contaminants are easily inhaled into the smallest passageways of the lungs where they could pose " a significant health threat . "
Previous studies have focused on emissions of volatile organic compounds , ozone , and toner particles from office printers and copiers .
However , the research left broad gaps in scientific understanding of particle emissions and airborne concentrations of particles , the report noted .
Morawska and colleagues , who are with the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane , initially were not trying to close that knowledge gap .
" It was n't an area that we consciously decided to study , " Morawska said in an interview .
" We came across it by chance .
Initially we were studying the efficiency of ventilation systems to protect office settings from outdoor air pollutants .
We soon realized that we were seeing air pollution originating indoors , from laser printers . "
The study found that indoor particle levels in the office air increased fivefold during work hours due to printer use .
Printers emitted more particles when operating with new toner cartridges , and when printing graphics and images that require greater quantities of toner .
Funded by Queensland Department of Public Works and The Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation , the ES&T report includes a list of the brands and models in the study classified by amount of particles emitted .
As a result of the study , the scientists are calling on government officials to consider regulating emission levels from laser printers .
" By all means , this is an important indoor source of pollution , " Morawska said .
" There should be regulations . "
The health effects from inhaled ultrafine particles depend on particle composition , but the results can range from respiratory irritation to more severe illnesses , such as cardiovascular problems or cancer , Morawska said .
" Even very small concentrations can be related to health hazards , " she said .
" Where the concentrations are significantly elevated means there is potentially a considerable hazard . "
Larger particles also could be unhealthy without reaching the deepest parts of the lung .
" Because they are larger , " Morawska added , " they contain more mass and can carry more toxins into the body .
No matter how you look at it , there could be problems . "
Morawska said that more research on the health effects of inhaling printer - generated particles is needed .
As a first step to lower risk , people should ensure that rooms in offices or houses are well ventilated to allow airborne particles to disperse .

“ The only thing we have to fear is the ‘ culture of fear ’ itself , ” by Frank Furedi :
Fear plays a key role in twenty - first century consciousness .
Increasingly , we seem to engage with various issues through a narrative of fear .
You could see this trend emerging and taking hold in the last century , which was frequently described as an ‘ Age of Anxiety ’ .
But in recent decades , it has become more and better defined , as specific fears have been cultivated .
“ Give Back a Smile ” Program Restores Dental Health of Violence Victims
The Give Back a Smile Program founded by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry uses volunteer cosmetic dentists to restore the damaged teeth of domestic violence victims at no cost .
I learned of this program through an article on CNN yesterday that reports that 500 U.S. applicants have now received the program ’s services .
Survivors of violence can apply for cosmetic dental assistance by calling 800-773-4227 .
According to the website , the application process is as follows :
The Life of a GBAS Case :
1. A survivor calls the GBAS , 800-773-4227 , for an application .
2 . The application is received by the survivor , filled out with the assistance of a domestic violence counselor and returned to GBAS for review .
3 . When a dentist agrees to take the case , a letter is sent to the survivor with the volunteer ’s contact information listed .
It is the survivor ’s responsibility to call to set up the consultation .
4 . The dentist makes sure that the survivor qualifies according to the guidelines that were sent earlier at the consultation .
If not , the case is closed by GBAS .
5 . The dentist determines eligibility .
If eligible the dentist will develop a treatment plan .
6 . If / when lab assistance is needed , the coordinator will give contact information for a lab that will donate the work .
The original “ GBAS Donated Lab Work ” form that is sent with the case needs to be sent to ANY lab that is donating the work .
7 . When the case is complete , fill out the final report and send to GBAS and the case is recorded as complete .
Note that a domestic violence counselor or social worker must confirm that the tooth damage was caused by domestic violence , which is “ sometimes done through checking police reports or restraining orders . ”
Kudos to the AACD for organizing the volunteer dentists and providing these services .
Information for volunteers and donors is available online .
A few questions I have about the program :
[ Updated with responses from the AACD in italics ]
- What qualifies as domestic violence ?
Under the GBAS guidelines domestic violence can be physical abuse from a former intimate partner or spouse .
We also take into consideration emotional abuse , for example if someone was not allowed to seek dental care .
- Can men receive treatment ?
Yes , as long as they meet the eligibility requirements of the program .
- Abused children ?
Unfortunately , the GBAS program is only available to adult survivors of domestic abuse .
GBAS does not have the resources to expand its services outside these guidelines at this time .
- Can same - sex partners qualify ?
Yes , as long as they meet the eligibility requirements of the program .
- Are oral health issues such as cavities and gum disease addressed , or are only cosmetic / tooth replacement issues considered ?
The volunteers are asked to at least treat the injured area but they are not limited to that .
The program ’s guidelines do not include severe decay , neglect or gum disease .
The doctor does have the option of treating these issues but they are not required to .
- Is there any screening for oral cancers ?
This is up to each individual volunteer GBAS member dentist .
- How long does it typically take from application to receiving services ?
The application process can a few months .
Depending on the availability of volunteer GBAS member dentists in certain areas or multiple survivors needing assistance in some areas the wait can be longer .
- Are services generally available locally , or are they centered only in big cities ?
How geographically broad is the program ?
How far do most applicants have to drive to receive assistance ?
There are volunteer GBAS member dentists throughout the United States including rural areas and large cities and in Canada .
GBAS does consider distance when matching a domestic violence survivor with a volunteer GBAS member dentist .
Reimbursements are made for any travel expenses incurred .
Each case is different but generally most survivors do not need to travel long distances .
- What percentage of applicants receive services ?
Do all applicants with confirmed teeth problems due to domestic violence generally receive assistance ?
As long as the eligibility requirements are met survivors of domestic violence generally receive assistance .
They do not receive services if they miss appointments , cancel short notice , do n’t keep us updated as to their current contact information , or the dentist does not see any evidence of dental injuries as a result of abuse .
Will update if I get answers .
Thanks to Anna Velten of AACD for answering my questions .
A prototype of what may be the next generation of personal computers has been developed by researchers in the University of Maryland 's A. James Clark School of Engineering .
Capable of computing speeds 100 times faster than current desktops , the technology is based on parallel processing on a single chip .
Parallel processing is an approach that allows the computer to perform many different tasks simultaneously , a sharp contrast to the serial approach employed by conventional desktop computers .
The prototype developed by Uzi Vishkin and his Clark School colleagues uses a circuit board about the size of a license plate on which they have mounted 64 parallel processors .
To control those processors , they have developed the crucial parallel computer organization that allows the processors to work together and make programming practical and simple for software developers .
“ The single - chip supercomputer prototype built by Prof .
Uzi Vishkin ’s group uses rich algorithmic theory to address the practical problem of building an easy - to - program multicore computer , ” said Charles E. Leiserson , professor of computer science and engineering at MIT .
“ Vishkin ’s chip unites the theory of yesterday with the reality of today . ”
Desktop Parallel Processing
Parallel processing on a massive scale using numerous interconnected chips or computers has been used for years to create supercomputers .
However , its application to desktop systems has been a challenge because of severe programming complexities .
The Clark School team found a way to use single chip parallel processing technology to change that .
Vishkin , a professor in the Clark School ’s electrical and computer engineering department and the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies ( UMIACS ) , explained the advantage of parallel processing like this : “ Suppose you hire one person to clean your home , and it takes five hours , or 300 minutes , for the person to perform each task , one after the other , ” Vishkin said .
“ That ’s analogous to the current serial processing method .
Now imagine that you have 100 cleaning people who can work on your home at the same time !
That ’s the parallel processing method .

“ The ‘ software ’ challenge is : Can you manage all the different tasks and workers so that the job is completed in 3 minutes instead of 300 ? ” Vishkin continued .
“ Our algorithms make that feasible for general - purpose computing tasks for the first time . ”
Vishkin and his team are now demonstrating their technology , which in future devices could include 1,000 processors on a chip the size of a finger nail , to government and industry groups .
To show how easy it is to program , Vishkin is also providing access to the prototype to students at Montgomery Blair High School in Montgomery County , Md .
From Theory to Reality
For years , the personal computer industry achieved advancements in computer clock speed , the fundamental rate at which a computer performs operations , thanks to innovations in chip fabrication technologies and miniaturization .
Moore ’s Law — which dictates that the number of transistors on integrated circuits in computers will double every 18 to 24 months — was coupled with a corresponding improvement in clock speed .
But no advancements in clock speed have been achieved since 2004 .
From an early stage , Vishkin foresaw that Moore ’s Law would ultimately fail to help improve clock speed due to physical limitations .
This has guided his perseverance over his professional career in seeking to improve computer productivity by distributing the load among multiple processors , accomplishing computer tasks in parallel .

In 1979 , Vishkin , a pioneer in parallel computing , began his work on developing a theory of parallel algorithms that relied on a mathematical model of a parallel computer , since , at that time , no viable parallel prototype existed .
By 1997 , advances in technology enabled him to begin building a prototype desktop device to test his theory ; he and his team completed the device in December 2006 .
The prototype device ’s physical hardware attributes are strikingly ordinary — standard computer components executing at 75 MHz .
It is the device ’s parallel architecture , ease of programming and processing performance relative to other computers with the same clock speed that get people ’s attention .
“ Based on the very positive reactions of my graduate students this spring , ” Vishkin stated , “ I knew that it was time to take the technology public . ”
Earlier this month , Vishkin and his Ph.D. student , Xingzhi Wen , published a paper about his newly - built parallel processing technology for the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures , and showcased it at a major computing conference , the ACM International Conference on Supercomputing ( ICS ) in Seattle .
At the ICS event , Vishkin allowed conference participants to connect to the device remotely and run programs on it in a full - day tutorial session he conducted , offering colleagues and student participants the opportunity to experience the prototype technology firsthand .
Vishkin also participated in a panel discussion at a special invitation - only Microsoft Workshop on Many - Core Computing on June 20 - 21 in Seattle , Wash .
In August , Vishkin will present a keynote address at the Workshop on Highly Parallel Processing on a Chip in Rennes , France , held in conjunction with the 13th Euro - Par , an international European conference on parallel and distributed computing .
“ This system represents a significant improvement in generality and flexibility for parallel computer systems because of its unique abilities , ” said Burton Smith , technical fellow for advanced strategies and policy at Microsoft .
“ It will be able to exploit a wider spectrum of parallel algorithms than today ’s microprocessors can , and this in turn will help bring general purpose parallel computing closer to reality . ”
Vishkin has filed several patents on his parallel processing technology since 1997 .
Funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense , his research has also received significant interest from the computer industry , which he believes his technology will revitalize .
“ The manufacturers have done an excellent job over the years of increasing a single processor ’s clock speed through clever miniaturization strategies and new materials , ” he noted .
“ But they have now reached the limits of this approach .
It is time for a practical alternative that will allow a new wave of innovation and growth — and that ’s what we have created with our parallel computing technology . ”
In addition to Xingzhi Wen , Vishkin ’s research teams includes students Aydin Balkan , George Caragea , Mike Detwiler , Tom Dubois , Mike Horak , Fuat Keceli , Mary Kiemb and Alex Tzannes , as well as electrical and computer engineering professors Rajeev Barua and Gang Qu .
Firebug and javascript.options.strict
I ’ve had some complaints recently that my site was taking an age to load in Firefox .
In fact , anything built with base2 was performing very badly for some Firefox users .
My advice to them was to disable Firebug .
This solved the problem but I did n’t know why .
I use Firebug and was n’t experiencing any slow down .
Yesterday I received an email from Alex Robinson and now the mystery is solved .
Firefox allows users to set various preferences via the about : config URL .
One of these settings , javascript.options .strict , generates various warnings and messages about your JavaScript code .
Firebug then takes these messages and turns them into entries in the console .
The latest version of base2 was generating about a hundred information / warning messages .
Things like , “ function does not always return a value ” .
A Firebug console entry is made up of several DOM elements , so a hundred messages generates several hundred DOM insertions .
This is what was causing my site to perform so badly for some users .
I ’ve since refactored the base2 code so that it no longer generates any warning or informational messages .
I have n’t uploaded this code yet as I have made some other changes which I ’ll blog about later .
I recommend that you test your own code with javascript.options .
strict set to true .
The polar ice caps on Mars have been there for a long time ; although , they have n’t always stayed the same size , or shape .
They cover the surface between the poles and approximately 60 Â° latitude today , but Norbert Schorghofer of the Institute for Astronomy and NASA Astrobiology Institute in Hawaii has shown that Mars has had at least forty major ice ages during the past five million years .
The Martian ice caps are divided into three layers : a massive bottom sheet , a porous middle layer and a thin , dry , dusty top layer .
The makeup and extent of the ice coverage has varied over its long history due to both precipitation of water vapor from the atmosphere , and the diffusion and condensation of water from pores in the ice .
“ Although neither of the two mechanisms by itself could simultaneously account for the mass fraction and latitudinal boundary of the observed ice , their combination provides just enough ice at the right places , ” Schorghofer said .
Unlike the Earth , Mars does n’t have a Moon to keep its tilt in check .
Instead , the planet is able to tilt as much as 10 - degrees from its current angle .
This can create tremendous variation in the size of its ice sheets .
Earlier studies of the ice showed that the shifting of the ice was due largely to Marsâ€™ varying tilt ( obliquity ) , and thus changes in global and local temperatures affecting the humidity levels of the entire planet .
Schorghofer used computer modeling that takes into account thermal and atmospheric conditions , as well as the growth and retreat of the ice sheets .
His research shows that the transfer of water vapor from the ice into the atmosphere , and the condensation of this water back into the ice profoundly altered the way in which the ice caps melted and re-froze .
Closer to the poles , the amount of ice changes very little over time .
But near the edges of the sheets , the volume of ice has varied by as much as 100,000 cubic km during each ice age .
Mars ’ icy love handles have each also shrunk an overall depth of 60 cm over the past 2.5 million years .
Understanding the cause for ice ages on Mars may help us learn more about the climate history of other planets , including Earth .
“ The dynamic nature of the ice sheets makes Mars an ideal system in which to test and expand our knowledge of astronomical climate forcing .
A great deal could be learned about terrestrial ice ages from the study of Martian ice stratigraphy â€ “ a longer , cleaner and simpler record than Earthâ€™s , ” Schorghofer said .
When the Phoenix Mars Lander arrives at the Red Planet in 2008 , it might just see the different kinds of ice layers that Schorghofer is predicting .

A tame female elephant has fled an Indian circus after eloping with a wild bull elephant that broke open a gate and led her off into the jungle , her distraught handler said today .
" I brought up Savitri since she joined the circus two decades ago , " Kalimudddin Sheikh , who unsuccessfully tried to lure his charge away from her new beau , added .
The wild male , who wildlife officials believe was probably in musth - the periodic condition in which bull elephants seek to mate - turned up at the travelling circus when it stopped in the village of Kumar Bazar , in West Bengal state , yesterday .
It broke into an enclosure and led Savitri into the jungle , with the pair being followed by three other female elephants in the same pen .
Their trumpeting alerted circus workers , who led them back .
Savitri's mind , however , seemed made up .
According to one forestry official , she was last seen bathing with the bull in a jungle pond .
When handlers called for Savitri to come to them , she looped her trunk around the bull 's leg and " he protectively shielded her like in a Bollywood blockbuster , " the official said .
The forestry department said it would continue to monitor the pair to ensure they did not cause any damage .
For nearly five decades , America 's role in the military coup that ousted Iran 's elected prime minister and returned the shah to power has been lost to history , the subject of fierce debate in Iran and stony silence in the United States .
One by one , participants have retired or died without revealing key details , and the Central Intelligence Agency said a number of records of the operation -- its first successful overthrow of a foreign government -- had been destroyed .
But a copy of the agency 's secret history of the 1953 coup has surfaced , revealing the inner workings of a plot that set the stage for the Islamic revolution in 1979 , and for a generation of anti-American hatred in one of the Middle East 's most powerful countries .
The document , which remains classified , discloses the pivotal role British intelligence officials played in initiating and planning the coup , and it shows that Washington and London shared an interest in maintaining the West 's control over Iranian oil .
The secret history , written by the C.I.A.'s chief coup planner and obtained by The New York Times , says the operation 's success was mostly a matter of chance .
The document shows that the agency had almost complete contempt for the man it was empowering , Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi , whom it derided as a vacillating coward .
And it recounts , for the first time , the agency 's tortured efforts to seduce and cajole the shah into taking part in his own coup .

People think it 's easy to become a massage therapist .
I blame the commercials .
They always say " In less than a year , I got on the road to a health care career ! "
They never mention that in LESS THAN A YEAR , we know the names , locations , and functions of every body part .
Not just 206 bones , but even the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons of your neurons .
We 've studied diseases and skin conditions .
We learn about Eastern medicine , too .
This involves energy , points , channels , colors , seasons , emotions ...
We packed all of that , and much more , into our brains .
I think that deserves a hint of respect .
You guys come to my office without even taking a shower first .
Sir , you 're going to be naked on my table , and I 'm only going to be an arm 's length away .
It 's June , and we 're in Florida .
The room stinks before you 've even finished undressing .
Oh , and you have n't even passed gas yet ... which half of you do .
Most of you start face down .
In a way , that 's nice for me .
You 're can't be too aggressive with your sexual harassment yet .
That 's what I think , eh ?
As soon as I move that towel , you spread your thighs and lift your ass .
I was n't going to touch your musky hole in the first place ... but I 'm having a hard time convincing myself to do your thighs with all of the funk in the air .
After waving it around for a minute , you realize I 'm not going to be entering your back door .
So you sigh unhappily , reach down to adjust , and lay back on the table .
I finish your feet , and it 's time to turn over .
I 've continued the massage , you 're flipped over .
We can pretend all of that ugliness never happened .
Why , oh why , did n't you brush your teeth ?
Or chew some gum ?
I 'm massaging your face , pressing on your sinus points , and you smell like something took a crap in your mouth , and then died .
No , this is NOT a good time for you to reach up and caress my hand .
I did n't want you to do it in the first place , and now I REALLY do n't want you to .
I try to move on as quickly as possible ... but then I remember that I 'm getting closer to that other area .
You 're going to ask me , are n't you ?
I cringe the whole time that I massage your stomach .
I move the towel so I can get to your thigh .
PHEW !
You did n't ask !
I 'm so relieved , I forgive the crap from earlier .
I 'm working on your feet when I see movement from the corner of my eye .
No , do n't !
NO !
You 've moved the towel a little , thinking you 're subtle ... and I can smell your nasty sweaty balls .
I ignore you totally .
Even if I was that kind of girl , I would n't do that for you .
I only have your other leg left , so I hurry .
I tell you that the session is done ... and then you ask .
" Does this massage have a happy ending ? " I say you should take your time getting dressed and head for the door .
I 'm daydreaming of a bath in bleach .
Undiluted .
You ask again , because you apparently think I 'm deaf .
Why not ?
I can't smell you , right ?
You leave , without leaving me a tip .
That 's fine , because you 're GONE .
That 's MY happy ending .

Next week , it is beginning an advertising campaign against the Republican candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani in Iowa .
Mr. Giuliani took out an advertisement yesterday in The Times attacking the group and Mrs. Clinton .
The group has held two online presidential forums , one on Iraq in April and the other on climate change in July .
Mr. Obama , of Illinois , came out on top in a straw poll for offering the best hope for leading the country out of Iraq and John Edwards won on climate change .
Mrs. Clinton , of New York , trailed significantly in both .
“ Anybody who has 3.2 million people in an organization and can mobilize and raise resources and things , they are going to have a big impact , ” said Joe Trippi , a senior adviser to Mr. Edwards .
MoveOn has shown a willingness to depart from party orthodoxy on campaigns .
Last year , despite party leaders ’ entreaties , it took an active role in aiding the antiwar candidacy of Ned Lamont , who was trying to unseat Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut , then a Democrat supporting the war effort .
Mr. Lamont won the Democratic primary .
Mr. Lieberman ran as an independent in the general election and kept his seat .
“ It ’s good for the Democrats to have an engaged and vocal left , ” said Jenny Backus , a Democratic strategist in Washington .
“ It ’s something the Republicans have benefited from in the last couple campaign cycles .
It allows Democrats to look moderate .
A vocal left keeps the party from drifting toward triangulation . ”
Democratic leaders in Congress and presidential campaigns said they winced when they saw the MoveOn advertisement .
While they may have agreed with its overall point , that the troop buildup has not worked , several Democratic officials said privately that the advertisement had been counterproductive .

Facebook NASHVILLE  Former vice president Al Gore said Friday that he still has n't ruled out a presidential bid in 2008 , but he does n't expect to run and might not possess the skills necessary to be elected president now .
Gore spoke to The Tennessean today before signing copies of his new book , The Assault on Reason , at Davis - Kidd Booksellers at the Mall in Green Hills , in Nashville .
For months ,
Gore has said repeatedly that he probably wo n't run for office again , but would n't say that he would never run for office again .
He reiterated that stance on Friday , but downplayed the possibility of another campaign .
" I do n't want anyone to interpret that answer as throwing a little red meat out for speculation , " Gore said .
" I am just being candid .
But I do n't expect to get into this race .
I have given the reasons why .
I strongly prefer to serve in other ways . "
Gore lost the 2000 presidential election to President Bush .
Gore , who lost the electoral vote despite winning the popular vote , now views the U.S. political system as flawed .
" It may be easier to fix it from the outside , " he said .
" Again , I have n't ruled out for all time thinking about politics again .
It 's just that the way it works now , I do n't think that the skills I have are the ones that are most likely to be rewarded within this system .
It 's like a washing machine that is permanently set on the spin cycle .
It does n't stop spinning .
That creates real problems for a politics based on reason . "
Friends have urged him to run for president again , but he wants to see a " transformation of this conversation of democracy " that de-emphasizes imagery and spin-doctoring .
" I expect it will take a lot more time , " Gore said .
" I 'm grateful for those who have a good opinion of me , to the point where they think I ought to run again , but I am not convinced myself that 's the best way for me to serve . "
Despite what he sees as problems in the political process , Gore said he still respects the system and the influence of the presidency .
While he wo n't completely dismiss a 2008 run , he does n't expect to re-enter politics " because I do n't think I 'm very good at some of the things that the modern political system rewards and requires , and I 've found other ways to make a difference and to serve the public interests .
And I 'm enjoying them . "

When the Federal Communications Commission issued its final set of rules for the upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction , reaction was mixed .
Open access proponents were disappointed that the FCC failed to include all four of Google 's open access suggestions , while the telecoms bemoaned the fact that two of them were included .
Verizon is taking its irritation over the FCC 's rules to the courts , asking the US District Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to set them aside .
Under the FCC 's rules , whoever wins the spectrum auction must allow consumers to use any device and any lawful application on their networks .
After the FCC 's decision , Verizon quickly made its position clear .
" Imposing any such requirements in the competitive wireless market would reduce the revenue the government will receive from the spectrum auction and limit the introduction of new and innovative wireless services , " the company said shortly after the announcement .
Despite that , Verizon appeared as though it would go along with the FCC 's decision .
As one might expect , the sticking points for Verizon are the two open access rules adopted by the FCC .
The telecom is asking the appeals court to vacate the FCC 's open access requirements but leave the rest of the auction rules intact .
In its petition for review , Verizon argues that the FCC exceeded its authority in mandating the two open access conditions , accusing the Commission of being " arbitrary " and " capricious " and saying that the rules are " unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law . "
Ars contacted Verizon for comment on the filing but was told by a company spokesperson that it would not comment further beyond the appeal .
Google , which has indicated that it plans to participate in the auction , was critical of Verizon 's lawsuit .
In a statement released in response to the legal action , Google criticized Verizon , saying that it " does n't think consumers deserved more choice " than they currently have .
" It 's regrettable that Verizon has decided to use the court system to try to prevent consumers from having any choice of innovative services , " wrote Chris Sacca , Google 's head of special initiatives .
" Once again , it is American consumers who lose from these tactics . "
The auction is currently scheduled to begin on January 16 , 2008 .
It is hoped that the result will be a real alternative to the current cable / DSL broadband duopoly .
The 700MHz spectrum is prime wireless real estate , as signals of that wavelength have a far reach and can easily penetrate buildings .

It 's the bitterest of ironies : thousands of men who 've given up work to care for their children are being ditched by their high - flying wives - who wanted them to stay at home in the first place
At the time it seemed like a good idea .
After all , Richard Dean told himself , he was earning less than his wife Louise , a high - flying marketing executive .
And did it really matter who was at home to look after their children ?
With that in mind , it was not such a difficult decision for him to give up his career as a manager in the manufacturing industry to look after their ten - month - old son , Jack .
He hoped it would bring them closer together as a family .
In reality , it sounded the death knell for their marriage .
Scroll down for more ...
" I sensed that Louise was becoming more detached and less interested in me sexually within a year of becoming a househusband , " says Richard , 50 .
" She was always picking on me for silly little things she said I had n't done , like the washing up or not tidying away the toys .
" It was as if she was losing all respect for me , just because I was the one at home , doing the domesworktic duties .
Then , one day two years ago , she announced she was leaving me - and taking the children with her .
She told me she was going to go and live with her mother 20 miles away .
To say I was devastated does not do my feelings justice .
It was as if the bottom had fallen out of my world . "
For five years Richard , from Watford , Herts , had worked hard to become a perfect " mother " to their sons , Jack , who is now nine , and Edward , seven .
But from the moment he gave up his job , Richard says Louise , 47 , failed to see him as a " man " .
The phenomenon of the househusband is an increasingly popular one .
The number of men deciding to become househusbands has increased by a staggering 83 per cent since 1993 .
According to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics , there are more than 200,000 fathers in the UK choosing to give up their careers and raise their children at home .
But are the couples who go down this domestic route sowing the seeds of marital disharmony ?
It seems that in many cases the rise of modern career women has had an unexpected - and disastrous - knock - on effect on many husbands who assume the traditionally ' female ' role .
In short , having a man whose primary function is not as alpha male breadwinner , but domestic drudge just ain't sexy .
Divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd - Platt says that in her experience , the decision to allow the wife to be the main wage earner will have a detrimental effect on as many as half of these relationships , and that divorce statistics in these cases have risen by at least five per cent in the past two years .
" My warning would be to think long and hard about letting the man stay at home , ' she says .
' I know it is very trendy for the wife to be the breadwinner , but in my professional experience this decision will strain the marriage .
It may be fun at first to say ' I have a househusband ' , but the wife will quickly begin to resent the fact the man is not pulling his weight financially .
" She will think : ' You 're not supporting me ' - within all of us I think there is still a very deep - seated belief that men should be the protectors .
A gradual lack of respect begins to eat into the relationship , and it puts men in a very vulnerable position .
" The role these men are performing at home is , of course , very valuable , but women can find it very hard to recognise and respect a man who is doing it . "
It 's a marital timebomb which exploded under Richard Dean 's relationship with little warning , yet he and his wife embarked on their " househusband " experiment with high hopes .
Richard says : " Our elder son was just a baby and I was intrigued by the thought of spending all day , every day , with him .
It did n't offend my masculinity at all - we'd also just moved into a bigger house and there was a lot of renovation work to be done , so when the baby was asleep I would don my hard hat and do some building work .
" I know my grandfather and my father could never have been househusbands , but I did n't see why there should be a social stigma in this day and age . "
Balance quickly shifted
But Richard says the balance in their relationship quickly shifted .
" I was happy to do all the cooking , cleaning , shopping and washing , but I began to feel that Louise was taking me for granted , " he says .
" She 'd come home exhausted after a ten - hour day , and I 'd be desperate to chat , to have some adult conversation , but she 'd say she was too tired . "
He says he poured his heart and soul into being a good " mother " , more so after their second son was born two years later .
' I made sure I structured my days with the children - I took them swimming , we went to the park and I did lots of activities with them , like reading and crafts .
I lived and breathed those children , but not once did I regret the decision to put my career on hold .
" Yes , it 's hard not making your own money , but I was doing the essential job of bringing up our children . "
But then the hammer blow fell , and Louise walked out , taking the boys with her .
" I begged her not to go , but I think she had simply decided she could find someone more dynamic than me , " he says sadly .
" Suddenly , the children I 'd cared for since they were babies were being taken away .
" It 's all very well to be a househusband , but she had come to look down on me , to think of me as not very masculine , and not hard - working .
It was as if all the things I did around the house did n't count - that was nothing compared to how hard she had to work in her mind , which was so unfair .
" And the great irony was that we 'd decided together that I should stay at home with the children . "
While the pain of the separation was humiliating enough , worse was to follow when Richard attempted to establish proper contact with his children .
For two years he fought through the family courts , desperately trying to gain full access to Jack and Edward .
And at the same time , he was forced to find to meet maintenance payments .
Having effectively quit his career five years earlier , he had to start at the bottom all over again .
" I was left out in the cold , " he says .
" It left me in an impossible situation , because I 'd been out of the workplace for five years , caring for my children , and yet now I was expected to get straight back to work and start paying her some maintenance . "
The moment Richard 's wife said she was leaving him and taking the children , she changed her working hours from full to part - time so she could spend more time with the boys , while her mother helped with the rest of the childcare .
" It was very cleverly done , " he says .
" I 've had to take a series of menial part - time jobs just to keep me going financially , and on top of all that I 've had two years of solicitor 's bills in taking my wife to court to get better access to the children , which has cost me at least £ 12,000 .
Stress
Richard is still desperately fighting for better access to the two children he did so much to raise , but now sees only every other weekend .
' It 's no wonder I am suffering from stress , and have gone from living in the lovely home we owned to a two - bedroom flat in a much rougher area of town .
Vanessa Lloyd - Platt says there is a huge problem built into the legal system at a time when more and more fathers are becoming primary carers for their children .
" There has been a massive turnaround in roles within a marriage , but there is still a very strong belief in the legal system that allowing the father to have residency of the children is somehow against the natural order of things , and many judges still believe the children will be better off with their mother . "
It 's a conundrum which is all too familiar to 46 - year - old James Thomson , who works as a mechanical engineer , but prior to this was a stay - at - home father to his three daughters , Alice , 14 , Chloe , 11 , and Amy , eight .
He lives in Manchester , and like Richard , he found that his marriage to Angela - a 43 - year - old who runs her own communications company - began to crumble once he had given up his job .
James says : " We made the decision that I should stay at home when Alice was 18 months old .
Angela was earning twice as much as I was .
Up to that point we'd had a child - minder , but it felt as if neither of us was spending much time with our child .
" Alice would scream when we dropped her off with the child - minder , so it was obvious that all was not well .
We then had a two - week family holiday in Greece and talked about the future .
It became obvious that by the time we'd paid a child - minder and both of our petrol costs , there was n't a lot left from my wage .
It actually made financial sense for me to be at home .
" To my surprise , I slipped into the role with real ease .
I shopped , cleaned , washed and cared for Alice , and then Chloe and Amy once they came along .
Alice was with a childminder for just under a year before I gave up my job , and I was a househusband for about 11 years until we split . "
James says that as a househusband 12 years ago he was very much in the minority , and many mothers were very distrustful of him .
" There were n't many couples doing this when we first made the decision , and I think some other mothers thought I was trying to seduce them when I 'd chat to them at coffee mornings and play groups , ' he says .
" In the park , they 'd all be sitting chatting to each other while I rushed around physically playing with my kids and they ignored me .
" Then when my wife came home she 'd plonk herself down in a chair and put on the TV or read a magazine and ignore me , too , while I was still running round with the children .
" I suppose I did resent this , but I thought that was the trade - off .
The children meant the world to me .
But then , in 2005 , our relationship broke down completely .
We were hardly talking to each other , and she was spending longer and longer out of the house .
" One day she came home suddenly and told me that she did n't love me any more , and she was fed up with being the main breadwinner .
" It came out of the blue to me - we 'd jointly agreed that this was the best plan , and it was as if the rug was being pulled from under my feet to be told that she was not happy and deeply resented having to earn all the money .
" Further arguments followed and over the course of several months they got more and more heated until in the end I told her to pack her bags and get out if she was so miserable .
At first the children stayed with me and she visited them , but then she took me to court . "
As both Richard and James were to discover , the British courts still favour the mother when it comes to deciding where the children should live in divorce cases , even if the father has previously been the primary carer .
James has 50 - 50 care of his children - he has them for one week , his wife the next .
" I suppose I should be grateful that I have a half - share in my children , but it does n't feel like that to me at all - I miss them so much , " he says .
" I just have to put up with what little time I have with them , and be grateful for that .
James says : " It 's madness that in this day and age fathers do not have more rights over their children .
I think it 's appalling that courts should be able to rule that a father 's needs are somehow less than those of a woman .
Just because someone gave birth to the children does n't mean they love them more .
" I cope by working very long shifts when my children are n't here , and my company has been really helpful and understanding in letting me work flexible hours when I need to pick them up from school . "
David Williams , 48 , from Cardiff , is still fighting his wife Mandy , 39 , for custody of their four - year - old daughter , Alexandra , after they split up two years ago .
He used to work in social services , but is now retired through ill health .
His wife used to work as an administration officer , but has given up full - time work to care for their daughter .
Like Richard and James , he feels much of his masculinity and power in the relationship was lost when he gave up his job to become a househusband .
" It is ironic , given that for hundreds of years women have been perceived solely as housewives and mothers , and yet their role has been regarded as essential to society and they have been respected and valued for it , " he says .
" But once I gave up my career , I lost prestige both in society and in the eyes of my wife .
It was as if I had no value .
" There were times in our marriage when I felt as if I was being treated like a subservient Victorian housewife .
I 'd be criticised if the washing was n't hung out exactly how my wife wanted it and she used to check to make sure that I had cleaned the house perfectly , checking for dust and badly - washed plates .
" My wife was a real control freak and she wanted everything to be done perfectly .
My standards were n't good enough , even though I had run a house perfectly successfully on my own before I met her .
I spent my days cooking and cleaning , as well as doing everything for our daughter . "
David is still very bitter about the outcome of their divorce .
" Even though I had been looking after my daughter for two years , when it came to our divorce the judge assumed my wife should be the one to have custody of our child - just because she 's a mother , " he says .
" This was despite the fact she was working full - time , and I had been the primary carer .
Now that she has full custody of Alexandra , she works part - time from home .
It is a situation that makes me weep - I miss my daughter so much . "
He now lives alone , in the little cottage he owned before he married , and sees Alexandra only every other week .
" She lives 110 miles away from me , away from the friends she made when she lived in our village , and my family , in the area that was her home .
I 'm allowed to see her for two weekends a month .
That means a round trip for me of more than 200 miles .
It is annihilating me , both emotionally and physically . "
If current trends are anything to go by , the number of men deciding to become househusbands is set to rise even more dramatically .
But how many of those men - who no doubt start out by regarding themselves as paragons of sensitive modern manhood - will end up wishing they had never left the office at all ?

KAMPALA ( Reuters ) - Ugandan police are holding a Ghanaian preacher over a stage magic device they fear may dupe people into believing they have experienced miracles .
Customs officials seized the Electric Touch device -- which magicians use to give small electric shocks to volunteers -- from “ Prophet ” Obiri Yeboah at the airport last week , the state owned New Vision daily reported Tuesday .
The pastor heads one of many Pentecostal churches in Uganda , receiving large sums of money from congregations seeking miracle cures for diseases or help with financial problems .
The Electric Touch device is usually sold in magic shops alongside card tricks , magic coins and disappearing balls .
“ With a simple touch , make a fluorescent bulb glow on and off at your command , make confetti move , charge a spoon and watch as it shocks a volunteer ! ” says one online magic shop selling the device .
“ People could be duped to think it is a miracle , ” the New Vision quoted Civil Aviation Authority security chief Herman Owomugisha as saying .
Officials are worried about the proliferation of “ miracle ” churches in Uganda , many of which claim to cure HIV / AIDS .
Interview Few people know the music industry better than Peter Jenner .
Pink Floyd 's first manager , who subsequently managed Syd Barrett 's solo career , Jenner has also looked after T.Rex , The Clash , Ian Dury , Disposable Heroes and Billy Bragg - who he manages today .
He 's also secretary general of the International Music Managers Forum .
And he does n't pull his punches .
The major four music labels today are " fucked " , he says .
Digital music pricing has been a scam where the consumer pays for manufacturing , distribution , and does all the work - and still has to pay more .
Labels should outsource everything except finance and licensing .
But he 's also optimistic that for almost everyone else - indie labels , musicians , songwriters and budding entrepreneurs - as well as network providers - the future 's going to be pretty bright .
The Big Four know that the DRM era is nearly over - and within two or three years , he predicts , " most countries " in the world will have a blanket licensing regime where we exchange music freely , for a couple of quid a month .
In the future , he also suggests , artists , co-ops and managers will raise their own investment on behalf of artists - and pick and choose their marketing teams .
Jenner is organising a conference in London on November 15 to discuss these issues .
Billed as an " Urgent Blue Sky Debate " , for once a music event may live up to its billing .
Earlier this year , France almost voted to legalise P2P and bring in a blanket license - the necessary stepping stone to the future .
While Jenner elaborated on these in a report for MusicTank recently - it 's only available to the public for a fee .
So we were delighted when he dropped by Vulture Central yesterday to lift the lid on the business .
Strong language follows .
You said that at In The City , the big label executives have lost their faith in DRM - they do n't believe in it any more .
They do n't .
Not anymore .
And that was done by Sony BMG - what the fuck was that [ rootkit DRM ] about ?
The other was iTunes - and they 've seen how kids do n't like it .
The unitary payment does n't suit the technology , it does n't suit how they 're actually using downloads - which is to explore and move around .
You do n't want to pay a dollar for each track when you want to explore music .
And they 're pretty crappy services , too .
eMusic works , but when the others time - bomb the songs it 's more annoying than the per-machine restriction .
Because it 's suddenly robbing you of something you had .
Oh yes .
And three years later you go , " Oh , shit ! " -
You basically have to pay twice for it .
Yes , that 's outrageous .
You 've got to provide stuff that people can keep , and they do n't mind paying you $ 3 a month for .
So how long can the big labels keep up this charade ?
Earlier I was talking about the ground moving underneath the industry .
At In The City people are beginning to realise they have to do something .
So I think in two or three years blanket licenses will be with us in most countries .
And France nearly voted for it this year .
Yes , it got shot down - but the people who shot it down really shot themselves in the foot .
They tried to get away from being too unpopular by saying " it 's like a parking fine " - and the court said no - if it's an infringement of copyright , it 's an infringement of copyright , and there 's a huge fine .
So of course they can't enforce the law - it 's completely unenforceable .
With the DRM , I think they 've realised it just is n't working .
People do n't like the CDs , they find their way around it ; they do n't like the DRM , they do n't use the DRM services ; they resent - as you say - having subscriptions wiped .
So do you think a blanket license will be introduced bottom - up through industry agreement , or top - down as in France - where there was some political leadership ?
It just is n't on the mainstream media , or think tanks ' radar just yet .
And I do n't see much political leadership .
No , the political people have to be just well informed enough so they do n't fuck it up , and they have to be encouraged to help it .
I think it would be wonderful if the government could lock everyone in a room - the music industry , the unions , the performers , the record companies , the publishers , the ISPs - and tell them you can't be let out until you sort it all out .
They wo n't do that , but I think some way will be found to get that result .
So it 's a fear of losing the distribution channels ?
They wo n't have any control over distribution .
A blanket license is a blanket non-license , really - it 's simply saying " we wo n't sue you " .
But if you have commercial services exploiting music , we will want to pay you more .
You 're licensing the anarchy .
It 's interesting where we 'll end up drawing the line between commercial and non-commercial , but in the end the numbers will be so huge it 'll iron itself out .
Someone from England might pull in a lot of hits from Spain - but again , it does n't matter .
I do n't then worry how they 'll pass the money to each other , but it 'll all come out in the wash .
Like it does today with collection societies ?
Yes
I saw some reaction to the first step - " Value Recognition Right " here in the UK , and very few people seemed to understand it - especially not from the value - for - money point of view .
It was a very important first move but it was also a bit clunky .
" Value Recognition Right - what 's that ?
You 're inventing a new right to make people pay - but you 're also suing people - huh ? "
But if you say that if mobile phones and ISPs want to distribute music in a non-commercial fashion , then they should pay for that right .
And if you swear that you 're not going to listen to any music , you 're not going to pay .
It 's going to be very hard for you not to pay , and the network is keeping an eye on you to see you do n't download any music .
And if you do without a license , we 'll sue the hell out of you - because you 've been offered a cheap deal like the TV license .
That 's a lot cheaper than a TV license .
And fairer .
If you do n't have a computer , you do n't have the internet , you do n't have a 3G phone - and you do n't listen to music - you 're not going to pay !
They had to do it I think , and it was necessary to flush out critics who have no realistic alternative - other than that artists should go begging ...
The " freedom " people are telling us I have to go out and sell more T - shirts - it 's an argument I find tremendously insulting .
To me if someone gets some earning from their creativity it's one less person who 's going to spend their life on a production line , or in a cubicle
Well , all the people who are writing this have salaries
Or they 're rich tenured American professors .
They 're getting paid very nicely , thank you .
No , I certainly agree .
I do n't think the positivehello side of Recognition Rights came in .
Here 's some place you wo n't be sued - you can do what you like with it - explore the world 's music , share it , download it .
So the Big Four can't give up control ?
Well , they know that they 've built their power around their monopoly , and their manipulation of the market , and that 's how they cover up their incompetence - by being " the only people who know how to buy stuff in " , and so on .
They 've spent a lot of money establishing it .
And it 's only through distribution , through black boxes , and their control of the existing copyright regime .
" The guy was coming out of the house with his hands up .
I did n't see no weapon , " McCrea said .
" They shot him with a Taser and he fell .
He got up , disoriented , and fell towards a cop .
They shot him seven times . "
The recipient , a 58 - year - old man who received his new heart two weeks ago at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge , is said to be doing " extremely well " .
The new technique involves keeping a donated heart warm and beating throughout the procedure , rather than packing it in ice for transport .
One expert told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme it could " triple or quadruple " the number of transplants .
The process gives doctors more time to get hearts to the recipient .
Donor hearts are normally given a high dose of potassium to stop them beating and are packed in ice which helps to keep them in a state of " suspended animation " .
But there is only a four - to - six - hour window for the organ to be transplanted into the recipient , which could be a problem if a heart becomes available in a remote area - many organs in the UK are transported by road .
If we look at resuscitating hearts that are currently unusable the number of transplants could be tripled or quadrupled
Professor Bruce Rosengard
How system works
Under the new system , doctors hook the heart up to a machine which keeps it beating with warm oxygenated blood flowing through it .
This gives doctors time to examine the heart for any damage and the chance to better match the organ with a recipient .
The heart can be kept outside the body longer and reaches the transplant patient in much better condition .
The transplant was done as part of a European trial .
Future transplants
Researchers plan to carry out another 19 operations in Germany and the UK .
Professor Bruce Rosengard , who led the team carrying out the transplant , said the operation was a success , the heart was working well and there were no signs of rejection .
" Normally the heart is in suspended animation [ on ice ] but they still start to deteriorate .
But once hearts are hooked up to the device , which takes about 20 minutes , any deterioration is fully reversed .
In the longer term it is not just hearts that can be handled by such systems but other organs too , particularly the liver
Chris Rudge
" The goal of this trial is to demonstrate that this is at least equivalent if not superior .
" The next step will look at hearts that are not good enough for transport currently - we hope we can render more hearts usable . "
He said the technique could raise the number of potential donors by at least 50 % .
If the technique proved successful in resuscitating hearts that were currently unusable the number of transplants could be tripled or quadrupled , he added .
In 2004/05 115 heart transplants were carried out , 15 patients died while waiting for a donor organ and 54 patients were still on the waiting list .
Chris Rudge , managing and transplant director of UK Transplant , said : " I am very pleased it has gone well on this first occasion .
" It is a major issue that the time a heart can be stored between taking it from the donor and transplanting it into the recipient is short ... so anything that extends that time and allows the procedure to be organised more thoroughly is to be welcomed .
' Best option '
" In the longer term it is not just hearts that can be handled by such systems but other organs too , particularly the liver . "
The British Heart Foundation 's medical director , Professor Peter Weissberg , said : " For many very ill heart disease patients transplant is still the best option .
" We hope that this new technique will prove successful in more patients , so transplant teams can look further afield than they currently do for suitable hearts . "
And Professor Stephen Wigmore , professor of transplant surgery at Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre in Birmingham , said the new technique had many benefits .
" There 's reduced pressure on the need to make an immediate decision , increased time between removal and transplant , it allows evaluation of the organ outside the body and the organ is kept at body temperature so it should function better . "
Ruby on the JVM , Rails too said the JRuby project will announce , possibly as soon as this week , that JRuby supports the popular Ruby on Rails Web development framework .
Ruby on Rails is sometimes referred to as RoR or simply Rails .
" We 're trying to finish off the last few test cases so we can claim that more than 95 percent of core Rails tests passed across the board , " Nutter said .
Moreover , the JRuby team is inviting Rails developers to try out real - world usage of JRuby and help them find any Rails issues the unit tests do not cover , or any remaining failures that are crucial for real applications , Nutter said .
Support for Ruby on Rails is important because " once Rails can run on JVM alongside other Java apps , existing Java shops will have a vector to bringing Rails apps into their organizations .
They wo n't have to toss out the existing investment in servers and software to go with the new kid on the block , " Nutter said .
The article also mentions " Microsoft is looking at support for Ruby developers and broader uses of Ruby , including having it run on the CLR . "
Both bits of good news for fans of Ruby who want it to play well with Windows and IIS .
Not to mention that using JRuby ( or NRuby , if it will be called that for .
NET ) should open up all of those libraries available to Java / .NET developers , which has been considered by some to be one of Ruby 's weaker spots .

One of the things I 've been dreading is getting Rails to work with IIS , although it appears to be getting easier ( last time I checked , there was no such " seamless integration " ) .

Spaghetti Cabling that would make a fully - grown sys admin cry , or … Cable management is for wimps .
Most network and system administrators like a nice tidy cabled cabinet of servers and network equipment .
Sometimes it just does n’t work out that way .
The following are some of my favorite images of nasty cable messes .

At an altitude of 13,000 ft the Andean air is clear .
A plume of white smoke rises from the chimney at the La Oroya smelter , hard at work refining arsenic and metals such as lead , cadmium and copper .
But today the company is not discharging any gases over this city in central Peru .
' It 's a nice day , so the company wo n't be letting off any gases , ' says Hugo Villa , a neurologist at the local hospital .
' They keep the worst emissions to overcast days or after dark . '
When the gases are released , they make this one of the most polluted places on the planet , with La Oroya ranking alongside Chernobyl for environmental devastation , according to a US think - tank , the Blacksmith Institute .
The company is a US corporation , Renco Doe Run .
The gases are the product from the main smelter a mile or two down the valley .
The high mountains around keep out the cleansing winds , meaning that airborne metals are concentrated in the valley .
Neither humans nor nature can escape the company 's outpourings of poisons .
And , despite evidence that gases have been behind the premature deaths of workers and residents young and old , the business - oriented , pro-US government of President Alan Garcia is too afraid of foreign investors to do anything about it .
Now , however , the townspeople , once muted by their worries about losing their jobs with the valley 's biggest employer , are turning their attention towards Ira Rennert , Renco 's proprietor .
The pollution from his plants appears both horrific and difficult to contest .
A study of 93 newborn children in the first 12 hours of their life , conducted by Hugo Villa , showed they had highly dangerous levels of lead in their blood , inherited from their mothers while in the womb .
The nearer the mothers lived to the main smelter , the higher was the babies ' level of lead poisoning .
' The effects of the lead are often difficult to trace , ' said Villa .
' But it lodges permanently in bones and affects the liver , kidneys and the brain .
It affects the central nervous system .
I 've had child patients who have lost feeling in their limbs and can't control themselves . '
The quality of air sampled in the neighbourhood by three Peruvian voluntary agencies showed 85 times more arsenic , 41 times more cadmium and 13 times more lead than is safe .
In parts of the town the water supply contains 50 per cent more lead than levels recommended by the World Health Organisation .
The untreated waters of the Mantaro river are contaminated with copper , iron , manganese , lead and zinc and are not suitable for irrigation or consumption by animals , according to the standards supposed to be legally enforced in Peru .
The water coming out of the nearby Huascacocha lake contains more than four times the legal limit of manganese .
It is no surprise , therefore , that the town has more than its fair share of youngsters with physical or mental disabilities .
The company has a scheme under which a few hundred carefully selected children of Doe Run employees are taken for a few hours every day to a camp outside the town .
With less money , the town council is trying to do something similar for children whose parents do not work for the company .
None of this bears on the main problem - the pollution from the refineries .
The problem here is such that adults chat about the lead levels in their blood .
' I'm 37 , ' said one .
' That 's nothing , ' said another , ' I 'm 43 . '
For years the Oroyinos , as the locals are called , appeared to put up with their lot .
In the past , union leaders and the mayor were persuaded by Renco Doe Run to side with it to block , successfully , the government 's feeble attempts to force it to reduce pollution .
' We may move out , and you 'll all lose your jobs , was the message , ' said Pedro , one former employee , now an invalid .
' It was a question of deciding whether to have enough food to eat or not . '
This year it is different .
The town has elected a new mayor , Cesar Rodriguez , and the unions elected new leaders ; and the effects of the pollution on children is finally getting through to parents .
Rennert 's record as a polluter is not confined to Peru .
For nearly 13 years , according to industry reports , the company topped the US Environmental Protection Authority 's list as the worst air polluter in the country .
Thousands of Buddhist monks have taken to the streets of Burma for a seventh day of protest in the biggest show of opposition to the military regime since the 1988 uprising .
The protesters have vowed to march until the generals step down .
Demonstrations have focused on Rangoon but have also broken out in Mandalay and townships across Burma .
About 200 nuns joined the protest on Sunday .
On Saturday , the monks managed to reach the home of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been under house arrest since 2003 .
She emerged to pray with them .
The demonstrators have used loud - hailers to chant pro-democracy slogans such as " Release Suu Kyi " .
They have also urged people to join in .
And a trickle of supporters has been accompanying the protesters .
Security officials have until now proved reluctant to act against the publicly - revered monks ' demonstrations for fear of inflaming the public , say analysts .
But as the protests spread , some supporters feared a police intervention and linked arms to form a human chain in order to protect the robed devotees .

A German belly dancer who checked into hospital to have her thighs trimmed ended up with just one butt cheek after the plastic surgeon hoovered out her right buttock , Ananova reports .
Julia " Cleopatra " Meyer , 38 , of Munich , said of her liposuction ordeal at the Berlin Charité hospital : " I had been unhappy with my saddlebags , the fat stored in the outer thigh area .
Because of the local anaesthesia I did not realise what he was doing .
When I saw afterwards that half of my bum was missing I almost fainted .
It had been completely sucked away . "
Unsurprisingly , the matter ended in court , where Meyer was awarded £ 12,000 damages against the unnamed private plastic surgeon .
The court heard her career is dead and the poor woman " does not even dare to go to a swimming pool because she is ashamed of the way she looks " .
A consultant at the Berlin Charité hospital chipped in his expert opinion , describing the arse reduction as a " grave error in treatment " . ®

Gore breaks silence on media coverage of 2000 election RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 4 , 2007
Print This Email This
For the first time Al Gore talks about the effect the press had on him and on the 2000 presidential election , telling Vanity Fair contributing editor Evgenia Peretz that he doesnt blame the media for his loss and that he accepts responsibility for not being able to communicate more clearly with the public , according to a release from the magazine to RAW STORY Tuesday .
 Modern politics seems to require and reward some capacities that I dont think I have in abundance such as a tolerance for spin rather than an honest discussion of substance .
Apparently , it comes easily for some people , but not for me ,  Gore says .
Peretz reports specifically on Gores coverage in The New York Times and in The Washington Post , each of which reported and / or referenced Gores supposed claims that he invented the Internet , that the two main characters in Love Story were based on him and Tipper , and that he discovered the toxic waste at Love Canal .
Asked about the debate coverage , Gore tells Peretz ,  The sighs , the sighs , the sighs Within 18 hours , they had turned perception around to where the entire story was about me sighing .
And that s scary .
That s scary .
Peretz reports that the Gore family joked about the nonstop talk about which president youd want to have a beer with , and Kristin , the Gores middle daughter , said ,  Gee , I want the designated driver as my president . 
But , according to Peretz , deep down they werent laughing .
Tipper Gore tells
Peretz that following the loss , we were roadkill it took a long time to pick ourselves up from what happened . 
Tipper also says that Al has made no moves that would suggest a run for the presidency , but adds that if he turned to her one night and said he had to run , shed get on board , and theyd discuss how to approach it this time around , given what theyve learned .
Gore tells
Peretz that he does believe that some of his words were distorted and that certain major reporters and outlets were often unfair , and admits that the tendency of the press to twist his words encumbered his ability to speak freely .
 I tried not to let it [ affect my behavior ] ,  Gore tells Peretz .
 But if you know that day after day the filter is going to be so distorted , inevitably that has an impact on the kinds of messages that you try and force through the filter .
Anything that involves subtlety or involves trusting the reporters in their good sense and sense of fairness in interpretation , you re just not going to take a risk with something that could be easily distorted and used against you .
Gore also tells Peretz that bringing up the Internet again in public was like stepping on a verbal land mine .
 If I had tried in the wake of that to put expressions about the Internet in campaign speeches , it would have been difficult ,  he says .
 I did , of course , from time to time .
But I remember many occasions where I would say something about the Internet , and as soon as the word  Internet  came from my lips , the press would be snickering and relishing the mention .
Not everybody in the press , but the Zeitgeist was polluted , and it never dissipated , because the stream of pollution coming into it was constant , constant . 

Former Shelter Director Reveals Why She Left Abuse shelters surround themselves in a shroud of secrecy .
On March 10 , 2007 RADAR staff interviewed a former abuse shelter director to learn what goes on behind closed doors .
The woman requested anonymity because she was fearful of the consequences of disclosing her identity : I worked at an abuse shelter located in the mid-Atlantic area for over 10 years .
I first worked as a counselor and was eventually promoted to the position of shelter director .
Our shelter had 8 rooms , with a capacity of up to 30 women and children .
Our shelter received funding from a variety of private and government sources at the federal , state , and local levels .
A large share of our budget came from the state Child and Protective Services program to pay for abused children and mothers who resided at our facility .
Our shelter provided a broad range of services , including shelter residency for up to 2 months , 3 meals a day , counseling , advocacy , and transportation to arrange for local services .
When necessary , we connected our residents with nearby welfare , immigration , and pro bono legal services .
And we provided transitional services for former residents .
Counseling was based on Lenore Walker 's battered woman syndrome and the Duluth model 's power and control wheel .
The shelter did not provide services to male victims of domestic violence , even when the men had suffered physical abuse similar to what women had experienced .
Instead the men were referred to a local police station to request a restraining order .
Our staff consisted of about 30 persons , who did administration , counseling , transportation , child care , and other activities .
We had a similar number of volunteers , who were generally women with previous histories of abuse .
The volunteers were sometimes more of a problem than they were worth because they were still dealing with their own personal issues .
Even though the volunteers were not paid anything , the shelter received funding for their services .
Most persons think of women in an abuse shelter as victims of severe physical abuse , bloodied and broken .
In our shelter , however , only about one in 10 women had experienced any kind of physical injury .
A similarly small number had been threatened with any physical harm , although they may have been involved in a previous incident of physical abuse .
So the great majority of women were there because they claimed to have been subjected to verbal or psychological abuse .
We did not verify the claims of new residents - if the woman answered the questions correctly , we basically believed what she said .
There is no question that some women , many of whom were on welfare , were gaming the system to benefit from the many services our shelter provided .
When I first started working at the shelter , the staff was held accountable to professional standards and services were regularly audited .
We shared a feeling of altruism , of helping needy victims .
But over the years , I saw a big change .
The shelter became more ideologically oriented .
We began to sponsor workshops and training on lesbian issues .
Shelter residents who were pregnant were advised of the difficulties of raising a child alone , and were encouraged to get an abortion .
In order to service illegal immigrants , we stopped requesting any form of personal identification .
But then you began to wonder who you are really dealing with .
Around the same time , the number of staff increased and employee benefits expanded .
I once calculated that the average staff member was away from work 60 days out of the year - 5 weeks on vacation , plus holidays and sick days .
After a while it became impossible to have a cohesive staff .
In the end , we would refer the women to other programs , and they would refer clients to us .
It became a self - serving numbers game .
The staff became less accountable in their work and began to see their job more as an entitlement .
The shelter lost its grass roots appeal and began to feel like an employment center .
There was little professionalism or accountability .
That 's when I resigned my position as shelter director .
New Delhi , August 11 : Two journalists of The Indian Express have received this year ’s Prem Bhatia awards for Political Journalism and Environmental Reporting .
The Indian Express Principal Correspondent Varghese K George received the Rs 1 - lakh Prem Bhatia award for excellence in Political Journalism for his exposes on how government officials siphoned - off crores of rupees meant for flood relief in Bihar .
George ’s articles prompted the government to institute a probe against 26 officials , including high - profile IAS officer Gautam Goswami .
George ’s reports on the Bihar Assembly has also been noted in his citation .
The award for environmental reporting went to The Indian Express Senior Assistant Editor Jay Mazoomdar for his series on missing tigers in India ’s national parks , beginning with Sariska .
Mazoomdar ’s stories forced the government to form a � Tiger Task Force ’ headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
The Prem Bhatia foundation also gives out two scholarships each year to rookie journalists which went to Jaydeep Hardiker , Staff Reporter for the Hitvada in Nagpur and Jatinder Jeet Singh , Staff Reporter for The Tribune this year .
Hardiker 's research will focus on " The Paradox of Plenty in Vidharbha " while Singh will investigate the " Changing Demography in Punjab , the Immigration of Punjabis and the Role of the Media " .
The annual Prem Bhatia Memorial Lecture was delivered by eminent jurist Ashok Desai – a speech on the Constitution and the future of democracy peppered with sharp wit , humour and personal experience .
The U.S. Government is soliciting bids for a project that , if implemented , could see travelers facing lie detector testing at airports , border crossings , and other high traffic venues .
The project is sponsored by the Defense Academy for Credibility Assessment ( DACA ) , which until recently was known as the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute ( DoDPI ) .
“ Credibility assessment ” is the U.S. Government ’s latest buzzword for “ lie detection ” and supplants the now démodé “ detection of deception . ”
Although DACA nominally falls under the Department of Defense ’s secretive Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) , it is more than just a DoD agency in that it trains all federal polygraph operators , including those from non-DoD agencies such as the FBI and CIA .
DACA also controls the federal research budget for lie detector testing ( despite a history that includes burying unwelcome research results , such as those that suggested innocent blacks are more likely to fail the polygraph than innocent whites ) .
According to the amended solicitation , the scope of the project is :
To identify , implement , empirically evaluate , and validate optimal procedures for speedy accurate credibility assessment of humans passing through a security checkpoint in high volume environments ( e.g. , airports , border crossings , building entry ) .
The effort shall specifically address physiological and behavioral assessment using instrumental and / or non-instrumental procedures applicable in multi-cultural environments with emphasis on the identification and reduction of factors affecting assessment accuracy and variability .
It is anticipated that the scope of the project will be broad enough to justify a multi- disciplinary investigatory team and multi-site data collection .
What this would amount to is a program for mass lie detector testing of travelers .
This is a truly bad idea .
First , although the U.S. Government pretends that it already has a working lie detector ( in the form of the polygraph ) , it is deceiving only itself .
Al - Qaeda and other Islamic insurgents know full well that the lie detector is a sham .
Moreover , even if a 90 % accurate , countermeasure - proof lie detector were developed ( something this project has virtually no prospect of achieving ) , it would be worthless for such a task as screening travelers for terrorists .
Let ’s assume for the sake of argument that as many as 1 in 100,000 travelers is a terrorist .
With a 90 % accurate lie detector test , for every 1 terrorist correctly flagged as deceptive , some 10,000 innocent travelers will wrongly be so flagged .
One remains stuck with the hopeless task of finding the needle in the proverbial haystack .
This problem is similar to that associated with using the polygraph in an attempt to screen for spies .
In 2002 , the National Academy of Sciences completed a research review and concluded that “ [ polygraph testing ’s ] accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies . ”
The federal government ignored that conclusion and has instead actually increased its reliance on employee polygraph screening .
Now it would seem the U.S. Government wishes to subject the traveling public at large to such madness .
The open period for proposals has been extended until 2 P.M. EST on 10 July 2007 .
Scuttlebutt has it that Draper Laboratory of Cambridge , Massachusetts is favored to win the contract .
For a future project I needed these days some easy to use zip or gzip class to create a zip file from files / folders inside a specified directory .
A short search on Google has lead me to the Create ZIP File PHP class from Rochak Chauhan .
I tested two other scripts before and must say that this script works great for single files if you add them manually .
To compress a whole directory with an unknown number of files into one zip file I created some class extension to get this job done .
Extend the PHP class script
I used some directory functions ( opendir , readdir ) to get all the files from the specified directory .
Inside each directory there are files and “ real directories ” and directory locations .
We need only the real directories .
We test each value with “ is_file ” , “ is_dir ” and we filter off the directory directions ( “. ” and “.. ” ) .
After the “ file ” is identified , the files content is added to the “ add File ” object and for other directories the method “ get_file_from_folder ” is called again .
class createDirZip extends createZip { function get_files_from_folder( $directory , $ put_into ) { if ( $ handle = opendir ( $ directory ) ) { while ( false !== ( $ file = readdir ( $ handle ) ) ) { if ( is_file ( $ directory . $ file ) ) { $ fileContents = file_get_contents ( $directory . $file ) ; $ this ->add File ( $fileContents , $ put_into . $ file ) ; } elseif ( $ file != '. ' and $ file != '..' and is_dir ( $ directory . $ file ) ) { $ this ->addDirectory ( $put_into. $file . '/' ) ; $ this->get_files_from_folder($directory .$file .'/' , $ put_into.$ file .'/' ) ; } } } closedir ( $ handle ) ; } }
To get the files and sub directories from some directory we use this code :
$ createZip = new createDirZip ; $ createZip -> addDirectory ( ' themes / ' ) ; $ createZip->get_files_from_folder('blog/wp-content /themes /' , ' themes / ' ) ;
We need create an object from the extension we have just created .
Next we need only to define the base directory ( which is used in the zip file ) and the path to the directory .
With this we are able to output the zip file :
$ fileName = ' tmp/archive.zip ' ; $ fd = fopen ( $ fileName , ' wb ' ) ; $ out = fwrite ( $fd , $ createZip -> getZippedfile ( ) ) ; fclose ( $fd ) ; $ createZip->forceDownload ( $ fileName ) ; @unlink ( $ fileName ) ;
Via the method “ getZippedfile ” all content is added to the file ( archive.zip ) and the method “ forceDownload ” will send the created zip file to the browser .
I think this simple function is very helpful if you like to offer the public some dynamic files inside a directory or just to “ zip – mail – backup ” some directories from your web server using CRON .
Some important update !
After using the same script on two of my websites I got some complains from some ( mac ) users with the problem that they ca n’t open the downloaded zip files .
While the download via Firefox on Windows and Linux ( even most of the time with IE ) works fine is this not a the best solution .
I checked some other classes but did n’t find a similar solution .
My advice is to use the Linux zip application via the command line : exec ( ‘ zip - r test.zip your_folder / ’ ) ;
This is not the same as in this tutorial but will work for most of the machines .
Actually is this solution much better even for bigger files …

The second book in the Hero's Guide series will be out at the end of the month .
Some of the art is showing up around the web , so I 'll post some here as I 'm able .
In this scene , Prince Liam and Princess Ella ( CinderELLA ) are practicing their sword fighting skills while Prince Frederick hides .
He 's a total wuss .
When British forces took Basra on April 6 , 2003 , their artillery damaged a statue of an Iraqi soldier straddling a writhing shark .
It was commissioned by Saddam Hussein to commemorate the end of the Iran - Iraq war in 1988 .
Looters have stolen the soldier .
But the shark , meant to represent Iran , remains .
The Islamic Republic 's influence is indeed felt throughout Basra , Iraq 's second - largest city where Shiite parties , militiamen , and criminal gangs all are locked in a vicious fight for power .
The streets in the provincial capital are even abuzz with talk of Iranian - trained sleeper cells at the ready .
With the British exit earlier this month , which some analysts say is a prelude to the 5,500 - strong contingent 's complete withdrawal from Iraq , comes great uncertainty for this city : Will Iran bolster its strategic foothold ?
Will the Shiite militias control the streets ?
Is the Iraqi Army strong enough to mediate the fight between rival parties ?
What happens here may provide a window on the future for the rest of Iraq .
This is a city that operates according to a fragile balance of military force , fear , cronyism , and business interests .
All of Iraq is perilous .
But the violence and fear in Basra takes place mostly outside the sphere of Sunni - Shiite killings .
Al Qaeda is not a factor .
Basra is a predominately Shiite city , yet it is still imbued with fear of kidnappings , assassinations , and being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
This instability reveals that the violence in Iraq is not only sectarian or the result of insurgent activity , but is also caused by deep - seated political and tribal rivalries and an intense scramble for power .
" I came back to Iraq when the American and British tanks rolled in … things looked promising and we thought our dream of a democratic and tolerant state may materialize , " says a university professor , who , like dozens of people interviewed by the Monitor during a recent trip to Basra requested anonymity for fear of retribution from militias .
" The dream has been shattered .
I feel trapped now and I am very pessimistic .
I am looking for a way out . "
The British say they can return if necessary .
In a statement issued Sept. 5 , Britain 's Ministry of Defense said that despite the pullout they " still retain security responsibility " for Basra Province .
They will hand over full control to provincial authorities by year - end .
" Troops will retain the capability to intervene in support of the Iraqi Security Forces should the security situation demand it , " it said .
But should British forces decide to venture back , they will inevitably face a den of Mahdi Army fighters .
During the occupation , Moqtada al - Sadr 's militia made a habit of targeting the Hussein - era compound of palaces in the city center that had been the British base until its hand - over to the Iraqi Army earlier this month .
17,000 Mahdi Army militiamen
Billboards glorify Mahdi militiamen who died fighting the British .
Streets carry their names .
Upon the British departure , the Mahdi Army claimed victory .
It had been leading the fight against the occupation since its early days .
On Sept. 8 , thousands of militiamen roamed the city center in vehicles and on foot brandishing Mr. Sadr 's posters in what they billed as a " victory parade . "
They are trying to " falsely claim credit for ' driving us out , ' " says Maj .
Mike Shearer , spokesman for the British forces .
In the fight between Shiite factions , Mr. Sadr 's army has emerged as the most formidable force .
The militia is said to number 17,000 in Basra alone and is divided into 40 company - size military units , according to a senior Iraqi security official .
Little is known about their local leader , Muntasir al - Maliki , who had replaced a commander killed by British forces in late May , except what 's said about him having killed his own father a few years ago because he was an unrepentant supporter of the former regime .
They control multiple units in the 14,500 - strong police force , and hold sway in hospitals , the education board , the university , ports and oil terminals , and the oil products and electricity distribution companies , says a Basra - based , Iraqi researcher .
There is no doubt of the militia 's power .
In an Aug. 24 meeting , witnessed by the Monitor , two Mahdi commanders pledged to a senior Iraqi security official not to attack British forces as they withdrew , in exchange for the release of 26 of their members .
Gen . David Petraeus , commander of coalition troops in Iraq , confirmed this in his testimony to the Senate on Sept. 11 .
And the Mahdi Army nationwide has been ordered by Sadr to freeze their activities for six months after intra-Shiite clashes in Karbala Province to the north of Basra in late August .
But no one is sure whether that will be obeyed here .
" The issue of resistance depends on central decisions but this may change from place to place in Iraq depending on the conditions , " says one Basra - based Mahdi Army commander , cryptically .
He boasts that the militia has rockets that possess a range farther than the air base , where British troops are all concentrated now , and that it controls vast weapons depots dating from the former regime that " will last us from here until eternity . "
In fact , British forces said one of their soldiers was killed Sept. 5 , just days after the withdrawal from the palaces , bringing to 42 the number of soldiers killed this year alone , compared with 29 in all of 2006 .
The Iranian connection to the Mahdi Army , as US officials have insisted , indeed exists , says the Basra researcher .
These Tehran - backed groups are often referred to in US military communiqués as " Special Groups . "
The researcher says one form of support is free shipments of food from Iran that are then sold in markets .
The proceeds , he says , are used to purchase arms in weapon markets in Mahdi Army strongholds in the city like Khamsa Meel ( Five Miles ) and Hayaniya .
" The [ Sadrist ] movement is basically a state within a state in Basra that is able to confront the occupation , " he says .
" No one dares say a word and no one really knows who 's in control of the movement . "
With the British largely now out of the picture , many expect the Mahdi Army to turn on its main rival – the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , known by Iraqis simply as " the Majlis , " or council .
It 's the dominant Shiite party in the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
300 assassinations
The council , previously known by its acronym SCIRI , and its affiliates were all based in Iran before Mr. Hussein 's ouster .
Its paramilitary unit , the Badr Brigade , was trained by the Iranians .
Badrists , as members of the Badr Brigade are known , now hold senior positions throughout central and southern Iraq as governors and commanders in the security forces .
In Basra , a senior Badrist , Khalaf al - Badran , heads customs , after founding the police intelligence unit .
All border crossings , including Shalamja to Iran and Safwan to Kuwait , are controlled by Badrists .
Another top Badrist , Hassan al - Rashid , had been Basra 's governor before losing out to Muhammad Mosabeh al - Waeli of the Fadhila Party in 2005 .
Already the provinces of Maysan , Dhi Qar ( Nasiriyah ) , and Muthana ( Samawa ) , which had been handed over by the British - led coalition troops to Iraqis starting in 2005 , have seen several episodes of pitched battles between the Mahdi Army and government forces beholden to Badr .
Last month saw the assassination of two top Badrists – Muthana Province Gov. Muhammad al - Hassani and Diwaniyah Gov. Jalil Hamza – with most fingers pointing to elements of the Mahdi Army .
" I expect the tit - for - tat assassinations to increase , " says a Basra - based newspaper editor , adding that at least 300 partisans of Badr and its sister parties in the Supreme Council have been assassinated in Basra alone since the start of the year .
One resident of the middle - class neighborhood of Jazayer describes how he witnessed the drive - by shooting of a Badr official on his street on Aug. 19 that was promptly followed by the kidnapping , torture , and killing of a Mahdi Army operative in the same neighborhood .
" Facing the often invisible enemy , the terrorists that plague Basra , is not for the fainthearted , " says Cpl. Ross Jones in a story posted last month by the British Army on the Ministry of Defense 's official website .
God 's Revenge
One Shiite party bears the brunt of charges by residents of Iranian influence : Thaar Allah , or God 's Revenge .
It 's described by one Basra journalist as a " time bomb . "
On a recent afternoon , the party 's leader , Yousif al - Mussawi , stood in front of his SUV with its tinted windows in the courtyard of his headquarters .
He spoke on a sleek mobile phone .
The bearded Mr. Mussawi wore a shirt unbuttoned at the neck and black jeans .
A large pistol was stuffed in his waist .
" Thaar Allah is a party founded by divine purpose , " is scrawled on the outside wall .
His party has a penchant for graffiti .
Heavily armed men in military fatigues guard the two - story building painted in deep green .
In the hallways , men and women mill around waiting to see party officials for help in resolving disputes or landing government jobs .
Inside his office , Mussawi becomes slightly hostile when asked about the origins of his party .
He finally relents and says that it started in 1995 as a guerrilla group that conducted operations against the former regime from its base in the marshes along the Iranian border .
Mussawi , a former naval officer , was later imprisoned in Baghdad 's infamous Abu Ghraib prison and was among the thousands released by Hussein in October 2002 ahead of the US - led invasion .
He does not hide his affection for Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and says that his party desires to establish in Iraq a wilayat faqikh , a state ruled by clerics along the lines of Iran .
But he denies any military or financial links to the Iranians .
Mussawi speaks of plans to expand his party 's presence throughout Iraq including Baghdad and the need to fight all coalition forces until they leave .
" Coalition forces are usurpers , plunderers , and occupiers and must be resisted … by force .
I am doing that , " he says , refusing to give details .
He rolls out a classified map of Basra prepared by the British military showing the level of violence in July .
Asked how he obtained it , he says with a laugh , " They steal it for us . "
He denies accusations made by his opponents that the party is bankrolled by protection money paid by wealthy traders including the Ashour family , which dominates the port of Abu Flous , south of the city .
He calls the money he receives from these families " donations from party members . "
Mussawi has bolstered his position by forging an alliance with what 's known in Basra as the Bayet al - Khumasi , or the Pentacle House .
The Bayet al - Khumasi comprises the council and its affiliates the Badr Organization – the new name for the Badr Brigade – the Shaheed Al - Mihrab Foundation , the Sayed al - Shuhada Movement , and the Hizbullah Movement ( no relation to Lebanese Hizbullah ) .
They all want to oust Governor Waeli .
The governor 's dilemma
Mr. Waeli , who is a member of the Fadhila Party , is accused of mismanagement of public funds , corruption , and using the 15,000 - strong oil facilities protection force , dominated by Fadhila partisans , in Basra and neighboring provinces as a paramilitary unit specializing in crude oil theft .
His enemies have a chant , making the rounds here on cellular phones , that derides Fadhila , which means virtue , as " Radhila , " meaning sin .
Some of his detractors also charge that he's an agent for British forces and the Kuwaitis .
Fadhila follows the teachings of the late Muhammad Sadiq al - Sadr , Moqtada 's father , but it does not believe the young cleric is fit to carry the Sadrist mantle .
Fadhila leader Ayatollah Muhammad al - Yacoubi , one of the senior Sadr 's disciples , has fashioned the party as a Shiite Arab Islamist party opposed to Iran .
This has made Fadhila 's relationship with the Mahdi Army tense and put it on a direct collision course with the Supreme Council , the pro-Iranian heavyweight .
Waeli has accused Iran and the council of wanting to remove him because he tried to contain their influence and opposed a plan that would include Basra in a nine - province region friendly to Iran .
" In concert with its allies in Iraq , Iran wants to change the governor of Basra by hook or crook , " says the portly Waeli , sitting in his enormous office .
He has challenged a no - confidence motion passed by a majority of the provincial council members and a subsequent request by the central government that he quit .
" Arab countries have noticed my nationalist tendencies and have supported me , " he adds .
Waeli regularly travels to Gulf Arab countries in what 's billed as investment promotion trips .
Throngs of heavily armed bearded men in military pants and black shirts guard the perimeter of Waeli 's provincial headquarters .
To up the ante against Waeli , Mussawi from Thaar Allah was tasked with organizing and leading a demonstration in April that degenerated into clashes .
The governor himself took up arms to defend his office .
His rivals do not hide their desire for a super Shiite region comparable to the Kurdistan region in the north .
They deny any military or intelligence links to Iran and say ties are economic and social in nature .
" Iranians are anxious to work with us , but the Arabs are absent and they keep labeling us as an extension of Iran .
There is no truth to this , " says Qassim Muhammad , a provincial council member from the Sayed al - Shuhada Movement , which was founded by Dagher al - Mussawi , a former anti-Hussein guerrilla fighter based in Tehran , who is now a parliament member close to Mr. Maliki .
Although Iran is closest to the council and its affiliate parties like Badr and Sayed al - Shuhada , it 's also backing many other Shiite groups in southern Iraq including those that are openly using violence to oppose British and coalition troops , according to Ali Ansari , an Iran specialist at London 's Chatham House .
" The Iranians are backing as many horses as they can , " he says .
" But there is a limit to their influence , given how fractious Shiites are in Iraq . "
Baghdad 's bid to control Basra
Amid this chaotic and dizzyingly complex picture in Basra , the central government has attempted to wrest control in this vital province which , with its oil exports , accounts for nearly 90 percent of Baghdad 's revenues .
In June , one year after Maliki had declared a state of emergency in the province , he appointed Lt. Gen. Mohan Hafidh to head the Basra Operations Center ( BOC ) , a body in charge of security in the province in coordination with the British .
Iraqi Army forces under General Mohan 's command were the ones that took over the palaces vacated by the British .
The Army routinely sets up checkpoints now at night all over the city to try to curtail militia movements .
" The BOC and Mohan are the last hope for Basra and many parties want to see him defeated because they do not want to see their gains eroded , " says Majid al - Sari , an adviser to General Mohan .
Maliki also appointed Maj. Gen. Jalil Khalaf to purge the police force of militias .
He has already faced two assassination attempts and street protests as he seeks to fire unqualified officers , prevent policemen from using the force 's vehicles when moonlighting as militiamen , and enforce a requirement that all policemen shave their beards .
" Criminal activity in Basra is a virus being nurtured by the police force 's weakness and its multiple loyalties , " the police chief told the Basra - based Al - Manara newspaper .
Few people , let alone the police force , can offer any explanation of the brazen crimes that occur in broad daylight such the theft Aug. 19 of an armored truck transporting nearly $ 1.2 million worth of funds belonging to the local agricultural board , according to an official with one of the city 's main transport companies .
A group of doctors protesting in July the killing of two of their colleagues , possibly because they were former military doctors in the Hussein era , and the kidnapping of leading Basra surgeon Zaki Faddagh , were bluntly told by a provincial official to hire their own guards for protection , according to one of the protesting doctors .
Dr. Faddagh has left Basra after a ransom was paid for his freedom , and the doctor recounting the story says he now will sell all his belongings and leave Basra after his teenage son was kidnapped in August and held for two weeks .
He was freed once a hefty ransom was paid .
He says he has proof that policemen were aiding the kidnappers .
" If the British took their role as occupiers seriously and dealt with things firmly from the get - go , we would not have gotten to this situation , " he says .
Britain's ' light touch '
Martin Navias , an analyst with Britain 's Center for Defense Studies , offers a similar assessment .
" The light touch [ of the British approach here ] has allowed various competing groups to gain ascendency in Basra , and Britain has very little control .
We are really marginal there . "
The British have been preoccupied with training the police and Army , ensuring that key supply routes from Kuwait are secure , and shielding themselves from an increase of attacks by militiamen .
Otherwise , they left the competing Islamist parties and militias to their own devices .
British troops in Basra turned down repeated requests by the Monitor for interviews .
In a statement issued Friday , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown touted the training of 13,000 Iraqi soldiers as his Army 's crowning achievement and said that full control of security in Basra would be handed to the Iraqis by the end of the year , with British forces assuming an " overwatch " role .
He said supply routes would continue to be protected by the British .
Asked on Wednesday if US troops may have to fill any void left by the British , General Petraeus said more Iraqi soldiers would be dispatched to Basra while American Special Operations soldiers would conduct pinpoint missions with their Iraqi counterparts as they did March 20 , when they captured in Basra two senior leaders of the Mahdi Army and a Lebanese operative with the pro-Iranian militia Hizbullah .
Now , the Mahdi Army has put banners in Basra warning against " the secret US Army . "
In his testimony in Washington last week , Petraeus called Iran 's deepening influence in Iraq , particularly in the south , one of the most " unsettling " developments of the past eight months .
He said the various Islamist parties and militias have found a way to " accommodate " one another in order to keep Basra functioning .
" Interestingly there is an accommodation down there right now that is the kind of Iraqi solution to problems in the south that is mildly heartening , I guess is the way to put it , " he said .
" We are in a wait - and - see approach with Basra but we have every expectation that Basra will be resolved by Iraqis . "

For angry heretics on the run , Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger sure know how to enjoy themselves .
Sitting in a cozy Berkeley restaurant just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay , exchanging tasting notes on the vermentino ( " cold white wine is so good with fatty , fried food , " Shellenberger says ) , they recount with perverse pleasure , in tones almost as dry as the wine , how they 've been branded as infidels by fellow environmentalists .
It started in 2004 , when they published their first Tom Paine - style essay accusing the movement 's leaders of failing to deal effectively with the global warming crisis .
" We thought that someone was going to take a swing at us , " Shellenberger says .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope published withering counterattacks , and the two men were dubbed " the bad boys of American environmentalism " by author Bill McKibben .
Nordhaus , 41 , and Shellenberger , 36 , did n't set out to infuriate their former colleagues .
On the contrary , they were good Berkeley citizens — partial to black clothing , into biking ( Nordhaus ) and yoga ( Shellenberger ) , fluent in pinot noir .
Above all , they were passionate about the environment .
For the better part of a decade , they toiled in the green movement as consultants and political strategists , each hoping to change the world .
Instead , the climate crisis changed the rules :
It demanded a new way of framing the debate , and the pair became disillusioned when the environmental establishment stubbornly refused to adapt .
That led to their fateful essay , with the not - so - subtle title The Death of Environmentalism .
Overnight , the two became pariahs .
And now , with the October publication of their first book , Break Through : From " The Death of Environmentalism " to the Politics of Possibility , they are going to face the full fury of enraged environmentalists .
Pope , who has read the book , predicts that the reception from the movement " will be harshly negative . "
Break Through is a fascinating hybrid : part call to arms , part policy paper , part philosophical treatise .
( Name another book that gives equal time to Nietzsche , cognitive therapy , and fuel - economy legislation . )
It takes aim at some of the environmental movement 's biggest lions , including Kennedy and Al Gore .
It belittles the Kyoto Protocol ; it rips into best - selling social critics like Thomas Frank and Jared Diamond .
But it also dismisses free marketeers who believe that unfettered markets alone can solve our carbon - emission woes .
" If this book does n't piss off a whole lot of conservatives and a whole lot of liberals , we 've failed , " Nordhaus says .
The two have reimagined the underlying philosophy of environmentalism in a way that could win over many of its natural skeptics , from financially insecure Americans who view green activists as elitist snobs to the leaders of developing countries like Brazil , India , and China who think environmentalists want to stop economic growth just when they were about to get their share .
Green groups may carp , but the truth is that the book could turn out to be the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring .
Nordhaus ( left ) and Shellenberger blame labor and environmental groups for stifling economic growth .
Illustration : Hue Man , based on photo by Paul TrapaniBy its very nature , the environmental movement has always been antitechnology and antigrowth .
Bikes are better than cars ; open space is better than development ; less is always more .
As a result , its leaders have focused most of their antiglobal warming political energies on regulating carbon emissions and limiting domestic energy consumption .
Noble aims , to be sure .
There 's just one problem :
In dealing with global warming , these strategies have n't worked in the past and will not work any better in the future .
Consider the evidence : Since the Kyoto agreement , many of the 36 industrialized countries that committed to reducing emissions are not on track to meet even minimal goals — since 2000 , their emissions have gone up , not down .
And both China and India are building a slew of coal - burning plants as their economies explode .
" If China burns all the coal that it is set to burn between now and 2050 , " Shellenberger says , " we are super - deeply fucked . "
Even if every American SUV owner were to buy a hybrid tomorrow , that would n't come close to offsetting the environmental damage being perpetrated around the globe .
In fact , all the standards , cap - and - trade limits , and emission reductions that environmentalists have been pushing for may slow , but will never reverse , global warming .
And that is Nordhaus and Shellenberger 's inconvenient truth .
" There is simply no way we can achieve an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , " they write in their introduction , " without creating breakthrough technologies that do not pollute . "
Environmentalists , therefore , have missed a huge opportunity .
Rather than being leaders in solving the global climate crisis , they are content to be doomsayers and scolds .
What Nordhaus and Shellenberger advocate is what might be called post - environmentalism , an ambitious new philosophy that is n't afraid to put people ahead of nature and to dream big about creating economic growth — neither of which environmentalists have been very good at .
Their vision cuts across traditional political divides :
It 's pro-growth , pro-technology , and pro-environment .
They have specific proposals about Brazilian rain forests , the auto industry , and global warming preparedness .
But the heart of the book is its unabashed desire to create a new way to think about our problems .
Just as computer technology fueled the economic boom that started in the mid '90s , greentech can drive the first boom of the new millennium .
" Global warming , " they write , " demands unleashing human power , creating a new economy , and remaking nature as we prepare for the future . "
Unfortunately , technological revolutions do n't come cheap .
Nordhaus and Shellenberger argue passionately that the only appropriate response to the climate crisis is a federally funded , $ 300 billion Manhattan Project to rapidly develop new forms of greentech .
Nothing short of that , they argue , can jump - start the transition to a green economy in time .
__Nordhaus and Shellenberger __began as actual tree huggers , meeting in 1997 on a campaign to save a Northern California redwood forest from a rapacious Texas tycoon .
They came from very different backgrounds : Shellenberger was raised in Colorado by Mennonite parents , married young , and has two kids .
Nordhaus grew up in an affluent and well - connected Washington , DC , family and is childless .
But they 've become the kind of close friends ( Shellenberger was best man at Nordhaus ' wedding last year ) who spend so much time together they begin to look and sound alike .
Their break with mainstream environmentalism happened gradually .
In 2003 , Shellenberger was a lapsed academic turned progressive PR consultant with several promising political initiatives under his belt .
Nordhaus was working as a polling consultant and a political strategist for environmental groups .
In private conversations together , they began mulling over some very untraditional thoughts .
What if the economic solution to global warming were n't a matter of putting on the brakes but of stepping on the gas ?
What if environmentalism 's emphasis on limits and " not in my backyard " restrictions was hopelessly at odds with the average American 's belief in a limitless future ?
With a handful of like - minded partners , they drafted the New Apollo project , the first version of their plan for a federally subsidized greening of the economy .
They hired an economist to run the numbers and determined that a $ 300 billion government investment could call forth another $ 200 billion in private capital .
( To prove their independence from traditional environmental politics , they picked someone who had worked for the Bush administration . )
The public loved the idea .
In polls the two conducted , a New Apollo scale investment plan got a thumbs - up from practically every group , including , most surprisingly , non-college - educated males — classic Reagan Democrats — the very voters who are generally antitax , anti-government spending , and anti-environmentalist .
In fact , instead of being a drawback , the scope of the project was a selling point .
Politicians , as well as labor and environmental groups , signed on .
Nordhaus and Shellenberger even got the attention of John Kerry 's campaign .
Then nothing happened .
It soon became clear that the project conflicted with the shorter - term goals of those same interest groups , and ultimately the duo was asked by other environmental lobbyists to stop pushing the legislation in Congress .
" Labor groups were interested in protecting existing jobs in the US rather than creating jobs in the new - energy economy , " Shellenberger says .
" Environmental groups were more concerned with regulatory limits on greenhouse gases and raising fuel - economy standards . "
They had tried to be strategic by forming a coalition of interest groups , but interest groups were , in fact , the problem .
Shellenberger and Nordhaus became convinced that as long as policy was shaped by special interests — including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club — there would be no policy other than short - term , narrowly focused fixes .
" There are two ways to change the world , " Shellenberger says , this time in New York , over another glass of good wine .
" One of them is just to talk a presidential candidate into it .
Then he wins , and the whole world changes . "
That was Nordhaus and Shellenberger 's tactic in 2004 : Just persuade the Democratic leadership .
But when Kerry lost and Congress remained in Republican hands , they started to rethink that strategy .
" The other way is a paradigm shift .
And that takes time . "
That 's where Break Through comes in .
To promote the book , Nordhaus and Shellenberger will give a series of speeches around the country over the next several months .
They 'll use their nonprofit foundation , Breakthrough Institute , to fund further research .
Oddly enough , they have n't coined a good name for their movement , a surprising lapse for a public relations expert and a political strategist .
" We call it post - environmentalism , " Nordhaus says .
" But we really have n't come up with a word or phrase that fully captures exactly what this new politics is . "
One would think that Silicon Valley , a short hop from the pair 's Oakland office , would be the perfect ally in their crusade .
The term cleantech is sweeping the Valley ( see " The Great Green Boom , " page 168 ) , and $ 300 billion in federal R&D money should be a nice incentive .
" Bill Joy gets it , " Nordhaus says , but too many others do n't .
Many Valley players are leery of government programs , and they tend to take their policy cues from old - guard environmentalists , Shellenberger and Nordhaus have found .
" They think this is all going to get done with a little cap and trade , and a few other policies .
And the rest will be done by private capital ! "
Nordhaus says .
The dollar investment that most Valley venture capitalists are talking about right now just is n't enough , they insist .
We need hundreds of billions , not hundreds of millions .
Shellenberger shakes his head .
" All these guys ' education in computer science was underwritten by the fucking federal government ! " he says .
Yet when Silicon Valley tells the story of the Internet , the government 's role is downplayed .
" They think they invented the Internet , " Nordhaus says .
" But Intel does n't exist and Google does n't exist without massive federal government investment in computer science , the Internet , microchips ! "
A month before publication , early reaction to Break Through is starting to roll in .
Michael Pollan , who wrote the best seller The Omnivore 's Dilemma , gave them a book - jacket blurb , as did Ross Gelbspan , author of the global warming jeremiad Boiling Point .
And Adam Werbach , the former head of the Sierra Club ( and a fellow dissident with his own heretical ideas ) , says , " They nailed it . "
But Pope , the current Sierra Club chief , dismisses the new book as a rehash of Nordhaus and Shellenberger 's 2004 essay .
" Time has not been kind to their thesis , " he says .
" Our politics have changed very dramatically in the last five years . "
He says he now agrees that we need much more government funding of research and development ( " Their investment plan is way too modest ! " ) but thinks it can all be paid for through the auctioning of carbon permits .
" They are not environmentalists , " he says , and he's not really sure they are even progressives anymore .
" I'm halfway there with them , " says McKibben , renowned activist and author of The End of Nature , " but I think environmentalism has done considerably better than they expected at getting global warming back on the front burner . "
He still questions their emphatic rejection of the politics of limits .
" One part of dealing with the climate problem is investing , but another is figuring out how to quickly limit carbon dioxide by changing some of the things we 're doing now . "
The two authors respond with their usual feisty aplomb .
" No environmentalist will say investment is n't important , " Nordhaus says , " but look at what they are actually putting their resources into . "
He and Shellenberger are certain that the public will support massive government spending on greentech — bigger than anything the Sierra Club or Silicon Valley VCs are proposing — only if it is presented not as an attempt to rein in prosperity and economic growth but as a quantum leap for the global economy and climate .
If they 're wrong , Shellenberger and Nordhaus may be best remembered for tilting at windmills — when windmills were what they were fighting for all along .

We predicted in past posts that AACS , the encryption system intended to protect HD - DVD and Blu-ray movies , would suffer a gradual meltdown from its inability to respond quickly enough to attacks .
Like most DRM , AACS depends on the secrecy of encryption keys built into hardware and software players .
An attacker who discovers a player ’s keys can defeat the protection on any disc that works with that player .
AACS was designed with a defense against such attacks : after a player has been compromised , producers can alter new discs so that they no longer work with the compromised player ’s keys .
Whether this defense ( which we call “ key blacklisting ” ) will do much to stop copying depends how much time elapses before each leaked key is blacklisted .
Next week marks three months after the first compromised player key appeared on the Internet ( and more than five months after cracks for individual discs began to appear ) .
Discs slated for release on Tuesday will be the first to contain an update to AACS that blacklists the leaked keys .
What took so long ?
One limitation comes from the licensing agreement signed with player manufacturers , which requires that they receive ninety days ’ notice before their keys are blacklisted , so that they have enough time to update their products .
Customers who obtained the new discs a few days early confirmed that the previously leaked keys no longer worked .
It seemed as if AACS had recovered from the attacks just as its designers intended .
However , a new twist came yesterday , when SlySoft , an Antigua - based company that sells software to defeat various forms of copy protection , updated its AnyDVD product to allow it to copy the new AACS discs .
Apparently , SlySoft had extracted a key from a different player and had kept the attack a secret .
They waited until all the other compromised keys were blacklisted before switching to the new one .
The AACS Licensing Authority will be able to figure out which player SlySoft cracked by examining the program , and they will eventually blacklist this new key as well .
However , all discs on store shelves will remain copyable for months , since disc producers must wait another ninety days before making the change .
To be successful in the long run , AACS needs to outpace such attacks .
Its backers might be able to accelerate the blacklisting cycle somewhat by revising their agreements with player manufacturers , but the logistics of mastering discs and shipping them to market mean the shortest practical turnaround time will be at least several weeks .
Attackers do n’t even have to wait this long before they start to crack another player .
Like Slysoft , they can extract keys from several players and keep some of them secret until all publicly known keys are blacklisted .
Then they can release the other keys one at a time to buy additional time .
All of this is yet more bad news for AACS .
Gas inventories declined marginally .
Oil stocks declined more than expected , but are still at the top end of historical ranges .
A decline in active refinery capacity was also another factor .
Crude topped out at $ 80.18 today before settling at $ 79.91 .
( The text of the EIA 's weekly report can be found here ) .
But as Steve Hargreaves at CNN says :
In its weekly inventory report Wednesday , the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks plunged by 7.1 million barrels last week .
There have been concerns that OPEC production cuts from earlier this year and rising demand for oil have diminished crude supplies worldwide .
Still , EIA said crude inventories in the United States remain above average for this time of year .
But traders are focusing on the fact that crude inventories are below last year .
Plus they say that while summer driving season sparks big demand for gasoline , it 's actually winter that sees the largest demand for crude as people worldwide use heating oil and power plants burn oil to provide electric heat .
" Crude stocks are not crazy high anymore , " said Antoine Halff , head of energy research at Fimat in New York .
" Plus , heating season is ahead of us . "
As Robert said last week ( and I think it 's safe if I echo it again this week ... ) :
By the time David Thomas eased his Cadillac into the parking lot of an office complex in Issaquah , Washington , he already suspected the police were on to him .
An empty Crown Victoria in one of the parking spaces confirmed it .
" That 's heat right there , " he told his two passengers – 29 - year - old girlfriend Bridget Trevino , and his crime partner Kim Marvin Taylor , a balding , middle - aged master of fake identities he'd met on the internet .
It was November 2002 , and Thomas , then a 44 - year - old Texan , was in Washington to collect more than $ 30,000 in merchandise that a Ukrainian known as " Big Buyer " ordered from Outpost.com with stolen credit card numbers .
His job was to collect the goods from a mail drop , fence them on eBay and wire the money to Russia , pocketing 40 percent of the take before moving to another city to repeat the scam .
But things did n't go as planned .
Ignoring Thomas ' suspicions , Taylor walked into the Meadow Creek Professional Center to collect the Outpost shipment , and found the cops waiting for him .
Thomas and his girlfriend tried to escape in the Cadillac but were caught half a mile away .

An ID badge that Taylor wore when he was arrested indicated that he worked for Microsoft .
But that was no more accurate than the two - dozen other employee badges he possessed for E - Trade and AT&T Broadband , or the 15 driver 's licenses from various states that featured his congenial face and a dozen aliases .
Nor did Thomas ' California driver 's license help authorities identify him .
Although it had his picture , the name and address on the ID belonged to a producer for the A&E channel .
With so many fake IDs in play it was unclear to police exactly who they had in custody .
Then as they read Thomas his rights , he told them : " Get me some federal agents and I 'll give you a case involving the Russians and millions of dollars . "
Thus was the beginning of Thomas ' turn to the other side .
For 18 months beginning in April 2003 , Thomas worked as a " paid asset " for the FBI running a website for identity and credit card thieves from a government - supplied apartment in the tony Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle .
From bedrise to bedrest , seven days a week , he rode the boards and forums of his and other carding sites using the online nickname El Mariachi .
He recorded private messages and IRC chats for the FBI as " carders " schemed to , among other things , sell stolen credit and debit card numbers , defraud the George Bush and John Kerry campaign sites , drain hundreds of thousands of dollars from bank and investment accounts , sell access to Paris Hilton 's T - Mobile account and run phishing scams against U.S. Bank and the FDIC .
He did it all while battling denial - of - service attacks against his site and dodging attempts by his old partner Taylor and other carders to track his whereabouts and out him as a fed .
Just as his enemies were closing in on him in September 2004 , the FBI pulled the plug on his work and cut him loose .
But not before Thomas had given authorities a valuable look at the internet 's underworld , even though the strain of leading a double life nearly broke him .
Now Thomas is telling the story of his work during this period .
It 's a tale that provides a rare glimpse of the thriving international computer underground of high and low - tech thieves and swindlers whose crimes cost millions each year .
It also illuminates the rarely seen world of federal law enforcement 's war against these organized criminals , and the moral and ethical tradeoffs sworn agents make in pursuing their mission – providing crooks with an electronic marketplace where they can congregate and conduct their ignominious business anonymously .
Even allowing some crimes to go unpunished .
The full scope of the problem is hard to judge , but nonetheless staggering .
U.S. banks lost $ 546 million to debit card fraud in 2004 , according to banking research firm Dove Consulting , and credit card fraud losses were estimated to be about $ 3.8 billion globally in 2003 according to The Nilson Report .
The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 10 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year .
The financial impact of identity theft remains untold .
Thomas says he is telling his story now because he 's tired of the life he 's lived on the boards over the last five years and resentful of the control the FBI maintained over him for so long .
He also wants to warn the public about the risks they face from the carding community and deter kids from being seduced into a life of crime .
The FBI 's Seattle office would n't discuss Thomas , and neither confirmed nor denied that he worked for them .
But over the last year Wired News verified other key aspects of Thomas ' account in dozens of interviews with members of the underground , victims of online crimes he observed , as well as attorneys and other people connected with Thomas – his former apartment manager , for example , confirmed that the FBI paid Thomas ' rent .
Additionally , Thomas provided hundreds of chat logs and forum posts from his former website , The Grifters 11 – a criminal marketplace that played a key role in a parade of diverse frauds , ranging from bank theft to telephone records hacking , all unfolding in a sprawling international tableau spanning from the former Soviet empire to the tropics of Colombia .
It was July 2004 and Brian Campbell had been on Isla Mujeres off the coast of Cancun for three days for a relative 's wedding when he discovered he'd been scammed .
An American MBA student studying in Australia at the time , Campbell ( not his real name 22 ) was accustomed to checking his investment portfolio daily over the internet .
But the wedding distracted him a couple of days , and when he finally got online , he found he was locked out of his Schwab trading account .
He called Schwab and discovered that his user name and password had been changed .
What 's more , $ 106,000 had recently been wired from his account to a Fortis bank account in Belgium .
Campbell had n't requested the transfer .
Unknown to Campbell , a cyber thief who went by the nick " desertmack " had gained access to his e-mail account and had been watching him for weeks .
The Mexico wedding was the break desertmack needed .
He 'd been hoping a little tequila and sunshine would distract Campbell from obsessively checking his brokerage account long enough to steal the money and send it to Brussels , where an accomplice would withdraw it .
But while desertmack was watching Campbell , the FBI was watching him .
Or at least David Thomas was .
Sitting in a 500 - square - foot Seattle apartment , window shades drawn and cramped with three computers that emitted an oppressive heat , Thomas recorded every conversationthat desertmack and his accomplice , who used the nick jonjacob , exchanged in a private area of The Grifters .
net .
The Grifters was a members - only " carding " site that Thomas launched in December 2003 , eight months after beginning his work for the FBI .
The goal of the site was to attract identity and bank thieves .
It was the kind of site authorities called a " build it and they will come " site .
And they did .
By mid-2004 the site was crawling with thieves trafficking in fake IDs , stolen credit card numbers , card - embossing equipment and ATM skimmers that capture data on a debit card 's magnetic stripe so criminals can encode it on blank cards and drain an account .
The Grifters was a successful crime hub in a crowded field , competing with other sites like Shadowcrew , CarderPlanet and DarkProfits to attract the biggest criminals .
None of the carders knew that Thomas was working for law enforcement , although there were many who accused him of it .
Indeed , if a carder was arrested and returned to the boards , as Thomas had done , often he was working for " LE , " in carder lingo .
But the boards were always thick with a fog of police paranoia , and no one took the accusations seriously enough to stay away from Thomas .
Thomas began following desertmack closely after he saw the crook purchase a credit report for Campbell from a Florida woman who used the nick Decepgal .
Decep ran a carding site called Muzzfuzz and , according to bankruptcy filings in her real name , worked as a transcriber of psychiatrists ' notes .
She also ran a side business selling credit reports to identity thieves – $ 40 for a standard report or $ 75 for full - info reports that included a victim 's property holdings , bankruptcy filings and lists of possible relatives33
The report , coupled with e-mail account statements , gave desertmack all he needed to access Campbell 's Schwab account and initiate the money transfer .
Jonjacob and another associate in Brussels then opened a Fortis business account – chosen because of the bank 's $ 40,000 - a- day withdrawal limit on such accounts .
As the day for the transfer neared , the thieves could hardly contain their excitement : " Hehe , fingers firmly crossed , along with my legs , testicles and anything else I can think of , " one associate wrote desertmack .
Then , on the day of the theft : " well ... I expect our friends are off enjoying their holiday .
And with a bit of luck , you 're busy raping that juicy account of theirs . "
The night before the attack , desert mack changed the contact number on Campbell 's account so Schwab would call him for verification instead of Campbell if it suspected the wire request was fraudulent .
The ruse worked .
Within 24 hours the money was on its way to Brussels .
But that was the last desertmack heard of it .
Once the funds were overseas , his accomplice jonjacob disappeared .
If desertmack suspected a double - cross , he was wrong .
Campbell , who confirmed the details of the theft for Wired News , learned from Schwab that a suspect was arrested in Brussels while trying to withdraw money from Fortis .
44 )
Shortly after that , it appears that desertmack was arrested too , though not for the Schwab crime .
Oregon sheriffs arrested a 47 - year - old man on unrelated identity theft charges in September 2004 , after his wife was involved in a car accident and deputies discovered outstanding warrants on both of them for an old eBay fraud caper .
Police searching the couple 's apartment found equipment for making credit cards and fake IDs , as well as 432 stolen credit card numbers , 176 bank account and routing numbers and boxes of credit reports in other people 's names .
E-mail found in the suspect 's computer inbox was addressed to desertmack@mailvault.com .
" He was very organized , " Oregon deputy sheriff David Thompson told Wired News .
He had 510 dossiers on victims that consisted of " each person 's credit cards and IDs that he had created , bundled up with a rubber band so that he could just grab a bundle and have that identity for a day to go out and go shopping . "
The suspect claimed it was all research for a book he was writing about fraud prevention .
Oregon FBI spokeswoman Beth Ann Steele said the man was suspected of initiating the Schwab wire transfer , but said the bureau did n't pursue charges because local authorities had a stronger identity theft case against him .
The Schwab case illustrates a running theme in Thomas ' dealings with the FBI .
Although Thomas says he provided his handlers at the Seattle FBI with logs depicting desertmack 's scheme , the bureau apparently never acted on that information – the Oregon FBI only learned of the theft because Campbell , the victim , reported it himself after it occurred .
" If we had left it up to Schwab , they might never have gotten the FBI involved at all , " Campbell says55 ,
Schwab , too , was less than responsive .
Campbell got his money back from the company only after several calls to the firm pointing out the obvious security flaws in a system that failed to flag a wire request made on an account a day after contact information on the account was changed .
" Schwab was pretty bad with customer service , " Campbell says .
" For a long time they would n't tell me they were going to take responsibility for it and return ( the money ) . "
( Schwab had no comment ) .
As for Thomas , he was unaware of desertmack 's fate until Wired News tracked down the suspect .
As with all of the information Thomas provided the FBI , he was kept in the dark and never knew what , if anything , the agency did with the intelligence he gave his handler .
Thomas began his work for the FBI five months after his Issaquah arrest and after serving three months in jail .
His partner , Kim Marvin Taylor , known by the nick " Macgyver , " left Washington before he could be charged , and landed quickly back on Shadowcrew , where he was a top administrator of the site .
After Thomas ' arrest , federal agents came to see him in jail , as he 'd requested .
He told Secret Service agent Michael Levin what he'd done for the Russians , but Levin was n't impressed .
According to Thomas , the agent replied that he had multi-million - dollar cases on his desk and was n't going to waste time on a lousy $ 50,000 internet scam .
Seattle FBI Agent Steve Butler also came to see him and seemed just as unresponsive at first .
The jailhouse chat through a glass partition lasted less than 10 minutes with no mention of a job .
But when Thomas was transferred to Nebraska to face an outstanding warrant for check fraud , Butler showed up for a repeat visit , an assistant U.S. attorney in tow .
The agent laid out his plan : Thomas would work for the Northwest Cyber Crimes Task Force in Seattle to gather intelligence and teach Butler how the carding sites operated ; in return , the FBI would pay his rent and all of his expenses .
It would be an intelligence gathering mission , not aimed at making arrests , but rather at learning how the international carding scene operated .
" They made a big show down there , " Thomas says .
" They told me that they 'd take care of me , and I 'd have a legit job with them . " 66 .
He did n't have to think twice .
No one had ever sought him out for work before , and in an age of background checks they likely would n't .
But that was n't the only reason he took the offer .
He wanted to write a book about the carding world , and figured this was the perfect chance to gather material .
" ( The FBI ) wanted to see just what they could get out of it , and I wanted to see what was really going on and to write about it , " Thomas says .
" It was a win - win situation . " 77 .
His lawyer got the Nebraska charges reduced to a misdemeanor and fine , and by April 2003 Thomas was back in Seattle , where girlfriend Trevino joined him , and on the boards , using computers the FBI supplied him .
But almost immediately the words he'd spoken in Issaquah came back to bite him .
On CarderPlanet , someone posted a copy of his police report containing the statement he made to police about the Russians and federal agents .
Taylor , still a fugitive , took to the boards and accused Thomas of selling him out to the feds .
A war of words broke out between Thomas ' supporters on CarderPlanet and Taylor 's supporters at Shadowcrew .
" All of a sudden , whatever I was hired to do ( for the FBI ) looked like I was n't going to be able to do it , " Thomas says .
" In my mind I was toast .
Because that report was too damning . "
Thomas denied the claims to little avail .
Then , two months later Taylor was jailed in Colorado on new charges unrelated to the Issaquah bust .
He served eleven months before being released in May 2004 .
But his absence did little to foster calm .
Over the next year , the board war would escalate from verbal scuffling to all - out Joe Jobs and DDoS attacks .
And every 45 days or so when things would quiet down , someone would repost Thomas ' police report to stir them up again .
Between battling other carders and gathering information for the feds , Thomas 's workdays were long and full of non -stop activity .
He became obsessed with knowing everything that was happening on the boards .
He 'd often sleep during the day , then work all night when the boards were most active .
Each day when he awoke , he'd hop on the boards to see what had happened while he 'd slept .
Were any carding sites down ?
Had anyone been arrested ?
Then he'd run through a checklist of scams unfolding that day .
He spent 18 to 20 hours a day online with 15 to 20 chat windows open on his screen at a time .
When he was n't chatting online , he was talking on the phone .
" People would talk to me – I 've got this deal , I 've got that deal .
What do you think of this , what do you think of that ? " he says .
" El had a huge following . "
His job was to log every message he received and sent as well as every note that members posted to the boards .
At the end of each day he sent Butler a report .
Sometimes there were more than 300 messages in a single discussion thread .
Every morning Butler debriefed him by phone , and once a week they met in person .
Everything he recorded for the FBI , he recorded for himself as well .
His task for the FBI was to track who was doing what , which was n't always easy since members changed their nicks often and used anonymous e-mail , proxy servers and pre-paid cell phones to mask their identities and whereabouts .
Occasionally , however , they 'd let their guard down .
Thomas never pressed for details .
But like a good psychiatrist , he did the cyber equivalent of nodding with interest , and people were happy to talk .
Ironically , even though the carders constantly accused each other of working for the feds , they often acted as if a cloak of invisibility shielded them .
Larry Johnson , special agent for the Secret Service 's investigative division who headed an undercover operation for his agency on the boards , says agents were often dumbfounded by the carders ' lack of discretion .
" If I were going undercover they would accuse me , accuse me and accuse me ( of being a fed ) and then buy something from me ( anyway ) , " he says .
" Figure that out . "
Thomas says the carders believed they operated in a protected world .
" It was all some fantasy criminal paradise , " he says .
" Nobody believed law enforcement was out there in force . "
In truth , law enforcement agents were ( and still are ) some of the fraud sites ' most determined users , and it was n't just undercover U.S. feds scouring the boards .
There were also agents from Russia , the U.K. , Australia , Israel and Brazil .
Fraud investigators from Visa , Bank of America , eBay and others also lurked on the sites , determined to gather intelligence about threats to their customers .
The Nebraska prosecutor , Andrea Belgau , who Thomas says was present at the Nebraska meeting with Butler and Berry , was also very reluctant to discuss the meeting .
" I can't speak very completely about it other than he did offer assistance to the federal authorities , " she said .
She would n't discuss the details , but said she would n't dispute what Thomas told me either .
" I do n't think it 's appropriate for me to delve into it , " she said .
" The defendant may be free to speak about it , but those of us employed by government agencies have more restrictions . "
( Return to story )
The presence of so many watchers meant that authorities sometimes targeted the wrong person for investigation .
Although U.S. agencies held deconfliction meetings to apprise each other of who was doing what , word did n't always get around .
When Thomas once asked Butler who was the biggest target the feds were tracking , Butler laughed and replied , " You 're the biggest target .
Everyone is after you . "
Although the Seattle neighborhood where Thomas lived was upscale , his apartment was strictly low - rent .
Except for a small couch and TV , the only living room furniture was an Ikea table that groaned from the weight of two desktop computers – one for watching the boards and chatting with carders , the other later used for hosting The Grifters – and a laptop for compiling reports to Butler .
Trevino occasionally helped out with research but for the most part avoided Thomas 's work and spent her time chatting with friends online and playing digital games .
" I did n't want to be there doing what he was doing , " Trevino says .
" I did n't want to be a part of it .
Because I had done my time ( in the carding community ) and I did n't want to do any more . "
To conduct his work , Thomas was allowed to facilitate and commit crimes , but only after clearing them with Butler .
Butler said undercover agents from other agencies who did n't know what Thomas was up to would try to set him up , and Butler would need to run interference when he saw it happening .
He was also told that if he committed any crimes without clearing them first , Butler would make sure that he went to prison , and that other inmates would know he'd worked for the FBI .
88 .
The boards had a strict hierarchy that Thomas had little trouble infiltrating .
At the top were administrators , like Taylor , who handled day - to - day operations and served as gatekeepers to private areas of the board where the best deals were made .
Admins also meted out punishment to carders they did n't like or to " rippers " who cheated fellow carders .
An admin could ban someone from the board or , worse , post his photo online and expose his identity .
The pictures came from fake - ID vendors who often held on to the photos of customers just to use them when someone got out of line .
Beneath the admins were moderators who oversaw forums dedicated to various topics , such as bank fraud and identity theft .
Then came vendors and reviewers .
Before a vendor could sell his merchandise on the boards , a reviewer evaluated the quality of his offerings based on such criteria as the quality of a hologram on a fake ID , or whether the stolen credit card numbers a vendor was hawking were still live and valid .
Most reviews consisted of a couple of lines : " Cards good .
Premium numbers with high balances . "
The organized chain of command allowed a rich economy to flourish – and the range of products and services at offer was staggering .
While credit card fraud was a staple of the cyber underground , a wide variety of other crimes also unfolded – and still unfold – on the boards .
Some underground denizens offered spamming and " bullet - proof " hosting services from servers placed in locations unreachable by law enforcement .
Extortionists used botnets to deliver DDoS attacks against websites that did n't pay protection money .
And hackers designed and sold rootkits , spyware and spam mailers , alongside peddlers of stolen source code from companies like Microsoft .
Pretty much anything went in the underground if it could produce a profit .
Of course , the quickest way to make money was to , literally , make money .
And when a Colombian counterfeiter named Dexer showed up on the boards peddling top-quality fake dollars and euros , Thomas was interested .
After consulting with Butler , Thomas asked Dexer to send him some sample bills to review their quality .
Two weeks later they arrived at an FBI mail drop in Seattle , secreted in a hollowed - out book cover .
Although Thomas never saw the bills , Butler told him the counterfeiters had bleached $ 1 and $ 5 bills then printed $ 50 and $ 100 denominations onto the paper to produce near - perfect fakes .
Thomas gave Dexer a glowing review on CarderPlanet , and orders began pouring in – that is , until members started complaining that bills they ordered never arrived .
Dexer said U.S. customs was holding them up .
He discussed plans to get around the blockade , but shortly thereafter his nick disappeared from the boards , leading others to wonder whether he'd been arrested or simply skipped out to avoid the anger of dissatisfied customers who never received their bills .
Did the FBI move in on Dexer ?
As usual , Butler kept Thomas in the dark .
The uneven power relationship between Thomas and his handler , and the increasing claustrophobic nature of Thomas 's life , took their toll over time .
The strain was n't helped by the differences in Thomas ' and Butler 's personalities .
As Trevino describes him , Butler was the polar opposite of Thomas – tall and confident with tightly cropped blond hair and the physique and jaw of a college jock .
According to Thomas , Butler 's background was in drug investigations not cyber crime , and the two of them frequently butted heads over how to run the operation , often resulting in shouting matches in Butler 's car as they drove around the neighborhood for their debriefing sessions .
" He was very intelligent , " Thomas says .
" But ... we just never hit it off . "
The conflict came to a head one day after Butler rebuffed Thomas 's requests for some time off to get some rest .
When Butler next phoned for their routine debriefing session , Thomas , exhausted , refused .
" I 'm on vacation . "
Another shouting match ensued , culminating in Butler coming to the apartment and carting off the computer Thomas used to host The Grifters website .
As Butler left with the PC , he told Thomas he was fired and gave him a week to leave the apartment .
Dumbfounded , Thomas sat there for days struggling to figure out where he'd go with no money when Butler , his point finally made , called back .
" Okay .
Are you ready to get back to work now ? "
When TheGrifters went back online Thomas had to cover for his downtime by telling board members he'd been taken out by a DDoS attack .
The troubles with Butler were only compounded by the continuing attacks that Thomas faced from enemy carders trying to expose him and take out his site .
To deal with the stress of maintaining his double identity and battling Butler , he'd often retreat to the bathroom where he'd turn on the shower and lie on the floor , letting the water run for hours to clear the chatter from his head .
The shower ran so long one month that the FBI got a bill for 18,000 gallons of water .
Thomas says federal investigators appeared at his door to see if he was growing marijuana or making homebrew .
" They opened a federal investigation to find out where the water went , " Thomas says laughing .
" And the water went down the drain .
Because it was my only way to relax . "
Tomorrow : Enter the Russians .

One of Thomas 's former public defenders in Seattle , Thomas Hillier , was reluctant to speak with me but confirmed the jailhouse visit with Butler .
He said his memory of the four - year - old case was foggy and that he did n't recall a federal job offer for Thomas , although his file notes do contain a cryptic reference to a job offer next to the name of former assistant U.S. Attorney Hugh Berry .
According to Thomas , Berry was the U.S. attorney who visited him in Nebraska with FBI agent Steve Butler .

Thomas says the FBI paid him no salary , but covered his rent and expenses .
The former apartment manager at the complex where Thomas lived confirmed that the FBI paid rent on the apartment and that FBI Agent Steve Butler and another agent whom the manager identified as an FBI district supervisor accompanied Thomas the day he and Trevino moved in .
The manager , who asked not be identified by name because he spoke without permission from his former employer , said Butler gave him his cell phone number and told him to call if Thomas caused any problems while living there .
Candace Hamel , who worked in the property management head office at the time , said she could n't confirm that the FBI paid for the apartment , but then added after a pause and without prompting , " I 'm not denying it either . "
When asked if the management company had an ongoing deal with the FBI to supply the agency with apartments , as Thomas contends , Hamel again said she could n't confirm or deny then added , " That 's confidential information . "
FBI Agent Steve Butler was polite and friendly but declined to comment on whether Thomas worked for the FBI .
" We would never confirm or deny something like this , " he said , saying that such comments would make other people reluctant to work in such capacity with the FBI .
I should note here that there is a David A. Thomas who works for the FBI as chief of the agency 's Cyber Division Criminal Computer Intrusion Unit .
He 's often quoted in articles about cyber crime and should not be confused with David R. Thomas , who is the source for this story .

E - Gold Gets Tough on Crime
Confessions of a Cybermule
How Bot Those Nets ?
Crazy - Long Hacker Sentence Upheld
Known Hole Aided T - Mobile Breach
On the squeak - dev mailing list , Fabio Filasieno raised the issue of “ pipes ” in Smalltalk , which generated quite a discussion .
Since I ’ve provided an implementation , I ’m also writing down my thoughts on the subject .
In a nutshell , this is what the idea is about .
While the “ classic ” Smalltalk syntax allows us to write chains of unary messages such as
x foo bar
without explicit parentheses , this is not the case with keyword messages .
( x foo : 1 ) bar : 2
is a chain similar to the one above , yet its syntactic form is somewhat further removed from the idea of a “ smooth ” linear progression of operations , especially so when there are more than two consecutive message sends :
( ( ( x foo : 1 ) bar : 2 ) baz : 3 ) zork : 4
Imagine now that we have an operator which I will for now designate as “ :> ” allowing us to rewrite the above as
x foo : 1 :> bar : 2 :> baz : 3 :> zork : 4
In other words , it makes the result of the preceding expression the receiver of the following message send , so that in fact
x foo :> bar :> baz
and
x foo bar baz
are two syntactic forms of the same chain of messages .
One obvious example of the use of this operator is rewriting something like
( aCollection select : [ : some | some foo ] ) collect : [ : each | each bar ]
as
aCollection select : [ : some | some foo ] :> collect : [ : each | each bar ]
An even more likely case , which I do n’t believe was mentioned on squeak - dev , are complex conditions :
something things
At : aKey :> includes : a Thing :> ifTrue : [...] if False [...]
Writing the “ standard ” form often involves going back to the beginning of the expression to add parentheses once you ’ve written enough of the expression to realize what it will look like .
The chain operator exactly follows the “ do this , then this , then that ” structure of such expressions and does not require going back .
The change set linked at the beginning of the post implements the operator for Squeak .
The inevitable question now is , Is This A Good Thing ?
Clearly it adds nothing new to the language — chaining messages was always possible — only a new ability to express something in a different syntactic form .
Such things generally invite ( justified ) suspicion and tossing around the various “ less is more ” quotes .
Without questioning the value of minimalism and structured approach , some prior “ sugary ” additions such as tuples ( brace Array constructors ) or if Nil : / ifNotNil : could be ( and have been ) criticized on the same grounds .
Any Array constructor discussion usually involves someone pointing out how the ease of array creation is overrated because redesigning the code to replace arrays with structured objects or store them in self - documenting variables only improves the code .
This is true , of course — and yet in some contexts , one of which are DSL - like Smalltalk expressions , syntactically lightweight array creation turns out quite useful .
Perhaps there is a similar “ killer use ” out there waiting for lightweight message chains to become available .
Or perhaps not .
My take is that this operator might be a good thing , and only practice can show if there are use cases out there waiting for it .
As for less is more — perhaps the power of Smalltalk is not as much in having a small untouchable core ( and if anything , Object and UndefinedObject protocols in Squeak live to prove that more is more ) as in having a core small and malleable enough to support this sort of extensions and experimentation .
I ’d rather say Squeak core is still not small and malleable enough if something like this can only be done by modifying the compiler rather than tweaking the meta - level .
Having said this , I should comment on Bert Freudenberg ’s elegant # asPipe implementation .
There are two reasons why I consider it very neat but still not enough of the real thing .
One is the look of the code .
The value proposition of pipes is improving readability .
Getting rid of parentheses is only one step towards that , the other is having the links of the chain stand out enough for the reader to easily see where the distinct steps are .
This is partly an issue of formatting , but proper “ graphic design ” of a visually distinct special operator is still unbeatable .
In fact , in terms of visibility I think the operator even better than “ :> ” ( which already looks quite like a smiley ) is “ : ) ” :
something things
At : aKey :) includes : a Thing :) ifTrue : [...] if False [...]
The other issue are minor anomalies that are always hard to hide with DNU tricks because of the need for the DNU handler to have some rudimentary behavior of its own , and because some things are not handled by messages .
For example :
2 asPipe between : 1 and : 3 ; == true
evaluates to false .
2 asPipe between : 1 and : 3 ; ifTrue : [ # foo ]
fails to compile , ruling out the use of pipes to simplify conditions .
foo := [ #nil ] . bar := [ # notNil ] .
nil asPipe value ; ifNil : foo ifNotNil : bar
does compile because the branches are not literal blocks , but then the result of the “ pipe ” is #notNil .
Microsoft 's ongoing attempt to establish its own photo format as a JPEG alternative ( and potential successor ) took another step forward today when the JPEG standards group agreed to consider HD Photo ( originally named Windows Media Photo ) as a standard .
If successful , the new file standard will be known as JPEG XR .
Microsoft has sunk a great deal of work into HD Photo / JPEG XR and is aiming it specifically towards digital photography and other image capturing devices .
JPEG XR features include fixed or floating point high dynamic range , wide gamut image encoding , better compression compared to JPEG , lossless compression , the ability to store 16 or 32 bits of data per color , and support for CMYK , RGB , monochrome , and embedded ICC color profiles .
HD
Photo is also capable of storing data in such a way that only the needed information for any particular region needs to be decoded , and the compressed data itself can be manipulated .
Microsoft cites this feature as important for supporting the next generation of products like Windows Live Earth .
The new format may also improve the quality of photos taken under low - light conditions , due to its ability to store color data as interpreted by the camera sensor more flexibly than other formats may allow .
In contrast to the ongoing fight between competing file standards ODF and OOXML , the market seems moderately more friendly to the idea of a Microsoft - created standard that might replace , or at least complement , the existing JPEG standard .
Although JPEG2000 is capable of many of the same capabilities as HD Photo , the latter requires significantly less computational power and decompresses significantly faster .
Adobe 's TIFF format obviously is n't going anywhere anytime soon , but JPEG XR has the potential to establish Microsoft as a parity player in the image format game .
Now that the JPEG committee has begun the standardization process , balloting will begin and last through October of this year .
Assuming balloting is successful , it should take approximately one year to finalize and publish the completed standard , and Microsoft expects to work closely with the commission throughout this process .
Redmond has also stated it will offer a royalty - free grant for its patents that are required to implement the new standard .

According to my “ playtime , ” I spentof my life logged in to the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game : “ Final Fantasy XI . ”
This enormous value was the result of having played FFXI an average of four hours every day over the course of three years .
In that time , I believed that I had collected an impressive arsenal of weapons , armor , and fictional money called “ Gil ” for my in - game persona .
The reality , as I eventually realized , was that I willingly spent over $ 600 so that I could waste 180 days of my life sitting on my ass .
In this article , I ’ll be discussing the addictive nature of MMORPGs , the humorous way how I made certain that I was quitting FFXI forever , and most importantly , the reasons why I chose to quit playing .
If you ’ve never played a game of the MMO variety , then you ’re probably thinking “ You ’ve got to be kidding — Game Addiction ? ”
Believe me , the concept of such an affliction was just as alien to me when I bought the game .
Little did I know that within three years of purchasing the game , I would transform into a self - proclaimed “ FFXI Junkie . ”
Having examined the product subtleties more closely after - the - fact , I ’m convinced that Square - Enix ( the game producers ) purposely designed FFXI to be addictive in nature .
From a business perspective it makes sense to do so , since playing FFXI requires a subscription to their PlayOnline service .
Of course , you ’re not obligated to pay for the drugs subscription right away .
With exception of the one - time cost of the Game Discs , you wo n’t be charged anything for the first 30 days .
Funny how you must enter a valid credit card number to initiate your PlayOnline membership , though .
Then , right before you enter FFXI ‘s fictitious world for the first time , you ’re prompted with the following message :
A Word to Our Players Exploring Vana ’diel is a thrilling experience .
During your time here , you will be able to talk , join , and adventure with many other individuals in an experience that is unique to online games .
That being said , we have no desire to see your real life suffer as a consequence .
Do n’t forget your family , your friends , your school , or your work .
In fact , this message displays every time you enter Vana’diel , clearly indicating how Square - Enix acknowledges the addictive nature of MMOs .
FFXI possesses addictive qualities serious enough that a mandatory warning displays every time you login to play it .
It reminds me of the SURGEON GENERAL ’S WARNING posted on every pack of cigarettes .
Smoking Causes Lung Cancer , Heart Disease , Emphysema , and May Complicate Pregnancy .
FFXI Causes Muscle Fatigue , Repetitive Stress Disorder , Social Inadequacy , and May Lead to Obesity or Malnutrition .
It ’s easy to laugh at , because upon first seeing the warning , it seems very foolish .
You can tell yourself “ It wo n’t happen to me , ” or “ I ’m not addicted ” each time you click past the warning , but understand that the warning was put there for a reason .
It does happen .
Thankfully , although I was addicted , I was still sensible enough to go to work .
Three years of playing , however , did cause me to severely alienate myself from my family members and real life friends .
It also negatively affected my relationship with my now former girlfriend .
So what aspects of the game make it addictive ?
Plain and simple : the game has no ending .
There ’s a seemingly infinite and always increasing number of things for your game character to do .
Even after 180 days spent playing FFXI , I still experienced only a fraction of what ’s available — but going into detail about what the game offers would go beyond the scope and intended purpose of this article .
The point is that I became addicted enough that I willingly clicked past the warning for three years .
Consequently , the subscription costs and prices of expansion packs added up over 36 months , eventually reaching over $ 600 .
Once I calculated that value , I recognized that I was investing hard - earned money into my own demise .
Nothing tangible was resulting from the considerable time I was choosing to invest in playing FFXI .
After having played so long , it did n’t even seem like I was playing to have fun anymore — I was simply playing because my real life problems did n’t exist in Vana ’diel .
With this newfound understanding , I became determined to regain control of my life and quit playing FFXI forever .
The problem was , I often heard about the struggles other MMO Addicts had when trying to quit .
They ’d leave and come back , leave again and come back again — sometimes repeating their attempt to quit five or more times .
Knowing my own addictive personality , it would be all too easy for me to fall into a relapse if I did n’t make some preventative measures to keep myself from returning .
In other words , just telling myself that I would n’t play anymore would n’t be sufficient .
I ’d most likely “ quit ” only temporarily — and return to the game the first time I became even moderately bored .
Similarly , unsubscribing would n’t be sufficient either .
Character data remains intact when you cancel your subscription , and it ’s very easy to reactivate the account .
Since I was seriously planning on quitting permanently , I did everything in my power to make it difficult for me to login ever again .
In order to stop myself from returning to FFXI , I :
Gave all of my virtual assets to in - game friends .
Canceled my PlayOnline subscription .
Uninstalled the FFXI Game Software .
Locked the FFXI Game Installation Discs inside a Time Capsule .
Stored the Time Capsule in a neighbor ’s attic .
Left the Key to the Time Capsule with my family in New Jersey .
Moved from New Jersey to Michigan .
You may believe my methods for quitting are rather extreme , but I knew that ’s what it would take .
Even now , five months after taking these steps , I still get an occasional desire to play .
Thankfully , it ’s damn hard to justify reversing all of those steps to satisfy my Gaming Addition .
Now to answer the more important question :
Why ?
Three years is a long time .
Looking back on the years I lost playing FFXI is reminiscent of a time warp .
I advanced my game character for three years while my real life was put on pause .
It got me nowhere .
I failed to invest in myself because of my addiction to the fantasy .
Consequently , after three years I did n’t have more money , more school , or more skills , let alone more happiness .
Dedicating more time to this fantasy world did n’t make sense — my real life was suffering because of my inability to exercise restraint , so I took drastic measures in order to begin creating positive change in my life .
The hardest part was making the choice to quit permanently , knowing that I ’d have to continue making that choice every day to truly conquer my addiction .
My hope is that maybe this article can enlighten other MMO Addicts that it ’s within their power to choose to quit playing .
If your life is suffering because of an unhealthy addiction to a MMORPG , then I encourage you to assess whether you ’re playing for fun , or because you ’re simply unable to stop .
Quitting FFXI has been bittersweet for me .
Having abstained from playing for five months now , I admit that there are many aspects of the game that I miss — but truthfully , What I miss pales in comparison to Who I miss .
The people I developed in - game friendships with during my FFXI career are naturally what I miss most .
They helped transform the game into an unforgettable experience , and the feeling of comradeship I would constantly experience playing alongside them is something I am sad to have let go of .
I ’m not disappointed I made the decision to stop playing , but I ca n’t deny having enjoyed every moment of my playtime .
Still Unconvinced Game Addiction Exists ?

Just when it seemed that Western images of Africa could not get any weirder , the July 2007 special Africa issue of Vanity Fair was published , complete with a feature article on " Madonna 's Malawi . "
At the same time , the memoirs of an African child soldier are on sale at your local Starbucks , and celebrity activist Bob Geldof is touring Africa yet again , followed by TV cameras , to document that " War , Famine , Plague & Death are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and these days they 're riding hard through the back roads of Africa . "
It 's a dark and scary picture of a helpless , backward continent that 's being offered up to TV watchers and coffee drinkers .
But in fact , the real Africa is quite a bit different .
And the problem with all this Western stereotyping is that it manages to snatch defeat from the jaws of some current victories , fueling support for patronizing Western policies designed to rescue the allegedly helpless African people while often discouraging those policies that might actually help .
Let 's begin with those rampaging Four Horsemen .
Do they really explain Africa today ?
What percentage of the African population would you say dies in war every year ?
What share of male children , age 10 to 17 , are child soldiers ?
How many Africans are afflicted by famine or died of AIDS last year or are living as refugees ?
In each case , the answer is one - half of 1 % of the population or less .
In some cases it 's much less ; for example , annual war deaths have averaged 1 out of every 10,800 Africans for the last four decades .
That does n't lessen the tragedy , of course , of those who are such victims , and maybe there are things the West can do to help them .
But the typical African is a long way from being a starving , AIDS - stricken refugee at the mercy of child soldiers .
The reality is that many more Africans need latrines than need Western peacekeepers -- but that does n't play so well on TV .
Further distortions of Africa emanate from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's star - studded Africa Progress Panel ( which includes the ubiquitous Geldof ) .
The panel laments in its 2007 news release that Africa remains " far short " of its goal of making " substantial inroads into poverty reduction . "
But this does n't quite square with the sub-Saharan Africa that in 2006 registered its third straight year of good GDP growth -- about 6 % , well above historic averages for either today 's rich countries or all developing countries .
Growth of living standards in the last five years is the highest in Africa 's history .
The real Africa also has seen cellphone and Internet use double every year for the last seven years .
Foreign private capital inflows into Africa hit $ 38 billion in 2006 -- more than foreign aid .
Africans are saving a higher percentage of their incomes than Americans are ( so much for the " poverty trap " of being " too poor to save " endlessly repeated in aid reports ) .
I agree that it 's too soon to conclude that Africa is on a stable growth track , but why not celebrate what Africans have already achieved ?
Instead , the international development establishment is rigging the game to make Africa -- which is , of course , still very poor -- look even worse than it really is .
It announces , for instance , that Africa is the only region that is failing to meet the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs in aid - speak ) set out by the United Nations .
Well , it takes extraordinary growth to cut extreme poverty rates in half by 2015 ( the first goal ) when a near - majority of the population is poor , as is the case in Africa .
( Latin America , by contrast , requires only modest growth to halve its extreme poverty rate from 10 % to 5 % . )
This is how Blair 's panel managed to call Africa 's recent growth successes a failure .
But the reality is that virtually all other countries that have escaped extreme poverty did so through the kind of respectable growth that Africa is enjoying -- not the kind of extraordinary growth that would have been required to meet the arbitrary Millennium Development Goals .
Africa will also fail to meet the second goal of universal primary education by 2015 .
But this goal is also rigged against Africa , because Africa started with an unusually low percentage of children enrolled in elementary school .
As economist Michael Clemens points out , most African countries have actually expanded enrollments far more rapidly over the last five decades than Western countries did during their development , but Africans still wo n't reach the arbitrary aid target of universal enrollment by 2015 .
For example , the World Bank condemned Burkina Faso in 2003 as " seriously off track " to meet the second MDG , yet the country has expanded elementary education at more than twice the rate of Western historical experience , and it is even far above the faster educational expansions of all other developing countries in recent decades .
Why do aid organizations and their celebrity backers want to make African successes look like failures ?
One can only speculate , but it certainly helps aid agencies get more publicity and more money if problems seem greater than they are .
As for the stars -- well , could Africa be saving celebrity careers more than celebrities are saving Africa ?
In truth , Africans are and will be escaping poverty the same way everybody else did : through the efforts of resourceful entrepreneurs , democratic reformers and ordinary citizens at home , not through PR extravaganzas of ill - informed outsiders .
The real Africa needs increased trade from the West more than it needs more aid handouts .
A respected Ugandan journalist , Andrew Mwenda , made this point at a recent African conference despite the fact that the world 's most famous celebrity activist -- Bono -- was attempting to shout him down .
Mwenda was suffering from too much reality for Bono 's taste : " What man or nation has ever become rich by holding out a begging bowl ? " asked Mwenda .
Perhaps Bono was grouchy because his celebrity - laden " Red " campaign to promote Western brands to finance begging bowls for Africa has spent $ 100 million on marketing and generated sales of only $ 18 million , according to a recent report .
But the fact remains that the West shows a lot more interest in begging bowls than in , say , letting African cotton growers compete fairly in Western markets ( see the recent collapse of world trade talks ) .
Today , as I sip my Rwandan gourmet coffee and wear my Nigerian shirt here in New York , and as European men eat fresh Ghanaian pineapple for breakfast and bring Kenyan flowers home to their wives , I wonder what it will take for Western consumers to learn even more about the products of self - sufficient , hardworking , dignified Africans .
Perhaps they should spend less time consuming Africa disaster stereotypes from television and Vanity Fair .

After a six weeks away , CBS Chief Foreign Correspondent , Lara Logan , returned to Iraq and shared her stark observations with Bob Schieffer this morning on " Face The Nation . "
Logan spoke about the deteriorating conditions in Bagdad and the underlying theme coming out of Iraq ; sectarian killings are down , but U.S. troop deaths are up and the number of attacks on our soldiers are on the rise .

Schieffer : " What 's your assessment at this point , is it better , worse , or about the the same as when you left ? "
Logan : " Well , I can tell you Bob , I 've only been gone for about six weeks and just the drive from the airport into Baghdad itself was really visually disturbing .
You could sense there is a dramatic change in the feeling in the city itself .
It looks like a wasteland .
The drive really reminded me of something out of Armageddon . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Al Qaeda is the strongest it has been since the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , a new U.S. government analysis concludes , according to a senior government official who has seen it .
A Pakistani soldier mans a bunker near the Afghan border in a tribal area of Pakistan .
Despite a campaign of military action and counterterrorism operations , al Qaeda has regained its strength and found safe haven in the tribal areas of Pakistan , the report says , according to counterterrorism officials familiar with the report .
The five - page intelligence analysis remains classified and was prepared for senior U.S. policymakers .
It was not issued in response to a specific threat .
Two intelligence officials said the report 's finding are similar to what is expected to be in the National Intelligence Estimate anticipated to be released later this summer .
The NIE is the intelligence community 's collective analysis of pressing national security issues .
The White House 's view is that " over the past six years , we have prevented attacks from al Qaeda by taking the fight to them , " a senior administration official said .
" But they are an enemy that adapts . "
This new report backs up warnings by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and other officials that al Qaeda remains a serious threat and that the United States is vulnerable despite the numerous security changes made since September 11 , 2001 .
Watch Chertoff explain his " gut feeling " »
Chertoff said Wednesday , however , that there is no " specific , credible information " that terrorist attacks on the United States are imminent .
In a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday , several senior intelligence officials talked about how the terrorist group has found refuge in parts of Pakistan .
" We actually see the al Qaeda central being resurgent in their role in planning operations , " John Kringen , head of the CIA 's intelligence directorate , testified at the hearing Wednesday .
" They seem to be fairly well settled into the safe haven in the ungoverned spaces of Pakistan there .
We see more training .
We see more money .
We see more communications . "
Thomas Fingar , deputy director of national intelligence , told lawmakers that al Qaeda leaders hiding in Pakistan are able to maintain relationships " with affiliates throughout the Middle East , North and East Africa and Europe . "
In a statement , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it was no surprise al Qaeda has been able to reorganize and rebuild " given President Bush 's stubborn dedication to keeping our overextended military mired in an Iraqi civil war . "
" It is a travesty that Osama bin Laden remains at large nearly six years after the 9/11 attacks and appears to have found new sanctuary to operate freely in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border regions , " Reid said .
" The Bush administration and most congressional Republicans would rather stubbornly stick with a flawed strategy and fight a war that senior military leaders say cannot be won militarily , than adapt to fighting the enemy who attacked us six years ago . "
In recent weeks , counterterrorism authorities have expressed concern about the possibility of another attack on U.S. soil , saying several factors , such as the thwarted terror plots in Britain , have them on edge .
The FBI has created a small group of agents and analysts to examine new threats and leads over the summer , a bureau official told CNN .
The group , which was created several weeks ago , is supplementing what agents and others are also doing in field offices across the country and is an example of how the government is trying to make sure no credible lead is missed , the official said .

Trackbacks Judicial Activism Switching Sides ?:
The first judge wrote a short concurrence noting that the court was bound by Supreme Court and circuit precedent , and thus had little choice but to rule in the government 's favor .
The second judge dissented , taking issue with decades of caselaw from the Supreme Court and lower courts and urging the rejection of the Supreme Court 's test and the substitution of a new , more restrictive test to better protect the rights of minorities from abusive police practices .
The fascinating thing about this ?

Counter Strike was originally created by fans
Thousands of people have signed up to help develop a community - built massively multiplayer online role playing game ( MMO ) .
Developer Dave Perry and publisher Acclaim are building a professional MMO with the help of ordinary people .
One of the users will be chosen to " direct " a future game and will receive any royalties earned .
" I want it to be a title they own and feel excited about , " said Mr Perry , a 24 - year veteran of the games industry .
Overwhelming response
The original goal was to try to develop a title faster than if it was done by professional developers alone , he said .
The project , known as Top Secret , is looking for artists , writers , designers and audio technicians from the ranks of ordinary gamers .
" With 20,000 people signed up we are already the biggest development team in history .
" We will end up with 100,000 people on this team .
if 1 % is any good , we are good to go . "
Gamers have been able to sign up since last week and Mr Perry said he had been overwhelmed by the response .
" There is a real pent - up level of interest we did n't expect .
We have touched a nerve . "
There is a tradition of non-professionals creating content for the games industry .
The 1998 PC game Half Life spawned an entire industry when fans created a modified ( mod ) version of the title , called Counter Strike .
Crowd sourcing
Ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought ,
Dave Perry
Many firms offer tools to users to help them build content and mods but this is believed to be the most ambitious commercial project to date .
Mr Perry has worked in the games industry since he was 15 years old .
In recent years he has made the transition from lead programmer to studio head and is currently working on four other MMOs , as well as creating a games finance business and driving the creation of an open source , global map of gaming .
A professional team of artists , programmers , designers , and audio staff will build the MMO but the creative impetus will come from the users .
" We are not doing this for fun ; this is a professional game we are trying to make .
It 's a business .
" I hope it will prove to us that consumers are useful . "
Mr Perry is hoping to take advantage of so - called crowd sourcing or " accepting that the combined intelligence of all these people is far beyond your own . "
" While we want to think we 've got all the best ideas it 's just not true , " added the Northern Ireland - born , now LA - based , developer .
Back - up plan
MMOs have become one of the most popular gaming genres , with titles like World of Warcraft attracting millions of monthly subscribers around the world .
Mr Perry said successful MMOs kept gamers on a continuing path of new experiences .
He said he expected the volunteers to come and go over time , with some recruited by the games industry to work on other projects .
" I am expecting a lot of head - hunters , developers and publishers to be looking around and trolling through the responses and hiring anyone that is good .
" I also expect to see splinter groups ; teams of three or four working together on other projects . "
He said that the whole industry would have something to gain from the experience .
But he also said there was a back - up plan in place , if the contributions from gamers prove disappointing .
" If they deliver zero , we can still ship a title , " he said .
Mr Perry is also helping the development of an interactive map which will reveal the global reach of the games industry .
He has funded a programmer to help start the map and is now turning over its development to users .
" It has to be created by the people for the people - they have to have complete control . "
The map will encompass games developers , publishers and colleges offering gaming courses around the globe .
" Ultimately we are going to see that the games development industry is much bigger than we thought , " he said .
All of us possess everything necessary to be more creative .
The problem is we ’ve been trained away from our creative instincts by schools , parents , movies and workplaces .
The word creativity is frequently inflated by association , frequently appearing with overused , hype - laden words such as genius , brilliance , revolution and innovation .
Hype mongers and creative intimidators throw those labels around like candy , scaring most people out of their own natural creative instincts .
This essay , a high speed hack - centric interpretation of the creative thinking course I taught at the University of Washington , offers both concepts and tricks to help anyone be creative at any time .
If you do n’t want to read , you can watch the presentation :
Kill creative romance
First , like most media today , this essay starts with violence ( and unnecessary exclamation points ) !
Close your eyes , imagine the most amazing sword ever made , and attack every creative legend you ’ve ever heard .
We ’ve romanced da Vinci , Mozart and Einstein into gods , minimizing the ordinary aspects of their lives so intensely that their mothers would n’t recognize them in the legends we tell .
Next , using your sword ’s mint scented flamethrower attachment , set fire to childhood tales of Isaac Newton and the apple , Benjamin Franklin and the lightning kite , and Edison and the light bulb .
These popular tales of creativity and discovery are deceptive at best , wild lies at worst , shaped to placate the masses , not to inform creative people on their craft .
Tear it all down , throw a dozen napalm coated hand grenades in for good measure , and watch your old , broken down view of creativity go up in flames .
Dance over the smoldering ruins !
Roast marshmallows on the still warm remains of your creative fulminations !
The fun begins now .
On the new creative landscape you ’ve made , place the following simple definition : an idea is a combination of other ideas .
Say it five times out loud .
Say it to your cat .
Yell it out you car window at strangers waiting for the bus .
Every amazing creative thing you ’ve ever seen , or idea you ’ve ever heard can be broken down into smaller ideas that existed before .
An automobile ?
An engine + wheels .
A telephone ?
Electricity and sound .
Reese ’s peanut butter cups ?
Peanut butter and chocolate .
All great creative ideas , inventions , and theories are comprised of other ideas .
Why should you care ?
Here ’s why : if you want to be a creator instead of a mere consumer you must see ideas currently in the world as fuel for your mind .
You must stop seeing them as objects or functional things : they are combinations of ingredients waiting for reuse .
Combinations
Cooking is a brilliant analogy for creativity : a chef ’s talents hinge on their ability to bring ingredients together to create things .
Even the most inspired chef in history did not make bacon appear by mere concentration , nor suggest to the divine forces that a ripe tomato would be a “ nice to have ” on the list on desired outcomes of evolution .
Buying into the “ creativity as combinations ” view of the world , helps creators in many ways .
It means that if at any time you feel uncreative the solution is to look more carefully for the combinations available to you .
Increasing creativeness at any time does n’t require anything more than an increase in your observations : become more open to the possible combinations of things than you currently are .
Here ’s a test : quickly pick two things in front of you , say this web browser and your annoying , smelly friend Rupert .
Now close your eyes and imagine different ways to combine them .
If you ’re stuck , here are three :
Rupert with a minimize button
An annoying , smelly web browser Web browsing on , or with , Rupert ’s face
Now while these combos might not be useful , good , or even practical , they ’re certainly creative .
Adding a third element , say a gallon of jolt cola , might yield even more interesting combinations ( a caffeine overdosed smelly web browser infused with Rupert ’s annoying personality ) .
Over time , creative masters learn reusable combinations , or patterns , that can be used again and again to develop new ideas or modify old ones .
Study any creative field , from comedy , to cooking , to writing to music composition , and you ’ll discover patterns for constructing good combinations that appear again and again .
( Snark resistant disclaimer :
Yes , there are other complexities to working with ideas that the combinations themselves do n’t solve .
And yes , I confess that sheer combinations of ideas wo n’t necessarily yield brilliance .
But you get what you paid for : read the title of this free essay again – it ’s creative thinking , not brilliant thinking .
So go snark elsewhere ) .
Inhibition
We ’re afraid .
We ’re afraid of the dark , of our parents , and what our parents do in the dark .
Our tiny , efficient brains do their best to keep us from thinking about things we fear or do n’t understand .
This is good for survival , but bad for combination making .
We shut down the pursuit of many combinations because of predictions we make about what the result will be like .
Remember this : we suck at prediction .
Half the challenge of being creative is turning fears off , and trying out ideas even if we think they might not work or are unsure of what will happen .
Weird ideas almost always teach us something we could not have learned any other way , and improve the chances the next combo will be more useful .
One way to think of creative people is that they ’re the ones who have more control over their fears , or simply have less fear of embarrassment .
Being creative has more to do with being fearless than intelligent , brilliant or any other adjective superficially associated with creativity .
This explains why many people feel more creative when drinking , on other drugs , or late at night : these are all moments when our inhibitions are lower , or at least altered , and we allow ourselves to see more combinations of things than we do at other times .
Environment
Creativity is personal .
No book ( or essay ) can dictate for you how to be more creative .
You have to spend time paying attention to yourself : when do ideas come easiest to you ?
Are you alone ?
With friends ?
In bars ?
At the beach ?
Are there times of day when you ’re most relaxed ?
Is there music playing ?
Start paying attention to your own creative rhythms and construct your creative activities around them .
To get all Emersonian on you , this is called self - knowledge : you ca n’t be productive as a creator if you ’re not paying attention to your own behavior and learning about how best to cultivate the idiosyncratic and custom wonder that is you .
Persistence
Being creative for kicks is easy .
But if you want to be creative on demand you must develop habits that help and that ’s about persistence .
You wo n’t always find interesting combinations for a problem right away , and identifying fears and working through them is rarely fun .
At some point all creative work becomes , simply , work .
Study the histories of great creators and you ’ll find a common core of willpower and commitment as their driving force .
Van Gogh , Michelangelo and Mozart worked every day .
Edison , Hemingway , Beethoven , and most legendary talents outworked their peers .
Forget brilliance or genetics , the biggest difference between the greats and us , was their dedication to their craft .
The greatest creative hack , however unglamorous and obvious it might be , is simply not giving up .
Playing with ideas is one thing , but realizing them in the world is another .
When an idea is fully formed in your head there ’s no escaping the fact that for the idea to change the world it has to leave your brain , a journey that only happens with ordinary , regular , ever - day hard work .
Writing proposals , sketching designs , pitching ideas : it ’s all work most of us know how to do .
The question is how far are you willing to go to make your idea real : a challenge that has little to do with creative thinking .

Creative thinking hacks
Just so you know , I know that you skipped the rest of the essay and jumped straight down here .
Start an idea journal .
The rule is : any idea that pops in your mind , at any time , write it down .
There are no inhibitions : any idea for anything goes in here .
This will help you find your own creative rhythms , as over time you can note what times of day you ’re more creative .
I recommend a paper journal , so you sketch or draw things , but digital journals can work too .
Whenever you ’re stuck , flip through your journal .
You are bound to find an old idea you ’ve forgotten about that can be used towards the problem you ’re trying to solve .

Give your subconscious a chance .
The reason ideas come to you in the shower is that you ’re relaxed enough for your subconscious to surface ideas for you .
Make this easier : find time to turn your mind off .
Go for a run , swim , jog , have sex , something that ’s as far from your creative problem as possible .

Inversion .
If you ’re stuck , come up for ideas for the opposite of what you want .
If your goal was to design the best album cover ever , switch to designing the worst album cover ever .
Five minutes at an inverted problem will get your frustrations out , make you laugh , and likely get you past you fears .
Odds are high you ’ll hit something so horribly bad that it ’s almost good , and you ’re inspired to switch back to your original goal .

Switch modes .
Everyone has dominate ways to express ideas : sketching , writing , talking .
If you switch the mode you ’re working in , different ideas are easier to find and your understanding of a particular idea changes every time you use a different medium to express it .
This is both a way to find new ideas , and to explore an idea you ’re focusing on .

Take an improvisational comedy class .
This will be easier and less painful than you think .
It will teach you an entirely new way of thinking about the craft of creation .
Most improve classes are structured around fun , party type games and teach you ways to combine ideas in real time : a powerful skill for any creator ( If you ’re unconvinced , read What I Learned From Improv Class ) .

Find a partner .
Many people are most creative when they ’re with other creative people they like .
Partnering up on a project , or even being around other creative people who are working on solo projects , keeps energy levels high .
It also gives you a drinking buddy when things go sour .

Stop reading and start doing .
The word create is a verb .
Be active .
Go make things .
Do n’t study it like accounting : you have to go do it , and make lots of mistakes , to learn anything about your own creative process .
So get off the web and start making something .

The boom surpasses the rise in sales of books in categories such as history , which have grown by 38 per cent , and politics , up by 30 per cent , confirming that religion has become a pivotal topic in the early 21st century .
But the statistics may not make uplifting reading for believers .
The most popular ' religious ' book , says Amazon , is The God Delusion , an anti-faith polemic by Richard Dawkins , the academic who has been dubbed ' Darwin 's rottweiler ' .
Second is God is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything , another broadside at holy citadels , by the journalist Christopher Hitchens .
Amazon said that the third most popular book in the category was Jesus of Nazareth by the Pope , followed by a perennial favourite among readers seeking spiritual fulfilment , Paulo Coelho 's The Alchemist : A Fable about Following your Dream and a riposte to Dawkins entitled The Dawkins Delusion ?
Atheist Fundamentalism and the Denial of the Divine by Alister and Joanna McGrath .
But it is The God Delusion that has driven the growth of the category .
Between April and June it was the fourth - bestselling book of all , beaten only by the two editions ( children and adult ) of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay 's latest offering .
However , the publication of The God Delusion last year also prompted a 120 per cent increase in sales of the Bible .
Amy Worth , books manager at Amazon , said : ' The God Delusion has been one of the bestselling books of the past year .
People are interested in the debate it has sparked .
There are 524 readers ' comments on our site .
The comments are both pro and against and it's clear that religious people are buying it .
The Dawkins Delusion has also been successful , although when we had a customer - vote on The Dawkins Delusion versus The God Delusion , the winner was The God Delusion . '
Other books challenging religion have included Daniel Dennett 's Breaking the Spell and AC Grayling 's Against All Gods .
Grayling , professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College , University of London , said they had found an audience following the terrorist attacks of 11 September , 2001 .
' I think 9/11 has changed the nature of the debate tremendously , ' he said .
' A decade ago people would n't say " I'm a Christian " at a dinner party .
You would no more speak about your religious belief than you would your sex life .
' But after 9/11 we no longer think people should be treated differently or given exemption from certain laws because they believe something .
Secularists are now saying , " OK , believe in what you like , believe in fairies at the bottom of the garden if you want to , but do n't force your beliefs on us or our children , and do n't expect preferential treatment . "
To allow religious organisations more privileges and influence than a political party or trade union , for example , is to distort public debate .
People are waking up to the fact it is anomalous . '
Suppose 245,000 americans had died in terrorist attacks since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The United States would be beside itself , utterly gripped by a sense of national emergency .
Political leaders would speak of nothing else , the United States military would stand at maximum readiness , and the White House would vow not to rest until the danger to Americans had been utterly eradicated .
Yet 245,000 Americans have died because of one specific threat since 9/11 , and no one seems to care .
While the tragedy of 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 has justified two wars , in which thousands of U.S. soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice , the tragedy of 245,000 lives lost in traffic accidents on the nation ’s roads during the same period has justified . . . pretty much no response at all .
Terrorism is on the front page day in and day out , but the media rarely even mention road deaths .
A few days ago , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that 42,642 Americans died in traffic in 2006 .
Did you hear this reported anywhere ?
This phenomenon is not just American , it is global .
Traffic deaths are the fastest - rising cause of death in the world .
Yet you ’ve heard far more about H5N1 avian influenza , which has killed 192 people worldwide since being detected five years ago , than about the 6 million people who have died in traffic accidents in the same period .
Last year alone , 1.2 million people were killed on the world ’s roads , versus about 100,000 dead as a result of combat .
The last decade is believed to be the first time in history that roads posed a greater danger to human beings than fighting ( which is partly a reflection of the decline of war ) .
Global prosperity is rising fast , which means that global car ownership is rising fast , and both of those things are good -- but they also mean that global traffic deaths are rising as well .
Worldwide , traffic deaths look exactly like a pandemic -- increasing in most nations , with local rapid spikes .

Two forces seem at play in skewed perceptions of these risks .
The first is the fundamental difference between harm because of accidents and harm because of deliberate action ; the second , society ’s strange assumption that traffic fatalities cannot be avoided .
The loss of life caused by terrorism on 9/11 -- or similar losses in other acts of terror or war -- has a wholly different moral standing than loss of life in accidents .
Terrorists are criminals whose intent is homicide .
Those who act illegally or immorally must be opposed even if that means engaging in complex , expensive , perilous undertakings , as the United States has since the darkness of 9/11 .
A life lost in a traffic accident is very sad , but it does not involve an offense against morality or human dignity .
Most traffic accidents are just that -- accidents .
In that sense , it may be reasonable that 3,000 deaths because of terrorism have a disproportionate effect on national policymaking .
Next , cars and trucks possess utility .
They are vital to our economy and to our personal freedom .
Having millions of cars and trucks roaring every which way is necessary for the American economy to be so productive .
Environmental Protection Agency figures show that , in the last three decades , vehicle - miles traveled have risen 170 % in the United States .
Some of this may be unnecessary , but most vehicle - miles happen because they serve someone ’s interest .
If the use of cars were restricted , accidents would certainly decline , but so would economic productivity and personal freedom .
Here ’s where the big faults in our thinking come into play .
Do the media downplay road dangers in part because the auto industry is the No. 1 advertiser on TV and among the top advertisers for newspapers ?
Detroit would much rather Brian Williams or Katie Couric titter about Paris Hilton , or the L.A. Times feature articles on Waziristan , than hear about 42,642 dead on the roads last year .

Typical Americans are to blame as well .
Because we do n’t want to contemplate dying in a car crash , we seem to assume that highway fatalities cannot be reduced , that they fall into the “ stuff happens ” category .
This is n’t so .
Risks of driving or of crossing the street -- each year more pedestrians die in the United States than the death toll of 9/11 -- could be reduced significantly without any sacrifice of freedom by car owners .
Relative to passenger - miles traveled , traffic fatalities have declined in the United States owing to anti-lock brakes , air bags , impact engineering ( a hidden safety feature of most new vehicles ) and the big rise in shoulder - harness use ( your seat belt is much more important to safety than air bags ) .
Tougher laws and social awareness have reduced drunk driving .
Yet fatalities per mile traveled have not fallen as much as might be expected given improved technology and less alcohol - impaired driving .
There appear to be two key reasons : cellphones and horsepower .
Driving while yakking may seem harmless to you , but try telling that to the loved ones of the hundreds or even thousands who die each year in totally avoidable phone - related accidents .
Holding a cellphone while driving will become illegal in California in 2008 .
But the odds of getting stopped are slight .
Automated cameras now issue speeding tickets ; why ca n’t they issue tickets to owners of cars photographed with a driver using a phone ?
Another idea is to pass laws under which , if a driver is on the phone at the moment of a crash , he or she is presumed to be at fault .
It is well past time for legislatures to stop waffling on this issue and take action .
People make phone calls while driving because they know they can get away with it .
This is more important than human life ?

The ever - rising horsepower of cars , SUVs and pickup trucks is another reason road fatalities stay high .
Twenty years ago , the average new passenger vehicle had 119 horsepower and went from zero to 60 in 13 seconds ; this year ’s averages are 220 horsepower and zero to 60 in 9.5 seconds .
New cars , SUVs and pickup trucks of this model year are the “ fastest and most powerful vehicles since the EPA began compiling data , ” the federal agency recently said .
Even many new family sedans are ridiculously overpowered .
Car & Driver magazine recently tested the new , 268 - horsepower Toyota Camry :
It did zero to 60 in 5.8 seconds , which was Corvette acceleration a generation ago .
Cars with high horsepower and rapid acceleration are easy to lose control of , especially for young drivers .
Tap the accelerator in a tight curve for just an instant in that Camry -- to say nothing of socially irresponsible monstrosities such as the 520 - horsepower Porsche Cayenne SUV -- and you can lose control .
High - horsepower cars enable cutting off and other forms of aggressive driving ; cutting off and sudden lane changes are leading causes of highway collisions .
A generation ago , a small percentage of American drivers had high - horsepower vehicles .
Now the majority do !
Is it a coincidence that road rage and high horsepower have occurred simultaneously ?
High horsepower makes road rage possible , which in turn adds to the death count .
The proliferation of high horsepower cars is doubly wrong because it links to ever - rising petroleum use and greenhouse gases .
Automakers have significantly increased powertrain efficiency in the last 20 years -- but the gains have gone into horsepower , not fuel efficiency .
Other things being equal , if new - vehicle horsepower were reduced by one - third , miles per gallon would rise by one - third .
One decade of sales of new vehicles with one - third higher horsepower accounts for the amount of oil the United States imports from the Persian Gulf region .
Reduce horsepower by a third and end U.S. Persian Gulf oil dependence .
Yes , it ’s that simple .
If only we ’d actually do it !
Because horsepower is an arms race -- if one automaker offers more , all must -- federal legislation to limit horsepower would offer a good - news trifecta :
Higher mpg , reduced greenhouse - gas emissions and lower road fatalities as average motorists stop acting like they ’re at a NASCAR track .

Why does n’t Congress act to end the horsepower wars ?
Please do n’t counter that “ no one can tell me what I can drive . ”
The Constitution says you ’ve got a right to own a gun and to read a newspaper .
Firearms and materials related to 1st Amendment expression are the only categories of possessions given protected status by the Constitution ; courts consistently rule that vehicles on public roads can be regulated for public purposes such as safety .
Horsepower regulation and serious enforcement against cellphone use while driving might save thousands of lives a year .
Such reforms might also prevent many billions of dollars in economic losses and make a big dent in the other road - danger figure no one talks about -- 2.6 million Americans injured in traffic crashes last year .
Other reforms , such as pedestrian - activated warning lights at crosswalks , could also reduce traffic deaths in the United States .
Numerous reforms could reduce traffic deaths in developing countries .
As a nation , we find common ground in agreeing that even one death from terrorism cannot be tolerated .
Why are tens of thousands of annual road deaths OK ?

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A woman set fire to her ex-husband ’s penis as he sat naked watching television and drinking vodka , Moscow police said Wednesday .
Asked if the man would make a full recovery , a police spokeswoman said it was “ difficult to predict . ”
The attack climaxed three years of acrimonious enforced co-habitation .
The couple divorced three years ago but continued to share a small flat , something common in Russia where property costs are very high .
“ It was monstrously painful , ” the wounded ex-husband told Tvoi Den newspaper .
“ I was burning like a torch .
I do n’t know what I did to deserve this . ”
Boorman 's new lifestyle costs less
Exactly one year ago this week , I held a public bonfire in central London , whereby I burnt all of my branded possessions .
In an article on this website , I explained why .
I suffered from a condition known as obsessive branding disorder - a combination of compulsive shopping and a reliance on status symbol brands for the maintenance of one 's self esteem .
I did n't buy clothes , gadgets or even food for the basic functions that they performed .
I bought them for the way they made me feel .
From Adidas trainers to BlackBerry phones , I depended on the confidence these brands gave me to face the world each day .
I began to realise the more money I spent , the more miserable I became .
With mounting debts and plummeting self - esteem , I pledged to do away with these emotional crutches and attempted to live a year of my life brand - free .
By banning myself from the shops I hoped to cleanse myself of a destructive addiction .
But the prohibition became a kind of experiment , I wanted to find out if a person living in modern Britain could survive away from the chain stores and supermarkets that dominate our lives .
The first months of my brand - free life were hell .
My local High Streets were populated entirely by mass - market brands and I was forced to scour the back streets for alternative spaces to shop .
Glamorous lifestyle
The weekly shop for essentials - previously an hour 's dash around Sainsbury 's - now occupied a whole day of my weekend .
With most markets opening for one day a week , I was also forced to plan ahead .
I had to discover my local fishmongers and butchers and bulk - buy cosmetics and cleaning products from janitorial suppliers .
Shopping for clothes became less of a glamorous lifestyle pursuit and more of a functional activity , undertaken only when I absolutely needed new stuff .
I sourced my new wardrobe from second hand shops , army surplus stores and non-branded suppliers on the net .
I even had some clothes made by the tailor at my local dry cleaners .
Goodbye designer threads
Emotionally , I had a lot of re-building to do .
Without my beloved brands as confidence boosters , I had to search for new reasons to feel good about myself .
My psychotherapist encouraged me to confront my negative self - esteem and to stop judging myself by the impossible ideals that confronted me in the media .
Accepting the real me , as opposed to camouflaging with brands , was key to the long - term disconnection from the culture of consumerism .
The advertisements for Selfridges said " I Shop Therefore I Am " , but I began to know better .
As the year 's experiment draws to a close , I 'm pleased to say that I remain largely brand - free , save the odd emergency shop for Andrex toilet rolls .
Emergencies
Shopping for locally produced , small - scale produce remains a constant struggle in Britain , but the hollow dazzle of the High Street has been replaced by something infinitely more satisfying .
I know my local shopkeepers by name .
There being little alternatives to branded ready meals and processed food , I have lost almost a stone in weight simply from eating all natural produce .
Spending less money overall , my bank balance is back in the black .
And the status anxiety that plagued my social life has all but disappeared .
Why on earth did I spend so much time worrying about the brands on my feet ?
Some of my colleagues and friends might find me less exciting but as my mother used to tell me , the people who care about your clothes do n't really care about you .
My year 's brand amnesty coincided with a raft of media reports on consumption and climate change .
The Stern Report warned that we face losing up to a fifth of the world 's wealth from unmitigated climate change .
Carbon footprints began to dominate the news agenda and countless manufacturers clamoured to re-brand as carbon neutral .
Media reports alerted us to the problem of waste in consumer packaging and gave us further evidence of the dreadful working conditions endured in the factories of our favourite High Street brands .
Just as soon as we began to embrace carbon offsetting , evidence emerged that the schemes had little effect .
We watched Al Gore on TV pleading with us to consume less , interspersed with brand adverts that encouraged us to consume more .
Clearly , this is the modern dilemma that all consumers face , addicted or not .
Compelled to consume
According to the Carbon Trust , 42 % of the average carbon footprint is made up of recreation and leisure , clothing and food .
Public debate on carbon emissions has so far concentrated on transport and energy , but at some point soon we will have to consider changing our spending habits on the High Street .
Tony Juniper of Friends Of The Earth has said : " Carbon offsetting schemes are being used as a smokescreen to divert attention from the tough choices that we have to make , which is about demand management .
We no longer have the luxury of living energy wasteful lifestyles . "
We are bombarded with brands
By avoiding the High Street we consume less for leisure and more for our basic needs .
By placing less status and emotional value on the things that we buy , we free ourselves from mindless consumption , allowing us more time and money for things which we know , deep down , give us greater contentment .
I would n't advise the collective burning of our branded lives , but I guarantee that a life free from labels will not cost the earth .
Bonfire of the Brands : How I Learned to Live Without Labels , by Neil Boorman , is published by Canongate Books .
I find this article extremely hypocritcal .
This man claims to have gone ' brand free ' for a year , yet I am curious as to how he completed his online shopping for some of the articles mentioned .
Surely he would have had to use a ' branded ' computer as well as a ' branded ' computer programme in order to complete these orders .
He then he finishes the article by advertising his book - which has been published , surely , by a ' brand ' , being Canongate books .
What a waste of time and effort , when it appears to me , he did n't really achieve what he set out to do .
Kate , Hull
As a foreigner ( Australian ) , I was amazed by the consumerist lifestyle here in the UK .
It really hits you like a sledgehammer .
How on earth people can afford to have the latest phones , with their expensive plans , is beyond me .
I still have a 5 year old Nokia phone , with a pay as you go SIM , and I 'd spend maybe 2 - 4 pounds a month , at most .
And as for advertisements , I can tell you this ; we have a media centre PC , with which we record all our shows , and we watch them later .
Theres a button that allows us to skip 30 seconds in a block , and so we havent watched a single commercial in maybe 3 years of owning this marvel .
A side benefit is that whatever we watch can now be seen in 3/4 the time .
Aside from this , we use the internet quite a bit , and rather than having information pushed to us , we pull the information we 're interested in .
I rarely watch news programs , as I have next to no interest in what they 're talking about .
In short , we are a product of our environment , and if we change our environment , we will change .
Each to their own , but I have no hang ups about brands , and am happy that way .
Roberto Maietta , UK
Well done that man !
Luckily I have never felt the need the pay an obscene amount of money for a t - shirt / pair of jeans etc just to be a free advertising board for a ' designer ' ( I use the term loosely ) ... the problem is how to get my 13 yr old daughter to see it the same way .
My solution is to offer to pay the cost of an unbranded pair of jeans / shoes etc and she can upgrade at her own expense if she chooses .
It 's amazing how often the unbranded item suffices .
I 'm happy to pay good money for a well made , quality item but many branded items are not truly worth their inflated price tags .
Jude , Ballymena , N.I .
How sad .
A bit like Supersize Me , an extreme reaction to a complex problem .
The answer is not to ditch all branded goods , rather to moderate personal consumption so it is at sensible and crucially , affordable , levels .
Steve Cummins , London
Great story and what an inspiration .
Only thing that I would point out is if you are going to add the ethical dimension ( low carbon lifestyle , etc. ) as part of reason why you choose an unbranded life than you need to look more closely at supply chains of the products you purchased .
Even if they are " unbranded " does n't necessarily mean they are not flown from around the world and made in sweatshop labour conditions out of materials whose manufacture is harmful to the environment .
Would it not be worthy to reward the conscious brands who are really trying to make a difference by producing locally , using organic and sustainable materials and choosing fair trade labour to create their products ?
Mark , Derbyshire , UK
I moved to France 12 years ago for a simpler life .
No pressure in the countryside to be anything other than yourself .
No one takes any notice of what you wear , or drive .
Its very hard to find any brand names in the local shops .
Diet is almost always fresh produce , either home grown or locally bought .
Everyone says Hello to you when you enter a shop or doctors etc .
Although some supermarkets are now trying to update their image , its still possible to live a very easy laid back , comfortable stress free , life .
My daughter went to school for 5 years in France and she is not at all interested in brand names , so a lot has come from living in France .
I think more people should try Neils Brand free year .
Why should anyone PAY for a brand name , after all its YOU who are doing their advertising FOR FREE .
Complete madness .
Get Real .
lynn , charente - maritime FRANCE
I think you have far more strength and intrigue being yourself than someone who gets entranced and buys - into the false images that the advertising companies and fashion media uphold .
After all , it doesn¿t feel that big a success story to be up to your neck in debt just to have the veneer of a lifestyle .
To judge ourselves or anyone else by what brands we use and wear is ultimately sad and ' sadly ' it¿s what most people do in many ways though we may not even realise we do it .
Sizing up someone¿s mobile phone , laptop , ipod , watch , shoes , where they shop , what car they drive , even where they live etc¿ I really like what you have done here and it's interesting to see what the effects of a brand free lifestyle reveal about what¿s underneath all that consumption .
Of course the advertising agencies totally target this and know all the tricks in the book to seduce us with glossy , cool images of success , sexual attraction and status symbols .
It ¿s power to you to step out of the loop .
As if our identity is based on the labels and brands we buy then we become ¿a product¿ too , and we are just buying the dream .
And to buy the dream doesn¿t mean we really get to live it , we are just fooling ourselves ¿or being fooled .
Chris , Brighton
We have all walked into a state of zombie - fied purchasing .
This guy is an example to us all .
Lets all start to communicate again , and stop lining the pockets of the already rich and gready .
Do you really give a monkeys how many tracks you can get on your IPOD ?
Or that your mobile can take photos ?
Some people are shallow mugs , and dont know any better .
Others are venerable and conned to buy somthing ' WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT !!'oh come on , are we that stupid ???

I know that I should ignore this story about self - publicist Neil Boorman because any publicity must be good publicity if you 've got a book to flog .
But I hope enough people respond to this story with disgust .
Neil , you could have sold your goods on eBay and sent the money you raised to any one of hundreds of charities desperate to raise funds .
That would have been far greener and far more constructive .
This is just a hollow publicity stunt .
DL , London
I 'm interested to know what Neil 's definition of " branded " is .
His clothes , janitorial cleaning supplies , etc. have to have been made by someone .
Unless he's out in the barn with a sheep and a loom while his friends are mixing up some fat and lye for their bath in the river ( yes , even water is branded - Yorkshire Water ) .
Getting away from the big names that sell an image more that a product makes sense ( for some ) , but to call it " brand free " seems a bit much .
Tim , Leeds
What a pathetic case , what a waste , burning items , at least he should give them to charity and visit the poorest countries to try to live like them and cure his " condition " .
Mary , Ascot
Credit to him , but for all vast numbers of people out there who do not buy into consumerism ( which I beleive his first artical 1 year ago made no acknowledgement of , as if we were all the same ) really see this as a ' so what ? ' artical / book plug .
Status anxiety ?
Not in my head .

IT MIGHT BE…IT COULD BE…IT IS !!!
Fermilab ’s CDF scientists make it official :
They have discovered the quick - change behavior of the B - sub -s meson , which switches between matter and antimatter 3 trillion times a second .
BATAVIA , Illinois – Scientists of the CDF collaboration at the Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced today ( September 25 , 2006 ) that they have met the exacting standard to claim discovery of astonishingly rapid transitions between matter and antimatter : 3 trillion oscillations per second .
Dr. Raymond L. Orbach , Undersecretary for Science in the U.S. Department of Energy , congratulated the CDF collaboration on the result .
“ This remarkable tour de force details with exquisite precision how the antiworld is tied to our everyday realm , ” Dr. Orbach said .
“ It is a beautiful example of how , using increasingly sophisticated analysis , one can extract discovery from data from which much less was expected .
It is a triumph for Fermilab . ”
The CDF discovery of the oscillation rate , marking the final chapter in a 20 - year search , is immediately significant for two major reasons : reinforcing the validity of the Standard Model , which governs physicists ’ understanding of the fundamental particles and forces ; and narrowing down the possible forms of supersymmetry , a theory proposing that each known particle has its own more massive “ super ” partner particle .
Many experiments worldwide have worked to perform high precision measurements of the behavior of matter and antimatter , especially as it pertains to strange , charm and bottom quarks .
Scientists hope that by assembling a large number of precise measurements involving the exotic behavior of these particles , they can begin to understand why they exist , how they interact with one another and what role they played in the development of the early universe .
Most importantly , they could also be the place in which to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model , which scientists believe is incomplete .
Although none of these particles exists in nature today , they were , however , present in great abundance in the early universe .
Thus , scientists can only produce and study them at large particle accelerators .
With a talk at Fermilab on Friday , September 22 , Christoph Paus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , representing the CDF experiment , presented the discovery to the scientific community .
The experimenters acquired their data between February 2002 and January 2006 , an operating period known as Tevatron Run 2 , where tens of trillions of proton - antiproton collisions were produced at the world ’s highest - energy particle accelerator .
The results have been submitted in a paper to Physical Review Letters .
This first major discovery of Run 2 continues the tradition of particle physics discoveries at Fermilab , where the bottom ( 1977 ) and top ( 1995 ) quarks were discovered .
Surprisingly , the bizarre behavior of the B_s ( pronounced “ B sub s ” ) mesons is actually predicted by the Standard Model of fundamental particles and forces .
The discovery of this oscillatory behavior is thus another reinforcement of the Standard Model ’s durability .
“ Scientists have been pursuing this measurement for two decades , but the convergence of capabilities to make it possible has occurred just now , ” said CDF cospokesperson Jacobo Konigsberg of the University of Florida .
“ We needed to produce sufficient quantities to be able to study these particles in detail .
That condition was met by the superb performance of the Tevatron .
Then , with a process this fast , we needed extremely precise detectors and sophisticated analysis tools .
Those conditions were met at CDF , along with the skill and contributions of a great team of people . ”
CDF physicists have previously measured the rate of the matter - antimatter transitions for the B_s meson , which consists of the heavy bottom quark bound by the strong nuclear interaction to a strange antiquark .
Now they have achieved the standard for a discovery in the field of particle physics , where the probability for a false observation must be proven to be less than about 5 in 10 million ( 5/10,000,000 ) .
For CDF ’s result the probability is even smaller , at 8 in 100 million ( 8/100,000,000 ) .
“ Everyone in Fermilab ’s Accelerator Division has worked hard to create the number of collisions that were required to reach this impressive result , ” said Fermilab Director Pier Oddone .
“ We ’re glad that CDF has been able to put these efforts to such good effect .
This is one of the signature measurements for Run II , and as we collect several times the data already on hand , I have great expectations for future discoveries . ”
Determining the astonishing rate of 3 trillion oscillations per second required sophisticated analysis techniques .
CDF cospokespersons Konigsberg and Fermilab ’s Rob Roser explained that the B_s meson is a very short - lived particle .
In order to understand its underlying characteristics , scientists have to observe how each particle decays to determine its true make - up .
“ Developing the software tools to make maximal use of the information in each collision takes time and effort , ” said Roser , “ but the rewards are there in terms of discovery potential and increased level of precision . ”
Many different theoretical models of how the universe works at a fundamental level will be now be confronted with the CDF discovery .
The currently popular models of supersymmetry , for example , predict a much higher transition frequency than that observed by CDF , and those models will need to be reconsidered .
Marvin Goldberg , Division of Physics program director of the National Science Foundation , emphasized the collaborative role of the experimenters .
“ This result reminds us that discoveries in particle physics require the coherent efforts of many people as well as advanced physical infrastructure , ” Goldberg said .
“ By combining the luminosity of the Tevatron , the precision of the CDF detector and the intellectual prowess of the international CDF collaboration with sophisticated data analysis , this remarkable result from a remarkable effort will advance our understanding of the way the universe works . ”
To further advance that understanding , Roser , Konigsberg and their colleagues continue to seek phenomena that are not predicted by the Standard Model .
The prize would be a discovery of new physics .
“ While the B_s oscillation discovery was one of the benchmark results that we wanted from the Tevatron , ” said Roser , “ we still have more than half the data from Run 2 waiting to be analyzed .
We ’re looking forward to more results , and we ’re always hoping for surprises . ”
CDF is an international experiment of 700 physicists from 61 institutions and 13 countries .
It is supported by DOE , NSF and a number of international funding agencies ( the full list can be found at http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/collaboration/Funding_Agencies.html ) .
With the Tevatron , the world ’s highest - energy particle accelerator , in 1995 the CDF and DZero collaborations discovered the top quark , the final and most massive quark in the Standard Model .

WaPo story should be online soon .
http://www.washingtonpost.com
The report described the link between poverty and poor health , urged the U.S. government to help combat widespread diseases as a key aim of its foreign policy , and called on corporations to help improve health conditions in the countries where they operate .
A copy of the report was obtained by The Washington Post .
Three people directly involved in its preparation said its publication was blocked by William R. Steiger , a specialist in education and a scholar of Latin American history whose family has long ties to President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Since 2001 , Steiger has run the Office of Global Health Affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services .
Wishing it not so .
Maybe it is just me , because as a journalist I often have to report stuff I WISH were n't true .
Even global warming , for instance .
I truly wish it was n't true .
It would be one less thing to worry about .
But unlike the right wingers , who choose to wish it away and presto- chango , it is n't happening , I feel I have to base my reporting on reality .
On facts .
On evidence .
So sadly , I think the evidence is clear that global warming is real and largely caused by human activity .
The Bush administration , of course , acts exactly the opposite .
Despite having a responsibility to GOVERN and base policies on actual data and reality ; despite having a responsibility to listen to scientists and experts in various fields of public policy , they will instead gag any message from such real authorities if the message does not suit their political agenda .
So it is , that we again find the Bush administration deep - sixing a report from the Surgeon General for political reasons .
Not based on reality -- just their own self interest .
A political hack with no expertise on such matters simply cans the report , cans the inconvenient truth .
To call that irresponsible is being perhaps too polite .
It is lying by omission , in a way .
More from WaPo :
The draft report itself , in language linking public health problems with violence and other social ills , says ``we cannot overstate ... that problems in remote parts of the globe can no longer be ignored .
Diseases that Americans once read about as affecting people in regions ... most of us would never visit are now capable of reaching us directly .
The hunger , disease , and death resulting from poor food and nutrition create social and political instability ... and that instability may spread to other nations as people migrate to survive . ''
In 65 pages , the report charts trends in infectious and chronic disease ; reviews efforts to curb AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria ; calls for the careful monitoring of public health to safeguard against bioterrorism ; and explains the importance of proper nutrition , childhood immunizations and clean air and water , among other topics .
Its underlying message is that disease and suffering do not respect political boundaries in an era of globalization and mass population movements .
...
The report calls on the administration to consider spending more money on global health improvement , for instance .
And it warns that ``the environmental conditions that poison our water and contaminate our air are not contained within national boundaries .
...
The use of pesticides is also of concern to health officials , scientists and government leaders around the world . ''
And aside from Surgeon General Carmona 's report , we have this :
http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
With the active encouragement of the Bush administration , U.S. scientists in the past year have developed several methods for creating embryonic stem cells without having to destroy human embryos .
But some who now wish to test their alternatively derived cells have found themselves stymied by an unexpected barrier : President Bush 's stem cell policy .
The 2001 policy says that federal funds may not be used to study embryonic stem cells created after Aug. 9 of that year .
It is based on the assumption that the only way to make the cells is by destroying human embryos -- a truism in 2001 but not any longer .
As a result , the National Institutes of Health recently refused to consider a grant application for what would have been the first federal study to compare several of the new , less politically contentious stem cell lines .
The Bush mantra :
Do n't let facts get in the way of your policies .
P.S. ;
Hope you guys did n't miss me .
I have n't filed a diary in some time .

With hindsight , retired police officer Charles Bostock knows exactly when he fell victim to
his wife ’s staggering betrayal .
" Sarah started pestering me for sex after a long period of little physical contact , " he says .
" I remember thinking she was trying to be a
loving wife , but now I realise she was covering
her tracks because she knew she was pregnant
by someone else - for the first time . "
Back then , however , Charles had little reason
to think anything was amiss .
The couple already had two children together and went on to have four more , sharing what seemed a
blessed life on a rambling property in the West
Country .
He had always , he says , taken
immense pride in his role as a loving father .
But when Sarah fell pregnant for the seventh
time five years ago , his life imploded .
Charles knew with devastating certainty that he could not be the father - for by then the couple had not had a sexual relationship for some months .
After a bitter confrontation , his wife confessed
that the pregnancy was the result of a one - night
stand .
Terrible enough after a long marriage , you may think .
But worse was to come .
Last year , DNA tests ordered by his wife
revealed that Charles was not the father of his
four youngest children either .
They were the product of a secret 14 - year affair his wife had been conducting with local businessman Richard Mills - the same man who had fathered her seventh child .
Sarah , 49 , had known all along , but callously
allowed her husband to believe they were his .
The discovery has sent shockwaves through
the heart of the family .
The two eldest , Alison , now 26 , and 24 - year - old Charles junior , have left home .
But the four younger children who Charles also thought were his - now aged 12 , ten , nine and six - live with their mother in the former
Charles , meanwhile , has been forced to move out , and is facing his 70th birthday with only with his memories for company .
" Richard is beneath my contempt , but
it ’s Sarah I really blame , " he says .
" I now
know she used me to raise her children .
" If she ’d had the courage to tell me the truth at the start , I could have had a chance of rebuilding my life .
Instead , she chose to continue her deception over the years .
" I gave her a home , children and a decent standard of life , and this is how she repaid me .
The only way I can deal with it is to tell myself she ’s ill . "
But if you were expecting remorse from his former wife , you would be disappointed .
Instead , Sarah Bostock claims she was only ever thinking of her family .
" I made a deliberate decision to have
children by my lover and I would do it
again if I had to , " she said this week .
" As far as I ’m concerned I was trying to
do the right thing by the family by keeping us all together .
" If I was a selfish woman I would have left years ago , but I felt it was better for all the children to try to maintain status quo - not that it was n’t terribly hard at times .
But I have always tried to put their best interests first . "
Its an astonishing sentiment - but for Charles Bostock , nothing much comes as a surprise now .
Today , his cramped council home in Bodmin ,
Cornnwall , is a far cry from the sixbedroom detached house a few miles away .
Together with his wife , Charles , a former Metropolitan police officer , moved there in the mid-Eighties from Surrey after an accident on his police motorbike , which meant he had to be
pensioned out of the force .
" The move was Sarah ’s idea actually , " he recalls .
" We had had happy times here on holiday and as nothing was tying us to Surrey it seemed like a good . "
The couple met at a party held by a mutual friend and married in Woking 1979 following a two - year courtship .
Despite the near 20 - year age gap , Charles believes they were happy .
" The age gap never bothered either of us , "
he says .
" It was barely mentioned . "
Two children , Alison and Charles , quickly
followed .
" We had the typical family life — the
children , dogs , a cat , " Charles reflects .
" Sarah stayed at home while I got a job working as a council manager .
We were happy . "
Not , however , according to Sarah , who defended her actions by attacking Charles ’s qualities as a husband .
" He did provide for us , yes , but what he did n’t give me was any fun , or affection , or real attention .
He never wanted to go out and do
anything . "
An excuse for tricking him into raising another man ’s four children ?
Few would think so .
Nevertheless , apparently without qualms , in 1989 Sarah began her affair with Richard Mills , who
she met while taking her children swimming .
Like Sarah , Richard , now 46 , was married with two children .
The two quickly became lovers - while agreeing , according to Sarah , that neither would leave
their spouses .
" Richard had two young children and so did I .
We enjoyed the excitement and lust and although there were deeper feelings , too , we made a
point of not discussing them , " she says .
" What was the point ?
We were committed to our respective domestic situations .
Much as I would have liked to get out , I did n’t envisage leaving
Charles because I did n’t want to upset the kids . "
How ironic , then , that within a couple of years Sarah admits that she took the selfish decision to actively started trying for a baby with her lover .
" I was very broody and wanted Richard ’s baby , " she says .
" He said it was n’t sensible but I went for it
anyway .
I instinctively knew that he would be fine with it and I was so desperate to have his child that I was prepared to take the risk .
" To be honest , Charles did n’t even come into it .
I remember thinking I had to do something for my own happiness . "
By 1993 , Sarah had achieved her goal .
She was pregnant .
It was at this point that she made the
decision to " cover her tracks " and recommence what had been a sparse sexual partnership
with her husband in order to facilitate the idea that the child was his .
" I do n’t deny it was calculating , " she says .
" In a funny way everyone was happy .
Charles
and I had discussed the idea of having more children . "
A daughter , now 12 , was born in 1994 , followed in quick succession by another three children - a son and two more daughters .
" People ask me now if I had any idea what was going on but it ’s so easy to miss the signs , " says Charles .
" All the children took after their mother , so I never I suspected a thing - why would I ?
" Life was busy , I had a full - time job and a house full of kids .
I would n’t say Sarah and I had an amazing relationship but it was n’t bad , and I was perfectly content . "
Sarah , meanwhile , continued to meet her lover in secret , sometimes even taking the younger children with her .
She introduced their biological father as " Mummy ’s friend " .
Who knows how long this bizarre deception might have continued had the Bostocks ’ domestic situation not come to a head in 2002 when Charles discovered Sarah was three months
pregnant with what would be her seventh child .
This time , he knew there was no chance the baby could be his as the couple had not had sexual relations for nine months .
" Even then she tried to pretend , " says Charles angrily .
" She said she ’d had sex with me while I was asleep - it was rubbish .
I felt completely numb .
" I pressed her to tell me who the father was , but she refused .
I did n’t know what to do - I did n’t want to abandon my kids but it was also
obvious the marriage was at an end . "
After consulting a solicitor , a separation order was drawn up which allowed Charles to occupy a room in the house while Sarah and the children lived in the rest .
In another ironic stroke , it was also agreed that he would pay £ 400 - amonth maintenance for ‘ his ’ four young children .
Only towards the end of the pregnancy , Charles maintains , did Sarah finally admit he was n’t the father of the imminent arrival .
" She claimed it was a one - night stand and that the father did n’t want to know , " he says .
" Later I got an anonymous phone call telling
me it was a man called Richard Mills .
But Sarah did not react when I confronted her with the name .
" Then , when the baby girl was born in 2002 , I did n’t think I would want anything to do with her , but she was such a lovely little thing .
I decided that if Sarah would let me , I would bring her up as one of ours .
" As far as I was concerned she had no contact with the baby ’s father and there was a chance we could have a fresh start . "
If he felt optimistic , however , he was mistaken .
" One night when the baby was a few months old Sarah came home and said she did n’t want a fresh start , she wanted me out , " says Charles .
" I was flabbergasted .
I had tried to do the
right thing , this was my home too , and
she was ordering me out . "
When he refused , battle commenced .
" Suddenly there were no secrets any more .
Sarah boasted about her lover , saying I was washed - up while he was virile and rich .
" She was trying to provoke me into leaving , but I had paid for this house and my family were
there .
" I did n’t see why I should leave .
I just could n’t believe what was happening to me . "
But Sarah claims her husband became verbally abusive towards her .
" When he talks of being a loving father
it makes me laugh , " she insists .
Charles furiously denies her accusations , saying that though there were fierce arguments in the house , as often as not , he insists , they were
started by his wife .
He also categorically denies any violence but says Sarah called the police to the house on three occasions claiming he was being violent as part of a strategy to get him out .
The police discovered nothing amiss .
By spring 2005 , circumstances had become intolerable and after receiving an Occupation Order , which he did not contest because he says he had lost the will by that point , Charles was forced to leave the marital home , moving into
a former council house with his eldest son Charles .
" It was a horrible transition .
Overnight , I ’d gone from seeing my kids all the time to seeing them once a week when Sarah could be bothered to drop them off . "
If that was hard to swallow , however , there was a final bombshell which made him realise
that much of his family life had been a lie .
Last summer , Charles was told by his 12 - year - old daughter that she and the other children had had swabs taken by Richard .
" I was baffled and immediately rang my solicitor to get him to find out what was going on .
A few weeks later the children came to see me again and the eldest told me : ‘ You are n’t our father .
Richard is '. "
The same day , Charles ’s solicitor confirmed his worst fears .
" I was devastated .
How do you cope with news like that ? "
Desperately hoping there had been a mistake , Charles ordered separate tests , which confirmed he was not the father of four of the
children he ’d raised as his own .
" In just one moment I stopped being Dad to my kids .
They are confused , and at the moment I
barely see them .
" The 12 - year - old refuses point blank to see me at all as she believes I deliberately lied to
her about not being her dad . "
Sarah , however , remains unrepentant .
" When we told the children they took it really well .
My fifth child by Richard already knew
who her father was , while the others seemed relatively unfazed by the news .
" I ’m lucky in that my kids are happy and well - adjusted .
They are all doing brilliantly at
school . "
But is it really that simple ?
Meanwhile , not content to stop at seven children , Sarah has gone on to have another baby by Mills , a boy now five - months - old .
While in another twist to the tale , Mr Mills
has been publicly accused of having affairs with two other women - claims he denies .
Finally divorced from Charles , Sarah remains in the marital home , although it is due to be sold
as part of the financial settlement , with Sarah receiving 61 per cent of the proceeds .
Richard Mills is also now divorced , although he has not yet moved in fully with Sarah .
" I did n’t want to force him on the children so he stays two or three nights a week as well as
during the day when he has the chance , " she says .
" But we do plan to live together as a family . "
That he is living only part - time with Sarah is but cold comfort to Charles Bostock .
" He is still in my house , bringing up the children I consider to be mine , while I live in a council house with my eldest son .
" It ’s hard for him and my daughter Alison because they feel torn .
They are horrified by what their mother did but do n’t want to cut her out of their lives completely .
" What she has done has affected so many lives . "
It is impossible to disagree .
Unusual Pet Products For Pampered Pets
Do you spend on your pet ?
I used to think that it was silly ( or even crazy ) to spoil a pet like you would a person , until I found a pet that really connected with me .
At that point , we fell into the clutches of the pet product industry and bought into toys and trinkets that we thought would make our cat happy .
But I ’ve also always assumed that perhaps , if your pet could talk , he ’ll tell you that he just wants a simple life that consists of basic meals , nice romps in the sunshine and a dry spot on the ground for when he rests .
But then again , this is America , the land of the $ 40 billion dollar a year pet industry .
Here is some eye bugging info about the business of pets ( from MSNBC ) :
Facts About The Pet Industry
63 % of U.S. households own a pet .
The most popular pets ( by population size ) : cats , dogs , then fish .
Followed by ferrets and the rest .
Over 60 % of pet owners have no kids .
Hence , they tend to treat their pets like their own children .
Spending on pets have increased because of demographics , better marketing and a more affluent client base .
Some 56 percent of dog owners and 42 percent of cat owners buy their pets Christmas presents .
63 percent of cat owners and 42 percent of dog owners sleep with their pets .
Veterinarians say obesity is the greatest health threat facing America ’s pets , with at least a quarter of the population overweight ( that compares with a 30 percent obesity rate in American adults ) .
Be careful with what you feed your pets .
Altering their diets with human food can be harmful to their health .
Spending figures between 2002 and 2004 show that while household spending on pets increased 18 % after inflation , toy sales dropped 25 % , spending on day - care centers fell 15 % , and spending on children ’s clothes was down 15 % .
So what makes the pet industry so successful ?
Let ’s take a look at a few products .
I ’d be very impressed if you can identify what these are :
Answer : Eye implants for the sight - challenged animals in your life .
and how about these ?
Answer : Implants for your neutered pet .

This device was attached to the collar to help you keep in touch with your pet .
It was supposed to help in the remote chance your pet got lost while wearing this thing so that somebody can just easily call back using the “ phone ” .
It was a glorified id charm and one way walkie talkie in one .
When it was available for sale , the phone was priced around $ 300 with a monthly calling plan that cost around $ 15 .
Given that it was a strange and expensive product , I ’m not surprised that the business went under .

Other Pet Products I ’ve Encountered ?
There ’s so much more out there , including pet apparel and jewelry , small animal carriers , perfumes of all sorts , fancy water , organic gourmet food and even diet pills !
After seeing all the stuff and services that cater to living things of the non-human kind , I ’m both bewildered and impressed by this burgeoning business .
The truth is , I do n’t even buy the counterparts to most of these products for myself or my kids .
But I can see how tempting it is for pet owners to want to indulge their “ children ” .
Now you know how some of us are oiling this economy !

If you watched the History Channel ' 9/11 Conspiracies ' show last night , you may have noticed how right off the bat they went for the old guilt by association method of associating truthers with the practically nonexistent " Jews did it " crowd .
What you may have missed is that in the end of the segment they do a slow zoom into a website in an " evil type way " , with the implication it was a truther website , which says " JEWS DID WTC " and flashes Stars of David , the twin towers , and other 9/11 related pictures .
What they did n't mention was that this site is a ytmnd parody site !
You can see the site right here : http://jewswtc.ytmnd.com/.
The history channel is so desperate to slander 9/11 truth that they actually attempted to link the movement to a ridiculous ytmnd parody site !
Talk about desperation !
July 10 , 2007  -- Republican Louisiana Sen. David Vitter , whose phone number was linked to Deborah Jeane Palfrey , the so - called " D.C. Madam , " says that he is sorry for a " serious sin " and that he has already made peace with his wife .
Palfrey is awaiting trial on racketeering charges related to a prostitution ring she allegedly ran .
" This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am , of course , completely responsible , " Vitter said Monday evening in a printed statement .
" Several years ago , I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling .
Out of respect for my family , I will keep my discussion of the matter there with God and them .
But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . "
Until his disclosure Monday , Vitter had been a rising star in the Republican social conservative movement .
" I do n't believe there 's any issue that 's more important than this one , " Vitter said in June 2006 , about the importance of a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
" I think this debate is very healthy , and it 's winning a lot of hearts and minds .
I think we 're going to show real progress . "
At another time , speaking at the Lafayette Parish Republican Executive Committee luncheon , Vitter compared same - sex marriage to hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
" David Vitter is dedicated to making life better for his young family and all Louisiana families , " reads the first line of his official biography .
Presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani eagerly used Vitter to vouch for his credentials , to write Op - Eds and to serve as a surrogate selling him to social conservatives .
" Obviously , I disagree with Rudy on some significant social issues and these are very important to me and to many people I represent , " Vitter said during his March 12 endorsement of the former New York Mayor .
" But after numerous personal meetings with the mayor , it 's very clear to me that he 's not running for president to advance any liberal social agenda . "
" Like all parents , Wendy and I , our top concerns are our children , " Vitter said , referring to his three daughters , Sophie , Lise and Airey , and son , Jack .
" And even with all the international threats we face from al Qaeda to Iran to North Korea , we 'll sleep very soundly at night with Rudy in the White House . "
A product of Harvard , Tulane Law School and the Rhodes Scholars , Vitter was elected to the Louisiana Statehouse to succeed former Klansman David Duke in 1991 ; there he successfully pushed through term - limits legislation .
In 1999 , after designated House Speaker Rep. Bob Livingston , R - La. , abruptly resigned after disclosures of numerous affairs , Vitter successfully ran to succeed him representing suburban New Orleans .
Asked whether she could forgive her husband after an extramarital affair , as Livingston 's wife had done , Wendy Vitter told the Times - Picayune : " I 'm a lot more like Lorena Bobbitt than Hillary [ Clinton ] .
If he does something like that , I 'm walking away with one thing , and it's not alimony , trust me . "
Vitter quickly became the Louisiana delegation 's most conservative member — against abortion even in cases of rape and incest and against gambling — and he secured power through his seat on the House Appropriations Committee .
There were whispers about Vitter having an affair with a prostitute around the time he was contemplating a gubernatorial run in 2002 , but nothing ever was reported in the mainstream media .
In May 2002 , he opted out of that race , announcing that he and Wendy had entered counseling because of the " cumulative stress from working in a high - pressure job , living in two cities , building a house , raising four young kids including a newborn , having our campaign activities based at home and traveling the state considering a run for governor .

But the next year , after Sen. John Breaux , D - La. , announced in 2003 that he would n't seek re-election , Vitter within days announced he would run to succeed him , and the national GOP did everything it could to clear the way for the man who said he represented " mainstream Louisiana values . "
With President Bush running strong on top of the ticket — and Vitter winning his home parish by a 5 - 1 ratio over his chief opponent Rep. Chris John , D - La. —
Vitter avoided the state 's odd runoff process by securing more than 50 percent of the vote .
On Aug. 30 , 2005 , the day after Hurricane Katrina hit , Vitter erroneously told the public that , " In the metropolitan area in general , in the huge majority of areas , [ the water is ] not rising at all .
It 's the same or it may be lowering slightly .
In some parts of New Orleans , because of the 17th Street breach , it may be rising and that seemed to be the case in parts of downtown .
I do n't want to alarm everybody that , you know , New Orleans is filling up like a bowl .
That 's just not happening . "
He has perhaps been best known nationally for criticizing the federal government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , opposing Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers , fighting for the Federal Marriage Amendment and endorsing Giuliani .
Physicists at the University of Pittsburgh have demonstrated a new form of matter that melds the characteristics of lasers with those of the world 's best electrical conductors - superconductors .
The work introduces a new method of moving energy from one point to another as well as a low - energy means of producing a light beam like that from a laser .
The Pitt researchers and their collaborators at the Bell Labs of Alcatel - Lucent in New Jersey detail the process in the May 18 issue of the journal Science .
The new state is a solid filled with a collection of energy particles known as polaritons that have been trapped and slowed , explained lead investigator David Snoke , an associate professor in the physics and astronomy department in Pitt 's School of Arts and Sciences .
Snoke worked with Pitt graduate students Ryan Balili and Vincent Hartwell on the project .
Using specially designed optical structures with nanometer - thick layers - which allow polaritons to move freely inside the solid - Snoke and his colleagues captured the polaritons in the form of a superfluid .
In superfluids and in their solid counterparts , superconductors , matter consolidates to act as a single energy wave rather than as individual particles .
In superconductors , this allows for the perfect flow of electricity .
In the new state of matter demonstrated at Pitt - which can be called a polariton superfluid - the wave behavior leads to a pure light beam similar to that from a laser but is much more energy efficient .
Traditional superfluids and superconductors require extremely low temperatures , approximately negative 280 and negative 450 degrees Fahrenheit for a superconductor and superfluid , respectively .
The polariton superfluid is more stable at higher temperatures , and may be capable of being demonstrated at room temperature in the near future .
The Pitt research builds on current efforts in physics laboratories around the world to create materials , which mix the characteristics of superconductors and lasers .
Snoke 's work provides a new method to trap and manipulate the energy particles .
Applied to technology , this technique could provide new ways of controlled transfer of optical signals through solid matter .
Snoke 's polariton trap was devised with a technique similar to that used for superfluids made of atoms in a gaseous state known as the Bose - Einstein condensate .
Three scientists shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for producing the condensate .

It may be that I just attract rude people , the way others attract eccentrics or wet paint .
But I do n't think so .
I think life 's getting ruder .
When you get to that point where the rudeness of everyday life is constantly amazing , you have two choices : you can shut up about it , for fear that you 'll expose yourself as a cardigan - wearing fusspot , or you can expose yourself as a cardigan - wearing fusspot .
So here goes .
Manners today are a disgrace .
Look around .
Stand in the street until a group of people sauntering four abreast blithely drives you into the gutter .
Wait by your phone until someone calls to wheedle some dough out of you at dinner - time and then hangs up before you 've finished saying " No thank . . . "
There are shelves full of books in the bookshops about manners and rudeness , which suggests that there 's either an epidemic of incivility , or a resurgent concern for social delicacies , which does n't seem likely .
We all know it 's happening .
Even John Howard knows it .
Like a dismayed patriarch , he has repeatedly expressed his alarm at the vulgarity and diminishing civility of public life .
Manners evolve organically ; good manners are defined by an unwritten code .
That 's why they have to be taught , demonstrated , absorbed .
It usually starts in the home .
Or not , as they case may be .
In her book Talk to the Hand , English author Lynne Truss tells the story of a documentary maker who was talking to a class of children about the concept of apology .
" Children , " she said , " in every family home , there 's a word which people find really hard to say to each other .
It ends in 'y ' .
Can anyone tell me what it is ? "
There was a pause , Truss writes , " while everyone racked their brains , and then someone called out , ' buggery ? ' "
TECHNOLOGY usually gets the blame for incivility .
Mobile phones , MySpace , the Blackberry tempo of daily life .
Each new gadget automates our lives further , seals our networked social pod from the mess and BO and delays of other people .
Technology lets us spend most of our days in a virtual space inhabited only by our contacts and friends .
So when we get out into the street and find ourselves f2f with people we do n't know - omg !
- we find ourselves floundering for rusty social graces , like long - forgotten dance steps .
No doubt the speed of change has outpaced the gradual social consensus which dictates courteous behaviour .
My ear still recalls the day my father nearly yanked it off my head when I failed to stand up to greet an adult ; today , standing up when someone comes into the room is naff .
In my circles , anyway .
To offer your tram seat to that probably pregnant woman , or not ?
That is the question .
Or maybe this is the question :
How much decorum do we want in public life ?
When Tony Abbott informed Lateline viewers the other week that " shit happens " he was probably hoping to hit a note of likeable frankness .
Instead , he sounded like a potty - mouth .
But blaming confusion about manners for incivility does n't wash .
To be confounded by modern manners you first have to care enough to wonder about them .
The fact is , cars pre-dated road rage by nearly a century .
It 's not cars or phones that make selfish idiots jabber on the mobile while they 're driving one - handed .
It 's selfish idiots .
If we 're so confused about how we should behave , why is it that we know perfectly well how everyone else should behave ?
They should get out of the way .
They should never presume to tell us how to behave .
They should treat us with respect .
Clearly , this is n't a golden age for courtesy .
Please , thank you , sorry : there 's a sense now that old magic words are for fogeys , the dull , the slow - laners .
The very idea of saying sorry seemed to disgust Alexander Downer last week when asked if Kevin Andrews should apologise over the Haneef case .
What do you want him to do , Mr Downer mocked the press pack , " fall on the ground and grovel ?
Eat dirt ?
Come on , get real . "
Yes , let 's get real .
We do n't aspire to the quietly honourable life now .
We want the big life , the movie life , a life so grand and busy that anyone who is n't useful or part of our circle is either invisible or in the way .
Some blame the spirit of the free market for this plague of solipsism , as Peter Saunders notes in his 2006 article , " Do n't Blame Howard for Decline of Civility " .
In fact , markets generate civility .
Or that 's the theory .
Adam Smith explained all this two centuries ago , apparently .
" For strangers to trade with each other , " Saunders writes , " they must be able to trust one another .
Shared norms of behaviour emerge to make transactions between individuals possible . "
But when there 's no pecuniary interest - when we 're dealing with strangers on the street , or the train or the cinema - what 's the point ?
In the deregulated environment of social behaviour , manners are elective .
And it 's not clear what you get by choosing them .
The reality is that manners have been slipping since they were invented .
Letting them slip is a way of expressing contempt for the suffocating rules of the past .
And this can be a good thing .
Manners , in the form of etiquette , used to be a subtle way of reinforcing social hierarchies .
Formal etiquette is all but dead now , and I suspect that few people miss it .
Anyway , we secretly like a bit of rudeness .
We tend to delight in the hideous ways other people behave , as long as we are not the object of the behaviour .
In Fawlty Towers , Basil 's un - self - censored spleen was delicious because it crashed through taboos , and it felt freeing .
Now , we are free to behave as badly as we like .
The trouble with that is , as the philosopher John Rawls put it , " if liberties are left unrestricted they collide with one another " .
Individual freedoms always exist in delicate balance with the constraining counterforce of the freedoms of all the other individuals .
So there 's a lot of colliding , in which the brash and powerful tend to prosper .
One day at the MCG , a friend and I were wedged in standing room in front of the loudest guy I 've ever heard at the football .
I could actually feel my skull vibrating every time this bloke erupted .
My friend finally turned around to explain that he had an ear infection and wondered whether the fellow would mind toning it down a tad .
The guy 's eyeballs bulged .
He was briefly too stunned to speak .
But only briefly .
There followed a fluent burst of C and F words in which his reply gradually became clear - " No " .
The argument was won by he who was prepared to shout loudest , and to back it up with the plausible threat of a kick to the head .
We know that basic civility lies somewhere on a continuum , at one end of which lies anti-social behaviour and even violence .
But basic manners in public might be important for a more fundamental reason .
Perhaps they 're crucial to the egalitarianism at the heart of our nationhood .
" Australian egalitarianism , " writes historian John Hirst in Sense and Nonsense in Australian History , " turns on the way Australians blot out differences when people meet face to face .
They talk to each other as if they are equals . . . "
PEOPLE started calling each other " mate " on the goldfields because everyone was so grimy that you could n't determine a man 's status from the quality or condition of his get - up .
It caught on ; Australians liked it .
This " democracy of manners " was a precious achievement for our nation , Hirst argues .
" One of the reasons people fought for democracy was that they wanted respect for ordinary people , that they should not be humiliated and scorned . "
This makes stirring good sense to me .
Establishing a civic ambience in which the least privileged are protected from scorn seems worthwhile .
Because when someone is not worthy of basic courtesy , they 're hardly entitled to occupy a place in a queue , either .
Or to that seat on the train where your briefcase already is .
Often it 's a simple matter of tone .
Think of the signs on letterboxes that say " No Junk Mail ! "
Who do they think they 're talking to , those letterboxes , with that insolent exclamation mark unsoftened by " please " or " thanks " ?
The schmuck who has a job so lowly he or she stuffs letterboxes and does n't merit a simple " please " ?
When I was that schmuck a few years back , I made a point of respecting the stated wishes of " Please No Unsolicited Mail " boxes and stuffing " No Junk Mail ! " ones to the brim with any stray papers , lolly wraps and leaves I could find .
The way we speak to strangers in public is still crucial to this democracy of manners .
But we 're getting less and less formal , and informality is a particular problem in dealing with strangers , since so many of us exist in a state of permanent anxiety about whether our ( anxiously ) lofty idea of ourselves is shared by others .
The other day I was in a bottle shop .
I took my purchase to the counter where the guy was waiting .
He said , " Just that today , matey ? "
Maybe I was having a bad day , but I do n't like being called " matey " , especially by someone who is not my mate , and especially when I 'm the one paying .
" Yes . "
I said , nodding .
I thought about it .
" Thanks , champ . "
Pretty pleased I was with that , too : a subtle slap of the goatskin gloves .
He knew what I 'd done ; he knew I 'd popped him back in his place .
" There you go , " he said , dropping my change on the counter and looking right at me .
" Tiger . " I blinked .
Tiger ?
Who the hell did he think he was talking to ?
I left , defeated and fuming .
Later , a friend of mine , whose milieu ( building sites , gentlemen 's clubs ) makes him an expert in male braggadocio , confirmed what I already knew .
I 'd effectively been turkey - slapped .
" Tiger " is the lowest .
A duel with pistols would have been more dignified .
WHEN we do n't know how to talk to strangers in public , it 's easier not to try .
At a local coffee shop , there 's a sign which says : " Please do not ask us to warm babies ' bottles as our response may offend you . "
Too late - I 'm already offended .
Where did the management assume the right to be rude when faced with a perfectly reasonable request ?
Signs like this are spreading , and I think they may well be a sign of our system of civility on the edge of collapse .
It 's as if we 've lost faith in our ability to negotiate the norms of civility .
Easier to go the knowing wink : " Smile , you 're on camera ! "
Or dash off a splenetic note - like the anonymous person who leaves rude notes on car windscreens on my street , choice edicts such as , " Park between the lines you selfish f*&^ing idiot !!! " - and set the world to rights that way .
No , if we 're all going to rub along in this age of self - actualisation , we need to get talking to one another again .
And the magic words are all we 've got to work with .
I insist my kids use them , even though " excuse me " and " thank you " are meaningless to very young children .
To a toddler , sticking " please " on the front of a request is purely arbitrary .
You might as well ask them to tap their nose twice while blowing a raspberry .
But eventually they might realise that " please " and " thank you " signify something meaningful : the recognition of the selfhood and autonomy of others .
When you say thank you , you recognise that the person you 're thanking did n't have to do what they did for you , whether it was passing the jam or selling you a ticket .
There was a sign in the stairwell at a friendly little Hong Kong flea pit I stayed in once : " Please do not shit on the stairs .
Thank you , The Management . "
At first I thought this was a choice example of delightfully goofed English spelling ; then , shortly after , I had an unforgettable encounter in the stairs with a fresh human turd .
Still , this is a noble sign , I think .
In its elegantly polite wording , it accepts that all of us have our own needs , preoccupations and dignity ; it simply asks that we remember that everyone else does , too , even if the evidence suggests that some users of the stairs either could n't read or chose to ignore it .
We have to put up with one another , after all ; it 'll be easier if we all try to be nice about it .
US Senate censure of MoveOn.org :
An attack on free speech in the service of militarism
By Bill Van Auken
22 September 2007
The US Senate ’s 72 - to - 25 vote in favor of a resolution condemning the liberal antiwar group MoveOn.org for publishing a newspaper ad questioning the credibility of Iraq war commander Gen .
David Petraeus represents a chilling attack on freedom of speech and a further undermining of the bedrock constitutional principle that subordinates the military to democratic civilian control .
The vote follows two weeks of agitation by the Republican right over the ad , which appeared in the New York Times on the eve of congressional testimony given by General Petraeus and Ryan Crocker , the American ambassador in Baghdad , defending the Bush administration ’s military surge , which has sent an additional 30,000 US troops into the war in Iraq .
Republican lawmakers took to the floor in the House and Senate , brandishing copies of the ad and demanding that the Democrats repudiate it .
Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani took out his own ad in the Times , extolling Petraeus ’s record and attacking Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton for failing to rebuke MoveOn.org .
Not to be outdone , Giuliani ’s Republican rival , Senator John McCain , expressed the opinion that the liberal lobbying group should “ be thrown out of the country . ”
Finally , on the same day that the Senate approved the resolution , President Bush declared at a White House press conference that the MoveOn.org ad was “ disgusting ” and attacked the Democrats for failing to denounce it .
Most Democrats , he declared “ are afraid of irritating a left - wing group like MoveOn.org — or more afraid of irritating them than they are of irritating the United States military . ”
The vote in the Senate , however , proved Bush ’s accusation against the Democrats completely wrong .
In the end , virtually every Democrat in the Senate cowered before the military , voting in favor of one of two resolutions defending Petraeus and condemning the MoveOn.org ad .
The first of these was approved by an overwhelming , 72 - to - 25 vote , with as many Democrats voting for it or abstaining as voting against .
Among those who abstained were Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
This bill “ strongly condemns ” the MoveOn.org ad , declaring that it “ impugns the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all the members of the United States Armed Forces , ” while citing at great length the US commander ’s military record .
The second measure , which failed , was a slightly watered - down version of this act of censure , offered by California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer .
Its stated purpose was to “ strongly condemn all attacks on the honor , integrity and patriotism of any individual who is serving or has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces , by any person or organization . ”
It endorsed the condemnation of the MoveOn.org ad , but added that Republican - backed attack ads , such as the Swiftboat Veterans ’ campaign against Democratic 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry and right - wing attacks on former Georgia Senator Max Cleland , who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam , should also be repudiated .
All but two Senate Democrats — Biden , who again abstained , and Wisconsin Senator Russell Feingold , who voted “ no ” — supported this measure .
The phony furor whipped up over the newspaper ad served largely as a distraction from the Republican support for continuing unchanged a criminal war in Iraq that is opposed by a large majority of the US population .
It also served to divert attention , if only momentarily , from the abject failure of the Democratic majority in both the House and Senate to enact a single piece of legislation altering the course of the war .
The Senate on Friday ended the week of debate that followed the Petraeus - Crocker report with the defeat of an amendment to the Pentagon appropriations bill sponsored by Democratic senators Carl Levin ( Michigan ) and Jack Reed ( Rhode Island ) calling for the “ redeployment ” of a portion of the present US occupation force within nine months .
Like other Democratic “ antiwar ” proposals , the measure envisioned tens of thousands of US troops remaining in Iraq to continue the suppression of national resistance and secure US interests in the region .
Nonetheless , the bill went down to defeat , with only 47 Senators voting in favor , 13 short of the 60 needed to secure a straight up - or - down floor vote .
Three Democrats ( as well as the so - called independent Democrat Joseph Lieberman ) joined Republicans in opposing the measure .
The defeat followed the overwhelming rejection Thursday of a bill sponsored by Senator Feingold that would “ transition the mission ” of US troops in Iraq by June of 2008 , withdrawing some forces while continuing to fund a US military presence in Iraq that would supposedly be limited to “ counterterrorism ” operations , protecting American assets and training Iraqi puppet forces .
This measure picked up only 28 votes .
Finally , there was the failure Wednesday of the Democratic Senate leadership to secure passage of a bill that they had touted as their best chance for success .
Sponsored by Senator James Webb ( Democrat of Virginia ) , it demanded that troops returning from Iraq be given “ dwell time ” at their home bases equal to the length of their combat deployment .
The proposal was supported by 56 senators , including six Republicans , leaving it four shy of the 60 votes needed to cut off debate and proceed to a floor vote .
The string of defeats signals the end of the Democratic Party leadership ’s false pretense that it is seeking to legislate an end to the war .
This claim is belied by the fact that from the outset this leadership has ruled out the use of the only power that Congress has to end war : the cutting off of military funding .
Now , Levin and others are reportedly preparing a new round of meaningless legislation that would include “ goals ” for withdrawal , with no binding power over the actions of the White House .
While serving largely as a political diversion , the MoveOn.org controversy nonetheless has grave political implications .
For the overwhelming majority of the US Senate to support resolutions condemning political speech in the name of upholding the “ honor , integrity and patriotism ” of the US military amounts to telling the population to keep their mouths shut and defer to the authority of the generals .
A Republican member of the House , Thomas Davis of Virginia , has taken this approach to its logical conclusion , calling for the convening of McCarthyite - style hearings on the politics of MoveOn.org .
The facts of the case , however , substantiate the substantive charges made against Petraeus in MoveOn.org ’s ad .
It said he was “ cooking the books for the White House ” in order to claim that the escalation of the US intervention in Iraq has produced “ progress ” and a reduction of violence .
It went on to cite the numerous independent reports indicating that the civilian death toll has actually mounted .
The thrust of the attacks on the ad have centered on its headline : “ General Petraeus or General Betray US ? ” which has been portrayed as an unconscionable attack on the unimpeachable record of a great military commander as well as an attack on every member of the armed forces .
The reality , of course , is that Petraeus is directing a criminal , colonial - style war against the Iraqi people that has produced untold killings and suffering .
While the Senate staged its obscene debate over a newspaper ad , the Iraqi authorities were still counting casualties from last Sunday ’s massacre by Blackwater mercenaries in central Baghdad , which has produced a death toll placed at 28 and still rising .
Moreover , Petraeus is a political general who was placed in his position because he accepted the policy of escalation advocated by the Bush White House , under conditions in which other military commanders rejected it .
He was then brought back to Washington to serve as an advocate for this policy , allowing Bush and the elements of the American ruling elite that support an unending occupation of the oil - rich country to hide behind his uniform .
Crying foul over political attacks on a political general used for openly political purpose represents a hypocritical and sinister attempt to silence all opposition to the war itself .
The attempt to equate criticism of Petraeus and his political role with the denigration of every working class youth in uniform is equally deceitful .
The fact is that Petraeus serves as an advocate for a policy that keeps these young soldiers killing and dying in Iraq for years to come .
More fundamentally , the thesis that the military is above criticism from either elected officials or the general public — a conception that is enthusiastically promoted by the Republicans and cringingly accepted by the Democrats — fundamentally serves to subvert the essential constitutional principle that the military is subordinate to civilian control .
This principle has already been gravely weakened by the transformations in the military itself , which has become a largely mercenary force of professionals , commanded by a predominantly conservative Republican officer corps and provided with vast funding to wage multiple wars of aggression .
Under these conditions , to promote the conception that the military is above reproach and anyone daring to criticize it must be formally rebuked is tantamount to greasing the skids towards a military dictatorship in America .
The Senate resolution is but the latest sign of the deep - going corrosion of democratic processes in the United States .
Nor is the inability and unwillingness of the Democrats to defend elementary democratic principles a new development .
A major factor in the theft of the 2000 election , in which the Democratic candidate Al Gore won the popular vote , was a Republican - led drive to marshal absentee military votes for Bush in the disputed Florida contest , including those illegally cast after the voting deadline .
When Florida Democrats sought to challenge the illegal military votes , the Bush campaign launched a witch - hunt , attacking Gore as unpatriotic and hostile to the military .
Gore quickly capitulated , agreeing to allow the invalid votes to be counted .
Later , Democratic Party officials and Gore campaign aides revealed that the then - vice president decided to allow the invalid military votes for fear of alienating the military brass .
The Democratic National Committee ’s general counsel at the time told the New York Times : “ I can give you his exact words .
‘ If I won this thing by a handful of military ballots , I would be hounded by Republicans and the press every day of my presidency and it would n’t be worth having . ’ ”
Another Gore aide was quoted as saying , “ Gore got very stuck on the notion that if he became president , it was not in the national interest that he have a relationship characterized by his mistrust of the military . ”
If anything , the flaw in MoveOn.org ’s provocative headline stems from its pro-Democratic politics .
Petraeus is merely an instrument of a policy crafted by others .
If one wants to look for “ traitors , ” a good place to begin is with the Democrats and those who promote illusions in the Democratic Party .
It was , after all , the Democratic leadership of the US Senate that provided the unanimous vote in the Senate last January confirming the general as the commander of American occupation forces in Iraq .
The aim of MoveOn.org is to influence and pressure this party to carry out a policy to end the Iraq war .
The deeds of the Democrats in the 10 months since they gained their congressional majority , thanks to an election dominated by the antiwar sentiments of the American people , have amply demonstrated the bankruptcy of this perspective .
Hell has been on my mind .
I recently dug up a list of all the places in the Gospels where Jesus talks about hell ( there are quite a few ) , so hell is all up in my face right now .
It 's one of the religious beliefs that I find most disturbing and most profoundly fucked - up -- and I want to talk about why .
Part of it , of course , is that there 's no evidence for it .
But that 's true for a lot of religious beliefs -- arguably all of them -- and not all religious beliefs anger me nearly as much as hell does .
( The evidence problem is , however , a problem I 'll be coming back to . )
Part of it is that it 's missing the entire point of punishment and justice .
For me , the point of punishment is either to change people 's behavior -- to show them that bad actions have bad consequences , and thus to teach them not to do it again -- or to provide an example , to demonstrate to others than bad actions have bad consequences , and thus to teach them not to do it .
Hell completely fails on both counts .
The permanence and eternity of it means that it utterly fails as a teaching tool .
It 's not like you 're going to learn from your mistakes -- the whole idea of hell is that , if you have n't learned your lesson by the day of your death or Judgment Day , you do n't get any more chances .
It 's like punishing a child by sending them to sit in the corner ... for the rest of their life .
And as far as hell being an example for others ... well , here 's where we come back to the fact that there 's no evidence for it .
It 's not like the souls being burned and tortured in hell for eternity are on display for the rest of us to see , so we can go , " Oh . Got it .
That 's what happens when you steal from your neighbor and cheat on your wife .
Important safety tip .
Thanks . "
All we have is the word of some ancient texts , Jerry Falwell , and the guy screaming at us from the Powell Street cable car turnaround .
So it 's a truly lousy form of punishment .
It takes all the good stuff out of the concept of justice , and turns it into pure revenge , simply for revenge 's sake .
Simply because it makes people feel good to believe that bad people are being punished .
And then there 's the problem of how wildly disproportionate hell is ; how it's what Ebon Musings calls " infinite punishment for finite sins . "
There is no math in the world that makes infinite torture a proportionate response to anything that any human might do on Earth .
To punish even crimes like mass murder with burning and torture for infinitely longer than a billion years ... it 's like punishing a parking violation with waterboarding .
But none of that is my biggest problem with hell .
My biggest problem with the idea of hell is that it 's such a powerful , insidious form of social control .
Here 's what the concept of hell does .
It tells people , " If you behave in bad ways , if you disobey ( God in theory , religious texts and teachers in practice ) , the consequences will be bad -- extraordinarily bad , much more bad than anything you 've seen or can even imagine .
No , we can't give you any evidence that this terrible bad consequence will happen -- but take our word for it , you do n't want it to happen .
In fact , even questioning its existence and asking for evidence of it is one of the most disobedient bad things you can do , and will get you sent there for sure . "
Now .
Think about how learning , and the idea of consequences , works in an ordinary non-hell - based context .
In everyday life , if you 're reasonably sane and do n't have a personality disorder , you learn about what to do and what not to do by experiencing consequences or seeing them happen to others .
Touching a hot stove burns you ; hitting people gets them mad at you ; drinking too much makes you hungover ; saying cruel things to people you love makes you feel sick and sad ; etc .
We also learn from one another , of course -- our parents or friends say , " Do n't drink milk past the expiration date , " or , " For the love of God , do not see ' Deuce Bigalow , Male Gigolo , ' " and much of the time we 'll just take their word for it .
But at least we have the option of verifying their statements .
We can see for ourselves that when our parents and teachers told us marijuana would lead straight to heroin , they were talking out of their asses , and we can see for ourselves what the consequences of smoking pot are and make a decision about whether it 's okay .
Hell does n't work that way .
Because hell is invisible , people have no way of deciding for themselves whether it 's real ... and because hell is such a grotesquely appalling consequence , people will do anything to avoid it .
Therefore .
If you can convince people that hell is real and that you are an authority on its existence and what they have to do to avoid it ... you can make them do ANYTHING .
Anything at all .
You can get them to give you money .
You can get them to go out and convert more followers for you .
You can get them to suck your cock .
You can get them to turn against their children .
You can get them to vote for your friends .
You can get them to go to war against your enemies .
You can get them to torture , to kill , to tie people to stakes and set them on fire , to blow themselves up in crowded places , to commit mass murder , to commit mass suicide .
And of course , you can get them to never ask questions about you , or whether what you 're saying and doing is right , or whether this hell place even exists .
Anything .
The combination of hell 's invisibility and the extremity of its horror makes it a singularly effective form of manipulation and social control .
It 's a terrifying consequence that people will avoid at all costs ... and they have no way to look at the world around them and ask , " Hey , is that really true ? "
Then when you add the " doubting hell 's existence will get you sent there " meme , it makes it even more powerful by making it self - perpetuating .
And all of this is especially powerful , and especially troubling , when it 's directed at children ... whose brains are , as Richard Dawkins points out , built , for very good evolutionary reasons , to believe what adults tell them .
Part of me gets it .
It is awful to think of wicked people thriving , living their lives out in comfort and never suffering the consequences of their badness .
I hate that Ken Lay died of a heart attack before he could rot in prison .
Part of me wishes I believed in hell , so I could believe he was there .
But the idea of hell is an evil , hateful idea , and it's not one I want in my world .
It exists for one reason and one reason only : to scare people into doing what you tell them , to squelch questioning and dissent .
It takes people 's innate fears -- and maybe worse , their ability to trust and learn from one another -- and manipulates them to create obedience .
It is an idea that has nothing but contempt for people 's autonomy .
It is an idea that has nothing but contempt for people , period .
It is social control , pure and simple .
It is completely at odds with the idea of a compassionate , loving God .
And any religion that has it as a central theme has a tremendous amount to answer for .

" Some even emailed me messages of encouragement such as ' Great job , we 're really impressed ! , " Brice reports .
They should be impressed .
Brice 's product is one of the few downloadable executables which definitely can't be infected with a virus - because it 's not executable .
It 's a text file , which simply says that it 's a text file which wo n't run - but it carries the .exe suffix , which means that your PC might try to run it if you click it .
Just to make it clear : it wo n't work .
It does n't work .
It was created as an experiment to see how many shareware awards it could receive .
" The obvious explanation , " says Brice , " is that some download sites give an award to every piece of software submitted to them .
In return they hope that the author will display the award with a link back to them . "
It 's an ancient scam , one of many designed to fool search engines into giving a website a higher rating .
The idea is that we , being lazy animals , will do a search for a product , and click on the first link that comes up .
So if your pages are the highest rated , then yours will get the clicks - and the advertising revenue that flows from those clicks .
But of course the same applies to other areas where awards are common .
How many people , seriously , do you think vote for Restaurant of the Year awards given by local newspapers ?
As any publisher will quickly confirm , such " prestige " awards are designed purely and simply to persuade the chef to buy advertising space in the paper ( and an expensive table at the awards dinner ) .
In the case of DBXV and its award , all we had to do was write to the awards organiser and say : " We sold over $ 5,000,000 worth of DBXV , " respond appropriately to their message of congratulations and stump up the £ 60 - odd it costs to buy the aluminium plaque that says that Consoft ( geddit ? ) won the award .
We pleaded pressure of work in refusing the invite to the the lavish black - tie dinner .
In reality , both my collaborator and I were known to the award company and the cat would have emerged from the bag if we 'd shown up .
It did n't matter : the assurance of LD " Lazy Dog " Spencer ( company secretary ) that the figures were correct was all the proof they required before cashing our cheque .
In a similar spirit of inquiry I experimented by text voting for my nearest Greek taverna for an award from my local paper .
To my complete lack of any surprise , it won ; I can show you the picture of the elated staff at the black tie dinner .
And I can show you the advertisement they took in the paper , too .
The good news : having submitted the " software " to all 1,033 shareware download sites listed by submit - everywhere .com Brice was pleased to find that 421 sites rejected it .
The tragic news is that judgment was still pending on 394 sites , and actually accepted by 218 which list it , obviously , as untested .
Dismally , the rejections are n't all gold - star efforts : several of them rejected software " of this genre " - a utility .
Now , shall I tell you about my award - winning blog ?

Part 1 : The Thriller Video , Foucault , and Discipline in the New Media July 29 , 2007
Sweating it out in my un-air - conditioned apartment , during an overheated New York summer , I recently received an email from my friend Jo , of a sort that thousands of people around the world must have been receiving at the same time .
She was alerting me to the latest YouTube phenomenon video .
I mean , of course , the prisoners at Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center , in the Philippines , restaging Michael Jackson ’s “ Thriller ” video .
In twelve days ( so far ) this video has been viewed over two and a half million times and is on track to become one of the most viewed YouTube videos ever .
The email from Jo also contained a question that probably did not appear in many other emails on this topic .
She asked : “ What would Michel have made of this ? ”
Jo was referring to the seminal late twentieth century French philosopher , Michel Foucault , who famously wrote about the history of prisons and their place in contemporary societies .
( Foucault also wrote ground breaking work on other topics , such as sexuality , madness and psychiatry , the human sciences , and medical practice ) .
Since I wrote my doctoral dissertation about Foucault ’s work , it certainly made sense that I might have something to say about it .
My first reaction , however , was an honest sense of being completely dumbfounded .
The vision of over a thousand prisoners precisely re-choreographing Jackson ’s “ Thriller ” dance , in their orange jumpsuits and sandals , was just too odd .
It seemed more like a mockery of prison decorum or like the accidental coming to life of a musical in the wrong place , than like a purposeful instance of punishment , justice , rehabilitation , or even vengeance .
Two minutes into the video , I got over my amazement and realized that in fact it all made sense , as far as Foucault goes .
Thinking back over his theories of disciplinary society , it fit almost too well .
Indeed , perhaps I was astonished at first , more because , as Freud says , what is uncanny is what is most familiar and therefore strangely hard to recognize .
And so the more I thought about the dance and about the appearance of the video on YouTube , the more I saw that it conformed quite exactly to Foucault ’s theories about the social function of the prison .
It was simply hard to believe that Foucault ’s theories might be enacted in such a literal manner .
Here we have in the prisoners ’ dance , I realized , and in its appearance on YouTube , the model itself , as Foucault proposes in at least part of his work , for how all individuals become proper citizens , workers , students , family members , patients , and all the other roles we play in our contemporary life .
So I had my answer for Jo . What would Foucault make of this ?
He ’s chuckling to himself in his grave and saying I told you so .
What we see in the video of the Filipino prisoners are thousands of people in identical clothing being marched around in a military like fashion .
Apparently they are dancing , but in fact they are being taught discipline .
The security consultant who came up with the idea freely acknowledges the disciplinary goal of the dance .
This accords with Foucault ’s contention that one of the crucial functions of the prison is to create “ docile bodies . ”
But more importantly , the dance is videotaped and posted on YouTube .
This is done again by the security consultant who came up with the idea .
The consequence of this is that , once the prisoners realize how popular the video has become , they feel compelled to better perfect their dance / discipline .
Once again , it turns out that this accords with Foucault ’s discussion of the impact of prisons in contemporary society .
Prisons , according to Foucault , early on became sorts of panopticons ( following a type of architecture invented by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century ) .
The function of a panopticon is to make people feel they are being watched at all times .
In turn , this feeling of being watched ( for the Filipino prisoners potentially of the whole world watching ) makes people take it upon themselves to better regulate their own conduct ( literally for the Filipino prisoners to come in line with the dance ) .
And so in the final instance , self - regulation turns out to be the mechanism by which external forces control the body .
This last point is probably the most crucial element of Foucault ’s argument in Discipline and Punish , his deeply influential history of prisons .
It is also a point more often than not misunderstood .
Foucault does not argue that in our disciplinary society people are being controlled by the fact of other people watching ( or videotaping , as the case may be ) .
Rather he argues that we control ourselves by making ourselves feel watched .
The sense of being watched comes from the individual and is an act of the individual on him or herself .
In fact , according to Foucault , it is this very act of self - surveillance which is the means by which we become individuals at all in contemporary society –how we fit into the workplace , home , school , church , etc .
Beginning in the 18th century and definitively by the 19th century , when this model of conduct was perfected in prisons and simultaneously expanded beyond their walls , and up to the present , we have been and remain a society of individuals formed in the act of making ourselves feel observed by others .
This is what is most fascinating about the “ Thriller ” video : the fact that it is placed on YouTube .
It brings starkly into relief the underlying social dynamic bound in the fact that YouTube is precisely a place where people , more than anything else , post videos of themselves .
And then they post videos of their friends and families , their most intimate relations .
It is where collectively , and more and more , we are all subjecting ourselves to the idea of the disciplining gaze of others .
We think we ’re sharing , when we ’re really conforming .
And once one begins to think about the Internet this way , there ’s hardly any reason to stop at YouTube .
For example , most forms of blogging make up even more powerful acts of forming oneself under the possible gaze of unknown others .
How is it , after all , that the diary , a sort of text a person conventionally writes only for him or herself , a sort of text once symbolized by the lock that closes it , how is it that this sort of text has come instead to be published happily and willingly in the most public and global of forums ever devised ?
It is almost a complete inversion for the act of writing a diary , to turn into the act of writing a blog .
Dating , blogging , YouTube , Flickr , Facebook , MySpace , craigslist , discussion forums , webcams , more and more we are enacting every aspect of our personal lives under the gaze of potentially any other person in the world .
I ’m going to stop now .
What I have said is all pretty abstract and rather quickly sketched out .
I think this topic is worth subsequent posts , where I will go into many of these points in more depth and less abstraction .
I want to try to make plain the disciplinary medium we swim in and form ourselves out of every day .
In the meantime , perhaps it is worthwhile returning to and keeping in mind my passing remark about Freud and the uncanny .
Beware of what is most familiar .
In our globalizing world , perhaps we do not need to be on guard so much against the encroaching interests of others ( governments , corporations , terrorists ) , as we need to be on guard against the way we incorporate these interests as the things we take most for granted about ourselves .
In the next 90 minutes , the tank brought down four Telstra mobile phone towers and damaged three Optus towers .
The rampage continued until the vehicle stalled on the way to another phone tower .
Mount Druitt police chief inspector Guy Haberley said : " He continued to destroy mobile phone tower communications sheds by crashing through the perimeter fence and colliding with structures , causing significant damage . "
The tank was allegedly stolen from A - One Lift Truck Services , where it was available for hire and was popular with students who used it for school formals .
A - One owner Greg Morris said he hired Patterson , a friend of a friend , on a six - month contract to help restore the armoured personnel carrier , made in 1967 .
" We worked on this together , and he loved the work he was doing , " Mr Morris said .
" I remember once when we took it out , someone touched it , and he lost his temper with them .
That 's how much pride he took in his work .
" He put hundreds of hours of work into it and helped build it .
He loved it just as much as I did . "
Mr Morris said he believed Patterson had once worked on tanks in the army .
Patterson 's neighbours said he had been a technician for Telecom , now Telstra , who received a compensation pay - out about 15 years ago after a head injury .
The tank rampage stunned many local residents .
Witness William Errington said he began following the vehicle with his friends after they heard loud noises and police sirens .
" The tank was being driven all over the place , on footpaths , on the wrong side of the road , " Mr Errington said .
" It was a bit scary , but it was n't something you see every day . "
Mobile phone services were disrupted yesterday while technicians prepared to move into the area and fix the damaged phone towers .
A Telstra spokesman said temporary structures had been erected to replace four mobile phone towers that were destroyed in Mount Druitt , Emerton , Plumpton and Minchinbury .
An Optus spokeswoman said three towers had been damaged and were being repaired .
Mobile phone services in the affected areas were expected to return to normal today .
Patterson faced a Sydney court on charges that included malicious damage ; breaking , entering and stealing ; predatory driving ; possession of a prohibited drug ; use of a weapon to avoid apprehension ; and driving in a dangerous manner .
He was refused bail .
A page about call / cc
call / cc stands for “ call with current continuation ” ; it is a function that exists in certain programming languages .
What it does is not very easy to describe ; in fact , I think it is one of the strangest inventions of computer science .
This page tries to explain what call / cc does , what it means , why it is useful and how it works .
[ 1999/11/14 ]
This page has only started .
It is something I really wanted to write .
However , I have so much to say on the subject , and so little time , that I must beg the reader 's pardon for its obscurity and many failings .
Still , I hope I am able to share some of my enthusiasm for this wonderful function .
The background required to read this page varies widely .
To understand it fully , you need a thorough knowledge of theoretical computer science and mathematical logic — and then you probably do n't need to be told what call / cc is , anyway .
But most parts require little or no knowledge of such topics .
I have tried to keep this free of Scheme prerequisites , but I have not always succeeded .
Anyway , consider this page more as a collection of scattered thoughts with little order in them than as a systematic treatment of the subject .
If something is obscure , just continue , it might become clearer later on since I try to repeat the same things as often as possible in various different ways .
At its heart , call / cc is something like the goto instruction ( or rather , like a label for a goto instruction ) ; but a Grand High Exalted goto instruction .
I can see your hair turning green at this point : ever since Dijkstra 's famous Turing award speech , we know that goto is Evil and can never be Grand , High and Exalted .
Well , wait until you know more about call / cc .
The point about call / cc is that it is not a static ( lexical ) goto instruction but a dynamic one .
Just exactly what is meant by this should become clear later on .
The call / cc function introduces some rather mysterious objects in the programming language , first - class reified continuations ; these fundamentally alter the way the program is understood ( some would say , making it much harder to understand — and admittedly there is truth in this ) .
Some genius I would say .
No , seriously , I 'm not sure .
I am told that P. J. Landin , in “ A Correspondence between algol 60 and Church 's Lambda - notation ” ( Communications of the ACM , vol. 8 , Feb. 1965 , 89 –101 and 158 –165 ) , introduces the J operator that is quite like call / cc .
I have not checked this .
[ XXX — do so . ]
It means “ call - with - current - continuation ” .
At least , that is its official name in Scheme ( and though the call / cc abbreviation is common , it has not achieved universal recognition and some Scheme implementations , such as guile , accept only the longer name ) .
This refers to the fact that call / cc captures the current continuation , and applies its argument to this continuation ( however , before you try to make sense of this please wait for me to explain what continuations are ) .
Since I am trying to speak of the function in general , and not of its particular implementation in Scheme , I will refer to it as “ call / cc ” and not “ call - with - current - continuation ” .
Scheme is the canonical language having a call / cc function : it is officially called call - with - current - continuation , although the call / cc notation is semi-standard .
The Standard ML of New Jersey also has a call / cc function , that is called SMLofNJ .
Cont.callcc ( it differs a bit from the Scheme version in that continuations are not directly reified as functions but need to be “ thrown ” with the function SMLofNJ .
Cont. throw ; however , that does not change the fundamental nature of the call / cc function ) .
The Unlambda programming language also has a call / cc function ( introduced simply because it is something that is difficult to understand and Unlambda is an obfuscated programming language ) : it is called “ c ” .
To the best of my knowledge , these are the only languages with a full - fledged call / cc function .
Many other languages ( notably Java , CAML or C++ ) incorporate a weaker form of call / cc ( “ outgoing - only continuations ” ) called exceptions : we will explain what exceptions are and why they are weaker than true continuations .
At a lower level , some OS 's have support for a kind of call / cc function : the only that I know of is the Solaris form of Unix which supports the getcontext ( ) function that is strongly related to call / cc .
And processor Task State Segments ( used in multitasking ) could be thought of as a manner of continuations .
Finally , a call / cc function can be added to the Coq project by simply entering Axiom callcc : ( P: Type ) ( ( P-> EmptyT ) ->P ) ->P. ; however , since Coq is not Turing - complete , this can be considered cheating .
Exceptions are present in many programming languages , and most people seem to have no problem understanding them .
We review them briefly .
An exception signals that a special condition ( generally an error ) was encountered in the course of the execution of a program .
Signaling the condition ( highly inappropriate term ) is called raising the exception ( most people use the term “ throwing ” here , but I prefer the former term ) .
When this happens , normal execution ceases : the function in which the exception was raised terminates immediately , raising the exception again in its caller ( parent ) , which terminates in turn , and so on until either the entire program is terminated or until it is caught .
Catching the exception involves putting the code which might raise it in a special block ; if the exception is raised , control is transferred to the exception handler which decides what to do ; after the exception handler has returned , normal execution is resumed ( at the end of the block , not where the exception was raised ) , as if the code had terminated normally .
With the exception is associated certain data , which are specified when the exception is raised , and which will be passed to the exception handler when ( and if ) the exception is caught .
Several different exceptions might be raised by the same block of code : they will be handled independently , in that an exception handler can be put for any subset of the exceptions which might occur , and those exceptions which are not caught will continue to cause termination .
The weakest form of exceptions are lexically scoped ones , also called block / break exceptions : they are not true exceptions but merely a structured form of labels and goto s .
This means that the exception may be raised only if a lexically surrounding block is there to catch it ( something that can be checked statically at compile time ) .
In its very weakest form , this is the return , break and continue statements of C ; however , C does not have labeled break s ( like Perl or Java do ) [ XXX — any projects on adding this feature ? ] , so these “ exceptions ” are limited to one - at - a - time local exits ( or , if you prefer , lexical scoping with a single - name namespace ) .
Beyond that , the labeled break s of Java ( next in Perl ) are examples of lexically scoped exceptions ; still , these are a far cry from true exceptions , and even further from first - class continuations .
Note how we say that these lexically scoped exceptions propagate outward through the program ( “ outward ” in the sense of lexical block scoping , of course ) .
True exceptions ( the raise / catch sort and not the break / block one ) are of a different nature : any block can raise an exception , it does need to have to be lexically embedded within a catch block .
And the exception will be caught ( if at all ) by the innermost catch that is dynamically surrounding the raise .
We say that ( dynamically scoped ) exceptions propagate upward through the program ( “ upward ” through the program stack , that is ) , from callee to caller .
One important thing to note is that whereas with lexically scoped exceptions the block ( catching the exception ) associated to a break ( raising the exception ) is well - defined and can be determined at compile time , on the other hand with true ( dynamically scoped ) exceptions the catch that will actually catch an exception thrown with a given raise cannot be determined in advance , and can vary from time to time according to the way the function containing the raise is called .
A digression on lexical vs dynamic scoping of exceptions
( If what follows seems obscure to you , do not worry , that is normal ; please feel free to skip over the rest of this section . )
There are , of course , subtleties involved when the language allows first - class citizenship of functions and inner functions , because an inner function might then escape from its lexically containing function and might be called from elsewhere , meaning that its dynamical container might be quite different from its lexical container .
Consider the following fragment of an imaginary C - like language :
void ( foo ) ( void ) ( void ) // A function taking void and returning a function that takes // void and returns void .
{ try { //
Return the following function : void inner ( void ) { raise SomeExn ; } } catch ( SomeExn ) { print ( " Here I am !
" ) ; exit ( whatever ) ; } } void main ( void ) { try { foo ( ) ( ) ; } catch ( SomeExn ) { print ( " There I am !
" ) ; exit ( whatever ) ; } }
What does this do ?
Essentially , from main we call the inner function of foo , which raises an exception .
Which handler should handle it ?
If exceptions are lexically scoped , it is that of foo , and if they are dynamically scoped , then it is that of main .
So in the one case , “ Here I am ! ” will be printed , and “ There I am ! ” in the other .
Note that this dilemma is not likely to happen in any real situation .
Why is that ?
Because no language acts like that —
I 'm not talking about exceptions but simply about this escaping of inner functions — except Lisp variants .
Pascal allows inner functions , but Pascal does not give them first - class citizenship so that inner functions cannot escape ( their dynamic container is always within lexical scope of their lexical container ) ; C allows first - class citizenship of functions ( or , to be precise , of pointers to functions ) but no nested functions ; gcc allows both but its manual explicitly specifies that “ all hell will break loose ” if you try to invoke an inner function after its lexical container has exited .
There is a deep reason behind this ( “ this ” being the remark made in the previous paragraph ) .
Indeed , when inner functions can escape , the question of the visibility of variables from the outer functions becomes rather complex : the duration of closures is greater than simply the execution time of the function , and the simple stack - based model of computation fails ( garbage - collection must be used , the closures must be stored on the heap rather than on the stack ) .
I mention this here because there is an analogy with escaping continuations : escaping continuations do to return addresses what escaping inner functions do to data ( i.e. making lifetimes become unpredictable and forcing a replacement of the simple stack model by a more complex , garbage - collected graph ) .
We will return to this .
There is something very deep here , which I am not able to understand clearly , let alone explain in detail .
Anyway , we now end this digression .
The C programming language ( or , rather , the POSIX standard ) defines two functions , setjmp ( ) and longjmp ( ) which are the nearest thing C has to exceptions or continuations .
We shall look at them in some detail because they have some interesting common points with call / cc and throw respectively .
The setjmp ( ) function stores the so - called “ stack context ” ( not a very appropriate name for outgoing - only continuations like these , but let us stick to it ) in a variable passed to it , the “ jump buffer ” ; it then returns 0 .
The longjmp ( ) function takes a jump buffer and a ( non zero ) return value : it makes the execution point jump ( non-locally ) to the return of the setjmp ( ) function which had set that jump buffer , and the function returns the proposed return value .
In other words , the longjmp ( ) never returns , it makes the setjmp ( ) function return instead .
As for the setjmp ( ) function , it can return in two different ways : with a return code of 0 the first time , and possibly one or more times later , with the return code that was passed to the longjmp ( ) function .
This key point of one function making another return a specific value will be crucial in understanding call / cc , so keep it in mind .
These functions are used to implement exceptions in C : an exception handler is installed with the setjmp ( ) function , and the exception is raised with longjmp ( ) .
What the functions actually do is that setjmp ( ) stores the size of the stack in the jump buffer , and longjmp ( ) restores it .
( Of course , there is a heavy amount of black magic involved , notably on the compiler 's part , so that this not mess up with the various optimizations , and there are some complicated restrictions on the use of these functions ; in the case where the longjmp ( ) function is called from a signal handler , things get pretty messy indeed .
But we are floating far above such worries . )
One important restriction of the setjmp ( ) and longjmp ( ) functions is that the function that called setjmp ( ) must not have returned between the call to setjmp ( ) and that to longjmp ( ) .
The following code , for example , is invalid :
#include < stdio.h > # include < setjmp.h > jmp_buf buf ; int foo ( volatile int n ) { if ( setjmp ( buf ) ) { printf ( " %d
" , n ) ; return 0 ; } else return 1 ; } int main ( void ) { if ( foo ( 42 ) ) longjmp ( buf , 1 ) ; /* Yow !
DEMONS are flying through my NOSE ! */ exit ( 0 ) ; }
( In practice , though , it works reasonably .
But more complex examples would fail miserably . )
The reason for this restriction is the way setjmp ( ) functions : it works by remembering just the size of the stack ( marking the current stack pointer ) , and longjmp ( ) essentially just reduces the size to that size , so that program execution appears to have jumped to the point where setjmp ( ) was about to return .
This works well so far as everything that was below the marked point on the stack remained unaltered , i.e. so long as the function that called setjmp ( ) did not return .
This is why we say that we have “ outgoing - only ” ( or , more precisely , “ upgoing - only ” since we are talking of dynamic scoping ) continuations .
Think of a setjmp ( ) function that would not have this limitation and you have a good approximation of call / cc .
If you adhere to a stack - based paradigm of computation , or things to work in all cases we would need a full copy of the stack as per getcontext ( ) .
The call / cc function takes one argument .
That argument should itself be a function f ( hence , our programming language should allow first - class citizenship of functions ) .
call / cc will apply f to the current continuation .
The current continuation is something which looks a lot like a function ( at least in the Scheme version of call / cc it does ; in the SML / NJ version it is a bit different but that is unimportant ) .
If a continuation is applied to a value ( or , as some prefer to say , thrown a value ) , it has the effect of making the call / cc ( which produced that continuation ) return that value .
We give a few examples .
These are written in Scheme , but little or no knowledge of Scheme should be required to understand them .
Keep in mind that ( lambda ( variables ) body ) is the notation for an anonymous function with given parameters ( variables ) that performs the given function ( body ) , and that the function f applied to the variables x1 , ..., xn is written ( f x1 ... xn ) .
Consider the first example : ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( k 42 ) ) ) .
This applies call / cc to the function ( lambda ( k ) ( k 42 ) ) ; hence , the latter function is called with argument ( k ) equal to the current continuation .
But the body of the function is ( k 42 ) , in other words , the continuation is thrown the value 42 .
This makes the call / cc return the value 42 .
Hence , the entire expression evaluates to 42 .
Now consider ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) (+ ( k 42 ) 1729 ) ) ) .
Here , the function throws the value 42 to the continuation , and attempts to do something afterward .
Only this has no effect , because as soon as a continuation is invoked ( by throwing a value to it ) , the program jumps ( to be precise , the current continuation becomes the continuation invoked ) and the program bit ( the continuation ) which was going to take an x and perform (+ x 1729 ) has been lost in space ( it has become GC - fodder ) .
So the result is still 42 .
On the other hand , consider ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) 42 ) ) .
Here , the function applied to the current continuation ( namely ( lambda ( k ) 42 ) ) does not make use of the said continuation .
It returns in the “ normal ” way .
In the case of Scheme ( and also SML / NJ and Unlambda , so , as far as I know , every implementation of call / cc ) , when this happens , the call / cc function also returns the same value .
Hence the result is 42 again .
But other approaches are possible , so this should not be taken as part of the “ fundamental ” nature of call / cc but only as a contingent property of its main implementations .
For the next example , we need to add two more elements of Scheme : ( let ( ( variable value ) ... ) body ) is used to bind initially variable to value in body .
And ( set ! variable value ) is used to change the value of variable to value .
In what follows , #f ( the “ false ” boolean ) is used as a dummy value representing something unspecified .
So , here is the example : ( let ( ( cont # f ) ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set! cont k ) ) ) ( cont # f ) ) .
Here we have a variable cont : its initial value is unimportant .
We call call / cc upon a function ( lambda ( k ) ( set! cont k ) ) that takes the continuation ( k ) and binds the variable cont to it ; it then returns in the normal way .
We ignore the return value of the call / cc and we call the saved continuation cont with an unimportant value .
But when that continuation is called , it has the effect of going , so to speak , “ back in time ” , to the point where the call / cc returned , and make it return again , after which the continuation is again called , so call / cc returns again , and so on : we are caught in a “ time warp ” and our example loops endlessly .
The interesting thing about the last variable is that the continuation escaped , i.e. it became visible outside of the function that is the argument to call / cc ( namely ( lambda ( k ) ( set! cont k ) ) ) ; this is precisely what was impossible with exceptions .
It ( meaning the continuation ) was captured and bound to the variable cont , and used outside the scope permitted for outgoing - only continuations ( exceptions ; in fact , with exceptions it is not possible to produce an endless loop like this ) .
[ XXX — add more examples here ]
It is time by now to explain the meaning of the central keyword in all this discussion : that of a continuation .
A continuation is “ something which waits for a value ” in order to perform some calculations with it .
This is a very vague definition , but I think it nevertheless makes things clear .
With every intermediate value in a computation , there is a continuation associated , which represents the future of the computation once that value is known .
A continuation is not something , like a function , which takes a value and returns another : it just takes a value and does everything that follows to it , and never returns .
Consider a computation such as ( * (+ 2 4 ) (+ 1 6 ) ) .
We have several continuations involved here .
The continuation for (+ 2 4 ) says : take this value , keep it aside ; now add one and six , take the result and multiply it with the value we had kept aside ; then finish .
The continuation for (+ 1 6 ) says : take this value , multiply it with the value ( 6 ) we had kept aside ; then finish .
Notice in particular how the result of (+ 2 4 ) is part of the continuation of (+ 1 6 ) , because it has been calculated and kept aside .
Continuations are not something static that can be determined at compile time : they are dynamic entities that are created and invoked as program execution proceeds .
At each step in the program , when a value is being evaluated , there is a current continuation , waiting for the value to be thrown to it [ why is it that I suddenly have the clear image in my mind of a lion waiting for fresh meat to be thrown to it ? ] ; the current continuation will perform the remainder of the computation , including calculating other values and calling other continuations .
It can be argued , if we believe in the stack - based paradigm for computation , that a continuation represents the execution stack , i.e. the sequence of nested functions that are the callers of a given value , at a given point in the program execution history .
The basic evaluation element in a programming language is this : evaluate an expression exp ( possibly in a given environment env if the language has named variables which is frequent ) with a continuation cont ( the current continuation ) waiting for the result .
Keep this in mind as we will say that we are evaluating an expression ( in an environment ) with a continuation , the “ with ” referring to the continuation that is waiting for the value .
One important particular case is that when the result of one computation immediately determines ( gives , yields , provides — or , more simply , “ is ” ) the result of another , that is , when the one is in tail position in another , such as the last instruction in a compound instruction or function body , then the continuation of the one is the same as the continuation of the other .
If we allow the program to explicitly manipulate continuations , which is the whole point of call / cc , we are reifying these continuations .
If they can be manipulated in exactly the same way as , say , integers ( they can be passed as arguments to functions , returned as return values , passed to other continuations , and so on ) , then we have given them first - class citizenship .
So , when we apply call / cc to a function f with a continuation k ( the current continuation hungrily waiting for the result of the said call / cc ) , call / cc applies f to k , with continuation k .
Notice how k plays a double role : it is passed as the argument to f , and it is also the continuation to that same call .
( The latter fact , as we have already pointed out that this fact is not so important , being more a convention in existing implementations of call / cc than a fundamental property of it .
This says , in a way , that the function call is in tail position in the call / cc call . )
We reconsider the previous examples .
First , ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( k 42 ) ) ) .
Here , k is bound to the continuation waiting for call / cc to terminate .
So we are evaluating ( k 42 ) , k being bound to the said continuation , with k again as ( current ) continuation ; the latter fact is not used , since k is immediately thrown the value 42 , making call / cc return .
Second example : ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) (+ ( k 42 ) 1729 ) ) ) .
Here , we have two continuations , k , the continuation waiting for call / cc to finish , and also for (+ ( k 42 ) 1729 ) , and another continuation , say l , waiting for ( k 42 ) to finish so as to add 1729 to it and throw it to k ; but that l will be left waiting ( and eventually garbage - collected ) because ( k 42 ) never finishes , since k is a continuation .
Third , ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) 42 ) ) : this time we really need to use the fact that the function f ( here ( lambda ( k ) 42 ) ) gets applied with the same continuation k as the call / cc ( the double role mentioned above ) .
Piano Society is proud to present its large collection of more than 5,600 high - quality classical keyboard recordings , produced by our artists consisting of both professionals and skilled amateurs .
Visitors can find a wide range of music by famous as well as lesser - known classical composers .
Although all recordings are free , donations will be gratefully received to cover the costs of hardware and web hosting .
Piano Society actually consists of two sites .
One is the main site , which you are looking at now and contains the music pages with recordings .
It is not necessary to register for the main site , everything is free .
The other is the Piano Society Forum where you can find discussions relating to composers , pianists , technique , repertoire , composing , and the piano .
To take part in discussions , or post recordings , you need to register and log in to the forum .
For the pianist , Piano Society offers its registered members a personal biography page and space to host their recordings .
To join as a pianist , please register with our discussion forum if you have not already done so , log in and post a message in the Audition Room forum , attaching three recordings of preferably different repertoire .
Your recordings will be evaluated by the administrators , taking in account feedback from long - standing members , and if accepted , added to the site along with the biographical information and photo you provide .
Recordings do not need to be of professional quality but must be reasonably accurate and error - free and have decent sound without too much hiss and extraneous noises .
Digital recordings are allowed although we much prefer acoustic recordings .
MIDI and other types of rendered music will not be considered for inclusion on the site .
Piano Society ensemble music videos
Several PS members have collaborated to make video recordings of four - hand and even six - hand piano pieces .
Some of the collaborations are of two members sitting together at the same piano .
Others are of two or three members sitting at their own piano , in their own home , in countries far away from each other , where audio and video editing programs were used to put the parts together .
The videos were fun to make and we invite you to watch them by following these links :

Former Muslims from several European countries signed the declaration in the Hague on the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks in the United States Tuesday .
Other signatories included many well - known Dutch politicians , authors and journalists .
The date of the declaration , Sept.11 , was symbolically chosen in order to condemn the terror and intolerance perpetuated by radical Islamic militants , though critics argue that choosing the date unfairly links Islam to terrorism .
The ex-Muslim committees from the Netherlands , Britain , Germany and the Scandinavian countries wanted to draw attention to what they refer to as the " lack of freedom of religion within Islamic culture . "
Ex -Muslim , Ehsan Jami , an Iranian - born Dutchman , launched the initiative to sign the Declaration of Tolerance .
Jami , 22 , a Labour Party member of the city council in a district near The Hague , has been attacked for his views three times .
" There are five sharia schools in Islam which say if you leave Islam you must be killed , " Jami , 22 , told Reuters in an interview .
Muslims are not allowed to renounce their faith , according to a strict interpretation of Islam and those who do are subject to imprisonment or death in some Muslim countries .
Ex -Muslims reignite divisive debate over Islam
The movement of Muslim apostate committees , which was spearheaded earlier this year by Jami and Mina Ahadi , an Iranian living in Germany , has reignited a divisive debate about Islam and has put the lives of such self - declared " ex- Muslims " in danger .
In Germany , Ahadi also lives under heavy police protection .
Mina Ahadi , head of German committee of ex-Muslims , which has 400 members
In highly publicized interviews , Jami 's blunt attacks on Islam has offended many Dutch Muslims and commentators have drawn comparisons between the local politician and the rhetoric of right - wing politician Geert Wilders , who has called for complete ban of the Quran .
Jami has referred to the Muslim prophet Mohammed as " criminal , " compared Islam to fascism and Nazism , and explained that he decided to launch the committee of former Muslims to call attention to " persistent taboos " about renouncing the Islamic faith .
Divided support for ex-Muslim group
Initially , the Labour Party did not support Jami and his committee , and the Dutch Vice - Prime Minister Wouter Bos told the news daily Volkskrant he did not approve of such a committee that " offends Muslims and their faith . "
But the Dutch public rallied around Jami , putting pressure on Jacques Tichelaar , Labour 's parliamentary leader to sign a declaration of support for the ex-Muslim committee .
However , Han Noten , who is the Dutch senate 's Labour faction leader , criticized his party 's stance .
In a commentary for Wednesday 's NRC Handelsbad newspaper , he said the Committee of Ex-Muslims was " oversimplifying reality " and that Jami 's methods succeeded in " polarizing society . "
" Signing the declaration on September 11 can only be interpreted as a provocation , " Noten added .
" It suggests … that former Muslims are innocent and Muslims are guilty . "
The right to renounce the Islamic faith
Theo van Gogh , a filmmaker who criticized Islam was murdered in Amsterdam in 2004
Jami's " Committee of Ex- Muslims " wants imams and Muslims to recognize fellow Muslims ' religious rights , including the right leave the faith .
" We are breaking the taboo that comes with renouncing Islam , but also taking a stand for reason , universal rights and values and secularism , " said a declaration signed by Jami , Ahadi of the German chapter , and their British counterpart Maryam Namazie , who is also of Iranian origin .
Ahadi , who belongs to the German group called " Wir haben abgeschworen , " meaning " We have renounced , " said it was significant that the three leaders were from Iran , since they had all witnessed the political repression under the Islamic Republic firsthand .
There are some 400 committee members in Germany , including non-Muslim Germans , according to Ahadi .
The British council of ex-Muslims has around 70 members , and Jami 's committee has only two official members .
" We have received hundreds of support e-mails and that 's what counts , " Jami told the AFP news agency .
" We 're more of a movement . "
Before you read on , spend a minute to take a look at this site using Firefox .
I ’ll wait till you get back …
Okay , so the basic theory is that Firefox ( and Mozilla Foundation and its Commercial arm , the Mozilla Corporation ) allows and endorses an extension named Adblock .
Adblock allows users to block ads ( or other content ) while surfing the web .
According to the creators of that site , this is wrong .
Horribly , horribly wrong .
It is “ no less than stealing , ” and a by some astute legal analysis , Firefox is a “ Contributory Infringer . ”
Yes , you heard me : Firefox ( with Adblock ) is a grave threat to capitalism itself .
In fact , FIREFOX === COMMUNISM .
There are a number flaws with this argument .
What if you do n’t use Firefox or Adblock , but you have banner blindness and never even notice the ads ?
What if you still use Lynx , which does n’t even render the ads ?
What if you are Googlebot , and all you care about is indexing test and following up links ?
Everyone wants to get paid for their work .
We have Adsense ads on our blog here , though so far they ’re just enough to pay the bills .
But arguments like this one display a fundamental ignorance of what the internet is and how it works .
I ’m not using the phrase “ fundamental ignorance ” as an insult – in fact , many intelligent , wealthy people are in the same camp .
They are people in traditional publishing companies , phone companies , etc. who think the Internet should work the same way they ’ve done business all their lives .
But it does n’t , and not by accident .
The reason the Internet and the Web are so successful is that anyone can create content , anyone can create services , and anyone can create and manipulate user agents to do whatever they want with all that content and those services .
Now , the folks at Why FireFox Is Bocked are of course within their rights to block users who use Firefox .
I would caution them not to , since search engines tend to penalize sites that serve different content to a spider than they do to a web browser , but it ’s their pagerank .
And I doubt anyone would even use Adblock if sites did n’t use misguided flashing , moving , text - blocking ads .
But I ’m sick of people trying to use the Web to make money , and then complaining about fundamental properties of the Web that make it such and incredible medium .
If you want to put stuff online and have complete control , then go back to 1993 and put it on AOL .

When water in two beakers is exposed to a high voltage , a floating water bridge forms between the beakers .
Credit : Elmar Fuchs , et al .
While it's one of the most important and abundant chemical compounds on Earth , water is still a puzzle to scientists .
Much research has been done to uncover the structure of water beyond the H 2 O scale , which is thought to be responsible for many of water ’s unique properties .
However , the nature of this structure , governed by hydrogen bonds , is currently unknown .
“ Water undoubtedly is the most important chemical substance in the world , ” explained Elmar Fuchs and colleagues from the Graz University of Technology in Austria in a recent study .
“ The interaction of water with electric fields has been intensely explored over the last years .
We report another unusual effect of liquid water exposed to a dc electric field : the floating water bridge . ”
When exposed to a high - voltage electric field , water in two beakers climbs out of the beakers and crosses empty space to meet , forming the water bridge .
The liquid bridge , hovering in space , appears to the human eye to defy gravity .
Upon investigating the phenomenon , the scientists found that water was being transported from one beaker to another , usually from the anode beaker to the cathode beaker .
The cylindrical water bridge , with a diameter of 1 - 3 mm , could remain intact when the beakers were pulled apart at a distance of up to 25 mm .
Why water would act this way was a surprise , Fuchs told PhysOrg.com .
But the group ’s analyses have shown that the explanation may lie within the nature of the water ’s structure .
Initially , the bridge forms due to electrostatic charges on the surface of the water .
The electric field then concentrates inside the water , arranging the water molecules to form a highly ordered microstructure .
This microstructure remains stable , keeping the bridge intact .
The scientists reached the microstructure hypothesis after observing that the density of the water changes between the beaker edges and the center of the bridge .
A microstructure consisting of an arrangement of water molecules could have a similar density variation .
In their experiments , the scientists also discovered the existence of high frequency oscillations inside the bridge , and they observed corresponding inner structures with a high - speed camera and visualization system .
Unlike the much slower surfaces waves , these high frequency oscillations were n’t caused by surface tension .
Rather , the scientists predict that the oscillating structures were triggered by the waviness of the voltage supply itself .
The researchers noticed a pattern with the inner structures : every experiment started with a single inner structure , which then decayed into additional structures after a few minutes of operation .
The group thought that this decay might be caused by either dust contamination or the increasing temperature of the water bridge under the electric field .
As the water temperature increased from 20 degrees Celsius to more than 60 degrees Celsius — which took about 45 minutes — the bridge collapsed .
The scientists explain that the unusual effect of the floating water bridge , as well as the microstructures they observed during the interaction of water with electric fields , could be another piece to the puzzle of the structure of water .
The group said that they are currently investigating how highly ordered microstructures may explain the density change in the water bridge , with the results to appear in a future publication .

Correction Appended
There was never much chance that Stephen Colbert would bungle his own show .
Mainly , there were concerns that the " The Colbert Report " ( pronounced with a French accent , as in ra-PORE ) would turn out to be the Double - Stuf Oreo of Comedy Central -- too much of a good thing .
It 's not .
If anything , after one week , Mr. Colbert 's half - hour sendup of cable news commentators already suggests that " Saturday Night Live " has outlived its usefulness -- or at least is in need of a shake - up .
When a comedian from " The Daily Show With Jon Stewart " has a big enough following to warrant his own spinoff , it may be time to renovate NBC 's 30 - year - old comedy show .
Even last Saturday , when Tina Fey , the head writer , was back at the " Weekend Update " anchor desk after her maternity leave , most of the political jokes were as labored and predictable as the comedy skits .
Yet young people increasingly rely on comedy , and particularly " The Daily Show , " as their main source of news .
That could explain why nowadays breakout stars like Steve Carell come from Comedy Central and not " Saturday Night Live , " as they did in the days of Mike Myers and Adam Sandler .
Humor has moved away from long , one - joke skits and wacky impersonations to jujitsu satire : using the glib complacency of television news against itself .
And some of the best material on Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert 's shows lies in their sadistic use of snippets from real newscasts and political speeches .
On Thursday , Mr. Colbert showed a montage of alarmed reports about the avian flu epidemic on CNN , C - Span and MSNBC , then showed a more upbeat Fox News headline : " Bird is the word on the street .
Why the avian flu could send stocks soaring . "

Americans are known for outsourcing everything .
So , why not the Iraq war too ?
Currently , contractors in Iraq number more than 180,000 , according to the Associated Press .
137,000 of them are working for the Department of Defense , and thousands more have been separately contracted by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development .
Their number is greater than the 163,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq now .
As journalist Jeremy Scahill writes , “ In essence , the Bush administration has created a shadow army that can be used to wage wars unpopular with the American public but extremely profitable for a few unaccountable private companies . ”
And this “ shadow army ” is accountable to no one , thanks to the immunity granted by U.S. authorities following the invasion in 2003 , which essentially prohibits Iraqi courts from prosecuting contractors .
This action prompted politicians on both sides of the aisle to introduce bills which would place U.S. security contractors under U.S. federal criminal codes .
But in the meantime , contractors continue to rake in billions of dollars in Iraq and surely , when we withdraw , they ’ll make bank off that as well .

A Worm for Your Apple
A small controversy is brewing over claims that an independent researcher going by the moniker Information Security Sellout ( or InfoSec Sellout ) has developed the framework of a worm that targets a currently undisclosed vulnerability affecting the Intel versions of OS X .
The worm is expected to extend to PPC versions as soon as the author is able to test against that architecture .
With the author dubbing it ' Rape.osx ' , the evolution of the worm is likely to be keenly watched by Apple watchers , security researchers , and malware developers .
When the first report was published on Sunday , InfoSec Sellout was claiming that the proof - of - concept worm was able to reliably deliver root and was based on a variation of mDNSResponder vulnerabilities that Apple had previously patched .
InfoSec Sellout later disclosed that the worm was first completed on July 14 , with functional testing on a network of approximately 1,500 OS X systems by the 16th of July .
In its first instance the worm only left a text file as evidence that it had been on a system , but it is reported that the worm can fully be ' weaponised ' with the payload of choice ( and it can achieve that result at this time ) .
While InfoSec Sellout states that the worm only seeks out other systems on the same network for infection , they point out that it is not going to take much extra work for the worm to attack a much broader network segment .
Following the path of many recent researchers , the author has stated publicly that they are avoiding telling Apple about their work until it is complete ( and after they have been compensated from unnamed sources ) .
This has led to the expected arguments about the ethical and professional nature of such behaviour .
In their defence , the author claims that it would be irresponsible to report on incomplete research .
Plus , they do n't want to give the vulnerability to Apple in order for Apple to miss patching the underlying vulnerability - only patching the particular approach vector being used .
With Apple having some of the most passionate defenders in Information Technology ( its userbase ) , the ongoing arguments about the merits of ' Rape.osx ' are likely to go long into the future - well after any real or perceived threat from the worm has passed .

Blind , drunk man shot entering wrong home Blind , drunk man shot when he enters wrong home
An intoxicated , visually impaired man entered the wrong northeast Harris County home early today and suffered minor wounds after the frightened homeowner fired a shotgun , officials said .
" It was not his residence , " said Lt. Michael Young of the Harris County Precinct 4 constable 's office .
" The homeowner requested that this person leave and the interloper refused , insisting it was his house . "
When the confused man advanced on the homeowner , the homeowner fired a round of bird shot that grazed the man on his face and head , Young said .
The man , whose family told deputies he has been involved in similar incidents before , was taken by ambulance to a hospital , where he remained this morning , Young said .
The man lives nearby , he said .
The incident occurred at about 2:45 a.m. in the 7900 block of Devlin south of FM 1960 .
Before he was wounded , the confused man had been jiggling the front door of the home on Devlin , shouting and pacing back and forth when he could not enter , Young said .
Although he had no key , the man managed to enter the front door , Young said .
It was unclear whether the deadbolt lock was set , he said .
When he went to the entryway with his shotgun , the homeowner found the confused man inside the door , Young said .
The homeowner said the two argued about whose home it was before the homeowner felt threatened and fired his shotgun , Young said .
No charges are expected to be filed in the case , Young said .

Democrats call for special prosecutor to probe Gonzales perjury Michael Roston

Three Senate Democrats called on the Justice Department 's Solicitor General to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether or not Attorney General Alberto Gonzales committed perjury in Congressional testimony on the Bush administration 's domestic spying program .
Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) harshly criticized the Attorney General in the Thursday Capitol Hill press conference .
" His inability to answer simple and straight forward questions was stunning , " Schumer said .
" His instinct is not to tell the truth , but to dissemble and deceive . "
Schumer laid out the case that the senator had perjured himself , pointing to differences between a number of statements made by Gonzales regarding a series of March 2004 meetings over President George W. Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
He pointed especially to Gonzales ' insistence that a meeting with top Congressional leaders did not concern the " Terrorist Surveillance Program , " the Bush administration 's publicly acknowledged domestic wiretapping program .
" It 's in black and white , " he argued .
" At the helm of this Department of Justice is a man who has potentially misled the American public again and again . "
Schumer said that a special prosecutor was needed and called on Solicitor General Paul Clement to appoint someone outside the Justice Department to investigate to Gonzales .
Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) echoed his remarks .
" I have never seen an Attorney General so contemptuous , " she said .
Gonzales could be facing a perjury investigation as the result of his testimony this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
This morning , CNN spoke to Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee , who expressed great frustration with Gonzales .
" In his testimony , there are so many instances where he does n't tell the truth to the committee , " said Schumer .
" He is just not being straight .
... I 've been in Washington 27 years and I have never seen anything like this . "
Schumer suggested Gonzales might be lying about which program was involved because he had been asked before John Comey 's testimony in May whether there was " any dissention about the wiretap program in the administration and he said no . "
" Anyone who was involved knows that this man is just not telling the truth , and it 's just unbelievable to me that either he does n't step down or that the president ... does n't ask him to resign , " Schumer said .
" How this man thinks he can just keep getting away with not telling the truth ...
This is just the straw that is breaking the camel 's back .
He 's done this over and over and over again . "
Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) is giving Gonzales until next week to change his testimony or face a perjury investigation .
However Schumer told CNN , " I would like to see an investigation occur right away . "
The following video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on July 26 .
Last week , before the House Committee on Financial Services , Ron Paul pointedly asked Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke : “ What moral justification do we have to deliberately devalue the currency and the dollars that people save ? ”
At this hearing , Paul explained why the beneficiaries of the Fed ’s cut in interest rates are financial institutions and Wall Street .
The victims , Paul added , are the poor , the middle class , and the future of the U.S. economy .
Dr. Paul has been a student of economics for many years and , in particular , has studied the theories of Ludwig von Mises and Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek .
Both economists have repeatedly explained how Fed credit expansion creates distorted saving and investment signals .
These distorted signals lead to malinvestment .
The consequences of malinvestment are recession or depression .
When the Fed chooses to mask the consequences of their past folly through more credit expansion , even more malinvestment is created .
The end result of this is an even larger economic decline .
Paul seems to be the lone political voice in Washington who understands this .
Paul ’s question to Bernanke may be watched below .

magine turning your head and holding your arm out , as if for a blood test .
You feel a slight prick , you loosen the tie , and then suddenly this warmth floods up , you feel a rush that begins at the base of your spine and surges up until it explodes in your head , like light .
Then , for hours , you float in a bubble of warmth and well - being ; dreams as vivid as movies drift before your eyes .
This is why people like heroin .
Imagine you no longer feel like an ordinary girl , bland and vulnerable , but like a girl who is daring , an outsider , a risk - taker , one of the guys .
This is why I tried it in the first place .
But why is a question junkies never ask .
They know why .
The question for a junkie , is why not ?
You have to have a very good reason to give up that rush .
After all , you ’ve come to love the ritual , even the smell of sulfur , the flame beneath the spoon .
You love the liquid lightning that fills your veins and blossoms in your head .
You love the dreams , more brilliant with color than anything you ’ve seen in life : a car so red its edges are silver in the sunlight , poppies exploding into color , again and again and again , orange , purple , vermilion , the dark velvety center .
And then the psychic numbness that envelops you for hours , where you have no worries , no fears , no anxieties , no guilt , no other desires .
So why is not the question .
You may as well ask why people have sex — which , as we all know , can have as deadly side - effects as heroin .
I was sixteen when I started .
Thin , thin , always dressed in jeans and a black t- shirt , hair long and wild , I imagined I was a bohemian .
The rules did n’t apply to me .
I did n’t have to attend school to get A ’s and B’s .
The year was 1970 .
Janis was still alive , I think , maybe even Morrison and Hendrix .
The Civil Rights Bill was six years old .
Watts had burned , so had Newark .
John F. Kennedy , Martin Luther King , and Bobby Kennedy had all been killed .
Vietnam was old news .
The Cold War was simply a part of the landscape .
We wanted out .
Sometimes it seemed as if the world were falling apart .
The center was not holding .
We were kids , living in the borderlands of Arizona , in a town ringed by missiles .
We could n’t imagine a future .
Instead , we shot dope .
We ran it across the border .
We were falling from idealism to despair .
I ’d fallen .
Needle to the vein .
My blond boyfriend from West Texas was threatening suicide and planes like dark predators were circling overhead .
By May of my twentieth year , I had not only grown up , I felt old .
I had quit using every toxic substance I ’d ever tried .
This includes pot , hallucinogens , cocaine , speed and alcohol , none of which required any effort at all to quit , as well as the two that caused me difficulty , heroin and tobacco .
I could claim that this makes me an expert , not only on addiction but on recovery , but I am ambivalent about everything : what constitutes addiction , whether physical addiction leads to psychological or visa versa , and whether or not people can be “ cured . ”
Whether addiction is a disease — or a symptom .
Part of me believes I was never addicted to anything — and that may be true .
I started smoking at fourteen , for instance .
Can I really say , that at twenty , I was addicted to nicotine ?
Likewise , even though I started using heroin at sixteen , I abstained for my entire senior year in high school — instead popping several Percodan every few hours .
( My boyfriend , true to his Texan roots , was a Cowboy , but of the Drugstore variety . )
Since I used opiates daily for only a few years of my life , was I truly an addict ?
Perhaps I was on the road to addiction and mercifully waylaid .
I have proof , at least , of physical need : I was cranky as hell whenever I tried to give up smoking and felt withdrawals whenever I tried to quit heroin .
Yet physical withdrawals are simply the most obvious manifestation .
Addiction is the absence of choice .
To illustrate , when I was sixteen , I was sitting in a park when I realized I was out of cigarettes .
Upon discovering that fact , I really wanted one — which meant I would have to stand up , walk a block home , scrounge for thirty - five cents ( yes , thirty - five ) , walk two blocks to the discount store , and buy the cigarettes .
( This not only gives you an idea of how lazy — or stoned — I was but of the oppressiveness of summer heat in Tucson . )
At any rate , I realized that if I quit smoking , I could choose not to take the walk .
What liberation !
Ever since then , addiction , for me , has meant that a substance compels me to consume it .
If I feel like I have to have it — even if , physically , I do n’t — then I am addicted .
In some fundamental way , then , it makes little difference if the precious amber liquid is scotch in a glass or heroin in a syringe , if escape comes in a vial of cocaine or is provided by little pills in a prescription bottle .
The underlying desire is the same .
Perhaps each of us , given the right ( or wrong ) substance and the right ( or wrong ) set of circumstances , is a potential addict .
After all , you do n’t have to be an asthmatic to suffer an asthma attack ; you simply have to be exposed to something that will trigger the reaction .
And you never know what that something might be .
For this reason , I ’ve never blamed my family .
My parents were as typical of their WWII generation , with its alcohol use and repression , as I am of the Vietnam generation , with our drug use and penchant for openness .
To be fair , my father would never have considered a few highballs a “ problem ” and my mother would insist that a stiff upper lip is an admirable quality .
When I was coming of age , we thought psychedelics would liberate our minds .
It never occurred to us that cocaine was dangerous ; it certainly was n’t thought to be addictive .
And heroin ?
Well , they had lied to us about the dangers of every other drug , why should we believe them about this one ?
But we should have .
And perhaps because we did n’t , the Vietnam War helped spawn a heroin epidemic — at least that ’s what they called it when use crossed the border from the ghettos and the barrios into the suburbs .
Ironically , my husband , who is Mexican - American , did n’t use when he lived in the barrio ; it was only later , after his parents moved the family into a white neighborhood , that he hung out with anyone who was doing drugs heavier than marijuana .
All the guys we knew coming back from Nam were strung - out on China white .
In the four years I was shooting dope , sixteen people I knew died of drug overdoses .
Sixteen people just like me .
Middle - class , white .
Children of doctors , lawyers , and restaurant owners .
Heroin is pernicious , but whether that ’s due to inherent properties of the drug or to the black market lifestyle , we may never know .
I do n’t suppose there are enough independently wealthy junkies for an accurate survey ; I do suppose that bootleggers during Prohibition led equally unhealthy lives .
At any rate , according to my brother - in - law , who has been in prison on drug charges three times and who is still on methadone maintenance , many of the ( mostly white , middle - class ) addicts we knew frequent the same clinic he does , still addicted nearly thirty years later .
Only four of us , my husband and myself included , were able to quit in time to make “ normal ” lives for ourselves .
Statistics are equally frightening : only one out of thirty - five addicts will stay clean and sober ; some relapse after ten or fifteen years ; most become alcoholics ; in one study , of the 10 % who had “ recovered , ” half were counted as not relapsing only because they had died .
Death as a cure — imagine that !
I fit the profile of the addict most likely to stay clean : young , female , addicted for under five years .
This suggests that the longer one uses , the more fierce the psychological addiction , yet we also assume that psychological factors — childhood trauma , history of family dependency , unhealthy living situations , poverty , etc. — make some of us more vulnerable in the first place .
A chicken or the egg sort of cycle .
Some research indicates that people who get addicted to opiates may already have a deficiency of dopamine in their brains , which predisposes them to addiction to substances like heroin .
But whether you ’re predisposed or not , if you use heroin with any regularity , you will get addicted because heroin takes over a natural function of brain chemistry : it replaces dopamine .
When the heroin stops , no dopamine , your nerves are screaming .
Physical addiction is simple .
If you do n’t do it , you experience pain ; since you did it in the first place to alleviate or avoid pain , you just do it again .
Basic Pavlovian theory .
You know what cures you .
On the other hand , people who have abused drugs like metham - phetamine or cocaine , which stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain , are always left with a need to have that center stimulated .
( Ecstasy , as I understand it , like Prozac , increases the amounts of serotonin in the brain and thus causes changes in brain chemistry , at least temporarily . )
In other words , even when there is no physiological predisposition to addiction and no physical dependency , because the drug itself causes changes in the brain , those changes can create a strong psychological addiction — in the case of cocaine , to anything that will stimulate the pleasure center .
Even sex .
So far as I know , cocaine is not physically addictive , only psychologically , but , hey , monkeys will give up food , water , and sex for cocaine .
Monkeys will die for cocaine .
No big surprise there .
People die for cocaine .
I once met a real estate developer who had lost everything , and he had quite a bit to lose , to that white powder .
He said , “ Cocaine is God ’s way of telling you you make too much money . ”
But back to the monkeys with monkeys on their backs : monkeys who have unlimited access to heroin gradually level out their use .
They still eat , they still sleep , they still have sex .
They simply do enough heroin to keep from going through withdrawals .
This experiment , which I read about in the Stanford Alumna Magazine , was published in the mid-eighties , when cocaine was thought of as nose candy , something one might indulge in at cocktail parties .
( Please pause for a moment to consider what that target audience might have been doing in its spare time . )
Whatever else the experiment ’s purpose , it did prove that there is no “ just ” to psychological addiction .
Physical addiction , no matter to what substance , seems to be the least of an addict ’s problems .
There ’s methadone for the junkie , Nicorette gum for the smoker .
Drunks , speed freaks , crack heads and their brethren coke heads have no choice but to go cold , I guess — although researchers are experimenting with new drugs which affect serotonin levels and seem to reduce the addict ’s cravings .
But even if you have to take the old - fashioned route and go cold , your body gets over it .
People do kick .
Some stay clean for years before going back .
It ’s the psychological pull , the craving , that ’s so hard to overcome .
For some people , of course , addiction is a symptom of an underlying disease , clinically known as a dual disorder .
For example , many schizophrenics or manic - depressives are addicts ; prior to being diagnosed , they used ( and became addicted to ) illicit drugs in an attempt to balance out a brain chemistry that was naturally out of whack or had been thrown out by trauma .
For the rest of us , though , the question is how do you liberate yourself from desire so intense it rules your life ?
I can answer only for myself .
One : I did n’t get sent to prison .
Everyone I know who ’s been there , male or female , is still an addict .
I ’ve never been there and I ’ve been clean for nearly thirty years .
This is also true of other people I know who did n’t go .
An unscientific survey , perhaps , but revealing .
Prison does not cure addiction .
In fact , there ’s such an ample supply of drugs in prison that a person could go in clean and come out with a habit .
After all , what do we think happens when a bunch of drug users are confined in the same place and they have a captive market ?
They exercise a little capitalistic know - how , that ’s what they do .
They ’re familiar with supply and demand .
The guards and visitors bring it in .
In the 70’s , in the state prison in Florence , Arizona , the wars between the Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood were over the drug trade as much as they were about race .
Legend has it that the head of the Mexican Mafia once stood out in the middle of the yard , brandished a pistol , and dared anyone , including the guards , to kill him : proof he was in control and fearless .
When I was nineteen , I met a guy just out of the joint who had a permanent hole in his arm , hidden by his prison blue tattoo .
He did n’t need a needle .
He just put the sharpened point of the glass bippy ( made out of an eyedropper ) right in the hole and shot up .
That ’s how he ’d done it in the joint and , once he got out , even though syringes were easier to come by , that ’s how he preferred to do it .
As I remember , he did n’t even have to register to be sure he was in the vein .
He put the point of the bippy in , the blood just washed in and then , when he squeezed the little rubber bulb , the dope backwashed into his vein .
Now , I might be wrong about the physics of the bippy because the whole open wound thing made me squeamish and so I did n’t watch very carefully , but some of the guys I knew were endlessly fascinated .
They were impressed .
They wanted a hole of their own ; they longed for easy access .
Two :
My life began to resemble a bad movie OR the illicit lost its allure .
Nirvana , chemically induced , cannot last .
Eventually you start using more .
Several times a week .
Then every day — this is the point at which heroin addicts consider themselves strung - out — then several times a day .
Before long , you do n’t get a rush , you do n’t get high at all .
You ’re shooting dope , now , to keep from getting sick .
To stay normal .
Scenes from how the illicit lost its allure :
Mr. Bippy shoves a gun in my face and demands my wake - up .
I am busy , at the moment , needle in my arm .
Fuck you , I tell him , you think we ’re afraid of you ?
No acceleration of my heart .
Nothing .
Franklin and Val come over to cop .
She has just suffered her third miscarriage and , perhaps because of that , he lets her get off first .
Almost immediately , her eyes roll up in her head and she hits the floor .
She is out .
Franklin sits down on the bed and ties himself off .
The whole time we ’re trying to revive her , Franklin is busy finding a vein .
We slap her , rub ice cubes on her , shake her .
Nothing .
We consider shooting her up with salt water , which we ’ve heard is the antidote , although we ’ve never seen it done .
Finally , we drag her to the bath tub and hold her head under cold running water .
She comes out of it .
Franklin is sitting on the bed , nodding .
He rubs his face .
Huh ?
he says , looking at his wife .
That was some good shit , Babe .
( Or something to that effect . )
A few weeks later , having been evicted from the apartment over gunfire — ( I told you it was a bad movie ) — I ’m lying in a bed in a motel so run down they ’ve filled the swimming pool with dirt .
Fernando , my future husband , is lying next to me .
We ’ve saved a tiny bit of dope for the next morning , but we have no money .
Fernando says , “ It ’s time to kick .
Something bad is going to come down . ”
At the time , this seemed to me a profound statement and perhaps it was , implying as it did , cause and effect .
Consequences .
Lying there next to him , I knew what I could n’t articulate .
The medicine had become the disease .
We had fallen into a kind of despair , where we could n’t remember how we were before .
Where the things that happened seemed to happen to other people and we were the numb observers .
Where there was no future , or if there was one , we could n’t imagine it .
But this is what I remember most : the day Val nearly died was a gray day , windy , dust and bits of dried leaves in the air .
After she came out of it , I watched them climb on their motorcycle , Val so thin , Franklin , all big , tattoos on his arms .
She put her arms around him , leaned into him , and they sped off .
I kept seeing her go out , lips blue .
What if she nodded out on the highway ?
She would slip , like a rag doll , beneath the traffic behind them .
He would n’t notice .
He would n’t care .
Could this happen to me ?
Where nothing nothing nothing would matter ?
Not Fernando .
Not if I was pregnant .
Nothing .
Except dope ?
Three :
We took a vacation from our addiction .
Fernando and I went into a fourteen - day detox program , courtesy of money the Nixon administration had set aside for treatment .
It was the first time I ’d met junkies who were old , in their thirties and forties .
They were parents .
Some were pregnant .
Some had school - aged children waiting in the car .
Some juggled wiggling , pajama - clad toddlers as they stood in the morning medication line .
Waiting there behind them , I felt like Miss Granola Girl herself .
I remember thinking , you mean this could be your life ?
Tommy , our counselor , was small , quiet with dark , dark skin , blue black .
He used to say , I ’ve had my jones for twenty years .
He ’d been clean for the last two or so but he never gave himself credit for that .
He counted all the years , from the first time to the present , as his habit .
Any intervening years off dope did n’t count either .
Once a junkie , he said , always a junkie .
Questions Tommy asked us : are you two a couple , do you love each other ?
or are you just spoon partners ?
who leads and who follows ?
when ?
what ’s the worst thing you ’ve ever done to get it ?
have you ever betrayed each other ?
how did that feel ?
how far will you go ?
what lines will you cross ?
One day , Tommy told me I was a self - medicating junkie .
I did n’t understand what he meant .
He said , “ Something eats at you , you want to cover it up . ”
That seemed to me such a normal impulse , I could n’t believe it had anything to do with my having a habit .
Our last day , Tommy held his hands in front of his face , his fingers pressed together , a black butterfly .
“ Look at you two , ” he said to us , “ What are you doing here ?
You have a chance to make it .
You can fight this sucker , do n’t give in . ”
He sighed , “ It ’s going to be hard .
You ’re used to hundreds of dollars passing through your hands every day , now maybe you ’ll spend $ 20 , $ 10 , that ’s all , groceries , gas for your car .
You ’re used to excitement : you got to hustle for money . ”
He shrugged at us .
“ Now you ’re going to be bored .
Watch TV .
What can we do , you ’ll say to each other .
How often can a person go to the zoo ?
What do normal people do ?
What did we do before we got strung out ? ”
He looked from Fernando to me , back again , and then laughed , “ You ca n’t remember what you used to do , can you ?
Well , try .
Because there ’s going to be only one thing you want to do and you ca n’t let yourself do it , not even once . ”
He was right .
Straight life was achingly boring .
Within three days , we were using again .
But it was different .
It was no longer unconscious .
After that , whenever I got off , or convinced Fernando that we should get off , or was convinced by him , I had to admit I was rationalizing .
This sounds very simple , but it seems to me that the ability to stand outside yourself and critique your own behavior and have insights into your motivations is invaluable .
You can no longer lie to yourself .
You find yourself disgusting .
Weak .
You are no longer comfortable with your junkie self .
You want to be strong , to have control .
After all , you probably started using because you felt invincible , outside anyone else ’s rules , daring , independent , and now , you have to admit it , you ’ve become pathetic , sniveling , dependent , the very things you despise in the junkies around you .
No thank you .
Four :
Why not ?
A good reason to quit .
I got pregnant .
Background details :
It was 1974 .
I was almost twenty years old .
I had been clean , completely clean for over three months , when Fernando and I got married .
He had gone on methadone maintenance .
We were living in his parents ’ house , along with his eight brothers and sisters .
It was a small tract house on the south side of Tucson .
Most everyone in the neighborhood , except for me , was Mexican .
Even the Chinese people who owned the neighborhood grocery spoke better Spanish than I did .
In memory , that was a time of light , yellow light in the kitchen in the mornings as I sat with Fernando ’s mother and his younger brother and sisters at the breakfast table .
A time of stories about La Llorona and the Mexican revolution .
This was when his mother began to initiate me into the family , when I began to believe that dreams did mean something , they could tell the future , for instance .
Not only that , but two yolks meant twins .
A fork dropped on the floor meant company was coming soon .
You should make the sign of the cross when you salted the food .
This was when I began to see that there was another world beneath this one , a world of spirits , a world where you made sense of the disparate pieces of reality by weaving them together into a story , where you paid attention to vague feelings that things “ were n’t right ” and , by doing so , saved yourself untold grief .
Why I started using again , in that time of healing , when the self that had been dormant inside me — feelings , perception , my spirit — was waking up , I do n’t know .
Maybe waking up was painful .
Maybe it was the one last fall , the one you have to take before you can close your eyes on your old life , turn your back and say , no , that ’s not me .
That ’s not who I am .
At any rate , I had started chipping again , was into a little recreational use .
I was n’t strung - out but I was headed in that direction — even though I had an inkling I might be pregnant .
One day we went to a friend ’s house , a pool party , and while the others were swimming and drinking beer , we were in a back bedroom listening to John Barleycorn Must Die .
I was sitting on the bed , I tied off , and suddenly I was filled with the same despair I ’d felt as I watched Val ride away on that motorcycle .
After I got off , I went outside and stretched out on a lounge chair by the pool , the light , a thousand flecks of white were bouncing off the turquoise water .
Fernando sat down next to me .
I closed my eyes .
Someone opened the door and “ Freedom Rider , ” that saxophone , flooded out .
Fernando told me he wanted me to see a doctor .
A doctor would tell me what I already knew : a not - child but human nonetheless , was swimming inside , his eyes bulging , his heart beating , the veins in his delicate pink brain pulsing with the red veins on the insides of my eye lids .
Fernando ’s hand was lying on my belly , curved , a dark shadow before the sun ; maybe , from inside , the eyes could see the shadow of his hand .
And this is when I realized the truth .
The lie I ’d been telling myself was that if I did n’t know , I could n’t be hurting it .
I could n’t be responsible .
But in that moment , I could see through the lie : the doctor pronouncing some words would not make it so and it would not make it not so .
My knowing or not knowing changed nothing .
If I was , I was .
And , if I was , I might be hurting it .
Fortunately , I was not physically addicted ; I did not have to go through withdrawals , which can be very dangerous for a fetus .
In fact , with heroin , the withdrawals are more dangerous to the fetus than the drug and so a woman who becomes pregnant while physically addicted needs to keep using or to go into a treatment program so she can be gradually withdrawn .
( Good luck getting into one .
Waiting lists for treatment programs in New York City are eight months long , not much help for a fetus . )
I was lucky .
I had only to fight the cravings , and that was hard enough , but it was as if those months of pregnancy put me in a place where I was forced to remain drug free .
Much like a rehab program might do .
It gave me a hiatus from physical addiction where , I convinced myself , I could n’t do any drugs .
In a way , the craving was like grief : it could still overwhelm me at times , but at least it was n’t constant .
I felt like I was moving out of darkness into light .
My senses and feelings had begun to wake up .
Being pregnant made me realize my body was important .
Addicts tend to think of their body as “ other ” in a strange way .
The body is not who they are .
It is nothing , then , to stick a needle into it .
This mind / body split really is n’t so unusual , of course .
It ’s a fundamental dualism in Western philosophy .
We think of it as normal ; we learn to deny our bodies from childhood .
I ’ve heard the psychology of it explained this way : when you are a child , your feelings are who you are and when you are not listened to or are told to deny your feelings , you are learning to deny yourself .
The message to you is : if my feelings are not important , then I am not important .
With addicts , though , the split must be magnified .
I remember , when I was strung - out , staring at my arm , the blonde fuzz and the freckles , and puzzling over the fact that it was my arm , that somewhere inside this body , there was a me .
Feeling Michael move inside me , watching my breasts and belly swell , feeling the uncomfortable twinges of pregnancy , even morning sickness , made me aware of my physical presence : my skin , my veins , my breathing , my heartbeat .
I had become essential .
It took me a long time , though , to realize that the spirit is n’t separate from the body ; the spirit is of the body .
The spirit needs the body to feel , to grow , to be with others , even to see and hear the world .
The spirit is of the body , not separate from it , which is why death , any death , is a kind of violence .
Five :
So it ’s connection that ’s important .
Not only to your own body , but also to those around you .
When you ’re strung - out , nobody else much matters .
Oh , you might tell yourself they do and , to a certain extent , they do , but drug addiction is the ultimate form of solipsism .
Even drinking is .
There you are , wrapped in your own little chemical cocoon .
Protected .
Disconnected .
Even strung - out , I had loved Fernando .
After he went on methadone maintenance , he issued his ultimatum : we could n’t see each other unless I went on maintenance or got clean .
I got clean .
I chose him , so we were already connected , but my being pregnant deepened our connection , committed us to one another , to Michael , to the family we were creating , in a way that marriage vows had n’t .
Living with his family mattered , connected me to his mother and brothers and sisters , made them my chosen family .
Choosing to have Michael , to stay clean for him , committed Fernando and me to something larger than us , than even the three of us , to something indefinable .
We chose to put our connections to one another and to others above our own desires .
This was not conscious , but it is what drew us back into life .
Six : I stepped out of the continuous present .
I ’ve heard that living in the moment is a good thing .
There are books devoted to it .
But , for a junkie , there is only the moment , the continuous present .
There is no cause , no effect .
No memory , no hope .
No consequences , no foresight .
You are suspended completely out of time .
It ’s kind of like prison in that way : you go in , time stops , you come out blinking your eyes .
An example : when I got so pregnant I could no longer fit in my clothes , I gave them all away .
It never occurred to me I might need them again .
I bought no baby clothes , no crib , no bottles .
About three weeks before I delivered , my mother and sister threw a shower for me .
I remember holding one of those little gowns up .
The baby became almost tangible .
I embroidered two tiny tee shirts .
My only preparation .
Yet pregnancy is the perfect metaphor for the future existing within the present .
How can you be pregnant and not imagine a future ?
After all , once the kid gives you a swift kick in the bladder or swings from your ribs a few times , you have a sense of him as a separate being .
My life went from being lived completely in the moment to being focused on the future .
I could n’t imagine him , but I could n’t wait to have him .
This meant I had to project my self into the future , to begin to imagine myself as a different person , a mother , no less .
This was not easy .
To go from complete solipsism to always putting the baby first .
Imagine the shock .
Seven :
The faith of others .
Nothing is more annoying than people reminding you you ’ve fucked up .
Hey , you think , tell me something I do n’t know .
Their nagging provides the perfect excuse : well , if that ’s what you think , I may as well do it .
Tommy had said , you two can beat this .
He believed it .
We came to believe it .
He said , if you slip once , it ’s okay .
Just pick up from there .
We believed that .
Our parents believed we could do it .
Not once did I hear them question us .
They knew we could .
They knew we would .
Not only did they believe in us , but they acted out of their faith .
Fernando ’s parents took me in , gave us a place to live .
Later , my parents helped us buy a house .
These were real , tangible ways of helping us get started in the world , of helping us put the old life behind us so we could start a new one .
They knew we could be strong .
The first time I told my parents I ’d been using and quit , my mother had said , “ So it ’s over then . ”
Punto final .
As if it were as simple as making up your mind .
And , of course , it was n’t .
And , of course , it was .
Eight : Windows of opportunity .
Sometimes quitting is agony .
Sometimes it ’s a piece of cake .
That ’s what I mean by a window of opportunity .
And that ’s what I ’m looking for right now , a window of opportunity so I can quit drinking .
Now I do n’t drink with the same desperation as I did drugs .
In fact , I think of myself as a moderate drinker .
Besides , my doctor tells me to have a glass of wine every night .
Of course , he probably means four ounces , not half a bottle , but I look at one of those little glasses and think : Right .
Like I could stop there .
Why bother ?
My friend tells me , “ In Europe , everyone has a glass of wine with lunch .
Two with dinner .
They do n’t think anything of it . ”
But my daughter insists two drinks a week is moderate drinking for a woman which makes me a heavy drinker .
Plus , because her best friend ’s mother died of breast cancer , Kathryn is worried about the increased risk .
It ’s good for my heart , I tell her .
She just shakes her head .
It ’s why you ca n’t lose weight , she tells me .
The other reason ?
I ’ve had a glimpse of my future .
Alzheimer ’s , like breast cancer , runs in my family , only Alzheimer ’s has hit both sides .
For some reason I do n’t quite understand , Alzheimer ’s causes your brain to produce less of the chemical that transports impulses from one neuron to the next .
Obviously , this would slow down your thinking .
Alcohol use , then , widens the synapses between your neurons , which means that the impulses we call ideas , memories , and thoughts have a greater distance to cross .
Put it together , wider gaps , less chemical for transport : not good .
Still , I ca n’t imagine myself without a vice .
I like being a woman who enjoys indulging .
I do n’t eat low fat anything .
I like my prime rib bloody , my oysters raw , and my chili hot .
I think sweaty sex on a summer afternoon keeps your marriage alive .
I love to walk around my house late at night , a glass of wine in my hand .
I like a cold tsing tao with my yu shiang eggplant .
It ’s hard to eat camarones al mojo del ajo without a few margaritas on the rocks .
( Yes , with salt . )
And who can imagine steamed mussels , roasted garlic , and fresh sourdough bread without a good cabernet ?
Not drinking makes me feel like a Calvinist .
Like a grinch .
Like I should clean my house and wear nylons .
On the other hand , is n’t worrying about it a sign ?
After all , it is common for ex-addicts to become alcoholics .
Why , every summer evening , do I feel compelled to drink a gin and tonic ?
Does the fact that I can’t pass by the wine section of the grocery store without salivating mean something ?
Is it significant that I love to look at the bottles of wine and try this one or that ?
What about the way I love the ritual of using a corkscrew , pouring the wine into the goblet , twirling it around like I know what I ’m doing ?
But what would bring about the window of opportunity ?
My only insight so far : I need to think of myself as a hedonist , not an addict .
Instead of spending thirty bucks a week on wine , I ’ll spend sixty every two weeks for a massage .
In other words , I have n’t quit drinking but I do n’t keep any booze in the house .
Nine : Avoid plunges into despair .
I ’ve never understood how people could believe that one shot of dope , one drink , one hit off a cigarette meant you were addicted all over again .
That is a myth , as far as I ’m concerned , designed to scare you .
It ’s not like , one time and you ’re hooked again .
No .
It ’s that , if you slip , it could plunge you into despair .
Despair that you did n’t really quit ; you promised yourself and broke the promise .
Again .
You ’re weak .
Despair because the craving is renewed and you have to face it again .
You are going to have to stand in the grocery store and stare at those shelves filled with beautiful bottles of perfectly good wine and know you ca n’t have any .
Despair because you know that giving in would make you happier than not giving in , because you know that a bottle of wine , a paper with heroin in it , could bring you joy .
What is wrong with you that a chemical can bring you joy ?
Avoid plunges into despair like the plague they are .
Ten :
But never say never again .
This is what terrifies the addict .
The idea of never again .
You have to admit , there might come a time when you really need to do something like heroin .
Or have a good stiff drink .
The word never is too final ; it sets you up for failure .
When I was eighteen , I fell in love with Keith Richards .
I was reading an interview with him in Playboy and he said he ’d quit using heroin for the time being .
He figured when he was eighty and sitting on his porch in a rocking chair , he could start using again .
My sentiments exactly .
It gave me hope .
Made the prospect of life without dope easier .
I need to feel that , on any given day , I can walk into a restaurant and order a glass of cold fume blanc to go with my figs and prosciutto .
I can see myself there at a table in the sun .
Ecstatic .
Eleven : Eleven steps only : I ca n’t leave it up to God .
The Higher Power I believe in gave me free will .
Just as
He did n’t put the needle in my vein , the glass in my hand , or the cigarette between my lips , neither will He take them out .
He is not going to give me a magical fix where I do n’t want it any more — and , truth be told , that ’s the only cure any addict wants .
For someone like me — and , unfortunately , I ’m not all that unusual — who began smoking dope and drinking at the age of fourteen , my whole sense of self , of who I was in the world was formed while I was under the influence of one substance or another .
I saw myself as someone who was adventurous , a risk - taker .
I was n’t afraid of anything .
But then I got pregnant .
Suddenly I was someone who would poison her own child .
Someone who was not powerful but powerless .
This juxtaposition caused me profound dissonance , a state that , according to Piaget and other theorists , is conducive to insight and therefore change :
Who was I ?
I had to choose , to create a new sense of myself .
And so , with help , I did .
Still , I sometimes wonder : which was the defining moment ?
The moment I first felt chemical nirvana ?
Or the moment I chose to stay clean for Michael ?
When I was in my twenties and thirties , I never would have admitted publicly to using drugs .
Out of fear , I erased that girl , denied her , believed I had transformed myself completely .
Now I can admit I am not so different from her .
Both moments defined me .
After all , a heroin addict is not so different from an alcoholic and neither is so different from the rest of us , or from those among us who need prescriptions to keep the darkness away .
There are people who ca n’t survive , without help , the circumstances of their own lives .
Is it any surprise that 85 % of all women heroin addicts were sexually abused as children ?
And , of course , because all cycles are cyclical , there are men and women so broken they have n’t been able to raise their own children .
Lives so damaged , so hopeless , that self - destruction is a relief , that the idea of hitting bottom — or of “ bringing the bottom up ” — is a perverse joke .
There ’s always another bottom to hit .
There is no voice so scathing as the one inside your head .
If I ’ve learned anything from addiction , it ’s compassion , of the liberal variety , and so I have to ask : if my “ cure ” implies a cause , what constellation of forces would have to come together to help people like my brother - in - law , who for years self - medicated , first with heroin and then with methadone .
He ’s only recently been diagnosed as schizophrenic but he probably had those problems when , at twenty , the state threw him into prison for selling about twenty dollars worth of heroin to an undercover cop .
Whatever happened there , we do n’t know .
But he never recovered .
He hears voices .
He rarely leaves the small studio apartment we rent for him .
He does n’t qualify for disability .
He ’s the big guy at the grocery store , the one you do n’t want to look at .
Historically , the Northwest Passage linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been ice - bound through the year .
But the agency says ice cover has been steadily shrinking , and this summer 's reduction has made the route navigable .
The findings , based on satellite images , raised concerns about the speed of global warming .
' Extreme '
The Northwest Passage is one of the most fabled sea routes in the world - a short cut from Europe to Asia through the Canadian Arctic .
Recent years have seen a marked shrinkage in its ice cover , but this year it was extreme , Esa says .
It says this made the passage " fully navigable " for the first time since monitoring began in 1978 .
" We have seen the ice - covered area drop to just around 3 m sq km ( 1.2 m sq miles ) , " Leif Toudal Pedersen of the Danish National Space Centre said .
He said it was " about 1 m sq km ( 386,000 sq miles ) less than the previous minima of 2005 and 2006 " .
" There has been a reduction of the ice cover over the last 10 years of about 100 , 000 sq km ( 38,600 sq miles ) per year on average , so a drop of 1 m sq km ( 386,000 sq miles ) in just one year is extreme , " Mr Pedersen said .
The Northeast Passage through the Russian Arctic has also seen its ice cover shrink and it currently " remains only partially blocked , " Esa says .
' Battle for Arctic '
Scientists have linked the changes to global warming which may be progressing faster than expected .
The opening of the sea routes is already leading to international disputes .
Canada says it has full rights over those parts of the Northwest Passage that pass through its territory and that it can bar transit there .
But this has been disputed by the US and the European Union .
They argue that the new route should be an international strait that any vessel can use .
Today I started wondering what actually happens when you plug in a USB device .
The little tour below goes from starting the USB subsystem to plugging something in , and I hope it is reasonably accurate .
This entry is probably best read with a copy of the Linux kernel handy .
Linux USB
Core , lower - layers
We can start our tour right at the very bottom in the heart of the USB core .
Things really start at the USB initialisation function in drivers / usb/ core/usb.c:usb_init( ) .
The first interesting call is to drivers / base / bus.c:bus_register ( ) .
We see that it passes as struct bus_type which looks like : struct bus_type usb_bus_type = { . name = " usb " , . match = usb_device_match , . uevent = usb_uevent , . suspend = usb_suspend , . resume = usb_resume , } ;
This is registering a new type of bus with the Linux driver core framework .
The bus does n't have much yet , just a name and some helper functions , but registering a bus sets up the kobject hierarchy that gets exported through / sys / bus / ( / sys / bus / usb in this case ) and will allow the further hierarchical building of devices underneath by attaching them as the system runs .
This is like the root directory of the USB system .
Your desktop / laptop / palmtop etc has a host controller which directly interfaces to USB devices ; common types are UHCI , OHCI and EHCI .
The drivers for these various types of controllers live in drivers / usb / host .
These controllers are similar but different , so to minimise code duplication Linux has a Host Controller Driver framework ( drivers / usb / core / hcd.c ) which abstracts most of the common operations from the host controller driver .
The HCD layer does this by keeping a struct usb_hcd ( drivers / usb / core / hcd.h ) with all common information in it for a host controller .
Each of host controller drivers fills out a struct hc_driver for its hardware dependent operations , as per below ( taken from the UHCI driver ) static const struct hc_driver uhci_driver = { . description = hcd_name , .
product_desc = " UHCI Host Controller " , .
hcd_priv_size = sizeof ( struct uhci_hcd ) , /* Generic hardware linkage */ . irq = uhci_irq , . flags = HCD_USB11 , /* Basic lifecycle operations */ . reset = uhci_init , . start = uhci_start , #ifdef CONFIG_PM . suspend = uhci_suspend , . resume = uhci_resume , .
bus_suspend = uhci_rh_suspend , . bus_resume = uhci_rh_resume , #endif .
stop = uhci_stop , .
urb_enqueue = uhci_urb_enqueue , . urb_dequeue = uhci_urb_dequeue , .
endpoint_disable = uhci_hcd_endpoint_disable , .
get_frame_number = uhci_hcd_get_frame_number , . hub_status_data = uhci_hub_status_data , . hub_control = uhci_hub_control , } ;
USB overview
It might be helpful to clarify a few USB concepts now .
A USB device defines a group of end - points , where are grouped together into an interface .
An end - point can be either " IN " or " OUT " , and sends data in one direction only .
End -points can have a number of different types : Control end -points are for configuring the device , etc .
end - points are for configuring the device , etc .
Interrupt end -points are for transferring small amounts of data .
They have higher priority than ...
end - points are for transferring small amounts of data .
They have higher priority than ...
Bulk end - points , who can transfer more data but do not get guaranteed time constraints .
end - points , who can transfer more data but do not get guaranteed time constraints .
Isochronous transfers are high - priority real - time transfers , but if they are missed they are not re-tried .
This is for streaming data like video or audio where there is no point sending data again .
There can be many interfaces ( made of multiple end - points ) and interfaces are grouped into " configurations " .
Most devices only have a single configuration .
You can see how this works at the host controller level with the above diagram clagged from the Intel UHCI documents .
The controller has a " frame " register which is incremented every millisecond .
Each frame pointer points to a queue of " transfer descriptors " .
The driver needs to schedule this work so that 90 % of the time is given to isochronous data , and 10 % left for control data .
Should any time remain , the bulk data is transferred .
You can see that any transfer descriptor for isochronous data will not be retried , but other data sits in a queue so it is never lost .
The USB layer communicates through USB request blocks , or URBs .
A URB contains information about what end - point this request relates to , data , any related information or attributes and a call - back function to be called when the URB is complete .
Drivers submit URBs to the USB core , which manages them in co-ordination with the USB host ( see the urb_enqueue functions provided by the host driver ) .
Your data gets sent off to the USB device by the USB core , and when its done your call - back is triggered .
Root Hub
There is one more element quite fundamental to the USB core , which is the hub -- all USB devices plug into a hub .
The USB controller implements a root hub ; you can have multiple root hubs in a machine , and other hubs can then connect to root hubs .
The hub driver lives in drivers / usb / core / hub.c .
The USB initialisation function starts up the khubd thread ( drivers /usb/ core/hub.c:usb_hub_init ( ) ) which waits for and handles USB events , but we will return to that later .
The hub driver is the first USB driver to be setup , so by examining how that works we can get a feel for how other drivers work .
The hub driver setup starts in drivers / usb/ core/usb.c:usb_init( ) where the drivers / usb/ core/hub.c:usb_hub_init( ) function is called .
This calls drivers / usb/ core /driver.c:usb_register_driver ( ) which adds itself to the USB bus we mentioned previously .
This sets up usb_probe_device ( ) to handle any probe events from the Linux driver core .
At this point the hub driver is ready to claim anything that looks like a USB hub .
The root hub setup phase comes out of the HCD setup phase , which proceeds something like this .
The Linux driver core goes through all devices on the PCI bus ( including the USB host controller of course ) and calls the probe ( ) function the device 's driver has registered ( the host controller registered itself in its initialisation function drivers / usb/ core/uhci-hcd.c:uhci_hcd_init ( ) ) .
The USB host controller driver wires up the HCD layer function drivers / usb / core/hcd-pci.c:usb_hcd_pci_probe( ) to handle this probe ( see struct pci_driver uhci_pci_driver in uhci-hcd.c ; usb_hcd_pci_probe( ) does some generic setup , but then calls back into the host driver start ( ) function to do any device specific setup ) .
usb_hcd_pci_probe( ) ends up calling drivers / usb/ core/hcd.c:usb_add_hcd ( ) which does some generic HCD setup and ends up calling register_root_hub ( ) . register_root_hub ( ) creates a new USB device and registers it with drivers / usb/ core/hub.c:usb_new_device ( ) . usb_new_device ( ) first calls drivers / usb / core / config.c:usb_get_configuration which sets up the interface ( all hubs only have one interface ; the interrupt interface to notify of events on the hub ) for the device before registering with the Linux driver core via drivers / base / core / device_add ( ) . device_add ( ) then causes the USB bus to be rescanned .
Binding root hub to a driver
Now we can examine how a USB device gets associated with a driver .
To summarise , what needs to happen is the hub driver needs to bind to the host controllers root hub .
This illustrates the general concept of a new device binding to a driver .
There is , believe it or not , more layers that come into play now .
There is a " generic " USB driver that handles the setup of interfaces in the USB core .
As we mentioned earlier a device has a series of end - points grouped together into an interface , and then may have multiple interfaces for different things .
Drivers really only care about communicating with the device at the interface level , so the USB core takes care of getting things to this stage for you .
In drivers / usb / core/usb.c:usb_init ( ) the final call is to drivers / usb / core / driver.c:usb_register_device_driver ( ) .
This does some simple wrapping of the driver , most importantly setting up usb_probe_device ( ) to handle any probes .
It then registers this with Linux driver core with a call to driver_register .
Remembering that drivers / usb/ hub.c:usb_new_device( ) has called device_add ( ) , the driver core will now see this new device and start probing for a driver to handle it .
The USB generic driver is going to be called , which has registered drivers / usb / core / driver.c:usb_probe_device( ) as its probe function .
This converts the Linux driver core device back to a USB device ( i.e. the USB device that was registered by register_root_hub ( ) ) and calls calls the drivers probe function drivers / usb/ core / generic.c:generic_probe( ) .
The role of the generic driver is to get the interfaces on the device up and running .
Firstly it calls drivers/usb/ generic.c:choose_configuration ( ) which simply reads through the device data and chooses a sane configuration .
But wait , how does it know what is a sane configuration for the root hub ?
All the information has been " faked " for the root hub in drivers / usb / core / hcd.c:usb2_rh_dev_descriptor and the like .
The root hub details are defined by the USB specification , so these can be kept statically .
Assuming everything is OK , drivers /usb/ core/message.c:usb_set_configuration ( ) is called to set up the chosen configuration .
It uses the helper function usb_control_message ( ) to send a message to the device about what configuration mode to go into .
It then goes through the available interfaces setting up the kernel structures , and adds them with device_add ( ) .
Inch by inch , we are getting closer to having the USB system up and running .
When a new interface is added , the driver core will now try and find a driver to handle it .
When an interface driver is registered with drivers / usb / core / driver.c:usb_register_driver ( ) it sets the probe function to drivers / usb / core / driver.c:usb_probe_interface ( ) .
So the driver core calls this function , and the first thing it does is checks the ID against the IDs the driver is happy to handle from the drivers id_table .
It uses usb_match_one_id( ) for this , which can match the class , subclass and protocol to make sure the it will work with this driver .
The root hub is part of the hub class , so can be handled by the hub driver .
Therefore drivers / usb / core /hub.c:hub_probe( ) will be called to get the hub driver to bind with the new hub .
This does some sanity checking and calls into hub_configure ( ) .
This then does some more general setup , but things get interesting when the interrupt end - point is setup .
The interrupt end - point on a hub will send an event whenever something happens on the hub , such as a device being plugged in or unplugged .
This is done by creating a URB and binding it to the end - point , asking that hub_irq be called whenever this URB is complete ( e.g. when an event is received ) .
New events on the hub
At this point , the system is waiting for something to happen .
The root hub is setup and listening for new events - we are ready to plug in our device .
When this happens the host controller will raise an interrupt signalling that one of its ports has changed state .
This will be handled by drivers / usb/ host/uhci-hcd.c:uhci_irq ( ) .
This checks that the interrupt was n't due to an error and then calls drivers / usb/ host/uhci-q.c:uhci_scan_schedule ( ) .
This function implements the interface between the UHCI " transfer data " messages and the Linux URB scheme .
It goes through the queues as illustrated in the figure above and finds any complete URBs and calls their completion function .
You may remember that the interrupt end - point of the hub was associated with a URB that would call drivers / usb / core /hub.c:hub_irq ( ) .
The UHCI code will go through it 's queues , find that this URB is complete and therfore call the completion function .
We previously mentioned that the kernel starts the khubd daemon to handle hub events .
We can see that hub_irq does some simple error checking , but its real job is to notify khubd that there is a new event on this hub .
hub_events ( ) is the khubd daemon thread doing all the work .
Once notified the hub has new event , it goes and reads the hub status to see what to do .
A new device appearing will trigger a port change event , which is handled by hub_port_connect_change ( ) .
This does some initial setup of the device , but most importantly now calls usb_new_device ( ) .
At this point , if the USB driver for this device is loaded , the device is essentially ready to go .
As with the root hub , the device will be probed and its interfaces found with the generic driver , and then those interfaces will be registered and any driver asked if they wish to bind to them .

It was supposed to be the one speed limit you cannot break .
But scientists claim to have demonstrated there is the possibility of travel faster than the speed of light .
The feat contradicts one of the key tenets of Einstein 's special theory of relativity - that nothing , under any circumstances , can move faster than 186,000 miles per second , or the speed of light .
Scroll down for more ...
Travelling faster than light also , in theory , turns back time .
According to conventional physics , an astronaut moving beyond light speed would arrive at his destination before leaving .
But two German physicists claim to have forced light to overcome its own speed limit using the strange phenomenon of quantum tunnelling , in which particles summon up the energy to cross an apparently uncrossable barrier .
Their experiments focused on the travel of microwave photons - energetic packets of light - through two prisms .
When the prisms were moved apart , most photons reflected off the first prism they encountered and were picked up by a detector .
But a few appeared to " tunnel " through a gap separating them as if the prisms were still held together .
Although these photons had travelled a longer distance , they arrived at their detector at the same time as the reflected photons .
This suggests that the transit between the two prisms was faster than the speed of light .
Dr Gunter Nimtz , of the University of Koblenz , told the magazine New Scientist : " For the time being , this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of . "

Just days after the much - anticipated arrival of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , which has broken all records to become the fastest - selling book in history , JK Rowling has revealed that she has already started work on two new projects .
In an interview with USA Today , the author said : " I 'm sort of writing two things at the moment - one is for children and the other is not for children . "
This method of composition is familiar to Rowling : " the weird thing is this is exactly how I started writing Harry , I was writing two things simultaneously for about a year before Harry took over .
So one of them will oust the other in due course and I 'll know that 's my next thing . "
Part of the phenomenal success of the Harry Potter series has been its strong crossover appeal that has led to its popularity among both adults and children .
It is unclear at which age group the new book is likely to be aimed , with Rowling saying : " I do n't really feel I have to prove I can write for adults , because I have already written for adults . "
It is also unclear what genre the book will fall into .
When asked , Rowling said : " I think that there will be some disappointment if I do n't write another fantasy " , but added : " I think I 've done my fantasy .
To go and create another fantasy universe would feel wrong , and I do n't know if I 'm capable of it . "
Rowling admitted to being angry at leaks that meant that extracts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ended up on the internet before the official publication date : " I had been working toward that point for a long time .
I did have a sense - of - humour failure when the epilogue went up . "
While Rowling , whose net worth has been estimated at $ 1 billion ( £ 488 million ) , said that she feels sadness about the end of the Harry Potter series , she went on to say that the lack of pressure on her to publish for financial reasons felt " quite uplifting " , adding that she was relishing the prospect of " wandering off to a cafe with a notebook and writing . "
Whatever the author publishes next is unlikely to replicate the exceptional success she has witnessed to date .
" Of course I wo n't write anything as popular as this again .
But I have truthfully known that since 1999 , when the thing began to become a little bit insane .
So I 've had a good long time to know that , and I accept it . "
Rowling expects the books to be judged by time : " When all the hype and everything else dies down , they will have to float or sink on their own merits , wo n't they ?
So in 50 years time , if people are still reading them , they deserve to be read , and if they 're not , then that 's OK . "
However , bookstores have been upbeat about continuing sales of the Harry Potter series .
Jon Howells from Waterstone 's called them " very , very longterm - perennial classics " , and added that they would " become the sort of book you find in every household , they have a continually refreshing audience . "
That may offer little consolation to eager fans who have already finished the latest book , especially as Rowling now plans to spend " lots " of time with her family .

About " Adding files " / " Adding 2.6.0 " performance : it was not stated what was command used to add all files for git ; note that git add .
has much better performance than git add * ( the performance of latter was since improved ) .
Note also that `git add` does more than just marking file as being under version control ; it has to add content ( blob and tree objects ) to object database and some more info to index .
Repository sizes after all those commands :
git bzr hg 92 MB 112 MB 179 MB
For Git and Bazaar repository sizes are after `gc` for git and `pack` for Bazaar ; without repacking git repository size was 162 MB

Clone / status / pull comparison of Git and Mercurial
On Tue , May 23 , 2006 in scm next steps post Jeremy Blosser did speed benchmarks with hg vs. git .
The post contains fairly large table of results .
Here 's the summary , where all times are given in seconds , and are user+sys time averaged over all results and all cases :
tool clone status log pull / merge local ssh http test full log log -p server workst .
git 9,529s 14,020s 36,820s 0,723s 1,893s 0,380s 20,005s 165,494s 479,750s hg 53,783s 109,052s 109,305s 1,857s 4,167s 6,020s ( stopped ) 48,992s 108,150s
Git repository has all 4 branches in one repository , Mercurial ( hg ) had one repository per branch ; `git log` is for git_p4 with only 2 branches .
As it can be easily seen Git is faster than Mercurial in all tested areas except pull / merge , where it is around 4 times slower .

Comparison of Bazaar-NG , Darcs , Git and Mercurial
Tests were made using a directory with 266 MB of files , 258 KB of which were text files , with the rest being image files ( not very typical but reflects nature of author 's repository ) .
Here 's a table summarizing the real times reported by time ( 1 ) :
Tool initialize initial initial branch / clone non-conflicting total repository file import commit repository merge bzr 0m1.144s 0m0.839s 1m7.836s 0m31.145s 0m1.154s 1m42.118s darcs 0m0.429s 12m50.321s 0m0.164s 0m5.691s 0m6.717s 13m3.322s git 0m0.081s 1m1.918s 0m6.679s 1m37.630s 0m1.910s 2m48.218s hg 0m0.781s 0m0.377s 0m49.015s 0m8.831s 0m0.342s 59.356s
As you can see , Mercurial ( `hg` ) was the fastest .
The fact that Mercurial outperforms
Git is probably caused by the fact that Git just does n't handle the binary files as well , although there were some patches lately dealing with overly - big blobs .

Clone and pull benchmark of Git and Mercurial for Google Code
This is synthetic benchmark comparing mainly transfer over HTTP protocol ; note that Mercurial uses hg - serve here , while Git uses ordinary web server ( HTTP is " dumb " protocol in git ) .
Repositories were seeded with approximately 1500 files totaling 35 M of data for initial " clone " test .
Then a single file in the repository was then changed 50 times and the clients pulled the updates for " pull " test .
The servers were running in Chicago and the clients in Mountain View ( 51 ms ping time ) .
Operation hg git HTTP git clone 8.1 sec 178 sec 8.7 sec pull 1.5 sec 18 sec 2.8 sec
Git was 22 times slower than Mercurial for clone over HTTP , and 12 times slower for pull over HTTP .
Times for smart protocols were similar for Git and for Mercurial .

Repository size benchmarks
-- window and -- depth parameters
A Blogpost about Git repack parameters mentions that most repositories should be ok with a window value of 50 for a complete repack .
Really large repositories might benefit from a higher value .
The -- depth parameter becomes insignificant when a large window value is used .
Estimate size of Linux kernel repository
The historic Linux repo currently repacks itself into a ~ 175 MB pack for 63428 commits .
The current Linux repo is ~ 103MB with a much shorter history ( 27153 commits ) .
Given the above we can estimate the size of the kernel repository after x commits as follows :
slope = ( 175 - 103 ) / ( 63428 - 27153 ) = approx 2 KB per commit
initial size = 175 - .001985*63428 = 49 MB
So the initial kernel commit is about 49 MB in size which is coherent with the corresponding compressed tarball .
Subsequent commits are 2 KB in size on average .

Fitting linear function to the size of pack ( created git pack - objects ) versus number of commit ( number of lines returned by git rev-list $ commit ) for git repository ( which is repository which starts from scratch , from two files , and not is imported project ) gives around 1.2 kB per revision ( per commit ) ; 1.35 KB per revision if we add index size into account .
The size of ( gzipped ) checkout is not substracted .
Only mainline is taken into account .
slope = 1.25 kB / revision ( for git.git repository )

Git , Mercurial , Bazaar repository size benchmark
As candidate repositories there were chosen three projects which use given version control system for each SCMs tested .
The choice is explained in DVCS Comparison : Meet the candidates blog post .
For all repositories , only a single branch was converted .
For all repositories except Samba , this meant the development branch .
As Samba has multiple development branches , v3 - 3 - test branch was chosen .
Where possible fast - export / import interface was chosen .
After conversion , pack command was run for the repositories that support this feature .
For Git , this meant a `git repack - adf \u2014 window=250` , for Bazaar it meant a `bzr pack` , and removing the obsolete packs .
This means that the table below show size of tightly packed repository .
Tests were done using Git v1.5.5.3 , Bzr v1.5 , Hg v1.0
Repository Git Mercurial Bazaar Git Cairo 15 MB 24MB 30 MB Coreutils 29 MB 44MB 76MB Samba 82MB 146MB 310 MB Mercurial Octave 22 MB 49 MB 57MB Mozilla 78 MB 205MB 255MB Dovecot 9MB 14MB 23 MB Bazaar Emacs 120MB 163MB 300 MB Mailman 42 MB 75 MB 73MB Pkgconfig 1.1MB 1.3MB 1.8MB Total 398MB 721MB 1125 MB Relative 1 1.8 2.8
As can be seen from the table , Git really is the most efficient in storing the data .
Next up is Mercurial , which also does a nice job .
Bazaar is the least efficient by far , taking on average 2.8 times the space of an equivalent Git repository .

Synthetic benchmark : how system acts under stress ( SVK , Darcs , Monotone , Bazaar , Mercurial , Git )
DVCS Round - up : One System to Rule Them All ? --
Part 3 by Robert Fendt on Linux Developer Network contains results of two synthetic benchmarks testing how a system acts under stress ( number of commits in repository , or number of files comitted ) .
The test system was a VM running Ubuntu 8.10 ( \u201cIntrepid\u201d ) , and the software versions used were SVK 2.0.2 , darcs 2.1.0 , monotone 0.42 , Bazaar 1.10 , Mercurial 1.1.2 , and Git 1.6.1 .
First test was about dependence on repository growth , testing commit time and repository size versus number of commits present in repository .
SVK and darcs show the worst scaling behaviour , with darcs showing the strongest dependence on repository size .
Mercurial shows a very weak dependence , with check - in time increasing by 180 milliseconds over the whole range .
Git shows almost no dependence at all , with check - in time increasing by 20 milliseconds .
Both SVK and darcs use quite a lot of space on the disk , with SVK showing very fast growth .
Mercurial 's repository size was only about 10 percent larger , and Git 's even about 10 percent smaller than the checkout ( note that for Git there was performed repacking every 500 commits ) .
Second test was about dependence on check - in size , testing commit time versus number of files added to empty repository , and time it took to create single file commit after the one from previous test .
Adding 2000 files to an empty repository took SVK nearly 1400 seconds , or over 23 minutes .
Among the rest , Darcs was again the slowest with about 5.5 seconds , while Git managed the task in about 300 milliseconds .
Monotone took about a second , Bazaar 1.9 and Mercurial 2.5 seconds .
Mercurial and Git showed more or less no dependence of single file commit time on the size of the previous commit ( which is also number of files in repository ) , and the other systems only small changes .

TOKYO , August 23 , 2007 - Sony today announced the development of a bio battery1 that generates electricity from carbohydrates ( sugar ) utilizing enzymes as its catalyst , through the application of power generation principles found in living organisms .
Test cells of this bio battery have achieved power output of 50 mW , currently the world 's highest level2 for passive - type3 bio batteries .
The output of these test cells is sufficient to power music play back on a memory - type Walkman .
4 prototype bio battery units ( left )
connected to Walkman for playback
In order to realize the world 's highest power output , Sony developed a system of breaking down sugar to generate electricity that involves efficiently immobilizing enzymes and the mediator ( electronic conduction materials ) while retaining the activity of the enzymes at the anode .
Sony also developed a new cathode structure which efficiently supplies oxygen to the electrode while ensuring that the appropriate water content is maintained .
Optimizing the electrolyte for these two technologies has enabled these power output levels to be reached .
Sugar is a naturally occurring energy source produced by plants through photosynthesis .
It is therefore regenerative , and can be found in most areas of the earth , underlining the potential for sugar - based bio batteries as an ecologically - friendly energy device of the future .
Sony will continue its development of immobilization systems , electrode composition and other technologies in order to further enhance power output and durability , with the aim of realizing practical applications for these bio batteries in the future .
The research results presented here have been accepted as an academic paper at the 234th American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition in Boston , MA USA , and were announced at 11 am local time on August 22 , 2007 .
The bio battery mechanism
The newly developed bio battery incorporates an anode consisting of sugar - digesting enzymes and mediator , and a cathode comprising oxygen - reducing enzymes and mediator , either side of a cellophane separator .
The anode extracts electrons and hydrogen ions from the sugar ( glucose ) through enzymatic oxidation as follows :
Glucose -> Gluconolactone + 2 H+ + 2 e-
The hydrogen ion migrates to the cathode through the separator .
Once at the cathode , the hydrogen ions and electrons absorb oxygen from the air to produce water :
( 1/2 ) O 2 + 2 H+ + 2 e- ->
H 2 O
Through this process of electrochemical reaction , the electrons pass through the outer circuit to generate electricity .
Key achievements of this bio battery research and development
1）Technology to enhance immobilization of enzymes and mediator on the electrode
For effective glucose digestion to occur , the anode must contain a high concentration of enzymes and mediator , with their activity retained .
This technology uses two polymers to attach these components to the anode .
Each polymer has opposite charge so the electrostatic interaction between the two polymers effectively secures the enzymes and mediator .
The ionic balance and immobilization process have been optimized for efficient electron extraction from the glucose .
2 ）Cathode structure for efficient oxygen absorption Water content within the cathode is vital to ensuring optimum conditions for the efficient enzymatic reduction of oxygen .
The bio battery employs porous carbon electrodes bearing the immobilized enzyme and mediator , which are partitioned using a cellophane separator .
The optimization of this electrode structure and process ensures the appropriate water levels are maintained , enhancing the reactivity of the cathode .
3 ）Optimization of electrolytes to meet the bio battery cell structure A phosphate buffer of approximately 0.1 M is generally used within enzymology research , however an unusually high 1.0 M concentration buffer is used in this bio battery .
This is based on the discovery that such high concentration levels are effective for maintaining the activity of enzymes immobilized on the electrodes .
4）Test cell combining high - power output and compact size
The test cells of these high - power , compact bio batteries have been fabricated using these three technologies .
The bio battery does not require mixing , or the convection of glucose solution or air ; as it is a passive - type battery , it works simply by supplying sugar solution into the battery unit .
The cubic ( 39 mm along each edge ) cell produces 50 mW , representing the world 's highest power output among passive - type bio batteries of comparable volume .
By connecting four cubic cells , it is possible to power a memory - type Walkman ( NW - E407 ) together with a pair of passive - type speakers ( no external power source ) .
The bio battery casing is made of vegetable - based plastic ( polylactate ) , and designed in the image of a biological cell .

FALLUJAH – A brave new attempt is under way to project that all is well now with Fallujah .
Residents know better – or worse .
Former Iraqi minister of state for foreign affairs Rafi al - Issawi visited Fallujah , 60 km west of Baghdad , Aug. 22 .
Issawi , who resigned Aug. 1 when the Sunni Iraqi Accord Front withdrew from the government , visited the city with other members of the Sunni Accordance Bloc , al - Tawafuq .
The group toured the city and met with senior officials and community leaders in a show of conversion of the city from the most violent to the most peaceful in Iraq .
The Iraqi Islamic Party ’s TV channel , al - Baghdad , accompanied Issawi on his tour and broadcast some of the scenes from inside Fallujah .
The footage exposed the painful truth of the real situation here .
The streets were deserted , shops were closed , and people appeared with sullen faces .
" Of course we are happy to have our city peaceful , but not this way , " lawyer Ahmed Hammad told IPS .
" The local police guided and supported by the American Army have prevented car movement for nearly three months now .
They should not be proud of having the city quiet in a way that kills everybody with hunger and disease . "
Hammad referred to the vehicle ban which was imposed by the US military in Fallujah in May .
Some residents in Fallujah praised the police , others described policemen as savages .
" Those who are not Fallujah citizens in the force must be expelled and replaced by our own men , " Nassir al - Dulaymi , a former police officer , told IPS .
" They swear at people in the street and arrest people as they please , and of course there is no real government to hold them accountable for their crimes .
Probably they would be rewarded for their savage acts . "
An article titled " Fallujah Catches Its Breath " in the independent Salon.com magazine Aug. 21 described the improving situation in Fallujah .
" Fallujah , once the symbol of everything gone wrong with the American mission in Iraq , seems to be breathing again , " wrote David Morris , a former Marine who works as an embedded reporter with US forces in Iraq .
" About half the shops are open .
Groups of children wave heartily at American convoys driving by . "
A journalist who lives in Fallujah told IPS that several local journalists had been detained and warned of trouble for them if they reported anything other than " good news " about Fallujah .
" The media in the west are lying about Fallujah by saying everything is well , " said the journalist .
" What is so good about a city that lives with no electricity , no water , no fuel , very expensive life necessities , and most important , with no vehicles ?
Moreover the unemployment is incredibly high . "
Others said members of the Sunni Iraqi Islamic party and the Sunni Accordance Bloc are weak and self - interested politicians .
" The Islamic Party and its allies convinced us that the situation would be much improved after the elections , and we fell for it , " 60 - year - old shopkeeper Sulayman Mahmood told IPS .
" All they did was give cover to the sectarian government as well as getting rich , and having thousands of bodyguards . "
A tour of the city on foot gives the impression of the dark ages .
People are back to riding donkeys .
Everyone IPS spoke with complained of the extremely high price of basic goods , and a lack of work that could raise money to meet those needs .
" A cylinder of cooking gas costs 22 dollars , and it is less than half full , " said Um Ali from the Shurta district west of the city .
" Groceries are too expensive , and we do not know what to eat , especially since the food ration is practically nothing .
Our sons are either unemployed or in jail . "
A report released by Oxfam International Jul. 30 said eight million Iraqis ( in a population of 24 million ) are in need of emergency aid .
" Iraqis are suffering from a growing lack of food , shelter , water and sanitation , healthcare , education , and employment , " the report said .
" Of the four million Iraqis who are dependent on food assistance , only 60 percent currently have access to rations through the government - run Public Distribution System ( PDS ) , down from 96 percent in 2004 . "
The report said 43 percent of Iraqis suffer from " absolute poverty , " and over half the population are unemployed .
The city has also been affected by the US and Iraqi authorities ’ dependence on tribes in Fallujah and throughout Iraq ’s western al - Anbar province .
Sheikhs are the real leaders now .
" They are taking us back to the British occupation period when the British gave power to ignorant sheikhs of tribes instead of politicians and academics , " Shakir Ahmed , a historian in Fallujah told IPS .
" This is a terrible conception that will take us back to the dark ages instead of the promised progress and prosperity .
These men are highly respected for being what they are , but never to lead a city , a province and a country . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Imagine cramming 30,000 full - length movies into a gadget the size of an iPod .
A view of the IBM facility outside Boulder , Colorado October 18 , 2006 .
Scientists at IBM said on Thursday they had moved closer to being able to cram 30,000 full - length films into a gadget the size of an iPod by learning how to steer single atoms in a way that could create building blocks for ultra-tiny storage devices .

Scientists at IBM said on Thursday they had moved closer to such a feat by learning how to steer single atoms in a way that could create building blocks for ultra-tiny storage devices .
Understanding and manipulating the behavior of atoms is critical to harnessing the power of nanotechnology , which deals with particles tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair .
“ One of the most basic properties that every atom has is that it behaves like a little magnet , ” said Cyrus Hirjibehedin , a scientist at International Business Machines Corp . ’s Almaden Research Center in San Jose , California .
“ If you can keep that magnetic orientation stable over time , then you can use that to store information .
That is how your hard drive works , ” Hirjibehedin said in a telephone interview .
“ What we are trying to understand is how this fundamental property works for a single atom . ”
Hirjibehedin and colleague Andreas Heinrich studied this property -- known as magnetic anisotropy -- in individual iron atoms using a special microscope developed at IBM .
“ What we ’ve been able to do is to look at an iron atom on a copper surface and to move that magnetic orientation around , ” Heinrich said .
Now they are looking for an atom that remains stable over a long time .
“ We have a couple of ideas but we do n’t really know which ones will work out , ” Hirjibehedin said .
“ In the very long run , we ’re shooting for data storage on a very tiny scale , ” he said .
IBM colleagues in Zurich , Switzerland , meanwhile , have stumbled on a way to manipulate molecules to switch on and off , a basic function needed in computer logic .
They had been evaluating the vibration of a molecule when they noticed it had distinct switching capabilities .
Heinrich , who is familiar with the work , said the discovery is especially important because the switching action did not alter the framework of the molecule .
Switches inside computer chips work like a light switch , turning on and off the flow of electrons that ultimately make up the electrical circuits of computer processors .
Molecular switches could be used to store information and would lead to super - fast , super - tiny computer chips .
The two discoveries , which were published in the journal Science , will one day form the basis of future devices the IBM scientists were reluctant to even speculate about .
“ Put yourself in the situation of people in the ‘ 70s , where they had a roomful of computing equipment that could basically do what you can do nowadays on your cell phone , ” Heinrich said .
“ They would have given you some really stupid answers . ”

「 プログラミング言語理論」という研究分野がある。この分野の研究者たちは，「 ML 」「 Haskell 」 「 Scheme 」あるいは 「 λ計算 」
「π計算」（円周率計算のことではない）など，多くのプログラマにとっては聞いたこともない言語やモデルについて，日夜研究している。そのような言語は，C，C++，Java，Perl，Rubyなど，今の世の中で広く使われている言語とは見た目や考え方が違いすぎて，「難しい 」
「役に立たない」などと思われがちだった。
ところが，その状況が最近になって微妙に変化している。
Haskell やLispなど「関数型言語」についての記事が，専門の学会誌ではなく，一般の技術誌に掲載された（日経ソフトウエア2006年6月号「 Haskellによる関数型プログラミング入門」など）
様々なフリーソフトウエアがML，Haskell，Schemeなどで開発された
プログラミング言語の研究者ではなく，普通のプログラマのためのHaskellの解説書が出版された（「入門Haskell―はじめて学ぶ関数型言語」（向井淳著，毎日コミュニケーションズ発行），「ふつうのHaskellプログラミング
ふつうのプログラマのための関数型言語入門」（青木峰郎著，ソフトバンク クリエイティブ発行））
Schemeを使用した，プログラミングの古典的な教科書である「計算機プログラムの構造と解釈」（ジェラルド・ジェイ
サスマンほか著，ピアソン・エデュケーション発行）が再注目され，複数の読書会が開催されている
といった具合だ 。
なぜそのようなプチブームが起こっているのか？
「 ソフトウエアの開発効率/品質問題」「CやC++以外の，JavaやRubyといった言語の普及」など，もっともらしい理由はいくつかあげられる。が，いずれにせよ，研究者たちは決して「役に立たない」「難しい」ことを目指してきたわけではなく，「よりバグの少ないプログラムを書ける」「より良いソフトウエアを作れる」ことを目指してきたのだから，その成果が広まるとしたら努力が報われるというものである。
だが，もしこのプチブームがただのブームで終わってしまい，実際の内容が十分に理解されず，「やはり難しくて役に立たなかった」ということになっては残念だし意味がない。そこで，この連載では，微力ながら，プログラミング言語やソフトウエア科学の様々な研究を，できるだけ普通のプログラマやエンジニアにもわかりやすく（どちらかといえば理論よりも実用に重点をおいて）紹介させていただきたいと思う。私のような者が偉そうに他人の研究を紹介するなど勘違いも甚だしいのだが，もしかしたら何かの役に立てば…と願っている。
プログラミング言 語 「 ML 」
連載のはじめの何回かは，「 ML」というプログラミング言語を紹介してみたい。
MLといってもメーリングリストではなく，XMLやHTMLのようなマークアップ言語でもない。英国エジンバラ大学（当時）のロビン・ミルナー氏らによって設計・開発された，プログラミング言語の名前である。ちなみに，ミルナー氏はコンピュータ・サイエンスのノーベル賞といわれるチューリング賞を受賞している。
MLにはいくつかの方言や様々な実装がある。すべて紹介することはできないので，Comp.Lang.ML FAQなどを参照していただきたい。これらの中で，Standard ML（SML）と呼ばれる標準規格は（ANSI CやJavaなど他の言語仕様と違って）英語や日本語のような自然言語ではなく，一種の論理式によって厳密に定義されている点が際立っている。SMLには，Standard ML of New Jersey （SML/NJ），MLton（ミルティン）など多数の実装がある。日本で開発されているSML処理系（の拡張）であるSML#もある。「プログラミング言語Standard ML入門」（大堀淳著，共立出版発行），「プログラミング言語ML」（ジェフリー・D．ウルマン著，アスキー発行）といった日本語の文献も出版されている。
Standard ML以外のMLとしては，フランス国立研究所INRIAのザビエ・ルロワ氏らが開発したObjective Caml（OCaml）が有名だ。日本では名古屋大学のジャック・ガリグ氏も主要開発者の一人である。OCamlは，SMLのように厳密な仕様はないが，
といった特徴がある。この連載ではOCamlについて紹介していく。
OCamlのインストールと実行
OCamlのバイナリやソースコードはWebページからダウンロードできる。もっとも，DebianやCygwinなど，主要なシステムでは最初からパッケージが用意されていて，インストーラから選ぶだけで済むことも多い。Mac OS X用やWindows用のパッケージも，上のページからダウンロードできる。もしパッケージがなくても，主なUNIX系OSなら，ソースコードを展開して「./configure 」「 make world.opt 」「 make install」の三つのコマンドを実行するだけでインストールできるはずだ（ちなみに，Emacs使いの人は，ソースコードのemacsディレクトリにあるREADMEファイルに従って，caml-modeもインストールするとよいかもしれない）。
OCamlには， 「 対話環境 」 「 バイトコード・コンパイラ 」
「ネイティブコード・コンパイラ」の三つのインタフェースがある。対話環境は，ocamlコマンドを実行すると起動される。あるいは，caml-modeがインストールされていれば，EmacsからM-x run-camlを実行してもよい。Windowsでは，デスクトップの「
Objective Caml」のアイコンをダブルクリックすると，OCamlWinPlusというインタフェースが起動する。しかし，このインタフェースは率直にいって問題が多いので，かわりにコマンドプロンプトからocamlコマンドを実行することをお勧めする。あるいは，ocamlbrowserコマンドを実行し，そのメニューから「
File 」 →「 Shell ...」を選択してもよい。
OCamlの対話環境を起動すると，
> ocaml Objective Caml version 3.09.1 #
のような画面になるはずだ。そこでおもむろに「1 + 2 ;;」と打ってEnterキーを押すと，
# 1 + 2 ; ; - : int = 3 #
となる。こ の 「 1 + 2 」 がOCamlのプログラム（式）だ。それを計算（評価）したら，整数型（int）の「3」という結果（値）になった，というわけである。試しに同様の式を評価してみると
# 3 - 4 * 5 ; ; - : int = - 17 # 1000 / 6 ; ; - : int = 166
となる。ちなみに，式の後ろにつける ; ;は「 入力の一区切り」を表す合図であって，式の一部ではない。
式の字句と字句の間には，空白や改行やコメントをいくら入れてもよい。コメントは(*で始まり*)で終わる。もちろん，式に括弧をつけてまとめることもできる。
# ( 3 - 4 ) * 5 ; ; - : int = - 5 # 3 - 4 (* 中途半端なところで改行するとわかりにくい *) * 5 ; ; - : int = - 17
OCamlを終了するには，通常のUNIX環境なら，Ctrl + d（Ctrlキーを押しながらdキー）を押せばよい。WindowsのコマンドプロンプトならばCtrl + zである。
また，よくわからなくなったら，とにかくCtrl + c（EmacsではC-c C-c）を押せば式の入力や評価を中止できる。
もう少し面白い 例
さて，電卓のような計算だけではつまらないので，もうちょっとプログラミング言語らしい例も試そう。
OCamlの式には（Haskellと違って）「副作用」がある。つまり，式を評価すると，結果の値だけでなく，それ以外の効果を発揮する場合がある。例えば（意味はいずれ説明するとして）とりあえず「Printf.printf
" Hello , world !
%d
" 123 ;;」という式を評価すると，
# Printf.printf " Hello , world !
%d
" 123 ;; Hello , world !
123 - : unit = ( ) #
となる。返り値は 「ユニット」と呼ばれるダミーの値()だが，副作用として画面に文字列が出力される。また，「 read_int ( ) 」という式を評価し，例えば12345と入力してEnterキーを押すと
# read_int ( ) ;; 12345 - : int = 12345 #
のように式の値 が12345になる。
グラフィックスやネットワーク・プログラミングも簡単だ。式の意味の説明は後回しにして，とにかく
# #load " graphics.cma " ;; # Graphics.open_graph " " ; ; - : unit = () # Graphics.draw_circle 100 100 50 ; ; - : unit = ( ) #
とすれ ば 「 Caml graphics」というウィンドウが開いて円が書ける。また，
# #load " unix.cma " ;; # open Unix ;; # establish_server ( fun inchan outchan -> print_endline ( input_line inchan ) ; close_in inchan ) ( ADDR_INET ( inet_addr_any , 12345 ) ) ;;
とすれば，クライアントから文字列を受信して表示するサーバーができる。試しに上のプログラムを実行している状態で，別のocamlで
# #load " unix.cma " ;; # open Unix ;; # let ( ic , oc ) = open_connection ( ADDR_INET(inet_addr_loopback , 12345 ) ) ;; val ic : in_channel = < abstr > val oc : out_channel = < abstr > # output_string oc " Hello , OCaml !
" ;; - : unit = () # close_out oc ; ; - : unit = ()
というクライアントの式を評価すると，クライアントの送信した文字列" Hello , OCaml !
" がサーバーに表示されるはずだ。ちなみにGraphicsやUnixなどはOCamlのライブラリ（モジュール）なのだが，勘の良い人なら，上の例とOCamlのマニュアルのPart IVを見れば，かなりのOCamlプログラミングができるだろう。ちなみに，Unixモジュールは，Unixという名前だがネイティブのWindows（Win32）でも一部の機能を除いて利用できる（残念ながらestablish_serverは利用できないようだ。もちろん，Cygwinならば問題はない）。
なお，OCamlがバイトコードのダイナミック・ローディングをサポートしていない環境では，上の例は「#load」の行がうまく動かないかもしれない。その場合は，
ocamlmktop unix.cma nums.cma str.cma graphics.cma bigarray.cma -o myocaml.exe
というコマンド（2行になっているが実際には1行）を実行すれば，あらかじめ無難な標準ライブラリをすべてリンクした対話環境「myocaml.exe」ができるので，それを利用すればよい。
OCamlの 「 型システム 」
さて，今までの例には整数や文字列等しか出てこなかったが，OCamlにはもちろん浮動小数もある。ところが，例えば「半径3の円の面積を計算しよう」と思って「3 * 3 * 3.14 」を評価すると，
# 3 * 3 * 3.14 ;; Characters 8 - 12 : 3 * 3 * 3.14 ; ; ^^^^
This expression has type float but is here used with type int #
とエラーになってしまう。これはなぜだろうか？
一般に ，ML（やHaskell）は「型」についてとても厳格な言語である。例えば，OCamlでは，浮動小数と整数は完全に区別されていて，「3」と書いたら整数にしかならない。浮動小数にしたければ「3.0」あるいは「3.」と書かなければならない。それどころか，掛け算の「*」すら整数専用で，浮動小数の掛け算は「*.」なのだ。
# 3.0 *. 3.0 *. 3.14 ; ; - : float = 28.26 #
同様に，浮動小数の足し算，引き算，割り算は，それぞれ「+.」「-.」「/.」である。これは（少なくともOCamlに慣れるまでは）誰しも「うっとうしい」と思うだろう。
しかし，よくよく考えると，実は，整数と浮動小数を混同してしまうほうが，一般にはずっと面倒である。例えば，誤差のない整数が「いつのまにか」誤差のある浮動小数になって，それを等号（言語によって=ないし==）で比較していたりしたら，ごく稀にしか起こらないため再現しづらいバグになり，悩まされるおそれが大きい。ゼロ除算などにより，結果がnan（not a number）や±inf（正と負の無限大）になる場合も厄介だ。それらを比較した結果についてのIEEE規格を正確に記憶している人間はどれぐらいいるだろうか？
以上のような理由から，SMLにいたっては，浮動小数を等号で比較することすら禁止されている（どうしても比較したい場合のためにReal.==という演算は用意されているが）。
このように，MLには「一見すると融通が効かないように思えるが，実はたちの悪いバグを防ぐという点では強力である」という特徴が多い。今回は大まかな導入だけで終わってしまったが，次回以降，そのようなOCamlの様々な機能について詳しく見ていきたい。
John Matzke was just 30 years old when he was told that he had only 18 months to live .
At 6 feet 4 inches tall , with blue eyes and broad shoulders , Matzke cut an impressive figure .
He ’d been a football player at Dartmouth College , where he studied geology .
That was also where he met his wife , Lyn , who worked in town .
In 1973 , Matzke and Lyn moved to Wisconsin to run a small homestead , where they grew organic vegetables and raised chickens and a pig .
Just seven weeks after the birth of his first son , in 1974 , Matzke noticed a lump in his armpit .
A biopsy showed that the lump was malignant melanoma , a particularly fatal form of skin cancer .
He would have that tumor and then a few others removed by surgeons .
Painting by Benjamin Adcroft
By 1984 , the cancer had spread to his lung .
Having served in the Army ’s Fifth Armored Division in Ulm , Germany , Matzke went to the Veterans Administration hospital in White River Junction , Vermont , to see his oncologist , Joseph F. O’Donnell .
Knowing that his patient ’s chances of surviving the cancer were slim — and would only lessen with each passing day — O’Donnell urged him to undergo immediate treatment .
The oncologist told Matzke that once melanoma invades an internal organ like the lung , the invariable outcome is death — usually within months — without immediate treatment .
Even with treatment , his outlook was guarded .
Only half of all melanoma patients with lung metastases are alive 30 months after surgery .
But Matzke did n’t follow his doctor ’s recommendation .
Instead , he took a month off to strengthen his body for the treatment that he knew would most likely be a grueling ordeal .
He went on long hikes in the mountains , he ate healthy foods , and he meditated .
He also spent a lot of time picturing himself healthy and visualizing good strong blood cells destroying the cancer in his body .
Matzke later flew back to Vermont , where O’Donnell repeated the chest X - ray to document the size and location of the tumor before starting treatment .
But instead of the large cancerous lesion in Matzke ’s lung , he saw . . . nothing .
O’Donnell recalls , “ When John came back a month later , it was remarkable — the tumor on his chest X - ray was gone .
Gone , gone , gone . ”
Call it remarkable , call it miraculous — such spontaneous remissions are as fascinating to physicians and scientists as they are rare .
Doctors would like to understand cases like Matzke ’s , who was given just 18 months to live but would survive another 18 years .
And although a recurrence of the cancer — this time in his brain — would eventually claim his life on November 8 , 1991 , the fact that his lung tumor disappeared completely begs for an explanation .
Pinning down spontaneous remissions has been a little like chasing rainbows .
It ’s not even possible to say just how frequently such cases occur— estimates generally range from 1 in 60,000 to 1 in 100,000 patients .
Many cases , when subjected to close scrutiny , prove not to have been remissions at all .
According to Stephen Barrett , a retired psychiatrist who operates Quackwatch , a number of people claiming to have had spontaneous remissions or to have been cured by alternative treatments never had cancer in the first place .
Barrett , who has tracked claims of cures through alternative therapies , says some people were given mistaken diagnoses .
Other claims , he says , are outright scams , used to promote books and videos that purport to share the secret of curing cancer or AIDS .
But genuine cases do exist , and throughout the history of medicine , physicians have recorded cases of spontaneous remission .
Such cases involve not just cancer but conditions like aortic aneurysm , a deadly ballooning of the heart ’s major artery ; Peyronie ’s disease , a deformity of the penis ; and childhood cataracts .
These cases cause doctors to scratch their heads in wonder at what brought them about .
But most of the attention on spontaneous recovery continues to focus on cancer , which takes the lives of over half a million people in the United States alone each year .
Although researchers say it is impossible to determine from a single patient what factors contributed to a spontaneous remission , Matzke ’s case provides a tantalizing clue that the immune system may sometimes be at work .
During his month of meditation and healthy living , white rings developed around his skin tumors , causing what doctors call a halo sign .
These findings are considered evidence that the immune system is attacking melanocytes , the pigmented cells in the skin that are the source of this cancer .
While most doctors say it is impossible to know just what causes the immune system to kick suddenly into action and induce a remission in any individual patient , Matzke ’s case underscores questions that researchers would like to answer :
Did his month of hiking , healthy eating , and meditating somehow strengthen his immune system ?
Did some as yet unidentified factor make his lung tumor mysteriously disappear ?

Today researchers are just beginning to piece together the clues they hope will allow them to see what makes a deadly cancer sometimes reverse course and melt away .
Much of their research focuses on the immune system , which they describe as a sort of military unit that protects the body from foreign invaders .
T lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell , serve as a frontline defense against invading bacteria and viruses .
A subtype of T lymphocyte , known as a natural killer ( NK ) cell , patrols the body , attacking and killing viruses and cancer cells .
Researchers are studying how NK cells recognize cancer cells as abnormal and how other cells , known as regulatory T cells , can command NK cells to hold their fire , in order to prevent them from attacking the body ’s own tissues .
Despite the remarkable insights researchers now have about the immune system , it remains a daunting task to develop immune modulators — drugs that can mimic the immune system or trigger it into action .
That is because there are a few dozen distinct immune cells that release between 50 and 100 signaling molecules — molecules that tell the other cells what to do and when .
When the relationships among these cells and molecules are graphed , the result looks like a plate of spaghetti .
Altering the behavior of one cell or molecule can upset the entire system .
Barnett Kramer , a medical oncologist and director of the Office of Medical Applications of Research within the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , says the complexity of these relationships makes it as difficult to cure cancer with immune modulators as it is to “ repair a fine watch with a screwdriver and a hammer . ”
Even when the immune system is aided by immune - modulating drugs , cancer remains a wily adversary : Cancer cells can dress up in a clever disguise by cloaking themselves in clumps of platelets ( cells that assist in blood clotting ) as they travel through the bloodstream .
Since the immune system does not normally attack its own platelets , the camouflage provides safe passage to the cancer cells as they migrate to distant parts of the body .
According to Robert Weinberg , a leading cancer researcher and founding member of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a number of “ built - in native defenses ” usually prevent the development of cancer .
For example , the body ’s cells can recognize “ signaling imbalances ” in their own internal circuitry that might cause them to proliferate wildly , causing cancer .
When an imbalance is recognized , the bad cells are “ hard wired , ” says Weinberg , to kill themselves , “ to commit suicide . ”
In the absence of this and other defense mechanisms , Weinberg says , “ cancer development would be inevitable , and we would be covered by tumors by the time we ’re several years old . ”
Because cancers have to trick the immune system and defeat a number of the body ’s other defenses in order to grow to the point where they become clinically apparent , it is surprising that some people with late - stage cancers like Matzke ’s can undergo spontaneous remission .
On the other hand , regression of early microscopic cancers may occur more readily and may be common .
A microscopic cancer can be likened to a paper fire in a wastebasket : A small fire may be easily contained and may even burn out without incinerating the house .
But once a fire escapes the wastebasket and the drapes and furniture go up in flames , the chances that the house will escape destruction are slim indeed .
Even more remarkable is that when the body does somehow induce a late - stage spontaneous remission , sending metastatic cancers spinning in reverse until they vanish , the body not only overcomes the evasions and counterattacks mounted by the cancer , it does so without the terrible side effects that can accompany current cancer treatments .
The holy grail of cancer therapy is certainly to find a way to trigger this most remarkable of nature ’s defenses .
But is it possible ?
Life - Saving Infections ?
One of the earliest systematic efforts to understand spontaneous remission was made by William Coley , an American bone surgeon born in 1862 .
Coley was driven to his research following the death of the first patient he would diagnose with sarcoma , a cancer that affects bone and muscle .
The patient , 17 - year - old Bessie Dashiell , who was a close friend of John D. Rockefeller Jr. , came to Coley with pain and swelling in her right hand .
When a biopsy revealed that the girl had sarcoma , Coley amputated her arm just below the elbow in a desperate bid to save her life .
Despite his efforts , the cancer spread throughout her body , and she died nearly three months after Coley diagnosed her .
Badly shaken by Dashiell ’s death , Coley pored over the medical records of previous sarcoma patients .
Anecdotal observations of patients dating back to the 1700s had already provided a curious clue that pointed to the immune system as a possible player in the body ’s fight to ward off cancer .
Doctors noticed that some cancer patients who suffered serious infections recovered from their cancer shortly afterward .
This led doctors to infect patients with organisms that cause syphilis , gangrene , and erysipelas — a serious skin infection , known in the Middle Ages as Saint Anthony ’s fire , that could invade the lymph nodes , a part of the body ’s immune system .
Unfortunately , a number of patients died from the infections instead of their cancer ; just how many is hard to say since medical studies in the 1800s were not methodical and often consisted of case reports .
Coley nevertheless believed there was something to be gained from such experiments , and so he scoured hospital medical records for cases of spontaneous remission in sarcoma patients .
In 1891 , when he came across a report of a German immigrant in New York City who had recovered from sarcoma after he developed erysipelas , Coley spent weeks tracking him down among the city ’s tenements .
When he found the patient quite alive and fully recovered , Coley became determined to test his hypothesis that sarcoma patients could be cured by infection .
Coley declared , “ Nature often gives us hints to her profoundest secrets and it is possible that she has given us a hint which , if we will but follow , may lead us on to the solution of this difficult problem . ”
Coley spent the rest of his career , until he died in 1936 , perfecting recipes for a brew of infectious agents and their toxins that could stimulate an immune response — without killing the patient .
His efforts met with variable successes and failures .
Parke - Davis produced the toxins , then known as mixed bacterial vaccines , or MBVs .
By the 1940s — when researchers discovered that a chemical warfare agent , nitrogen mustard , suppressed cancer — chemotherapy with nitrogen mustard and other agents , along with radiation therapy and surgery , began to supplant Coley ’s toxins .
In 1953 Parke - Davis ceased production of MBVs .
Yet as recently as 2005 , doctors at Dartmouth and Harvard universities concluded that Coley may have been right that some infections , particularly those caused by Streptococcus , might cause tumor regression .
In 1999 , a comprehensive review was performed of scientific studies of Coley ’s toxins .
Scientists found that the 128 patients treated between 1890 and 1960 with Coley ’s toxins fared as well as 1,675 similar patients treated with conventional methods in 1983 .
However , the researchers said the study was small and subject to bias , leaving their findings in doubt .
Currently , the toxins are still available on a “ compassionate use ” basis in nine countries , including Germany and the Bahamas ; one clinic in the United States also uses a preparation based on Coley ’s toxins .
As doctors and patients have become increasingly aware of the limits of conventional treatments for certain cancers , some doctors are looking back to Coley ’s toxins and how nature pulls off its occasional and surprising cures .
The hope that a drug or mind - body connection could be used to trigger a spontaneous remission has led researchers to study both the intricacies of the immune system and the mind , and the connections between them .
Looking for Answers : Body and Mind
Studying the immune system ’s reaction to cancer is now serious business .
Immune modulating drugs targeted to attack certain cancers have achieved blockbuster status in the past decade .
Rituximab , a monoclonal antibody that attacks cancer cells in patients with a certain subtype of B - cell lymphoma , was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 .
By 2005 , sales of rituximab reached $ 1.8 billion .
Researchers at biotech companies around the globe are devoting their careers to the development of other immune modulators , and a number of new agents are in the pipeline .
While Weinberg acknowledges the contribution made by Coley in instigating current research into the immune system as a way to fight cancer , he cautions that beyond Coley ’s original observation that there is a connection between the immune system and cancer , there is little to be learned from the rare instances of spontaneous remission .
First , he says , it is hard to find real cases , since many turn out to be “ hokum . ”
He adds , “ If you look closely at these cases , you find [ many ] were dissembling . ”
Weinberg , a middle - aged man with a trim mustache and a formal but genial manner , says it is impossible to learn lessons that can be generalized to most cancer patients from rare and idiosyncratic cases of spontaneous remission .
“ We need to work with reproducible phenomena that we can [ test ] 5 , 10 , 100 times over to verify the results , ” Weinberg says .
Performing scientifically sound experiments that can be reproduced over and over is exactly what Weinberg and his colleagues are doing .
Antoine E. Karnoub , another researcher at Whitehead , performs experiments on living human and mouse cells that are kept in a freezer packed with liquid nitrogen .
When he opens the freezer lid , white clouds escape .
Karnoub quickly closes the lid and explains that the human cells he tests were removed from patients during surgery or from biopsy specimens .
Many of the human donors died decades ago , but their cells are kept alive and reproducing so that Karnoub and others can test them and observe their interactions with the body ’s natural defenses .
Eventually , says Weinberg , the scientific insights learned from researchers like Karnoub may help others develop anticancer drugs .
Other mechanisms besides the immune system may also play a role in spontaneous remission , according to Caryle Hirshberg , coauthor of Spontaneous Remission :
An Annotated Bibliography and a consultant for the Institute of Noetic Sciences ( the term “ noetic ” here relates loosely to mind - body connections ) .
The bibliography provides the most comprehensive review available of the published literature on spontaneous remissions .
Reports included in the bibliography indicate that some cancers regressed after they outgrew their blood supply and underwent necrosis , or tissue death .
This observation led researchers to develop antiangiogenesis drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels .
Bevacizumab , the first angiogenesis inhibitor approved by the FDA , is in use now to treat colon cancer .
Other patients improved when they experienced changes in their estrogen , thyroid , or growth hormone levels .
Some patients improved after marked temperature elevations , with or without infection .
Finally , a number of reports suggest that some emotional , spiritual , or mind - body connection may have induced a spontaneous remission .
The scientific evidence that mind - body connections might induce self - healing is limited and conflicting .
Nonetheless , some patients and physicians believe the mind plays a powerful role in both the development of cancer and its treatment .
Alice Epstein , a mathematician and sociologist , was diagnosed in 1985 with cancer of the kidney and told she should have her left kidney removed right away .
One month after having her left kidney removed , the cancer spread to both her lungs , and she was informed she had just two to three months to live .
Like Matzke , she was advised to undergo immediate treatment .
Epstein , who says she had a “ cancer - prone personality , ” then turned to psychosynthesis , which she describes as a “ combination of psychotherapy and spiritual therapy . ”
It helped her overcome depression , difficulty expressing anger , and suppression of her own needs in order to please others — traits she and some psychologists believe are characteristic of the cancer - prone personality .
Although she never received any medical or surgical treatment for the deadly cancer invading her lungs , six weeks after starting psychosynthesis , her tumors began to shrink .
Within one year , they had disappeared without a trace .
That was 22 years ago .
Epstein , now healthy and 80 years old , tells her story with good - natured grace .
But she acknowledges that despite contact with many other people with cancer , she has not met anyone who had a spontaneous remission as she did , despite their efforts .
The problem with anecdotes is that they can so easily mislead ; it does n’t take long to find anecdotes that tell a different story .
Dr. O’Donnell recalls a patient of his with metastatic colon cancer .
The patient , whom we ’ll call Don R. , was told by his surgeon he had just six months to live .
O’Donnell says R. became so distraught that he constantly checked the calendar on his watch , and as each new month ticked forward , he grew more and more anxious .
On the night his watch was to tick forward to the six - month mark , O’Donnell had to hospitalize R. for his distress .
He placed the patient directly across from the nursing station where he could be closely monitored .
The man lived through the night — and went on to survive another 14 years , as his cancer never progressed ( he eventually died of a pulmonary embolus ) .
But for those 14 years , R. continued to check his calendar anxiously for the passage of every month .
O’Donnell says he tells this story as a reminder of how difficult it is to make a precise prognosis , but R. ’s story also challenges assumptions that anxiety and stress lead to a bad outcome while positive feelings automatically bring a positive outcome .
Doctors know that case reports can lead to flawed conclusions .
Cause and effect can be confused .
Unrelated events may be thought to be related .
If , as some people believe , the mind can have a positive influence on the immune system — which in turn can fight off cancer — it would stand to reason that R. , who was terribly stressed , might have been expected to do very badly .
On the other hand , patients like Matzke and Epstein could skew perceptions about mind - body effects through a form of reporting bias called the survivor effect .
The survivor effect occurs when only surviving patients tell their stories , leaving out those patients who may have tried positive thinking or prayer but died .
Collections of such case reports can be highly misleading .
To determine whether an intervention is truly effective , researchers must perform clinical trials that compare all patients treated with an intervention .
Unfortunately , there are few such studies , and those that exist have led to conflicting results .
The most celebrated study showing a dramatic reduction in mortality with psychological support was performed by David Spiegel , a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
Spiegel ’s study , published in 1989 in The Lancet , showed that women with terminal breast cancer who were enrolled in supportive therapy had a significant survival advantage over women who were not enrolled in support groups .
But several well - performed studies since 1989 fail to reproduce the finding .
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ) in 2001 found no survival benefit for the 158 women randomized to support groups compared with the 77 women who were not enrolled in the groups .
It did , however , show that women who were in support groups experienced an improved quality of life .
None of the patients from the groups could be interviewed because they have all died , and the groups were disbanded at the end of the study , according to Patricia Fobair , who co-led the support groups with Spiegel .
Fobair , a clinical social worker who was herself diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987 , recalls one of the group patients , an engineer , who came to the group depressed and with marital problems .
With encouragement from the support group , the woman went back to school to become an artist , resolved her marital problems , and became someone who was “ fulfilled , ” according to Fobair .
Despite conflicting study results , doctors agree that our minds clearly do have some effect on our physiology and overall health .
When frightened , our hearts race , our palms become sweaty , and our pupils dilate .
Stress can cause changes in the function of the immune system , including reducing the number of natural killer cells that are known to battle cancer .
An entire field of study called psychoneuroimmunology now examines such connections .
Weinberg , who says he used to doubt claims that mental states could affect the course of cancer , now wonders .
To show why , he pulls out a raft of study results collected in a large three - ring binder and points to several studies showing that mice subjected to stress developed more cancers than normal mice .
The effects of stress can be profound .
A fascinating study published in NEJM last year found that the newly bereaved — those who had lost a husband or wife within the past month — have a 53 to 61 percent increase in the risk of death .
Yet attempts to harness the power of the mind or spirit to induce self - healing through techniques like prayer , support groups , therapeutic touch , and meditation have been largely disappointing .
For example , doctors at Duke University thought that prayer might help patients who were undergoing cardiac surgery for stent placement .
But when they concluded a multicenter study of intercessory prayer for their patients , there was no reduction in six - month mortality .
Similarly , a study of “ therapeutic touch ” published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that practitioners who insisted they could sense a patient ’s “ energy field ” proved incapable of even sensing the presence or absence of a test subject ’s hand .
In that study , therapeutic touch practitioners , prevented from visually observing the subject ’s hand , were able to locate the hand correctly in only 122 of 280 test runs — 44 percent of the time , a rate roughly equivalent to chance alone ( 50 percent ) .
The authors of a 2006 study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology did find that breast cancer patients who had more social ties survived longer than did socially isolated women .
However , the authors concluded that socially isolated women fared worse because they had less access to medical care .
When patients do better , there is a temptation for doctors — whether they practice alternative or conventional medicine — to take credit for such outcomes .
Kramer of the NIH says , “ There is a tendency to believe that whatever you did caused the response , whereas we underestimate the natural course of the disease . ”
The fact that some patients do better or experience a regression following a seemingly useless treatment has raised questions about a possible placebo effect .
Exploiting the placebo effect is explained by Campbell Murdoch , who writes in the British medical journal BMJ , “ Another reason for using so - called ineffective treatments is to allow time to pass while the patients get better .
Cold bottles were not treatments , they were like egg timers .
You gave the patient or the parent an ineffective colored liquid in a bottle and asked them to take 5 ml four times a day out of it .
By the time the bottle was empty , the patient was better , not because the contents worked , but because time had passed .
It was effective , but for the wrong reason . ”
But if a ( useless ) treatment is not the cause of an improved outcome , could the placebo effect explain some cases of spontaneous regression ?
It appears unlikely , since that effect would be expected to work through the same pathways already being tested with various mind - body techniques .
If the placebo effect were at work , it should be observed in positive outcomes among people who join self - healing groups , pray , or visit Lourdes .
Yet despite intense interest in such cures over the millennia , whether religious or secular , scientific or mystical , none of the approaches based on mind or spirit has proven to be particularly effective .
Even the famed Lourdes , with over 1 million visitors annually , boasts only a few dozen “ miracle cures ” ever , according to the Vatican — leaving vast numbers of pilgrims to cope otherwise with cancer and other serious illnesses .
Underestimating Spontaneous Regression
While late - stage spontaneous regressions are as rare as hens ’ teeth , early spontaneous remissions of microscopic cancers may be quite common — and their frequency may have been underestimated .
And that might be causing an unexpected problem .
With the advent of new technologies , like CT scans , MRIs , and more sophisticated blood and urine tests , doctors are discovering many cancers at very early stages .
At first , doctors and patients welcomed early diagnosis , assuming that early detection would lead to improved survival .
But that assumption can cause “ medical mischief , ” according to the NIH ’s Kramer , who says that detecting such early - stage cancers can cause more harm than good if the cancer cells were unlikely to have caused a problem over the person ’s lifetime .
This , says Kramer , is especially true with prostate cancer and some melanomas and breast cancers that may never go on to cause harm .
In those cases treatment offers none of the benefits while exposing the patient to the measurable harms of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy .
As the “ medical mischief ” caused in part by an underestimation of the frequency of early spontaneous remissions has become apparent , doctors have had to abandon several cancer screening programs .
For example , when researchers developed a simple urine screening test for neuroblastoma — a childhood cancer that arises in immature nerve cells — officials in Japan launched a public health campaign to screen infants .
By 2001 , over 90 percent of infants were being screened .
When the cancer was detected , the children were treated with surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy .
But as it was later learned , many of the babies had a slow - growing form of neuroblastoma that would either cause no problems or disappear spontaneously .
Worse , the interventions did not reduce the number of deaths from neuroblastoma — but the unnecessary surgeries and treatments did cause some deaths , leading authorities to halt the program .
Similar concerns are now being raised about prostate and breast cancer screening programs that detect many slow - growing , less aggressive cancers that are generally more common in older patients than the more aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancer that tend to occur in younger patients .
Like many areas of medicine , progress comes in fits and starts .
At the same time that mistakes are made , small triumphs are achieved .
Coley ’s legacy lives on in the bacillus Calmette - Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine now in use to treat some forms of bladder cancer .
Doctors instill the bacillus into the bladders of patients who have been treated for superficial bladder cancer .
The bacillus provokes the immune system to produce an inflammatory response that in turn prevents cancer recurrence .
Derived from a bovine form of tuberculosis , BCG is used as a vaccine against TB in many parts of the world .
Although medical advances have dramatically improved outcomes in certain cancers — treatment of testicular cancer and childhood leukemia now routinely lead to cures — when it comes to many other cancers , modern medicine has yet to come close to nature ’s handiwork in inexplicably producing spontaneous remission without apparent side effects for people like John Matzke and Alice Epstein , who have experienced the rarest hints of nature ’s healing mysteries .
The equipment that technician Mark Klein learned was installed in the National Security Agency 's " secret room " inside AT&T 's San Francisco switching office is n't some sinister Big Brother box designed solely to help governments eavesdrop on citizens ' internet communications .
Rather , it 's a powerful commercial network - analysis product with all sorts of valuable uses for network operators .
It just happens to be capable of doing things that make it one of the best internet spy tools around .
" Anything that comes through ( an internet protocol network ) , we can record , " says Steve Bannerman , marketing vice president of Narus , a Mountain View , California , company .
" We can reconstruct all of their e-mails along with attachments , see what web pages they clicked on , we can reconstruct their ( voice over internet protocol ) calls . "
Inside the Secret Room Courtroom Clash !
A federal judge refuses to give AT&T back its internal documents , but orders the EFF not to give them out .
Whistle - blower 's Precognition
Years before the NSA 's warrantless surveillance program made national headlines , then - AT&T technician Mark Klein suspected his company was colluding with the government to spy on Americans .
Exhibit A ?
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein offers a firsthand account of his alleged discovery of a secret room routing American internet traffic straight to the NSA – and provides documents he says proves his case .
The Ultimate Net Monitoring Tool
A little - known company called Narus makes the packet - inspection technology said to be the basis of the NSA 's internet surveillance .
Here 's how it works .
Plus :
Daily updates from 27B Stroke 6 , the Wired News security and privacy blog
Narus ' product , the Semantic Traffic Analyzer , is a software application that runs on standard IBM or Dell servers using the Linux operating system .
It 's renowned within certain circles for its ability to inspect traffic in real time on high - bandwidth pipes , identifying packets of interest as they race by at up to 10 Gbps .
Internet companies can install the analyzers at every entrance and exit point of their networks , at their " cores " or centers , or both .
The analyzers communicate with centralized " logic servers " running specialized applications .
The combination can keep track of , analyze and record nearly every form of internet communication , whether e-mail , instant message , video streams or VOIP phone calls that cross the network .
Brasil Telecom and several other Brazilian phone companies are using Narus products to charge each other for VOIP calls they send over one another 's IP networks .
Internet companies in China and the Middle East use them to block VOIP calls altogether .
But even before the product 's alleged role in the NSA 's operations emerged , its potential as a surveillance tool was not lost on corporate America .
In December , VeriSign , also of Mountain View , chose Narus ' product as the backbone of its lawful - intercept - outsourcing service , which helps network operators comply with court - authorized surveillance orders from law enforcement agencies .
A special Narus lawful - intercept application does this spying with ease , sorting through torrents of IP traffic to pick out specific messages based on a targeted e-mail address , IP address or , in the case of VOIP , phone number .
" We needed their fast packet - detection and inspection capability , " says VeriSign Vice President Raj Puri .
" They do it with specialized software that can isolate packets for a specific target . "
Narus has little control over how its products are used after they 're sold .
For example , although its lawful - intercept application has a sophisticated system for making sure the surveillance complies with the terms of a warrant , it 's up to the operator whether to type those terms into the system , says Bannerman .
That legal eavesdropping application was launched in February 2005 , well after whistle - blower Klein allegedly learned that AT&T was installing Narus boxes in secure , NSA - controlled rooms in switching centers around the country .
But that does n't mean the government could n't write its own code to do the dirty work .
Narus even offers software - development kits to customers .
" Our product is designed to comply ( with ) all of the laws in all of the countries we ship to , " says Bannerman .
" Many of our customers have built their own applications .
We have no idea what they do . "

No -one is assuming responsibility for moving the plane
Enlarge Image
The decommissioned aircraft was being driven through the city at the weekend when the driver got lost and then abandoned the plane .
The Boeing used to belong to the private company Air Sahara .
Some locals are angry that no action is being taken to move the plane .
Others say it is a tourist attraction .
It appears that after taking a wrong turn , the driver found himself facing a flyover that was too low for him to take the plane under .
The driver has not been seen since and no -one is assuming responsibility for the 737 .
Sunday surprise
Restaurant owner Ramji Thapar is one of the puzzled residents of the Chembur area of the city .
The plane is causing problems for local businesses
He woke up Sunday morning to find the aircraft on a giant trailer abandoned on the road .
" Saturday night I shut shop and go home and everything is fine , " he told the BBC news website .
" Sunday morning when I get here , this aircraft is here near my restaurant ! "
The fuselage of the decommissioned aircraft , with the engine , wings and tail removed , was being taken by road to the capital Delhi late on Saturday night .
Reports say it was supposed to be used at a flight training academy .
The plane has become the centre of attraction with people coming from all over the city to take a look .
" I 've been fascinated with planes and never seen one so closely , " engineering student Vamsi Shastri said .
" It 's huge ! "
His friend Ankur Rane said , " It 's fascinating to see an airplane on the roads when one is only used to seeing cars and auto rickshaws . "
No joke
However , for Pradeep Malhotra , who runs a catering service in the area , the plane has become a huge problem because it is parked right in front of his shop .
Residents had assumed the problem would be quickly sorted
" My work is suffering because the food can not be loaded in the big vehicles , " he said .
" I have to load it in the smaller vans and then carry them to the bigger ones parked at the back .
" I do n't know how they are going to take it out because you can't reverse it , its too big , and you can't go further down the road . "
Some residents said they had not complained simply because they assumed that the authorities would be making it a priority to get the plane out of the city .
Five days on , it is still not clear who is responsible for the aircraft and its transfer to Delhi .
Contemplation on The Four Sublime States 3 . Sympathetic joy ( mudita )
Not only to compassion , but also to joy with others open your heart !
Small , indeed , is the share of happiness and joy allotted to beings !
Wherever a little happiness comes to them , then you may rejoice that at least one ray of joy has pierced through the darkness of their lives , and dispelled the grey and gloomy mist that enwraps their hearts .
Your life will gain in joy by sharing the happiness of others as if it were yours .
Did you never observe how in moments of happiness men's features change and become bright with joy ?
Did you never notice how joy rouses men to noble aspirations and deeds , exceeding their normal capacity ?
Did not such experience fill your own heart with joyful bliss ?
It is in your power to increase such experience of sympathetic joy , by producing happiness in others , by bringing them joy and solace .
Let us teach real joy to men !
Many have unlearned it .
Life , though full of woe , holds also sources of happiness and joy , unknown to most .
Let us teach people to seek and to find real joy within themselves and to rejoice with the joy to others !
Let us teach them to unfold their joy to ever sublimer heights !
Noble and sublime joy is not foreign to the Teaching of the Enlightened One .
Wrongly the Buddha 's Teaching is sometimes consid-ered to be a doctrine diffusing melancholy .
Far from it : the Dhamma leads step by step to an ever purer and loftier happiness .
Noble and sublime joy is a helper on the path to the extinction of suffering .
Not he who is depressed by grief , but one possessed of joy finds that serene calmness leading to a contemplative state of mind .
And only a mind serene and collected is able to gain the liberating wisdom .
The more sublime and noble the joy of others is , the more justified will be our own sympathetic joy .
A cause for our joy with others is their noble life securing them happiness here and in lives hereafter .
A still nobler cause for our joy with others is their faith in the Dhamma , their understanding of the Dhamma , their following the Dhamma .
Let us give them the help of the Dhamma !
Let us strive to become more and more able ourselves to render such help !
Sympathetic joy that is strength and gives strength : this is the highest joy .
And what is the highest manifestation of sympathetic joy ?
To show to the world the path leading to the end of suffering , the path pointed out , trodden , and realized to perfection by Him , the Exalted One , the Buddha .

Critical Chain is an amazing book .
The narrative form — a novella detailing a technical project team and their search for a way to manage an uncertain process — is a big win , it highlights the important ways that Critical Chain Project Management handles risks and uncertainty and makes it visible where everyone can manage it .
The section on estimating tasks alone is priceless .
If you ca n’t afford a copy and your library does n’t stock it , borrow mine .
You must read this book if you participate in software development teams .

Twenty years later , The Mythical Man-Month : Essays on Software Engineering is still one of the most important books ever written about developing software , from the small to the large .
Read the book that spawned the expression , “ there is no silver bullet . ”
Measuring software productivity by lines of code is like measuring progress on an airplane by how much it weighs .
— Bill Gates
As the project progresses , the client ’s requirements change .
This is especially true if the client is given the opportunity to interact with the team and engage in the learning process :
Agile ’s claim that requirements are subject to change is a self - fulfilling prophesy .
There is no simpler or surer way to increase customer satisfaction over the long term than to let them experience the application as it grows and to rate your progress by how much their satisfaction increases with the software itself .
Life is not all project management and wrestling with customers .
is the most enjoyable text on the subject of combinatory logic ever written .
What other textbook features starlings , kestrels , and other songbirds ?
Relax with a copy and let your mind process the business side of development in the background .
You ’ll be a better manager for it !

Relax with a copy and let your mind process the business side of development in the background .
You ’ll be a better manager for it !
Hire people with a minimal competency .
Do not be seduced into accepting “ help ” from people who are not able to contribute to the team at this level .
Minimize parallelism .
Exploit the talent of your best developers by giving them chunks of related work .
Measure progress by continually re-estimating the work to be done and by customer satisfaction .
Educate the customer to prefer completed work over documentation and promises .
I ’m just finishing off some work with a corporate client before moving back to my natural position in product development ( with a really exciting company ! ) .
It ’s a good time to reflect back over what was straightforward and what was difficult , what worked and what did n’t .
It has been a very positive experience overall , and I have learned a few more things .
Here are a hotch - potch of thoughts about corporate projects , clumsily organized around a single metaphor .
Although very few managers ever express it directly this way , many behave as if developing a piece of software is like building something fairly simple out of bricks .
It might be something large .
But it ’s still fairly simple .
This is tempting .
The inexperienced person thinks that bricks are easy to understand : they ’re all the same : if you know how to work with one , you know how to work with them all .
You can measure the progress of building something out of bricks by counting the bricks in place .
And anyone can contribute , even if only by moving bricks from one place to another using brute force .
When you have a brick by brick mentality , deep in your soul you believe that a project contains a fixed amount of work ..
There are so many screens , so many lines of code .
You think this to be true because when you examine finished applications , you can count these things .
So you engage in a discovery step up front where you estimate how many screens and how much code will be needed , then you play some games with numbers of people and the amount of work they can do per day , and out comes an estimated ship date .
You believe that since the finished work contains a fixed number of bricks , it is possible to know in advance how many bricks will be needed , and where they belong in the finished software
This model of software development leads to several natural assumptions about how to organize a project .
These assumptions are logical consequences of the belief that software is made of bricks :
The brick by brick mentality thinks of software development as making a pile of bricks .
Think of the stereotypical Egyptian Pyramid as an example .
There are so many bricks to pile and then you ’re done .
If it ’s all about moving bricks , That ’s a comforting thought .
Just keep those bricks moving .
This helps us with all sorts of problems .
Some people debate whether star programmers really are twenty times more productive than doofuses .
Who cares ?
As long as the doofus can move bricks , eventually the work will get done .
So if you have a poor performer , someone who is slow and not very careful , you can use them on a project .
Just find the right place for them where they can’t accidentally wreck the whole pyramid , and they can help .
Ok , they are not good with the tricky booby traps or aligning the windows to allow light to strike the altar at the solstice .
Fine .
But what about ferrying bricks from the dhow to the base of the pyramid ?
Does n’t that move the project forward ?
Ca n’t you hire almost any warm body with ten working fingers and put them to work somewhere ?
Perhaps they can fiddle with page layouts , or copy the work of more experienced developers when implementing new features that are similar to existing features .
But an extra pair of hands is always helpful , right ?
software is more complicated than bricks
This assumption is wrong .
The reason it is wrong is that software is deep .
It is not a simple pile of bricks .
Examining a finished piece of software , it is easy to discern surface forms like patterns , variable names , or rough organization .
But the motivations for these choices are often subtle and opaque to the journeyman .
You can observe this the next time you are interviewing developer candidates .
Ask them to name a design pattern : perhaps they respond , “ Singleton . ” Design patterns are surface forms .
Now ask them to explain what problem the pattern solves .
They respond , “ Ensuring there is exactly one of something . ”
We are still working with the surface form .
Ask why we just want just one of something like a database connection pool .
What problem are we solving ?
Why ca n’t we use class or static methods to solve this problem ?
What are the real - world issues with having 1,000 threads sharing a single database connection pool ?
How would you build ten pools ?
Or share connections without a single pool ?
All of these questions drive at the deeper issues underlying development choices .
A developer who treats their work as moving bricks , who simply copies the surface form of code they encounter , is oblivious to the motivations behind the code .
They do not know when to use it and when to forgo it .
They do not understand alternative ways of solving the same problem .
They reproduce it blindly ( and often incorrectly ) .
The result is software that superficially appears to be of acceptable quality because its surface form has things in common with good software .
However , just because good software may be constructed out of commands and strategies , this does not mean that software constructed of commands and strategies is good .
What is needed on a software development project are people who understand the nuances , the requirements , the underlying problems .
If you think that you are building a pyramid , what you want are architects , not slaves .
When you add people to a project who do not deeply understand their work or the problems the project faces , you create the superficial appearance of progress ( look at all the bricks ! ) , but you are slowly building up a mass of unworkable code .
You may not see the problems immediately , but in time you will discover that everything they have touched needs to be re-written .
determine the baseline competence required for a project and do n’t violate it
Once you understand that software is not a simple pile of bricks , you understand that the minimum level of competence required to contribute positively to a project is non-trivial .
You can decide for yourself whether you need the mythical great hackers or not .
But there is a minimum level of competence , and if you do not allow persons below that level onto your project , you will succeed .
If fact , you are far better off with a core of competent people and no sub-competent help than you are with the same group of people and the assistance of “ helpers ” on the side .
Those “ helpers ” require three or four times as much management attention as the core contributors if you are to keep them from breaking things .
And as we ’ll see below , re-organizing your project such that there are tasks to keep them busy is usually harmful in and of itself .
Protecting yourself from people unlikely to make a positive contribution may require adroit maneuvering on your part .
On one project , I explained that we could not complete the work in the time requested by the client .
The response was to offer us some part - time assistance by employees of the client .
Those particular employees may have been talented , but their experience was not a direct fit for the technical work of the project , and they did not have a full - time commitment to the success of the project .
Rejecting such “ assistance ” is tricky : other managers may have trouble with the idea that the project will move more slowly with the extra help , rather than move more quickly .
Those managers see your project as a pile of bricks , and you ’ll need to educate them if you are to avoid disaster .
The metaphor of a pyramid being built , brick by laborious brick is useful for illustrating another principle .
When you assume that an application is a pile of a million bricks , you assume that you can move bricks in parallel .
You can have one thousand people on the project , and if each places one brick per hour you will move forward at a constant rate of one thousand bricks per hour .
Software is not like this .
Parallelizing development has serious and sometimes fatal consequences .
The main problem is that the pieces are usually coupled in some way .
There are techniques for lowering coupling between “ bricks , ” but when you set out to place two related bricks simultaneously , you must , perforce , do some kind of design or thinking ahead of time as to how they relate so that you can place them properly .
Consider two pieces , and .
The natural dependency between them is thatdepends on .
The right thing to do is to build , and thenwhen you are happy with .
But the zealous manager with bricks on her mind asks , “ why ca n’t we decide on an interface , , betweenand , then build both at once ? ”
They want to build , thenandsimultaneously .
Of course , this constrainsandtremendously .
As you are building them , any flaw or shortcoming withyou discover as you build the pieces will result in rewriting bothand .
Only you are under time constraints so , you just patch and kludge , because the schedule does not have time allocated for redoing things : your motivation in parallelizingandwas to save time , so the schedule has no room for the possibility that it will take longer to writeandin parallel than in series .
This makes no sense to the person who thinks software is made of bricks !
Looking at the finished brick , what ’s the problem , it takeshours to makehours to make , why would making them in parallel take longer thaninstead of roughly Try the following : give pieceto one person , wait for it to be done , and then give pieceto another .
Whoops , when the person working onhas a question about howworks , they have to track down the author and interrupt her .
And if working onteaches you something about , is the person working onsupposed to change ?
Or is the original developer supposed to backtrack and change it ?
This explains a well - known nugget of wisdom :
One reason adding people to a late project will cause it to slip further is that you are increasing parallelism .
If the project was originally at or beyond its natural limit , further parallelism lowers productivity .
Or another example .
You have 100 reported bugs to fix .
You have 100 people .
Do you assign one bug to each person ?
No way !
Experience shows that bugs are rarely fully de-coupled form each other .
You have to analyze the bugs as a team and try to guess their causes and relationships .
If bug forty - nine is a simple text change on a page , anyone can fix it .
But if bugs one , four and nine are all related , you need one contributor to address them simultaneously .
Sending three people in to fix them in parallel thing would be a disaster .
Any time two or more pieces are strongly related either by design or by coupling in the application , it is a mistake to give each one to different people to build or fix .
In software , you want to minimize dependencies between pieces , which in turn means being very , very careful to minimize parallelism .
Obviously , there must be some parallelism on any project with more than one contributor .
But every project has a natural maximum amount of parallelism .
Gratuitously chopping tasks into bricks to increase parallelism beyond this natural limit lowers productivity rather than increases it .how to make the team twice as productive without parallelizing everything
What if you need two pieces , and , and you ca n’t wait for the normal amount of time to developand then ?
Here ’s an idea : instead of treating them like bricks and trying to developandin parallel , why not simply hire one person who works twice as quickly ?
And have them developandin series ?
Think about this for a moment .
There are a lot of claims out there that good people are three , five , ten , even twenty times as productive as the average .
This seems intuitively wrong : when you look at their finished work , it rarely looks that much different from the work of the average person .
So you figure the claims ca n’t be correct .
The finished work of the allegedly great person does n’t look too outlandish .
Ok , it hasandinstead of loops , and now that we look at it , the so - called great person seems to deliver fewer bricks , not more .
What ’s going on ?
Let ’s think about bricks for a moment .
What if this essay right , and many times building bricks in parallel takes more time than building bricks serially ?
What if it ’s very hard to coördinate the interfaces and contracts between pieces that are built by different people ?
If most projects assign related bricks to different people , and most projects further compound this error by trying to “ exploit parallelism , ” you can get a big productivity win just by bucking the popular choice and asking one person to do all of the related work themselves .
They ’ll be as productive as a team of other people simply because they are n’t burdened with the heavy cost of parallelism and from the wrong people working on pieces .
Of course , you need someone who is able to keep two pieces in their head at one time .
That ’s one of the advantages of hiring good people : they do n’t necessarily need to build things that are twice as complicated : if they can keep twice as much in their head at one time , they can build related things without incurring the costs of splitting development between people .
The other wrong assumption about software being like bricks is that you can measure progress on a software development project by examining physical features of the software , by counting bricks .
The underlying thought is that you imagine the finished software as a pyramid of bricks , a pile of them .
You count how many bricks will be in the finished application .
Now you can measure your progress by counting how many bricks are “ done .
” This is very wrong , and it leads to troubled projects .
The first problem with this assumption has been given above : if you need a million bricks for your application , you ought to be able to make use of absolutely anyone to move the project forward in some small capacity .
As long as they move a brick an hour , they are helping .
So , a brick a day , a million bricks … let ’s employ 1,000 sweating slaves for ten hours a day for one hundred days and we ’ll have our pyramid .
All we need are an architect and a team of overseers with sharp whips to see to it that they work without flagging .
But what happens when the millionth brick is placed and we are nowhere near completion ?
It turns out that software ’s requirements are fluid , so fluid that you could place as many bricks as you like and still not be finished .
In fact , moving a lot of bricks is counterproductive : the physical manifestation of software , like written code , design specifications , unit tests , and so forth , have mass just like bricks .
And if you want to redo things , the more mass you have , the harder it is to move and reshape it .
In that sense , software is exactly like bricks .
Only , what you want to is to move the minimum number of bricks required to test your assumptions about whether the software is complete enough .
It will never be complete , but trying to measure completeness by bricks is wrong .
There are only two meaningful ways to measure progress on a software development project : the first is to ask the team to estimate how much work remains , given the most up - to - date expectation for the form of the finished application .
The second is to measure customer satisfaction .
how to measure progress on software development projects with estimated work remaining Given the most current understanding of what is to be done to complete the application , it is meaningful to ask the team to estimate how much time will be required to complete the work .
This sounds conservative , even traditional .
Does n’t every project do this when they prepare the plan ?
What ’s the catch ?
The catch is , if you only do it once , you only know your progress once .
This differs markedly from the traditional model , where you plan once , estimate once , and thereafter you measure progress against your plan , rather than estimating again .
To measure meaningful progress , you must re-estimate on a regular basis .
If you wish to give a meaningful progress report every two weeks , you must ask the team to estimate the work remaining every two weeks .
if , instead , you simply take how many bricks you thought you needed a few months ago , count how many have been moved to date , and calculate the work remaining through simple subtraction , your reports are drifting further and further away from reality every fortnight .
We know that this does not work , both from experience in the field and from critical thinking : as the project progresses , the client ’s requirements change .
This is especially true if the client is given the opportunity to interact with the team and engage in the learning process :
Agile ’s claim that requirements are subject to change is a self - fulfilling prophesy .
We also know that as we work with the software itself , we learn more about how much work is required to complete the software .
For example , if you load a project ’s team up with in appropriate contributors , maximize parallelism , and perhaps go three for three by minimizing testing and bug fixing , you will compound a tremendous “ technical debt ” over time .
Measuring “ progress ” against the original plan does not include the technical debt in your estimate of the work to be completed .
Asking the team to estimate the amount of work to be done gives them an opportunity to factor the consequences of technical debt into their estimates .
Or of any other factor that reflects what the team is learning over time .
In essence , you have an opportunity to include off - balance sheet items in your measurement of progress , whereas measuring against bricks would have excluded those factors .how to measure progress on software development projects with customer satisfactionMeasuring customer satisfaction is easy .
All you have to do is ask the customer .
A successful project increases satisfaction over time .
An unsuccessful project does not .
I boldly posit that any project that increases customer satisfaction over time is a successful project , regardless of what was originally written in a specification .
Customer satisfaction is a key metric because software is not a pile of bricks .
It is impossible to predict with certainty the set of requirements that will result in maximum customer satisfaction at the end of the project , so you must measure satisfaction as you go .
That being said , there is a pitfall looming when you ask the customer to judge their own satisfaction .
Some customers have difficulty understanding the features and characteristics of software that will meet their needs in a cost - effective way .
They have trouble distinguishing good software from bad , good applications from lemons .
Although such a customer may need a not - so - big application , they may demand an Enterprise Solution
This manifests itself in the customer demanding proof of progress in the form of elaborate documents , plans , and diagrams instead of working software that solves a portion of their problem .
It manifests in the customer demanding proof that you ’ve “ hired up ” to meet their needs .
Although these things have their place , none of them are working software .
They are promises to develop software , and subprime promises at that .
It is easy to obtain short - term success with such a client : deliver what they ask for .
This is the exact business model followed by real estate developers specializing in inexperienced , first - time buyers : offer the superficial features that provide short - term excitement at the expense of long - term satisfaction .
In the case of software , you can dazzle the inexperienced customer with head counts , power points , and diagrams showing Jenga - piles of technology .
Should you do this ?
That is up to you , it depends on whether you wish to build short - term customer satisfaction at the expense of long - term satisfaction with the software itself .
If you wish to deliver long - term satisfaction with the software , you may need to educate the customer to focus on the software itself .
And that means delivering increments of a functioning application for the client to experience .
There is no simpler or surer way to increase customer satisfaction over the long term than to let them experience the application as it grows and to rate your progress by how much their satisfaction increases with the software itself .
Sometimes , it really does boil down to a few simple ideas , working in concert :

Modern Mother Worldly was very , very lazy .
All her children drove her crazy .
The Bible told her to spank and train them .
But society said she must never constrain them .
The fruit of rebellion she did now see .
On the day of judgment she will have no plea .
Modern Mother Worldly cast in hell !
Now what becomes of the children of such a ‘ Jezebel ’ !
— From the tract entitled , “ Perilous Times , ” sent to Quiverfull mother Andrea Yates shortly before she killed her five children
I ’ve been getting a lot of hits from a new article on Wikipedia on the Quiverfull movement , probably partially in response to a Nightline program on the movement which was shown January 3 .
I think the Wikipedia article is pretty good .
One thing I like about it is that it includes as a “ notable Quiverfull Family , ” Rusty and Andrea Yates .
Quiverfull movement people usually distance themselves from Andrea Yates , who killed her five children after attempting to stone them , dismissing her as a disobedient and ungodly mother , as not a “ true Christian , ” as mentally ill or otherwise just not a bona fide Quiverfull mom .
But my experience is there are more than a few women in the movement who are like Andrea Yates .
Unlike her , they have n’t been pushed to their breaking point yet .
Last July Andrea Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the murder of her five children .
She was then sent to a mental hospital .
After the trial , trial exhibits were uploaded to the internet , and so at last I was able to take a look at the actual teachings of the Yateses ’ long - time spiritual leaders , Michael Woroniecki and his wife , Rachel .
I knew Woroniecki was an “ itinerant ” preacher who traveled the world with his family , “ preaching the gospel , ” but I had n’t been able to learn much about his actual teachings .
Woroniecki proudly describes himself as a “ fire and brimstone ” preacher .
He believes his family is all that remains of “ true Christianity , ” comparing himself with Noah , whose family was spared the flood described in the Bible ’s book of Genesis .
He shares the distinctives of the Quiverfull movement : the reverence for the “ fruit of the womb , ” i.e. , children , for voluntary poverty or “ simple living ” , homeschooling and Bible literalism .
He believes , though , that it is evil and sinful for men to hold regular jobs and for women to be at home with the children while fathers work .
He teaches that families are to “ trust the Lord ” and that fathers should with their wives and children all of the time .
He pastors via letters and other written materials , and this is how he “ pastored ” the Yates family .
The Yates were intimately associated with the Woronieckis .
They had given up most of their material possessions and had purchased a bus from the Woronieckis in order to live in it with their three children , as the Wornieckis had previously lived in the bus with their six children .
The Yateses did n’t go to any sort of church meeting , believing with Woroniecki that the modern day church has the “ Jezebel ” spirit and is apostate .
Most of the teaching was man to man , Worniecki to Rusty Yates , although once in a while both Michael and Rachel Worniecki sent materials to Andrea Yates , all of it condemning .
Graphic from tract entitled “ Witch and the Whimp ” published by Michael Woroniecki .
In a tract entitled “ The Witch and the Whimp ” ( sic ) , Woroniecki sets forth his beliefs about women :
The word of God is very sobering when it warns “ For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is iniquity and adultery .
Although rebellion is common to all , the word of God continually emphasizes the particularly destructive power latent in “ the contentious woman . ”
Witchcraft , as seen in the nature of Eve , is the underlying ATTITUDE of contention or insistence to HAVE YOUR WAY .
Witchcraft is cooperating with Satanic motivation to manipulate , control and rule … This is the way of the adulterous woman .
She eats and wipes her mouth and says , “ I have done no wrong . ” ( Pr. 30:20 ) .
God says , “ I find more bitter than death the woman WHOSE HEART IS SNARES AND NETS AND HER HANDS ARE CHAINS .
Whoever is pleasing to God shall escape from her …
You may be married or single , brazen or reserved , striking or simple , a pagan or a Christian but as a daughter of Eve you are born with the nature of a witch .
No matter how blatant or subtle , “ God is not mocked . ”
This tract is primarily written to expose this “ spirit of Jezebel ” that Jesus says will rule
His people in the last days …
The woman Jezebel is the paradigm of the ultimate witchcraft which has a religious or “ Christian ” pretense .
..
She is a woman who could even intimidate a mighty man of God …
Today the false church is ruled by the “ spirit of Jezebel . ”
Whether it rules through an entire maternal organization … or ndividuals … the goal of seering a conscience is the same . …
It can rule through women who have positions of leadership or are simple and ordinary .
It rules because of the terrible bankruptcy for courageous men of decisive faith .
It rules because the so called pastors and preachers of today are passive whimps ( sic ) ruled by the underlying domination of their contentious wives .
A passive man may entertain a “ macho ” or charismatic image but his whimpish spirit is clearly seen by his refusal to rebuke the spirit of Jezebel , whether it be trying to rule as a “ preacher , ” “ teacher , ” or housewife .
( Emphases Worniecki’s , most scripture references removed . )
In the years before Andrea Yates killed her children , she had also been charged with caring for her elderly and ailing father who died in the year before the killings .
In this context , then , of back - and spirit - breaking daily caregiving while homeschooling her five young children , with virtually no community of women to support her , she had repeatedly received letters from the Woronieckis , her spiritual leaders , berating her for her spiritual disobedience and failings .
She had twice attempted to kill herself .
Shortly before she killed her children , she had received a tract entitled “ Perilous Times . ”
It included the graphic at the top of this post with the associated poem beneath it , “ Modern Mother Worldly . ”
The tract reads in part :
A woman is created to be a “ helper ” .
This does not mean a wife .
It means a servant , single or married .
if a girl does not know how to be a servant then she is learning how to be a ruler .
It ’s called witchcraft .
My daughters share and teach the gospel .
They do not preach .
They are completely content to be servants .
NO witchy contention to compete with their brothers …
The eternity of my children is my accountability while they are children and I would be sending them to hell if I raised them to think according to the standards of this world .
… If you REALLY want “ the best for your children ” then first YOU must get right with God .
… Yes it is far easier to just let the systems of the world do your job – EVERYBODY DOES IT – but you are the one who will reap the consequences .
… I can not stress how serious this whole thing is .
By the time a child is fourteen or fifteen , it ’s too late .
By this time , the thinking of the world that YOU have taught them , takes over .
You feed them with the world ’s ways and you reap exactly what you sowed .
… God is going to hold you accountable .
… The most severe statement Jesus makes in the whole Bible is in regards to how a child is treated ( Read Matt . 18:6 ) !
If Jesus makes such an extreme issue out of this how weighty it will surely be on the Day of Judgement !
( Emphases the author ’s . )
Shortly after receiving this tract , Andrea Yates killed her children .
She told a jail psychiatrist , “ It was the seventh deadly sin .
My children were n’t righteous .
They stumbled because I was evil .
The way I was raising them they could never be saved .
They were doomed to perish in the fires of hell . ”
One of her requests was that her head be shaved because she believed that on the flesh of her scalp , she must have born the “ mark of the beast , ” condemning her to eternity in hell for her failures as a wife , a mother , and a person .
The language of these materials which the Yateses believed were “ scriptural ” were more than just words , they were and are powerfully destructive and , I believe , they rise to the level of hate speech which ought to be legally prohibited , as other kinds of hate speech are legally prohibited .
To declare , as Woronieki does , that women are born “ with the nature of a witch , ” “ witches ” being understood to be evil and wicked in all the ways he describes , is hate speech , just as other kinds of hate speech are hate speech and ought to be treated as hate speech under the law , as discriminatory and sexist in the same way slurs against other marginalized groups , ethnicities and religious communities are treated .
For the purposes of this post , these words must be understood to have had the power to drive Andrea Yates over the edge , particularly given her isolation , the burdens of her life , and her struggles with mental illness .
How is it that men like Michael Woroniecki simply walk away from the devastation they have wrought in the lives of women and children ?
This is a man who at one point in his “ ministry ” was arrested after he followed a woman , a stranger , for two blocks , berating her to tears ; his actions were not restricted to hate speech in tracts and pamphlets and letters .
Who knows how many women have suffered at his hands in similar fashion ?
How is it that Rusty Yates walks away from the devastation he wrought in the lives of his wife and his children ?
He divorced Andrea , remarried a few days before Andrea ’s trial last July , then sped off with his new wife in a red Corvette .
Rusty Yates was the one person who knew what Andrea was reading , what she was thinking and hearing about God , women , about herself , as woman doomed to hell .
He was the one person who knew the burdens under which she was laboring day after back - breaking day , who knew what she was going through .
He knew exactly what was in the materials being sent to his family , and yet he did nothing as he watched Andrea descend into what must have been unbearable torment , believing that not only was she doomed to hell , she was dooming her children to hell as well , yet she was bound , as a woman , by the religious beliefs imposed on her , to continue to bear children , whom she believed she would continue to doom to hell .
How is it that any of the patriarchs simply walk away from the grave and deadly damage that they have caused and continue to cause in the lives of women they call “ Jezebel , ” women like me , women like Mary Jackson , women like Andrea Yates , and our children ?
How many more Andrea Yateses will we have , how many more children will be harmed , before we begin to hold men like these accountable , at a bare minimum , for discriminating against women because they are women , for terrorizing women because they are women ?
Take a look at those tracts , those words written about women ; why are they not legally prohibited as hateful and discriminatory , in the same way similar materials about any other group would be prohibited if they were widely and publicly circulated , and in particular , if they were causing real harm in the lives of real women and children ?

For those poking around the real estate market , it might be worthwhile to check out sites like buysiderealty.com , iggyshouse.com , zillow.com and trulia.com to see just how much online home shopping has changed lately .
In the past , most real estate sites primarily offered property listing services .
That ’s no longer the case thanks to improved online mapping services and the spread of broadband connections , which have allowed sites to take advantage of new technology .
What ’s more , as a means to drum up business , real estate sites have looked to expand their features to include services like alerts , “ heat maps ” showing active sales areas , video postings , home estimates and Q&A forums .
Some are even offering rebates to home buyers .
Chuck Cole , for instance , recently bought a home in Oakland , California , worth almost $ 450,000 -- and met his realtor just once through the entire month - long process .
Cole used the multiple listing service tool on buysiderealty.com to pick the properties he wanted to visit .
Later , after deciding on a house and submitting an offer , he had a realtor from buysiderealty.com handle the transaction .
For doing all the groundwork himself and bypassing a traditional realtor , Cole was rewarded with a rebate of over $ 8,000 , or 75 percent of the buyer ’s commission that buysiderealty .com earned from the deal .
“ We liked that everything was done pretty much by e-mail and phone .
When we ’ve worked with realtors in the past it was a big pain in the neck to try to connect with people in person and to have to go to their office , ” said Cole .
MARKET SLUMP SPURS BOOM
If you ’re looking to sell your house without using a real estate agent , consider a visit to iggyshouse.com , a sister concern of buysiderealty.com .
The site lures sellers with freebies like a multiple listing service , a listing on realtor.com and posts on other sites .
Home sellers once paid agents a premium for such services .
Iggyshouse.com also lets sellers and real estate agents post photographs , videos and details about the property for sale -- at no cost .
“ With 75 or 80 percent of sellers ( also ) being buyers , we know that if we give them this free service and they are self directed enough to sell on their own , there is a pretty good chance that they ’d want to use ( the ) buyside , ” said Joe Fox , chief executive of iggyshouse.com and buysiderealty.com .
“ We ’re basically giving a free service to educate consumers about another service that pays them to use it and that ’s exactly what is happening today , ” said Fox .
Another Web site that has entered this increasingly crowded space is zillow.com , which launched in early 2006 .
It not only offers free property listings , but also gives away a home valuation service it calls Zestimate .
Pete Flint , CEO of trulia.com , says the housing market ’s downturn has played to the strengths of real estate Web sites .
“ Although it ’s unfortunate what ’s going on in the housing market , it ’s really the online sites that are benefiting because consumers are spending a little bit more time before they make decisions and traditional real estate brokers are rethinking the way they ’re marketing themselves , ” Flint said .
“ So the change in the housing market has forced a change both in consumer behavior and forced a change within marketing activity for real estate professionals and we are a perfect platform for them both , ” he added .
Trulia.com , which launched in 2005 , has signed agreements with thousands of agencies that post all their available property listings on the site .
Trulia.com , in turn , generates revenue through advertisements placed on its site .
On the site you ’ll find services like trulia voices , which allows you to pose questions to local residents and agents on subjects as unexpected as the location of the nearest dog park .
If you ’d like to be alerted every time a property in a particular neighborhood goes on sale , trulia.com also sends you free alerts .
Another feature is “ heat maps ” that help you gauge the demand and average price of properties in certain spots .
“ The reality is that the actual ( real estate ) transaction is not changing , so people are still going to go to open houses and drive around neighborhoods , but the actual process of research for the real estate transaction has radically changed , ” said Flint .
PARIS  After devouring a Big Mac , a royal cheese , and paprika - flavored potato wedges dipped in mayonnaise , Romain Bertucca , a shaggy - haired 22 - year - old drama student wearing a beret and ripped jeans , explained why he eats McDonald's .

A fireplace and a plant are part of the newly designed interior of a McDonald 's in Wolfratshausen , south of Munich , Germany .
" It 's quick .
The food is hot .
It 's not like a sandwich .
It 's McDonald's , " he said , sitting on a stool with a friend on Thursday afternoon , overlooking Avenue de Wagram , two blocks from the Arc de Triomphe .
Mr. Bertucca is not alone in his endorsement of McDonald's , or MAKdoeNAHLDS , as it 's pronounced here .
In this land of haute cuisine where American tourists are customarily greeted with Gallic scorn , the world 's largest fast food company is more popular than ever .
Last year , McDonald 's sales in France grew by 8 % , almost doubling its growth in American sales , which have also rebounded in recent years .
Every 12 months , one out of two French people visit McDonald 's at least once .
Annually , they consume 22 million McDonald 's salads , 60,000 tons of French fries , 32,000 tons of beef patties , 12,000 tons of chicken , and 600 million buns .
" We hate it and go to it .
It 's our paradox , " a journalist for the French magazine Challenges , Alice Mérieux , said .
" We 're very anti-American in principle , but individually , if you 're going to the movies and have to eat in 10 minutes , you go to McDonald's . "
After years of stagnant sales , McDonald 's success also appears to be spreading throughout the rest of Europe , which posted first - quarter 2007 sales growth of 8.9 % , outpacing growth in the American market .
McDonald 's is now one of the biggest private - sector employers on the continent , with a workforce approaching 300,000 .
Even the harshest critics of McDonald 's acknowledge that the burger company has its admirers .
" French people are not against McDonald's .
They are against the Bush administration , " José Bové , the radical farmer and French presidential candidate , said in an interview .
Mr. Bové , who became a folk hero of the anti-globalization movement in 1999 when he and other protesters dismantled a McDonald 's in the southern French town of Millau , said he does n't personally know anybody who eats the food , which he calls la malbouffe , or junk food .
He blamed the growth of McDonald 's in his country on the incorrigible youth .
" Maybe it 's a new way of life .
Maybe they believe this is modernity , " he said .
To McDonald 's executives , the triumph of the burger company in France and , increasingly , around Europe is not a paradox but the fruit of a grand strategy cooked up by a Frenchman named Denis Hennequin , a maverick in a company that made its fortune on standardization and duplication .
The idea of Mr. Hennequin , the first non-American to hold the job of president of McDonald 's Europe since the company first arrived on the continent in 1971 , was to re-imagine the entire McDonald 's brand from a European perspective .
It was an idea that was first received coolly by Oak Brook , Ill. , executives , who now embrace Mr. Hennequin as a visionary .
" We truly became an international company , " he said in an interview .
" We were a global company , but I 'm not sure we valued the experiences of other parts of the world .
You can tell them yes , we are born in the USA , but we are made in France , made in Italy , made in Spain . "
Mr. Hennequin , a compact man with a balding pate , wide eyes , and a prominent nose , embodies the concept .
His hobbies are motorcycles and rock music .
In his spare time , he and his wife and three children perform as a family band and play covers of Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Rolling Stones .
His corporate role model is Apple 's Steve Jobs .
His favorite sandwich is the Big Mac , which , like most Europeans , he eats without a drop of ketchup .
When McDonald 's first arrived in Europe in the early 1970s , the selling point was America .
The American fast food experience  cheap , quick , sanitary  was an exotic import .
By the 1990s , the novelty wore off , while scares over mad cow disease , increasing concerns about fatty diets , and growing anti-American sentiment turned off customers .
McDonald 's was aggressively expanding but sales were sluggish .
Europe , Mr. Hennequin says , has a love - hate relationship with America .
" The problem comes when we are perceived as imposing a model , " he said .
McDonald 's , he figured , needed a new model .
After investing heavily in market research , Mr. Hennequin overhauled the whole operation , upgrading the décor , tweaking recipes , using more organic ingredients , providing nutrition labeling , and countering criticism from Mr. Bové and others by opening its restaurants to scrutiny .
For an American observer , the most striking change is the design .
The red and yellow kiddy template has been supplanted by more mature colors .
Outside signage in urban areas is more discreet and blends into the neighborhood .
Restaurants now have leather upholstery seating and some have gas fireplaces , candles , and hardwood floors .
McDonald 's has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to " re-image " about a third of its more than 6,300 restaurants in Europe and 70 % of its branches in France .
" Brand expression is in the store more than anything else , " Mr. Hennequin said .
" McDonald 's has ignored for too long the restaurant .
When you enter the restaurant , you enter the brand . "
Mr. Hennequin created a " design studio , " overseen by architect Philippe Avanzi , which offers franchise owners a choice of 10 schemes .
Each scheme is christened with a lofty name like " Eternity , " which feature straight wall patterns inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright , and " Origins , " favored by operators in scenic and rustic settings .
" Origins " is supposed to reproduce the ambience of a cozy chalet , with wrought - iron chandeliers and rough stone interior walls .
In a remodeled McDonald 's in the shopping mall in La Défense business district , the walls are decorated with giant images of lettuce and actual beef grinders and other kitchen utensils , solemnly framed as if they belonged in a museum .
Nutritional messages scroll along a teleprompter installed above large round benches wrapped in coffee - and vanilla - colored upholstery .
Ronald McDonald is nowhere in sight .
Even the McDonald 's play areas , called " Ronald Gym Club , " have been given a face - lift and are now being equipped with bicycle simulators , basketball hoops with electronic scoreboards , and intricate obstacle courses .
" If you have the right surroundings , suddenly everything is upgraded , " Mr. Hennequin said .
The food is still American but with European characteristics .
The anchors of the menu , the French fries and one - tenth - of - a - pound hamburgers , taste almost the same as they do in America .
McDonald 's performs the same " sensory evaluations " on its food supplies as it does across the Atlantic .
Buns , for example , are tested for " crown - seed coverage , " " heel color , " and shape and symmetry .
But McDonald 's is adding more and more " locally relevant " sandwiches and snacks .
In the United Kingdom , the company is introducing a hamburger called the " Limited Edition Deluxe " with bacon , served on a ciabatta roll , with " mature " cheddar , Batavia lettuce , grilled onions , tangy tomato relish , and garlic mayonnaise .
" It 's a much more complicated burger , " said Chris Young , who showcased the company 's summer European menu in a 12 - course tasting meal for reporters last week at McDonald 's modernist Germany head office in an upscale suburb of Munich .
In France , McDonald 's is rolling out le p'tit moutarde , a smaller - sized hamburger on a ciabatta roll smothered with a " sophisticated " mustard sauce .
To suit European tastes , the chicken filets in the European sandwiches have a " grilled profile , " instead of the more American " roasted profile , " Mr. Young said .
The expanding Starbucks - like McCafés , which are constructed inside the regular units and aimed at Europe 's aging population , serve lemon tartelettes ( a little pie dessert ) , flan nature ( a custard dessert ) , and cappuccinos poured in ceramic mugs .
The result of all of these changes is that Europeans who eat at McDonald 's have stopped associating the restaurant with America  just the way American consumers no longer have France in mind when they eat a cup of Dannon yogurt .
" The food is American , but if you say ,  McDonald's , ' I do n't think America , " said Jan Bastel , a 16 - year - old German student eating at a refurbished McDonald 's in Munich .
The branch occupies the first three floors of a neo - baroque building in front of a modern fountain in the middle of Karlsplatz , the historic old city entrance where hordes of shoppers , commuters , and tourists converge .
It 's busier than any McDonald 's in America .
The whole place has an international feel .
Green and yellow balloons festoon the spacious entranceways , which are decorated with white McDonald 's signs in Arabic , Japanese , Russian , English , and German .
Behind the counter , more than a dozen McDonald 's employees ring up 9,000 customers a day from 6 a.m. to 3 a.m. , serving them items like " Los Scharfos , " a fried snack made with gooey cottage cheese and jalapenos , and " El Pikante , " an oval beef patty in a pita dressed in picante sauce , and a " big bacon " burger topped with jalapenos .
( McDonald 's executives say Germans are fascinated by Mexican culture and love spicy foods , thus the jalapenos . )
On a recent afternoon , a middle - aged civil servant quietly ate a Filet O - Fish and sipped on a Coke during a 20 - minute work break .
On the second floor , a father was treating his son to chicken nuggets for his 12th birthday .
On the third floor , two teenage girls sat on cushy armchairs and snacked on a hamburger and a chicken sandwich .
Around them , McDonald 's employees from Afghanistan , Turkey , Bulgaria , and China swept and mopped the floors , while a Field Mob hip - hop video on a flat - screen television embedded in the wall provided the soundtrack .
Music is a running motif in the restaurant , which is decorated with wall prints of David Bowie and jazz musicians and is equipped with teenager - targeted video kiosks for downloading music and burning CDs .
Mr. Hennequin anticipates that the new European McDonald 's experience will become increasingly common in America .
" The U.S. is kind of using us as a guinea pig , " he said .
Already Oak Brook executives have borrowed a number of Mr. Hennequin 's ideas .
McDonald 's in America has launched its own redesign plan for many of its franchises and has adopted his " open doors " policy of inviting customers to take tours of franchise kitchens and meet executives and suppliers .
Mr. Hennequin started the policy after Mr. Bové destroyed the McDonald 's eight years ago .
American executives have also taken notice of the more direct European style of message communication .
For instance , McDonald 's Europe launched a poster campaign at its United Kingdom outlets that sought to raise the commonly low opinion of a McDonald 's entry - level job .
" Over half of our executive team started in our restaurants .
Not bad for a McJob , " the posters said .
Mr. Hennequin has attracted criticism for his McPassport initiative , which allows employees to transfer to any restaurant in the European Union , with some accusing him of trying to make it easier for Western European managers to hire cheap labor .
Mr. Hennequin said the policy responded to the wanderlust of younger employees .
" There is a tremendous amount of creative thinking that takes place in Europe and our system has benefited from it , " Jack Daly , a spokesman for McDonald 's , said .
Mr. Hennequin , who is in the running to someday succeed James Skinner and become McDonald 's first CEO from Europe , has already envisioned what he could do for McDonald 's in New York City .
" In New York , we have to change the image and design of the restaurants .
I think the European design would fit very nicely in a city like New York , " he said .
Greenhouse gases likely accounted for over half of the widespread warmth across the continental United States in 2006 , according to a new study in Geophysical Research Letters .
Last year 's average temperature was the second highest since recordkeeping began in 1895 .
The team found that it was very unlikely that the 2006 El Nino played any role , though other natural factors likely contributed to the near - record warmth .
When average annual temperature in the United States broke records in 1998 , a powerful El Nino was affecting climate around the globe .
Scientists widely attributed the unusual warmth in the United States to the influence of the ongoing El Nino .
El Nino is a warming of the surface of the east tropical Pacific Ocean .
The research team , led by Martin Hoerling at the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) Earth System Research Lab in Boulder , Colorado , also found that greenhouse gas increases in Earth 's atmosphere enhanced the probability of U.S. temperatures breaking a record in 2006 by approximately 15 - fold compared to pre-industrial times .
The authors also estimate that there is a 16 percent chance that 2007 will bring record - breaking warmth .
" We wanted to find out whether it was pure coincidence that the two warmest years on record both coincided with El Nino events , " Hoerling said .
" We decided to quantify the impact of El Nino and compare it to the human influence on temperatures through greenhouse gases . "
Preliminary data available in January 2006 led NOAA to place that year as the warmest on record .
In May 2007 , NOAA revised the 2006 ranking to second warmest after updated statistics showed the year was .08 F cooler than 1998 .
The annual average temperature in 2006 was 2.1 F above the 20th Century average and marked the ninth consecutive year of above - normal U.S. temperatures .
Each of the contiguous 48 states reported above - normal annual temperatures , and for the majority of states , 2006 ranked among the 10 hottest years since 1895 .
Using data from 10 past El Nino events observed since 1965 , the authors examined the impact of El Nino on average annual U.S. surface temperatures .
They found a slight cooling across the country .
To overcome uncertainties inherent in the data analysis , the team also studied the El Nino influence using two atmospheric climate models .
The scientists conducted two sets of 50 - year simulations of U.S. climate , with and without the influence of El Nino sea-surface warming .
They again found a slight cooling across the nation when El Nino was present .
To assess the role of greenhouse gases in the 2006 warmth , the researchers analyzed 42 simulations of Earth 's climate from 18 climate models provided for the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The models included greenhouse gas emissions and airborne particles in Earth 's atmosphere since the late 19th century and computed their influence on average temperatures through 2006 .
The results of the analysis showed that greenhouse gases produced warmth over the entire United States in the model projections , much like the warming pattern that was observed last year across the country .
For a final check , the scientists compared the observed 2006 pattern of abnormal surface temperatures to the projected effects of greenhouse - gas warming and El Nino temperature responses .
The U.S. temperature pattern of widespread warming was completely inconsistent with the pattern expected from El Nino , but it closely matched the expected effects of greenhouse warming .
" That attribution was not confirmed at the time , " says Hoerling .
" Now we have the capability , on the spatial scale of the United States , to better distinguish natural climate variations from climate changes caused by humans . "

Censured general evades subpoena to appear before Tillman hearing Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) revealed in a Wednesday hearing that Lieutenant General Philip Kensinger , who was censured Tuesday by the Army for deceiving investigators regarding the announcement of the death of Army Specialist Pat Tillman , has evaded a subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
" General Kensinger refused to appear today , " Chairman Waxman said in his opening statement .
" His attorney informed the committee that General Kensinger would not testify voluntarily , and if issued a subpoena would seek to evade service .
The committee did issue a subpoena to General Kensinger earlier this week , but US Marshals have been unable to locate or serve him . "
The announcement came at the start of a hearing on the friendly fire death of Tillman , an NFL player who joined the Army after the 9/11 attacks .
At the time , Tillman 's example was highlighted by the Bush administration to praise the heroism of Americans voluntarily fighting in the ' Global War on Terrorism ' before fratricide was revealed to be the cause of his death .
Wednesday 's hearing focused on what Defense Department officials knew about the cause of Tillman 's death .
The hearing included testimony from ex-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , appearing in this public setting for the first time since his November 2006 resignation .
Rumsfeld had told the committee he would not appear before the committee until late Tuesday night when he changed his schedule .
Also appearing before the committee were Gen. John P. Abizaid ( Retired ) , Former Commander , U.S. Central Command , Gen. Richard B. Myers ( Retired ) , Former Chair , Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Gen. Bryan Douglas Brown ( Retired ) , Former Commander , U.S. Special Operations Command .
While Waxman praised the witnesses for attending the hearing , and the Army for pressing its investigation , he also criticized the White House for failing to provide more information to the committee .
" The concealment of Corporal Tillman 's fratricide caused millions of Americans to question the integrity of our government , but no one will tell us how and when the White House learned the truth , " the California Democrat said .
Subdued Rumsfeld offers several ' I do not recalls ' Rep. Tom Davis ( R - VA ) offered his own harsh remarks on the manner of the announcement of Tillman 's death .
" Testimony from our previous hearing , and the results of six separate Army investigations all showed the tragic truth can only fall somewhere between screw - up and cover - up , between rampant incompetence and elaborate conspiracy , " the Ranking Republican on the committee forcefully stated .
" And once you 're descending that continuum , it almost does n't matter whether the failure to follow Army regulations ... was inadvertent , negligent , or intentional . "
But while Davis assailed the Pentagon 's secrecy , he was defensive of the White House .
" Nothing in our inquiry thus far demonstrates that the Defense Secretary or the White House were aware that this was a friendly fire incident before late May [ 2004 ] , " the Virginia Republican said .
" That we have not learned otherwise may perplex those who assumed the worst given the gross mishandling of this tragedy . "
After being sworn in , Rumsfeld offered a brief opening statement in which he expressed his regrets about the manner in which the Tillman family was notified of the Corporal 's death .
But , he insisted that he did not recall much about the circumstances beyond the statement he had already presented to the Pentagon 's Acting Inspector General in December 2006 .
" I do not recall when I first learned about the possibility that Corporal Tillman 's death might have resulted from fratricide , " he read from the memo .
He also acknowledged that he was informed of Tillman 's friendly fire death on May 20 , 6 days before the Tillman family was notified .
Following terse opening statements from the other witnesses , Rumsfeld then received extensive questioning from Rep. Davis .
He also said he could not recall the details during the questioning .
" I do n't recall precisely how I learned he was killed - it could have been internally , it could have been through the press , it was something that obviously received a great deal of attention , " he told Rep. Davis .
He also stated he had ' no recollection ' of discussing the matter with the White House until after it was revealed that Tillman had died from friendly fire .
Rumsfeld went on to say that he did not have any recollection of seeing the ' Personal - 4 ' or ' P - 4 ' memo from Afghanistan which warned senior leaders that Tillman 's death may have been caused by fratricide .
The ex-Secretary of Defense went on to answer a variety of questions about his complaints about the notification process on Tillman 's death .
He continued to express regret through the questioning with Davis .
" It is a most unfortunate situation that anyone has to agree is something that the department has to find ways to avoid in the future , " he told the ranking minority member .
Congressman challenges timeline on notification Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) was not fully satisfied with Rumsfeld 's explanation , and challenged how it was he was not informed until May 20 of the friendly fire incident .
" At least 30 people knew , including some of the highest ranking military officials in our government , " Cummings pointed out .
" If this was common knowledge among the top military ranks , Secretary Rumsfeld , something that was talked about across the backyard fences , how is it you did n't know ? "
Rumsfeld responded that there were 3 million people in the Department of Defense .
" It 's not possible for someone to know all the things that are going on , " he said .
Cummings was dubious , pointing back to Rep. Carolyn Maloney 's ( D - NY ) earlier referencing of memos written by Rumsfeld showing that he was aware of Tillman 's career in particular because of his story as an athlete - turned - soldier .
" I would not be asking you these questions if it were not for the fact that we had a hero here , one that you were well aware of , " the Maryland Democrat responded .
Cummings ' questions eventually caused some of Rumsfeld 's traditionally feisty spirit to emerge .
" I know that I would not engage in a cover up , " he said with some anger in his voice .
" I know that no one in the White House suggested such a thing to me .
I know that the gentlemen sitting next to me are men of enormous integrity , and would not participate in something like that . "
The Unlucky Few Lightning Strike Survivors Meet For World Conference
People who are struck by lighting stand a surprisingly good chance of surviving , but then often end up with mysterious ailments .
Lightning strike survivors are holding a world conference in a bid to overcome their trauma .
The revolving writing hut , in which Shaw wrote most of his best - known plays , has begun turning again in the grounds of his home , Shaw 's Corner , in Ayot St Lawrence , near Welwyn in Hertfordshire .
Ruth Gofton , National Trust Custodian at Shaw's Corner , said that putting the hut back in motion was important in preserving the author 's memory because " it reveals a great deal about the fascinating character of the man who lived there " .
" It is a very unusual idea , " Ms Gofton said , " that really goes to show what an eccentric and unusual man Shaw was . "
Healthy mind , healthy body
Shaw lived in the Edwardian villa for 44 years , until his death in 1950 .
He wrote most of his most celebrated works , including Pygmalion and Androcles and the Lion , in the revolving hut , which was built in the 1920s .
Located behind a screen of trees in a secluded part of the lush and peaceful gardens , Shaw spent days on end there , working at his typewriter .
There was also a small bed for those moments set aside for quiet relaxation and inspiration , and a telephone to make contact with the main house .
A working haven for Shaw
James Lees - Milne from the National Trust visited Shaw's Corner in 1944 .
He wrote in his book , Prophesying Peace : " He ( Shaw ) evidently feels the cold for there were electric fires in every room and the passage . "
When shown the writing hut , Mr Lees - Milne wrote that Shaw remarked to him : " this will be an attraction to the birthplace , if it survives . "
Working home
For nearly 30 years , the writing hut has remained on the ground .
But last year , the Univeristy of Hertfordshire 's Department of Engineering volunteered to return the structure to its mobile state .
The hut 's cosy interior
Ms Gofton hopes that this will now attract even more Shavian enthusiasts to visit .
" Nearly all our visitors have heard about the revolving writing hut , and some have been disappointed and unable to understand why it has not been in its functional state , " Ms Gofton said .
" Now they can see where Shaw worked and see why the peaceful , atmospheric surroundings were a welcome escape for him , as he was often besieged by the press and fans . "
The National Trust intends to continue its conservation programme at Shaw's Corner , with future plans to restore the exterior and interior of the hut .
The awakened one , the Buddha , said : Here , O , Monks , a disciple lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of unselfish joy , and so the second , and so the third , and so the fourth .
And thus the whole wide world , above , below , around , everywhere and equally , he continues to pervade with a heart of unselfish joy , abundant , grown great , measureless , without hostility or ill - will .
Introduction : Is Unselfish Joy Practicable ? by Nyanaponika Thera
The virtue of mudita [ muditaa ] , [ 1 ] i.e. , finding joy in the happiness and success of others , has not received sufficient attention either in expositions of Buddhist ethics , or in the meditative development of the four sublime states ( brahma - vihara [ brahma - vihaara ] ) , of which mudita is one .
It was , therefore , thought desirable to compile this little book of essays and texts and to mention in this introduction a few supplementary features of this rather neglected subject .
It has been rightly stated that it is relatively easier for man to feel compassion or friendliness in situations which demand them , than to cherish a spontaneous feeling of shared joy , outside a narrow circle of one 's family and friends .
It mostly requires a deliberate effort to identify oneself with the joys and successes of others .
Yet the capacity of doing so has psychological roots in man 's nature which may be even deeper that his compassionate responses .
There is firstly the fact that people do like to feel happy ( with — or without — good reason ) and would prefer it to the shared sadness of compassion .
Man 's gregarious nature ( his " sociability " ) already gives him some familiarity with shared emotions and shared pleasure , though mostly on a much lower level than that of our present concern .
There is also in man ( and in some animals ) not only an aggressive impulse , but also a natural bent towards mutual aid and co-operative action .
Furthermore , there is the fact that happiness is infectious and an unselfish joy can easily grow out of it .
Children readily respond by their own smiles and happy mood to smiling faces and happiness around them .
Though children can be quite jealous and envious at times , they also can visibly enjoy it when they have made a playmate happy by a little gift and they are then quite pleased with themselves .
Let parents and educators wisely encourage this potential in the child .
Then this seed will quite naturally grow into a strong plant in the adolescent and the adult , maturing from impulsive and simple manifestations into the sublime state of unselfish joy ( mudita - brahmavihara ) .
Thus , here too , the child may become " the father of a man . "
Such education towards joy with others should , of course , not be given in a dry didactic manner , but chiefly in a practical way by gently making the child observe , appreciate , and enjoy the happiness and success of others , and by trying himself to create a little joy in others .
This can be aided by acquainting the child with examples of selfless lives and actions for his joyful admiration of them ( and these , of course , should not be limited to Buddhist history ) .
This feature should not be absent in Buddhist youth literature and schoolbooks , throughout all age groups .
And this theme should be continued in Buddhist magazines and literature for adults .
Admittedly , the negative impulses in man , like aggression , envy , jealousy , etc. , are much more in evidence than his positive tendencies towards communal service , mutual aid , unselfish joy , generous appreciation of the good qualities of his fellow - men , etc .
Yet , as all these positive features are definitely found in man ( though rarely developed ) , it is quite realistic to appeal to them , and activate and develop that potential by whatever means we can , in our personal relationships , in education , etc .
" If it were impossible to cultivate the Good , I would not tell you to do so , " said the Buddha .
This is , indeed , a positive , optimistic assurance .
If this potential for unselfish joy is widely and methodically encouraged and developed , starting with the Buddhist child ( or , for that matter , with any child ) and continued with adults ( individuals and Buddhist groups , including the Sangha ) , the seed of mudita can grow into a strong plant which will blossom forth and find fruition in many other virtues , as a kind of beneficial " chain reaction " : magnanimity , tolerance , generosity ( of both heart and purse ) , friendliness , and compassion .
When unselfish joy grows , many noxious weeds in the human heart will die a natural death ( or will , at least , shrink ) : jealousy and envy , ill will in various degrees and manifestations , cold - heartedness , miserliness ( also in one 's concern for others ) , and so forth .
Unselfish joy can , indeed , act as a powerful agent in releasing dormant forces of the Good in the human heart .
We know very well how envy and jealousy ( the chief opponents of unselfish joy ) can poison a man 's character as well as the social relationships on many levels of his life .
They can paralyze the productivity of society , on governmental , professional , industrial , and commercial levels .
Should not , therefore , all effort be made to cultivate their antidote , that is mudita ?
Mudita will also vitalize and ennoble charitable and social work .
While compassion ( karuna [ karu.naa ] ) is , or should be , the inspiration for it , unselfish joy should be its boon companion .
Mudita will prevent compassionate action from being marred by a condescending and patronizing attitude which often repels or hurts the recipient .
Also , when active compassion and unselfish joy go together , it will be less likely that works of service turn into dead routine performed indifferently .
Indifference , listlessness , boredom ( all nuances of the Pali term arati ) are said to be the ' distant enemies ' of mudita .
They can be vanquished by an alliance of compassion and unselfish joy .
In him who gives and helps , the joy he finds in such action will enhance the blessings imparted by these wholesome deeds : unselfishness will become more and more natural to him , and such ethical unselfishness will help him towards a better appreciation and the final realization of the Buddha 's central doctrine of No-self ( anatta [ anattaa ] ) .
He will also find it confirmed that he who is joyful in his heart will gain easier the serenity of a concentrated mind .
These are , indeed , great blessings which the cultivation of joy with others ' happiness can bestow !
Nowadays , moral exhortations fall increasingly on deaf ears , whether they are motivated theologically or otherwise .
Preaching morals with an admonishing finger is now widely resented and rejected .
This fact worries greatly the churches and educators in the West .
But there are ample indications that this may , more or less , happen also in the Buddhist countries of the East where ethics is still taught and preached in the old hortatory style and mostly in a rather stereotype and unimaginative way , with little reference to present - day moral and social problems .
Hence modern youth will increasingly feel that such " moralizings " are not their concern .
In fact within the frame of the Buddhist teachings which do not rely on the authoritarian commandments of God and church , but on man 's innate capacity for self - purification , such conventionalized presentation of ethics which chiefly relies on over - worked scriptural references , must appear quite incongruous and will prove increasingly ineffective for young and old alike .
The need for reform in this field is urgent and of vital importance .
It was also with this situation in view , that the preceding observations have stressed the fact that a virtue like unselfish and altruistic joy has its natural roots in the human heart and can be of immediate benefit to the individual and society .
In other words , the approach to a modern presentation of Buddhist ethics should be pragmatic and contemporary , enlivened by a genuine and warm - hearted human concern .
In this troubled world of ours , there are plenty of opportunities for thoughts and deeds of compassion ; but there seem to be all too few for sharing in others ' joy .
Hence it is necessary for us to create new opportunities for unselfish joy , by the active practice of loving - kindness ( metta [ mettaa ] ) and compassion ( karuna ) , in deeds , words , and meditative thought .
Yet , in a world that can never be without disappointments and failures , we must also arm ourselves with the equanimity ( upekkha [ upekkhaa ] ) to protect us from discouragement and feelings of frustration , should we encounter difficulties in our efforts to expand the realm of unselfish joy .
Note 1 .
Usually rendered by unselfish , sympathetic , or altruistic joy .
Unselfish Joy : A Neglected Virtue by Natasha Jackson ( From Metta , The Journal of the Buddhist Federation of Australia , Vol. 12 , No. 2 . ) Mudita — unselfish or sympathetic joy — is one of the most neglected topics within the whole range of the Buddha Dhamma , probably because of its subtlety and of the wealth of nuances latent within it .
Besides getting honorable mention within the context of The Four Divine Abidings ( brahma - vihara ) , few commentators have had much more to say about it apart from explaining that it means " sympathetic joy at the good fortune or success of others . "
Only one notable writer , Conze ( in Buddhist Thought in India ) , has had the insight to suggest that mudita , i.e. sympathy , is a pre-requisite of metta ( loving - kindness ) and of karuna ( compassion ) .
He thus names appreciation as one of the components of mudita .
How right he is !
For one cannot appreciate another person without seeing some good in him .
If one does not appreciate the other person in the slightest degree , one would be hard put to experience joy at any stroke of good fortune or success that may befall him .
To stimulate feelings of pleasure when , in fact , one feels none , would be the grossest of hypocrisy .
Thus , mudita tacitly implies looking for the good in others and learning to recognize and admire what good there is .
Likewise , if one has a misanthropic view of mankind , regarding people as essentially evil and not worth being concerned about , one cannot , on the face of it , make much headway with any of The Four Divine Abidings .
To have a sympathetic attitude towards human beings does not betoken an idealization of man , but rather a realistic appraisal : that , though often in error and grievously at fault , man has , nevertheless , the potential to rise above his darkness and ignorance into the light of knowledge and even to undreamed of heights of Nirvana .
Unless one has that measure of faith and confidence in mankind which the Buddha himself had , the practice of metta and karuna is impossible .
Thus , the broadest and most simple aspect of mudita as sympathy towards mankind , is also the most basic and important .
To regard mudita as being relevant only on certain relatively rare occasions when our friends and acquaintances come into a bonanza of some kind , is to fragment it and render it trivial , thereby missing the essential matrix .
It should not be regarded as a matter of turning on a tap from which mudita will gush forth .
There should be , in a certain sense , a quiet stream of sympathy and understanding flowing within the individual all the time .
Though , to be sure , it does also mean developing the capacity to participate in another person 's finest hour and doing so spontaneously and sincerely .
It is indeed a depressing fact that people are much more ready to sympathize with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with them , a psychological quirk in people which wrung from Montaigne the ironic statement :
There is something altogether not too displeasing in the misfortunes of our friends .
Turning back to the essential matrix of mudita as sympathy towards mankind , faith in its potential for good and acceptance of its worthwhileness , this is precisely what is lacking in the world today .
There is abroad a kind of cosmic gloom and , among some large sections of people , a feeling of defeatism .
Probably the scene is largely colored by the shadow of the hydrogen bomb and the various other horrible weapons of destruction which we know the nations are so busy in manufacturing .
All in all , too much has happened in too short a time .
More scientific and technological discoveries have been telescoped into the last fifty ( or is it thirty ? ) years than in the previous five hundred , and the total result is , at the moment , of dubious benefit to humanity as a whole , though of inestimable worth to the new millionaires who have managed to muscle in on the expanding economy .
Electric and nuclear power , the spectacular forging ahead of communication , transport and industry have brought in their wake such negative by - products as over - population , more and more urbanization into colossal , concentrated centers , such as Tokyo , New York , and London ( and even Sydney and Melbourne ) , which , in turn , has given rise to other unfortunate results , both physical , and psychological : pollution from industrial waste , destruction of natural resources ; individual de-socialization , alienation , stress , as evidenced by the delinquency figures , the drift to drugs , character disorders , feelings of the meaninglessness of life , rise in crime , wanton destructiveness ( a sure symptom of frustration and an unlived life ) , despair , suicide .
We know that such ills have always existed in society , and that probably they always will to some degree , but the frightening thing about the present situation is that they are insidiously increasing , in spite of the fact that many people , and especially the youth , have never had it so good .
As it is , man feels more insecure than ever , more uncertain and lost .
Viewing these symptoms , many people throughout the world have drawn the conclusion that man has arrived at the period of moral decline and disintegration and that humanity has become so depraved as to be hopelessly beyond redemption or recall .
Such a view has always been characteristic of old age .
We can , with a certain degree of amusement read the lines :
To whom do I speak today ?
Brothers are evil , Friends today are not of love .
To whom do I speak today ?
Hearts are thievish , Every man seizes his neighbor 's goods .
To whom do I speak today ?
The gentle man perishes , The bold - faced goes everywhere ...
To whom do I speak today ?
When a man should arouse wrath by his evil conduct , He stirs all men to mirth , although his iniquity is wicked ...
The above admonition was composed in ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom , thousands of years ago , but the words are those which every generation hears .
There is a proneness in periods of crisis and transition , to conjure up in the mind a fantasy of a previous golden age , when people were of sterling worth and life was lived in accordance with the noble virtues .
But , we may well ask , when was there such an age , and where ?
If people who harbor such quaint notions were to read history , they would realize that such a belief is just about as valid as that there ever was a time " when flowers bloomed for ever and sweethearts were always true , " in the words of the old song .
Ancient history and the Middle Ages are definitely OUT as far as morality is concerned .
Without going so far back , merely a couple of hundred years , Smollett wrote this of eighteenth century England : Commerce and manufacture flourished to such a degree of increase as has never been known in this island ; but this advantage was attended with an irresistible tide of luxury and excess which flowed through all degrees of people , breaking down all the bounds of civil policy , and opening a way for licentiousness and immorality .
The highways were infested with rapine and assassination ; the cities teemed with the brutal votaries of lewdness , intemperance , and profligacy .
In the nineteenth century ( relatively recently ) , Wordsworth wrote :
The wealthiest man among us is the best :
No grandeur now in nature or in book Delight us .
Rapine , avarice , expense ,
This is idolatry ; and these we adore .
Plain living and high thinking are no more ;
The homely beauty of the good old cause
Is gone , our fearful innocence , And pure religion breathing household laws .
And James Hemming , a modern writer in his book Individual Morality : Nineteenth - century London was frequently shaken by the destructive antics of informally organized hooligan gangs of young aristocrats .
Those young roughs , having idled away their days , spent their nights beating people up , smashing up coffee stalls , alarming women and such like — the Bucks , the Corinthians , and all their imitators and hangers - on .
Such bands were following , somewhat less cruelly , in the tradition of the nefarious Mohocks , who terrorized eighteenth - century London .
Sexual propriety ?
Quoting again from Hemming : Brothels in the nineteenth century were big business , and , laws to forbid living on the immoral earnings of women , after several rebuffs in Parliament , did not reach the statute books till 1885 .
But this was in England , the most progressive country in Europe .
There is no evidence for believing that conditions were better on the Continent .
Understandably , twenty - five years after World War II , we are still appalled by the memory of the Nazi gas - chambers and the genocide which was their aim .
This is by no means an isolated instance of genocide .
History bears witness to similar incidents of destructive hate , culminating in mass murder .
The Albigenses were wiped out to a man , and in 1572 , at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew 's Eve , thousands of Huguenots were slaughtered , Pope Gregory XIII commanding bonfires to be lit and a medal to be struck in celebration !
The idea that the mass destruction of one 's ideological enemies is justified was already old in the days of the Old Testament .
Saul was commanded :
Now go and smite Amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
All of the foregoing is not intended as apologetics justifying violence , bloodbaths , or individual or collective acts of immorality but merely to dispel the myth that there was ever a previous idyllic phase , when man could have said with some semblance of truth : God 's in His Heaven
And all 's right with the world .
So , let us lay to rest forever the belief that in the past men were truer , kinder , more upright , and generally more worthy than they are today .
Let us give that piece of romantic fiction the respectable funeral that it deserves .
Our ancestors and predecessors were no better than we are , and we are certainly not worse than they were .
In many respects we have improved considerably on the ways of our forbears .
Actually , there has been a great deal of progress , considering that slavery hung on in England until 1772 , in America till 1863 , and serfdom in Russia till 1861 .
And , in spite of the injustices and lack of moral scruples that still exist , there is more awareness , kindliness , and sensitivity in many human societies than there has ever been before .
Today when a national disaster of great magnitude occurs in a country , quite often the rest of the world rallies around and helps — perhaps not to the extent that it should , but nonetheless , to some extent .
Such a broadening expansion of the human conscience would have been deemed a Utopian ideal in former times and impossible .
When acts of genocide were perpetrated in the past , people just accepted it : that was that , and there was nothing to be done about it .
In our time , the whole world was revolted by the Nazi gas - chambers , eventually rose against the loathsome disease of Fascism and smashed it even thought it took the combined might of the allied force five years of bitter conflict to do so .
However , in the past , without exception , whatever was inflicted upon a people , they mostly took .
Today they do n't — they protest , they demonstrate , they kick up a fuss .
They have become articulate because they have realized that the greatest evil of all is not poverty , racialism , or war but powerlessness .
Naturally , such an unexpected show of interest in public affairs is embarrassing to governments accustomed to an inert and docile population and there is some wistful talk by diehards of " the silent majority , " but the present indications are that " the silent majority " is likely to become a silent minority in the face of such urgent problems as over - population , and destruction of natural resources , which , if left unchecked , will make the earth uninhabitable within a foreseeable future .
However , against this general tendency is the lamentable fact that nothing was done about the rape of Tibet , and even now there are no large - scale or forceful protests being made about the genocide that is being practiced in that country by the Chinese .
So , far from feeling dejected and dispirited about mankind , we should be hopeful and buoyant .
There would be infinitely more cause for alarm and despair if people were as easy to manipulate as sheep or merely apathetic .
The arguing and the restlessness throughout the world is about the principles on which we should run our lives , a struggle for values other than the profit motive , for ways and means to make possible greater co-operation between individuals and nations , and for moral maturity in coping with man 's new powers and responsibilities .
People discuss , argue , petition , protest , demonstrate because of their sympathy , compassion , and love for mankind .
It is very difficult to differentiate between the three or to recognize precisely the line of demarcation where one ends and the other begins , because they are illimitable .
There are , of course , others who see in these conflicts only hatred but this view is hardly tenable because it is much easier and much more comfortable to remain uninvolved , drifting with the current , nor swimming against it .
The Ven. Nyanaponika has summed up the interdependence of the Four Divine Abidings in the following quotation : Love imparts to equanimity its selflessness , its boundless nature and even its fervor ...
Compassion guards equanimity from falling into cold indifference and keeps it from indolent or selfish isolation .
Until equanimity has reached perfection , compassion urges it to enter again and again into the battlefields of the world .
Sympathetic joy gives to equanimity the mild serenity that softens its stern appearance .
It is the divine smile on the face of the Enlightened One. From The Four Sublime States in The Wheel No. 6 .
Mudita by C.F. Knight ( From Metta , Vol. 12 , No. 2 . ) A feature of the Buddha - Dhamma is cognizance of the pairs of opposites in the training to get beyond them .
The Buddha 's method of mental training and development was to teach by first defining unwholesome or unskillful thoughts , words , and deeds , or practices which characterize many of man 's proclivities , and then to propound their opposites of a wholesome or skillful nature as an achievement to be sought after for the abolition of them both , eventually , when even the good must be left behind as well as the evil ; when even the Raft of Dhamma is to be abandoned — after crossing the flood of samsara .
The trouble with so many of the unwise is their desire to abandon the Raft of Dhamma before reaching the further shore .
The Buddha 's method of expounding the negative and the positive , the passive , and the dynamic aspects of behavior , in both abstract and concrete terms , is obviously to create awareness of what is to be sought after and nurtured .
The basic ignorance featured in Buddhism is not so much a rejection of the truth as it is a failure to perceive it .
It is , as it were , a " blind spot " in our perception akin to the physical damage of a section of the brain or the nervous system which results in impaired vision or locomotion .
In other words , the depth of our ignorance may be measured by our lack of consciousness of it .
This is why it is so necessary that we should see and recognize our failings and shortcomings if we are to eradicate them .
It is also important that we should be mindful of " the good that has arisen , " and to foster and develop it to the point of perfection .
To realize our imperfections is the beginning of wisdom — the first light to shine on the darkness of our ignorance .
While we are blissfully unaware of unwholesome states of mind within ourselves , such states will continue to flourish , and their roots will dig deeper into our very being .
Just so too , in our relationships with our fellow men , the unperceived evils will be repeated unconsciously and unrecognized , building up a cumulative unhappy future for us under the retributive causal law of karma .
In dealing with mudita or altruistic joy , we are once more to some extent frustrated with the inadequacy of translations for " brahma - vihara " or " appamañña " [ appama~n~na ] — the former as " sublime or divine abode , " and the latter as " boundless state . "
To reduce either of these terms to modern idiom is difficult .
The four characteristics grouped under these terms are : loving - kindness , compassion , altruistic joy , and equanimity , extended to universal application .
In their perfection they are " sublime " and " boundless , " and to be " dwelt in " as one speaks of " dwelling in Peace , " so we will leave it at that .
As with all perfections , these four desirable characteristics are the antidotes to the poisons of their opposite imperfections , and here is where the recognition of their opposites is apposite .
Less has been said or written of mudita than of the other three of these four characteristics , perhaps , again , because of its somewhat clumsy translation .
While loving - kindness and compassion are objective , reaching out to all sentient beings , mudita and equanimity are subjective , or personal in their application .
It may seem strange at first , until we critically examine the source , to speak of either selfish or unselfish joy .
Joy is an emotional ecstasy arising from pleasure .
It is something intensely personal .
While we can and do share our pleasures to some extent with others , the resultant impact of them on various personalities will vary as widely as the personalities .
At times what may give rise to rapturous joy in us , when shared , may give rise to positive aversion in another .
A pertinent example of this would be the reactionary effect of certain music on people of differing tastes .
While it is not uncommon for some of the modern generation to literally swoon in ecstasy under the influence of the combination of discordant and dissonant notes and chords , others find them anything but entertaining or pleasurable .
Here we have what might be termed " selfish joy " on the part of the participants , by those who have to suffer most unwilling participation .
For all that , within the group enjoying it , there is a reciprocity of delight , happiness , and rapture between the entertainers and the entertained .
Superficially , then , we could say it is not the phenomenon of joy itself , that is either selfish or altruistic by nature , but that time , place , and circumstance must all be considered in relation one to the others .
However , to bring mudita within the ambit of the Buddha - Dhamma we need to go deeper into the necessity for cultivating this perfection .
What are the opposites to be eliminated by its cultivation ?
We never tire of asserting the interdependence of every aspect of the Buddha - Dhamma , no matter which particular facet is being discussed .
We have already stated that ignorance is failure of perception , and it is true that greed and hatred do arise through the non-perception of their source and subsequent results ; that basically craving born of ignorance is the culprit , and that the purpose of the Buddha - Dhamma is to eliminate craving .
It is craving that gives rise to jealousy , envy , covetousness , avarice , and greed in all of its manifestations .
Here it is that mudita when practiced and developed becomes a " sublime " and " boundless " state of mind to be " dwelt in " as a corrective characteristic for their removal .
One of the most frequently used similes by the Buddha was that of fire .
At times it was the destructive quality of fire that was likened to the destructive nature of the passions .
At other times it was the ardent nature of fire that was to be emulated in the pursuance of the path to holiness .
In its uncontrolled existence fire is a destructive danger .
Under control it is one of man 's greatest boons and blessings .
In either case it was a motivating force to be reckoned with , at all times active , potent , and energetic .
The three roots of evil — greed , hatred , and delusion — are also known as " the three fires . "
On one occasion the Buddha and his band of monks were for the time staying on Gaya Head , a mountain near the city of Gaya .
From their elevated position they watched one of the great fires that from time to time ravaged the countryside .
This inspired what is known as " The Fire Sermon , " which is the third recorded discourse delivered by the Buddha subsequent to his Enlightenment , and at the beginning of his long ministry .
To the Buddha , the world of Samsara was like the flaming plains below , " Everything is burning , " said the Buddha , " burning with the fire of passion , with the fired of hatred , with the fire of stupidity . "
( Vin. 21 ) It is these three fires that give rise to jealousy , envy , covetousness , avarice , and greed .
The craving for possessions , the craving for sensual pleasures , the begrudged success of others , the hatred that is begotten by the gains of others , the odious comparison of greater status compared with our humble circumstances , these are the " fires " that burn within us to our undoing .
It is now evident why mudita is such an important characteristic to be cultivated .
When we can view the success of others with the same equanimity , and to the same extent , as we would extend metta and karuna — loving - kindness and compassion — to those who suffer grief and distress , sadness and tribulation , sorrow and mourning , then we are beginning to exercise mudita , and are in the process of eradicating greed and craving .
Developed still further , we can reach the stage of sharing with others their joy of possession , their financial or social successes , their elevation to positions of civic or national importance , or their receipt of titles and honorifics .
In such a manner mudita is counteractive to conceits of all kinds , and its growth and development checks craving 's grip .
Until we have developed this subjective characteristic within ourselves how can we develop the objective characteristics of metta and karuna ?
The accumulated possessions , results of our greed , may give us the pleasure and the happiness of the miser gloating over his hoard of gold .
The happiness born of shared pleasures , shared love , shared possessions , shared delights in another 's success , will surpass the meager selfish happiness of the miser .
Unselfish joy multiplies in ratio to the extension of its application , quite apart from its purifying effect on our own lives .
In Ñanamoli 's translation of Buddhaghosa 's Visuddhimagga he uses " gladness " for mudita , with the footnote : " Mudita — gladness — as one of the divine abidings is always used in the sense of gladness at others ' success . "
Buddhaghosa illustrates this by saying : " On seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad , gladness can be aroused thus : ' This being is indeed glad .
How good !
How excellent !'
Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person , so he pervades all being with gladness . "
In " The Analysis of the Sixfold Sense - Field " ( MN 137 ) the Buddha speaks of the six joys connected with renunciation .
While such joys are subjective by nature , they are devoid of any taint of egoistic craving that could give rise to the cankers of jealousy , envy , covetousness , or greed .
These joys arise on the realization of the impermanence of material shapes , sounds , smells , flavors , touches , and mental states , and the renunciation of attachment to them .
The Nature and Implications of Mudita by L.R. Oates ( From Metta , Vol. 12 , No. 2 . ) Altruistic joy is one of the four " sublime states " of mind — friendliness , compassion , altruistic joy , and equanimity — which together form one related group among the various spiritual or physical exercises generally described as meditation or contemplation .
These all have as their common aim the attainment of mental calm or equanimity , which is intended in turn to foster the development of liberating insight .
" A still mind , like still water , yields a clear reflection of what is before it . "
This is why this particular series ends with equanimity , but the route by which it is attained in this case is different from that traversed for the most of the other themes used as a focus for concentration .
The others , such as meditation on the breath , on death , on visual objects ( kasina [ kasi.na ] ) , or on the Buddha , the Doctrine , and the Order of the Enlightened One , are entirely concerned with the self - cultivation of the meditator .
Most of these themes are abstract or inanimate , while the Buddha and the Order ( in the strict sense applicable here ) have transcended any power of ours to help or hinder them .
So the only person concerned or affected in these forms of training is the meditator .
It was doubtless to encourage those wrestling by these means with their own inner weakness or conflicts that the following verse of the Dhammapada was uttered :
Let no one neglect his own task for the sake of another 's however great ; let him , after he has discerned his own task , devote himself to his task .
—
Dhp 166
But if this were the whole story it would be difficult for such self - cultivation to serve in turn as a basis for the freedom from bondage to the self - concept , which is the main characteristic of the development of insight .
Indeed , it was the recognition of the dangers of self - preoccupation , or self - righteousness , liable to arise in these often acute struggles for self - discipline , that impelled the more extreme exponents of the Pure Land school of Buddhism to abandon self - cultivation in favor of the less exacting path of reliance on the Buddha 's transforming grace .
But the cultivation of the " sublime states " represents a less radical form of compensation which , while compatible with other practices , can help to broaden the meditator 's perspective in order to achieve a mode of equanimity which does not imply withdrawal into oneself or indifference to others .
The starting point here , of course , is on the ethical plane in the practice of generosity in practical ways ( dana ; daana ) which , in order to become interiorized and thereby go beyond mere outward form , must be grounded in an attitude of friendliness ( metta ) for all beings without distinction .
Since this outlook implies the recognition that all beings are subject to joys and sorrows just as we are , it finds a natural development in sympathy — that is to say , compassion — for their sorrows and joy in their blessings .
The former of these seems much the easier to achieve , since it is possible to feel compassion for suffering even in the absence of any positive friendliness for the sufferer , whereas it is only possible to share genuinely in another 's joy if there is some element of true affection or friendliness present .
This is perhaps why , on a much lower level of sensitivity , the reporting of news seems so heavily concentrated on the side of crimes and disasters , which are perhaps felt more likely to arouse interest than happier events and deeds .
If the latter arouse any interest at all , it is likely to be spiced with envy or cynicism .
Not only does genuine joy in the prosperity of others require some element of affection ; it requires this to be of a quite high order .
A great deal of what passes for love is really aimed at mere emotional gratification on the part of the lover , for whom the " beloved " is little more than a prop for acting out some drama satisfying a purely subjective need — the beloved 's own needs being treated less seriously .
Indeed , even apart from outright commercialization , a certain habit of bargaining with affections seems remarkably widespread , when one begins to take notice of it .
In the light of this , the ability to feel a genuine joy in another 's happiness , equal to one 's satisfaction with one 's own , represents a truly " sublime state . "
So it is not surprising that in the history of Buddhism , which cultivated this attitude systematically , there arose an aspiration to share with others not only one 's material resources , but the spiritual resources described as merit .
This aspiration follows naturally enough from the basic theory as to what merit is .
Merit is the accumulation of tendencies resulting from enlightened deeds which , according to the law of moral causation ( the law of karma ) , conduce to the future happiness of the doer .
Here he is joyful , hereafter he is joyful , in both worlds the well - doer is joyful .
" I have done good " is the thought that make him happy .
Still greater is his joy when he goes to states of bliss .
If the doer is still in a state where only purely personal forms of satisfaction are possible , the fruits of merit can only take this form .
But suppose he loves even one being so much that , if that being is in some state of deprivation , he can only be made happy by the improvement of that being 's lot , then the merit which is due to him can only take effect by benefiting him through that other 's welfare .
The wider his altruism expands , so that purely personal gratifications no longer adequately satisfy him , the wider must be the range of the benefit which his own merit would need to bring to others if it is to fulfill its defined function of bringing happiness to him .
At the same time , his altruistic tendencies will ensure that he will have vastly more merit due to him , so his resources will tend to become commensurate with the aspirations , for example , of Santideva , when he says : May I be an alleviator of the sorrows of all beings and a divine medicine to those afflicted by disease .
May I be the benefactor and bringer of peace to them until all their bodily ailments and mental tribulations are at the end .
The principle of the sharing or transference of merit , so much stressed in Mahayana Buddhism ( though not unknown in Theravadan practices ) is sometimes objected to by Western Buddhists because of a superficial resemblance to the Christian doctrine of atonement , which they have rejected .
But the principles entailed are not really identical , since the Christian doctrine is based on an essential distinction between the roles of the Creator and the created , while the Buddhist sharing of merit arises from a combination of the definition of merit and of the nature of altruistic joy .
It has a further importance too , in that it anticipates the emancipation to be derived from insight into the emptiness of the self - concept , that is to say , awakening to the emptiness of the concepts " I " and " mine " in terms of ultimate truth .
On this level , the description " mine " as applied to merit will finally be seen to be as inapplicable as in the case of any other assumed possession .
This was already explicitly set out in one of the Buddha 's earliest discourses , " The Marks of the Not - self , " in which he taught his first five disciples to contemplate each of the five components of personality in the terms : " This is not mine ; this I am not ; this is not my self . "
The fourth of these components is the aggregate of mental tendencies or activities , which include merit and demerit .
Even on a lower plane than that of perfect insight , it can be seen that our deeds are not exclusively ours , because no one acts in absolute isolation , so that every act involves some stimulus or opportunity arising from activity of others .
On the other hand , a too persistent insistence on the individual nature of merit can only impede the ultimate awakening to the Not - self .
This has some bearing , too , on the reason why friendliness , compassion , and altruistic joy are regarded as leading to an equanimity which does not imply an indifference to the joys and sorrows of others .
In the absence of such a conclusion , the alternate sharing of joys and sorrows , like these emotions arising on one 's own account , would be as endless as the world - cycles which it is the Buddhist aspiration to transcend .
The goal of the " divine states " is that the aspirant , who in process achieves the role of a Bodhisattva in a two - way empathy with others by his perfect sharing of their joys and sorrows , is in a position to radiate to them stability , which in turn will help them to be less subject to their own emotional vicissitudes .
In this way , he and they are liberated together , each sustaining the other .
Last Saturday I started FON .
It ´s been the craziest 6 days of my business life .
And my business life is not short .
I started Viatel , Jazztel and Ya.com .
But in those three cases the launch itself was not an event .
I don´t remember the actual first week of Viatel .
I had the idea in 1990 , a sort of virus that reverted the calling patterns of international telecom networks and gave foreigners US dial tone .
It was a big idea , but it took me maybe a year of hard labor to get to the level of global awareness that I have achieved in 6 days with FON through my blog .
And it took 10 years and a great team effort for the company to be worth over $ 1bn .
Same is true with Jazztel .
Jazztel was a Spanish telecom company .
A fiber optic network / dsl provider .
But even though it was local , it took me at least 2 million euros in advertising to get to the level of awareness that FON has achieved in 6 days … and all through my blog .
Jazztel is now Spain´s second largest publicly traded telecom company with a market cap of over $ 1bn .
Same with Ya.com .
Spain´s second largest internet company .
We launched Ya.com when the internet was so small in Spain that most advertising had to be done on TV and print , and it costed a fortune .
True , we invested 38 million euros and we sold it two years later to T Online for 550 million euros , but close to half of the 38 million was spent in regular advertising in 2000 / 2001 .
But now , there´s my blog .
From what I know , mine is not a very popular blog .
It is read by only about 2000 people per day .
But it seems that 2000 people talking to their friends adds up to a LOT of people .
Last night I searched “ fon varsavsky ” in Technorati and I couldn´t believe the amount of blogs that were writing about FON .
And we are not even ready with our software !
The official launch date is November 15th .
Moreover , the concept of FON is not that easy to understand .
Yesterday , for example , I met with the former head of Vodafone in Spain , Ignacio Sanchez Galan , and he just did not get it , which surprised me as Vodafone could be one of the companies whose stock value would tank the most if FON becomes the Skype of the mobile world .
Not only there is an incredible amount of people reading blogs now , but they are smarter than the former head of Vodafone !
Now , of all the crazy things that happened , the one that stands out is the case of Daniel Isenberg , a Harvard Business School professor who wants to do a Harvard Business case on FON , only 6 days after it appeared on my blog .
I know this could be dangerous .
If FON in the end fizzles , people do not download our software and we don´t get to build a unified wifi nation , we will look like idiots .
But at least we won´t be broke idiots , as it happened to many during the bubble , as we are spending exactly O euros in advertising and very little on all the rest .
In FON , so far , there´s a lot of talent among the people who work there , but no money spent on marketing .
Blogging has turned the equation of being a big success or a big failure into being a small failure or a big success .
I like this new risk profile and will do whatever I can to turn FON into a big success .
