President Obama gave a great speech Thursday about his plan for health care reform , but unlike CNN and MSNBC , Fox did n't think it was worth covering .
Using a side - by - side video and fast - forwarding , the above video offers a minute - by - minute account of what they thought was more worthy of their attention , all compressed into less than a minute and a half .
Tipped off by two unnamed individuals , MyFox Boston claims to have unearthed a police report placing Congressman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) at the home of his longtime partner when police arrested the man and charged him with marijuana cultivation , possession and paraphernalia .
In a telephone interview , Frank acknowledged he was present for the bust but denied knowledge that James Ready was growing cannabis .
He reportedly told police during the August , 2007 incident that he only smokes cigars and would not be able to identify marijuana if he came across it .

Charges against Ready were dropped after he admitted to possession and paid a fine , MyFox added .
Congressman Frank , while professing to be unable to identify cannabis if he came across it , is no stranger to progressive positions on its prohibition .
In April 2008 , he proposed federal legislation that would have removed penalties for adult possession of the plant .
Appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher , he jokingly referred to it as the “ Make Room for Serious Criminals Bill . ”
“ I think it is poor law enforcement to keep on the books legislation that establishes as a crime something which in fact society does not seriously wish to prosecute , ” he said in a media advisory .
“ In my view , having federal law enforcement agents engaged in the prosecution of people who are personally using marijuana is a waste of scarce resources better used for serious crimes . ”
Frank was also a co-sponsor of Rep. Ron Paul ’s ( R - TX ) bill that sought to legalize the farming of industrial hemp .
Hemp is a drug - free relative of cannabis and can be used to make thousands of commercial goods , from food to paper , clothing , hygiene products and more .
It is currently illegal to grow hemp in the United States .
Speaking to MyFox Boston reporter Alison Bologna , Frank called the arrest of his partner “ one of those unfortunate incidents that happened in the past . ”
Pressed by the reporter on whether he had seen Ready ’s cannabis , he said , “ I did n’t see it , the police did n’t charge me with seeing it .
It was out of sight of where I was ; it was around the other side of the house . ”

Court records did not mention Frank ’s presence at time of the arrest , the report noted .
However , sources who tipped off the news organization claimed the original police report listed the congressman as a witness .

Lionel Messi won gold for Argentina at the Beijing Olympics
Europe 's football chiefs have backed a proposal to limit the age of players featuring at the Olympics to under 21 .
Uefa 's strategy council of clubs as well as national associations , leagues and players ' unions agreed unanimously .
Fifa 's ruling executive will discuss the issue in South Africa next week and will then send a report to the International Olympic Committee .
Fifa favours an under - 21 event , but the IOC wants to keep the status quo of under - 23s , with three over - age players .
Fifa president Sepp Blatter has previously suggested reducing the age limit to 21 , or abolishing the age limit but barring all players with World Cup experience .
A taskforce has been set up to examine the matter , with Blatter saying he was " sure " the dispute could be resolved .
In June , the IOC warned that football could be kicked out of the Games if Fifa stood by its plan to alter the under - 23 limit .
Fifa and the IOC have been struggling to reach an agreement on player eligibility since the current rules almost prevented Barcelona 's Lionel Messi from playing for Argentina in Beijing last year .
The Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) had ruled that Barcelona could recall Messi from the Games , but he was included in the national side after the player himself expressed a desire to remain in Beijing .
Messi went on to star for Argentina as they won gold .
Women 's Olympic football currently has no age restrictions .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Time Warner Cable TWC , on Thursday reported third - quarter net income of $ 268 million , or 76 cents a share , compared to $ 301 million , or 92 cents a share , in the same period last year .
Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had produced a consensus forecast of 75 cents a share .
The company said the earnings decline resulted largely from higher interest expense tied to the debt used to fund a $ 10.9 billion special cash dividend paid in March .
Revenues rose 4 % to $ 4.5 billion , the company said .
A new political thriller from PBS , “ Endgame , ” provides the little - known , true back story of apartheid ’s end in South Africa , with credit given to a for - profit mining company .
Foreseeing that deteriorating conditions in South Africa would likely result in a total loss of their assets , Consolidated Goldfields initiated secret discussions between representatives of the white South African government and the exiled black African National Congress ( ANC ) , paid for and hosted at the company ’s estate in England .
These talks resulted in Nelson Mandela ’s being set free after nearly 30 years in prison , and the public promise by South African President F.W. de Klerk to end the government - sanctioned system of discrimination known as apartheid .
Thus , Malcolm X had it completely wrong when he opined : “ You ca n’t have capitalism without racism . ”
As our new book , Race and Liberty in America , shows :
Capitalism punishes racial discrimination in the marketplace .
Capitalism undermines racism by penalizing those who act on their “ taste for discrimination . ”
Firms willing to recruit workers and market their goods and services without regard to color or national origin have a competitive advantage .
American streetcar companies , to take but one example , fought segregated seating because it added to their cost of doing business .
This is not to argue that there are no bigots or racists .
But Jim Crow , apartheid , and other race - or gender - based laws are at root institutionalized protection from competition , enacted to penalize and make illegal voluntary activities that are taking place in the absence of such laws .
In the post - Civil War South , for example , the races were intermingling , intermarrying , and doing business together as a natural course of events .
It was only through enacting Jim Crow that those who did not want competition from blacks were able to prohibit , with the full force of the government behind them , these voluntary activities .
In the absence of such laws , bigots themselves bear the costs of their own discriminatory behavior , and individuals seeking to maximize their profits and opportunities receive benefits from doing so without racial or other discrimination .
Racism is thus only successfully institutionalized and sustainable through the power of the State , and its cure is to remove the ability of the State to either confer privileges or prohibit peaceful activities for any ostensible reason whatsoever .
Of course , the end of apartheid in South Africa involved many events subsequent to the Consolidated Goldfields peace talks .
As portrayed in “ Endgame , ” for white Afrikaners , “ Our fear ( of ending apartheid ) stems from the knowledge that one day we will be punished for all the terrible wrongs we have inflicted . ”
The solution for that challenge — as well as forestalling white revenge against the ANC for its history of terrorist activities — was provided through Archbishop Desmond Tutu ’s leading the extraordinary Truth and Reconciliation Commission .

September 22 , 2009 –
The healing properties of cannabis have long been touted amongst the British cannabis community , who have done everything in their power to bring word of the cancer curing properties of cannabis to a wider audience .
And at face value it would be fair to expect the worlds press to get pretty excited over even ‘ a suspicion ’ of a cure for cancer , a disease which will strike down almost 1 in every 2 people .
Cannabis can cure certain types of cancer .
So why are we not researching it further ?
Because the pharma industry cannot get a patent on a plant so law enforcement holds the patent whilst the pharma ’s try to build a chemical version .. and that ’s no longer good enough to keep it outlawed .
Unfortunately that ’s not the case .
Cancer is on the rise statistically , yet the people who control health issues at a national and international level ( the pharmaceutical industry ) , are simply not prepared to let it be known that people can cure their own ailments , as it would cost them trillions of dollars in over - the - counter pain - relief sales , amongst a great many other products which cannabis has been proven as a safe , natural alternative .
Indeed Canadian Rick Simpson went one further .
Instead of telling people about it , he started to use a cannabis - derived oil to cure his own skin- cancer .
A cancer his doctor had attempted ( and failed ) to cure using more mainstream methods like strong drugs and surgery .
Its a truly mind - blowing story which explains in laymans terms the lengths which the establishment surrounding pharmaceutical drugs , will go to stop news of this getting out .
Even going so far as to close down a Canadian Legion office and sacking the entire management team for promoting Rick Simpsons marijuana based hemp -oil .
Rumour has it the pharmaceutical industry is attempting to synthesise the active ingredients in cannabis so they may make use of its healing properties whilst at the same time , keeping it firmly outlawed , to stop people treating themselves .
Just another conspiracy theory ?
Remember Spice artificial cannabis ?
Which got banned recently ?
JWH -018
Inhibition of human tumour prostate PC - 3 cell growth by cannabinoids R(+ ) - Methanandamide and JWH - 015 ( a close relation to the now banned JWH - 018 )
According to Christopher P Evans M.D , who is a Contributing Editor with UroToday .
Com , “ Investigators have found that JWH - 015 inhibited human prostate cancer cell xenograft growth in mice .
The study ’s conclusion is that CB2 receptor agonists have potential therapeutic application in the treatment of human prostate cancer .
So it turns out the active ingredient in Spice artificial cannabis could have cancer curing properties as a result of its ability to ‘ tweak ’ our in built CB1 and CB2 receptors .
A tweak which is necessary to shut down the processes cancer cells need to multiply and grow .
And this is the key issue .
“ Cancer occurs because cells become immortalized ; they fail to heed normal signals to turn off growth .
A normal function of remodelling in the body requires that cells die on cue .
This is called apoptosis , or programmed cell death ” , says Manuel Guzman of Madrid University .
He Continued , “ That process fails to work in tumors .
But THC promotes its reappearance so that gliomas , leukemias , melanomas and other cell types will in fact heed the signals , stop dividing , and die . ”
Dr. Ethan Russo , a neurologist , concurs .
“ And , that is not all , ” explains Dr. Russo : “ The other way that tumors grow is by ensuring that they are nourished : they send out signals to promote angiogenesis , the growth of new blood vessels .
Cannabinoids turn off these signals as well .
It is truly incredible , and elegant . ”
Which brings us back to Rick simpson ’s hemp oil .
A concoction which would see you facing a 5 year prison term in the United Kingdom , and 14 years if you decided to share your oil with a relative who may be dying of cancer .
Simpsons Hemp
Oil has cleared a skin cancer re-occurrence after only 4 days , on his own cancer .
A cancer which his doctor could not cure .
Simpson also has a whole video - library of statements recorded by people who say they have been cured of cancer by Rick Simpson ’s hemp oil .
So if you or a loved one are suffering with any form of cancer please please PLEASE write to your elected representative and ask why we are not supporting research into cannabis and its medical applications .
The clock is ticking for many people .

Obama 's Executive Order Enforces Smart Energy
October 6th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
President Obama has just signed an Executive Order that compels the largest consumer of energy in the US economy to invest in energy efficiency improvements to get to huge reductions in energy use by 2020 .
Every Federal agency must measure , manage , and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet specific targets by 2020 .
They have just 90 days to lay out a plan to meet these targets :
1. Use 30 % less gas by 2020 .
Federal agencies buy 750,000 new vehicles every year .
In normal times that ’s almost 1 in every 17 vehicles sold per year .
This Executive Order creates a rock - solid certain market for fuel - efficient vehicles every year from now till 2020 .
2. Design all new government buildings from 2020 to be net - zero energy .
Wow !
Jimmy Carter might have gotten just a few solar panels up on merely one government building ; The White House .
But this means every new government building goes solar to cut fossil energy use to zero .
And they wo n’t just want solar power .
They ’ll need efficient windows , geothermal ground heat exchanges , efficient air conditioning , solar hot water heating , radiant flooring , tankless water heaters , great insulation … ( and all this will take retrained architects , and doing that will take new classes , and those will need new instructors , who ’ll need new suits … this is going to be a green jobs boom ! )
How huge is this ?
Between all the Federal Agencies , from the Department of Defense to the Department of Justice , this involves almost 2 million Americans who collectively spend $ 500 billion every year .
While there ’s not much even a president can do to force knuckledragging Senators to vote the way renewable energy voters might like them to on climate and energy , there are some powers available to the presidency , and President Obama uses them .
Steven Chu at the DOE is one .
He has turned the DOE into a renewable energy powerhouse .
Lisa Jackson at the EPA is another .
She seems to be shutting down dangerous polluters weekly .
Apparently the Executive Order can be a power for Good too .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A man whose Scientologist brother committed suicide has urged Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to allow a parliamentary inquiry into the controversial church .
Thirty - year - old Edward McBride killed himself in the Brisbane suburb of Everton Park in February 2007 .
Mr McBride had been a member of the Church of Scientology for about two years and had paid $ 25,000 for various courses .
A coroner 's inquiry into his death heard evidence that members of the church had contacted him 19 times in the days before his death about completing an " audit " .
The church 's file on Mr McBride was subsequently sent out of the country to the US , meaning it could not be obtained by the Coroner .
His brother , Stephen McBride , last night flew from Perth to Canberra to urge Mr Rudd to support Independent Senator Nick Xenophon 's motion for an inquiry into the church 's tax - free status .
" It 's hard to describe the anger that my family and myself feels about the church 's conduct before and after my brother 's death , " he said .
" The Church of Scientology gained $ 25,000 from my brother , but Edward lost his life .
This organisation needs to be investigated by the police and by the Parliament .
" I believe the bombardment of 19 telephone messages backed him into a corner and he just had no room to breathe .
I think the secrecy of the religion , organisation , cult - whatever you may call it - it needs to be open and disclosed .
" There 's something just not right about it .
Please do n't let my brother 's death just be in vain . "
Stephen McBride said he believed his brother became involved in the church after becoming bored with his job in the Army .
Edward McBride had complained of bullying in his Army work and the Defence Force has since conducted a commission of inquiry into the incident .
At the time of his death he was trying to leave the Army and was frustrated at the length of time it taking for him to be discharged .
Coroner John
Lock found there was nothing to suggest the bullying and issues surrounding his discharge contributed to his death .
He also said some of the phone calls made by church members to Edward McBride in the days before his death were " virtually demanding " he come in to complete the audit .
The Church of Scientology has been under increased scrutiny since Senator Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to accuse it of being a criminal organisation last week .
Senator Xenophon , who detailed allegations of forced abortion and imprisonment from former members , says he does not yet have the numbers for an inquiry , but will not be giving up .
" I will continue to build my case , " he said .
" My fellow senators need to know that even if a vote is lost , either now or early next year , there is nothing to stop me from putting up a motion the very next day for another vote on it . "
Greens leader Bob Brown , whose party is backing Senator Xenophon 's call , described Edward McBride 's story as " terrible " .
" If the Scientology cult has nothing to hide it wo n't be concerned about an inquiry , " he said .
" There 's a much wider issue here of religious conviction and the passage of money , large amounts of money . "
The Church of Scientology has described Senator Xenophon 's allegations as " outrageous " and false .
In my last post I touched upon the Communicating Sequential Processes calculus that inspired both my Communicating Haskell Processes library ( including the name , of course ) and the new Go language .
This post serves as a brief introduction to CSP , and shows how it relates to CHP .
For those interested in learning more about CSP , Hoare ’s original book is available for free online , and is very readable , especially considering its formal subject matter .
Hoare ’s book is largely still accurate , but is superseded by Roscoe ’s book , which is also freely available online .
I ’m going to quote from the two texts in this post ; “ quote ” ( H123 ) is a quote from page 123 of Hoare , and “ quote ” ( R123 ) is from Roscoe .
Events
CSP is built on the idea of events .
An event is a synchronisation that several concurrent processes can engage in .
Events in CSP do not need to be pre-declared , and which processes synchronise together on events is determined by a notion of alphabets that I ’m not going to cover here — because CHP does n’t have alphabets , or events per se .
CHP has barriers , which are a synchronisation that several concurrent processes can engage in , and thus they serve as a useful stand - in for events .
The main difference is that barriers have the notion of membership , support dynamically enrolling on ( and resigning from ) the barrier at run-time — and they need to be allocated before use .
Events are written with lower - case names in CSP ; Hoare ’s book has lots of vending machine examples with events such as coin and choc .
Processes
CSP separates event synchronisations ( the act of engaging in a single event ) from processes ( which can be composed of many synchronisations ) ; in Haskell terms they should have different types .
However , separating the types of an event synchronisation from a process would bring a whole load of pain — not least that I could not easily define a CHP monad — so I discard this in favour of everything being a process ; an event synchronisation and a process are both of type CHP a , and thus there is no difference at the type - level between engaging in one event and engaging in many events .
Sequencing
The simplest form of sequencing in CSP is the prefix operator .
“ Given an event a and a process P , a -> P is the process which is initially willing to communicate a and will wait indefinitely for this a to happen .
After a it behaves like P. ” ( R14 ) .
So in my CHP monad , this prefix operator is the standard monadic sequence operator , >> .
CSP also has a semi-colon operator for sequencing two processes ( which relies on notions of termination — a complex issue in formal systems of computation ! ) , which also maps to >> in CHP .
As an example , here is Hoare ’s vending machine ( H6 ) that continually waits for a coin before dispensing a chocolate :
VMS = coin -> choc -> VMS
In CHP I might write this as :
vms = syncBarrier coin >> syncBarrier choc >> vms
Communication
Communication is central to CHP , and CSP .
To perform a communication , we need a mechanism for performing an output to a channel , and a corresponding mechanism to input from the other end of the channel .
We ’ll start with output : “ A process which first outputs v on the channel c and then behaves like P is defined ( c! v -> P ) . ” ( H113 ) .
This translates to a call to writeChannel and monadic sequencing in CHP : writeChannel c x >> p .
Where I find the correspondence of CSP and CHP to be fascinating is in the definition of performing an input from a channel .
“ A process which is initially prepared to input any value x communicable on the channel c , and then behave like P( x ) , is defined ( c?x -> P( x ) ) . ” ( H114 ) .
To put it differently , this performs the action of reading a value from channel c , and binds the return value to x in the right - hand side of the arrow .
This should sound familiar to Haskell programmers — this is monadic bind !
Indeed , here is the CHP rendering : readChannel c >>= \x -> p(x ) , or more simply : readChannel c >>= p .
As an example , here is a CSP process ( H115 ) that copies values from its left channel to its right channel :
COPY ( left , right ) = left ?x -> right !x -> COPY ( left , right )
This can be converted to CHP as follows :
copy :: Chanin a ->
Chanout a -> CHP ( ) copy left right = ( readChannel left >>= writeChannel right ) >> copy left right
Note that in CSP , a channel can be thought of as a ( potentially infinite ) set of events : one event for each value that could be communicated down the channel .
So for some integer channel c , c.0 would be one event , c.1 another , etc ) .
Thus channels in CSP are a sort of syntactic sugar on top of events — but in CHP we deal with actual channels that can communicate values , and they are distinct from barriers .
CSP is declarative , so it does not support the idea of assignment , or altering the value of a variable .
Values are only introduced through the aforementioned binding of inputs , through constants , or by parameterisation of processes .
Which means that slotting CSP into Haskell comes fairly naturally .
We have seen that the sequencing of communications maps well to a monad ( the CHP monad ) .
The main other aspects of CSP are parallel composition and choice , which are process combinators in CHP ( i.e. they have a type like CHP a -> CHP b -> CHP c ) .
Parallel Composition
CSP allows for parallel composition of processes .
Two processes composed in parallel run in parallel , and “ a parallel combination terminates when all of the combined processes terminate … the best way of thinking about [ this ] is that all of the processes are allowed to terminate when they want to , and that the overall combination terminates when the last one does . ” ( R143 ) .
These semantics also apply to CHP ’s parallel composition .
CSP ’s notation for composing P and Q in parallel : P || Q is near - identical to the CHP version : P < | | >
Q ( they only differ because || is already used in the Prelude ) .
Choice
CSP has the notion of external choice .
“ If x and y are distinct events then ( x -> P [ ] y -> Q ) describes an object which initially engages in either of the events x or y .
After the first event has occurred , the subsequent behaviour of the object is described by P if the first event was x , or by Q if the first event was y . ” ( H7 ) .
CSP has rules for what happens if the first events are not distinct ; in CHP this is considered to be a programmer error .
Note that the choice is only of the first events , not of later events in P and Q ; this is also the case in CHP , although it requires a certain amount of wizardry underneath to pick out the leading event of a CHP code block .
In CHP we use <-> as the choice operator .
As an example , Roscoe defines a counting process : “ COUNT (n ) is the process which will communicate any sequence of up ’s and down ’s , as long as there have never been n + 1 more down ’s than up ’s . ” ( R17 ) :
COUNT(0 ) = up -> COUNT(1 )
COUNT(n ) = ( up -> COUNT ( n+1 ) ) [ ] ( down -> COUNT ( n−1 ) )
We can translate this into CHP fairly directly ( using barriers for the up and down events ) :
count :: EnrolledBarrier -> EnrolledBarrier -> Int -> CHP ( ) count up down 0 = syncBarrier up >> count up down 1 count up down n = ( syncBarrier up >> count up down ( n+1 ) ) <-> ( syncBarrier down >> count up down ( n - 1 ) )
CSP also deals with nondeterministic choice , notated P |~| Q .
“ It is important to appreciate the difference between P [ ] Q and P |~| Q .
The process ( a -> STOP ) [ ]
( b > STOP ) is obliged to communicate a or b if offered only one of them , whereas ( a -> STOP ) | ~| ( b -> STOP ) may reject either .
It is only obliged to communicate if the environment offers both a and b .
In the first case , the choice of what happens is in the hands of the environment , in the second it is in the hands of the process . ” ( R24 ) .
I do not offer nondeterministic choice in CHP ; “ even though [ nondeterministic choices ] are not constructs one would be likely to use in any program written for execution in the usual sense , CSP contains … ways of presenting the nondeterministic choice of processes . ” ( R23 ) .
That is , nondeterministic choice is a modelling construct useful for capturing and reasoning about the behaviour of processes , but it is not something you would mean to write in a program ( a bit like bottom in Haskell , perhaps ) .
Primitive Processes
CSP has two useful primitive processes : SKIP and STOP ( skip and stop in CHP ) .
SKIP is the process which is always ready in a choice , and always immediately terminates successfully .
So in CHP it has the behaviour of return ( ) , but with the special property that it can be used in a choice .
STOP is the process which is never ready in a choice , and never terminates .
In CHP it acts the same — it is primarily useful for not being ready in a choice ( and thus for dummy items in a choice ) ; running a process that has the sole purpose of doing nothing and not terminating is rarely useful !
Summary
CSP is a formal calculus underlying CHP , in much the same way that the lambda calculus underlies Haskell .
It is useful for formal reasoning about programs , and expressing semantics , but just as you do not need to know the lambda calculus to program Haskell , you do not need to know CSP in order to program CHP .
CSP does have a model checker , FDR , which is freely available for academic use , and I have done some work on turning simple CHP programs into CSP ( and feeding them to FDR ) automatically ( which I will tidy up and release when I get time ) .
CSP also provided the idea of traces , which feature in CHP , and were briefly described in a previous post on using traces for testing .
Note : I could use operators ( including GHC ’s postfix operators ) to provide an interface for the channel operations .
I could define :
(!) = writeChannel (? ) = readChannel
Then I could take this CSP process :
COPY ( input , output ) = input ?x -> output !x -> COPY ( input , output )
and write it in CHP as :
copy input output = ( input ? ) >>= \x -> output !x >> copy input output
I did n’t want the code to end up too much like ASCII spaghetti so I decided against these operators , but feel free to define these in your own code if you prefer the operator version .
Unfortunately you always need those brackets around the input , so the do version becomes :
copy input output = do x <- ( input ? ) output !
x copy input output
Making Template Tag Parsing Easier¶
In my previous post about template tags , I discussed the two steps required for template tags .
Today I will be focusing on Parsing of template tags , and how they may be improved in the framework of Class Based Template Tags from yesterday .
I have talked about problems with template parsing in the past as well .
This post will offer 2 different approaches to making parsing better .
I would like to thank Cody and Chris who were involved in a slightly drunken conversation that led to these tags .
Chris actually wrote the other neat parsing implementation that I will talk about today .
Cody wrote the underpinnings of that implementation as well .
Note : Both of these approaches are more Proof of Concepts , and the code probably shows .
Please do n’t knock implementations , and just think about the ideas housed within .
Parsing from above - A DSL approach ¶ I ’m going to go ahead and start talking about an approach to parsing template tags that was pointed out in yesterday ’s comments .
It takes surlex which is made for easily parsing URL’s , and applies it to the concept of parsing template tags .
In the tag_utils package , I looked at the tests , because they make great documentation .
Here is an example of a tag definition .
p = ParsedNode ( ' test ' , '< arg1:int > < arg2:string > < kw: kwarg > ' , test_expected ) register .
tag ( ' test ' , p )
This defines a tag called test , which parses an int , string , and kwarg from a surlex expression .
The third argument is a function that is executed on the arguments on rendering .
This allows you in your test_expected function , to act on the arguments that are defined inside of the surlex expression .
A trivial example of the test_expected function is : def test_expected ( context , arg1 , arg2 , kw = None ) : print " Got %s and %s " % ( arg1 , arg2 )
So if you called the tag { % test 1 racoon %} , it would print out Got 1 and racoon .
This is an interesting way to provide a sort of DSL on top of the current mess that is parsing of template tags .
I really like how it reuses Surlex , which was made for parsing URLs .
However , parsing template tags is a similar task , and it works well here too !
I could imagine this easily being bolted on to the approach from yesterday , which might allow for easier subclassing and reuse of the parsing functions .
Parsing based on keywords ¶
An approach that I have talked about in the past is basically a subset of the above idea .
It allows you to define kwarg type arguments for your tags , and have them magically parsed out for you .
An example of this is my own SelfParsingTag .
The following lines allow you to specify what arguments your tag will accept .
def __init__ ( self , required_tags = [ ] ) : if not required_tags : self .
required_tags = self .
_get_tags ( ) else : self .
required_tags = required_tags def _get_tags ( self ) : return []
So you can either define the _get_tags function , or pass the allowed tags into the call when you make the tag .
The following 2 bits of code are equivalent .
class GetContentTag ( SelfParsingNode ) : def _get_tags ( self ) : return [ ' as ' , ' for ' , ' limit ' ] register .
tag ( ' get_latest_content ' , GetContentTag ( ) )
# Is the same as the following : class GetContentTag ( SelfParsingNode ) : pass register .
tag ( ' get_latest_content ' , GetContentTag ( [ ' as ' , ' for ' , ' limit ' ] ) )
Once the Tag knows what it arguments it will be accepting , it parses them .
def parse_content ( self , parser , token ) : parsed = parse_ttag ( token , self .
required_tags ) for tag , val in parsed .
items ( ) : setattr ( self , ' _' + tag , val ) return parsed
This effectively sets a private varible on the tag to the value of the arg .
So for example , if the tag was called { % sweet_tag for news .
story as my_stories limit 10 %} , then self .
_for would equal news.
story , and so on .
It also returns the parsed values as a dictionary .
There are a lot of improvements that could be made to parse_ttag , but it works as a basic implementation .
This approach allows us to implement a tag really easily .
If you want a ( silly ) tag that just updated the context with whatever value you input , you could make a simple tag .
It would be used { % my_tag with " awesome text " as context_var %} class SimpleContextTag ( SelfParsingTag ) : def _get_tags ( self ) : return [ ' with ' , ' as ' ] def render_content ( self , tags , context ) : for tag in self .
required_tags : context .
update ( { tag [ ' as ' ] : tags [ ' with ' ] } ) register .
tag ( ' my_tag ' , SimpleContextTag ( ) )
To implement the get_latest_object code from yesterday , we can skip all of the parsing steps .
class GetContentTag ( SelfParsingTag ) : def _get_tags ( self ) : return [ ' as ' , ' for ' , ' limit ' ] def render_content ( self , context ) : self .
model = get_model ( * self .
_for . split ( '.' ) ) if self .
model is None : raise template .
TemplateSyntaxError ( " Generic content tag got invalid model : %s " % model ) query_set = self .
model .
_default_manager . all ( ) context [ self .
_as ] = list ( query_set [ : self .
_limit ] ) register .
tag ( ' get_latest_object ' , GetContentTag ( ) )
If Harrison Ford and Sly Stallone can muscle back into the limelight in belated sequels to their defining roles , equal opportunities must dictate that here come the ( Show ) girls
The recent explosion of films featuring rickety old beefcakes doing their best to revive their past glories – think Die Hard 4.0 , Rocky Balboa , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – was all well and good , but it quite clearly favoured male actors .
Where are the female stars making belated sequels to their biggest hits ?
Where 's Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise 2 ( we never saw them actually die , after all ) ?
Where 's Sally Field in Steel Magnolias 2 : Steelier Magnolias ?
Where 's Bridget Fonda in Single White and Conspicuously Older Female ?
Well , hold your horses , because a wave of belated female - led movie sequels might just be on the horizon .
And it 's coming from the most obviously feminist - friendly genre of them all – the erotic thriller .
2006 's Basic Instinct 2 : Risk Addiction might have been a bit of a failed experiment ; in retrospect , asking Stan Collymore to simulate a sex act and setting the entire movie inside a building that 's shaped exactly like an erect penis might have been overegging it slightly .
But that has n't stopped Rena Riffel from signing up to reprise her role as Hope in the just - announced Showgirls 2 : The Story of Hope .
If Showgirls 2 turns out to be a success – even an ironic one , which seems to be the most likely outcome judging by the gormless website – then it's only going to be a matter of time before other middle - aged female actors start putting their names to new erotic thriller sequels .
And , personally , I do n't think that can come a moment too soon .
Imagine it .
Cindy Crawford coming out of retirement to disrobe for Fair Game 2 .
Or Madonna signing up for another Body of Evidence which , given that Body of Evidence was a shameless Basic Instinct rip - off , would probably be called Body of Evidence 2 : Risk Addiction and feature Stan Collymore simulating a sex act inside a building that 's shaped exactly like an erect penis .
And who has n't dreamed of a Bound 2 depicting nothing but Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon doing the sort of things middle - aged lesbians might do , like buying dogs and enrolling on dreamcatcher - making workshops ?
I know I have .
I want all the old erotic thriller actors from the 1980s and 1990s to make comebacks .
I want to see 55 - year - old Kathleen Turner writhing on top of a terrified man in the middle of a Body Heat follow - up .
I want to see mother - of - two Denise Richards romp around cluelessly like the world 's oldest schoolgirl in a sequel to Wild Things .
I want to see The Colour of Night 2 .
Actually , I do n't want to see The Colour of Night 2 .
Nobody wants to see that .
What 's more , all the female actors participating in these belated erotic thriller sequels would receive an immediate career boost from it , especially from the generation of men who furtively idolised them all so much as schoolboys .
Plus , is there a better way for these actors to kick out at modern society 's obsession with youth and beauty than by whipping their pants off and humping a dodgy copper in slow motion to some bad saxophone music ?
No , of course there is n't .
Someone really should have thought twice before letting Sean Hannity embarrass himself with the failed stunt he tried in his interview with Michael Moore , the second half of which aired last night on Fox .
Hannity wanted to make a point about how health care in Cuba is so much worse than it is in the YooEssAy -- in contradistinction to Moore 's own reportage -- so he offered what he called special video footage he had been provided of a " hospital " in Cuba .
What we then see is a rattletrap mess with old beds and rotting toilets , etc .
But Moore notices what should be obvious :
There are no patients , either .
Ah , but wait !
We shortly see footage of patients in a hospital .
But they 're in an obviously different building ( or at least wing ) , because this room is clean and the beds and equipment sanitary and well - tended .
But we only get to see them for a few seconds before -- swoop ! -- off we go back to the rat 's nest .
Which is obviously an abandoned hospital or wing , which is certainly not unheard of , even in the YooEssAy .
Moore , of course , laughs at all of this with glee .
Hannity quickly changes the subject , since his oh - so - convincing video evidence just makes him look as bad as he has recently in his Jennings Jihad .
You 'd think Hannity & Co. would know better than to try to run such hamhandedly edited footage past an experienced filmmaker like Moore .
This was so amateurish that they all should just be embarrassed .
But they 're too arrogant and too stupid to be so .
At the Denver conference , world oil production was discussed from both the supply side ( what flow rate can be reached ) and the demand side ( how much can the economy afford ) .
It is really the combination of the two that is important -- so I bring together both in this post .
Telling our children and grandchildren where they will draw their heat , electricity and liquid fuels from was not a topic of discussion in Denver .
Nonetheless , much information was conveyed on the relationship between the economics crisis and the future of oil .
This post is an attempt to summarize the main points on oil and the economy from the conference presentations -- concluding that there are three distinct future trajectories as we go forward .
" Peak oil can be a very tricky topic , the way I talk about it and deal with it at the end of the day is :
We need to revolutionize the way we consume and produce energy ...
We need to really be the leaders in saying : the future for our children and our grandchildren as far as energy consumption and as far as production , it looks like this " with those words Colorado Governor Bill Ritter started his closing speech at the ASPO conference in Denver that took place from 10 to 12 October 2009 .
Oil - the supply side - what flow rate can we reach ?
An overview of the future of oil at the conference was given by Ray Leonard of Hyperdynamics Corporation ( PDF ) and Chris Skrebowksi of Peak Oil Consulting ( PDF ) .
Ray Leonard who has extensive experience as former Vice President of Yukos in Russia and Kuwait Energy Company in Kuwait , showed that conceptually dividing the world of oil into 3 segments makes sense :
- OPEC controlling 73.9 % of world reserves and 44.9 % of worldproduction
- The Former Soviet Union ( FSU ) controlling 12.7 % of world reserves and 15.6 % of world production
- The Rest of World controlling 13.4 % of reserves and 39.5 % of production .
This distinction makes sense from a political perspective , as OPEC and the FSU operate under much different political and economic circumstances than the Rest of the World .
Ray Leonard estimates that Russian production could theoretically increase by another 4 million b/d with new field developments but that this is unlikely to happen due to the Russian tax system and Russian firms lacking the necessary capital .
OPEC is in a similar situation of not being able to expand production due to a lack of capital as International Oil Companies are barred from investing in secondary and tertiary recovery .
In Ray Leonard 's words : " Limitation on production level for OPEC is mostly due to politics , lack of motivation , investment level and type of crude ; NOT shortage of reserves . "
OPEC could hence be increasing production greatly by implementing secondary and tertiary production techniques such as water injection but this possibility is nigh impossible in his view .
The division Ray Leonard made between these regions was neatly depicted by Chris Skrebowski in a chart reproduced here .
Figure 1 - Overview of Reserves and Production in three different regions of the world from Peak Oil Consulting
Ray Leonard showed that production in the Rest of the World peaked in 2002 and by 2008 declined by 7 % .
With OPEC and Russia unable to increase production significantly due to politics and economics , we are nearing World Peak Oil Production .
" Production peak of ultra deep water fields will allow ' peak ' to be a ' plateau ' in the coming decade , followed by a sharp fall " according to Leonard .
Unconventional production is not set to change this situation , as his expectation is that the contribution of this category of oil will be less than 3 million barrels per day in the short to middle term .
The specific path of future oil production was projected by Chris Skrebowksi using the oil megaprojects approach , wherein all the large fields expected to come on - stream in the next seven years are tabulated and compared with decline rates in current fields .
In this approach , only the supply side is taken into account and the demand side is ignored .
From that perspective according to Chris Skrebowksi the current plateau will continue until around 2014 when the decline sets in , shown in figure 2 below .

Figure 3 - Update from Rembrandt Koppelaar on oil production to 2030 including current fields , discoveries , new fields projects , enhanced oil recovery , natural gas liquids and unconventional oil .
Figure 4 - Liquid Fuels production scenario from Douglas Westwood to 2025 including onshore , offshore , oilsands , oil shales , Gas - to - liquids , coal - to - liquids and biofuels .
From oil supply analysis to demand analysis - three future trajectories
A similar approach was presented by myself in the first update of a new project where I showed a continued plateau with potentially a small increase before the decline starts around 2014 .
This date is based upon an analysis using a database of individual projects and the assumption that the decline rate will accelerate from 4.5 % to 6.5 % .
The difference between my analysis and Skrebowski's is that I use a more severe decline rate and also include many more projects .
There are around 600 fields in my database versus around 250 in Chris Skrebowski's , because he did not include smaller fields , hence the term megaprojects .
A post on this is in the works with publication due in November here at The Oil Drum .
Interestingly another speaker at the conference , Douglas Westwood , presented a similar scenario with a plateau continuing until around 2014 , after which the decline sets in : Such analyses however do not include demand side effects and are therefore limited in portraying an accurate picture of the future .
A major factor that was discussed extensively at the conference was fortunately the interplay between supply , demand and prices .
Steven Kopits from Douglas - Westwood ( PDF presentation not available ) kicked off the discussion on the role of demand and prices in oil supply by showing that growth in the world economy did not stop despite a lack of growth in oil supply since the fourth quarter of 2004 .
" Oil supply stopped responding , GDP growth still went up , oil prices rose , and that put us [ the United States economy ] in a recession , and that 's why I argue that this is the first Peak Oil recession , " according to Kopits .
Based on this reasoning , future oil prices will be determined by how quickly demand will again hit oil capacity limits .
Kopits thinks that this could happen quite soon , as he foresees huge growth levels in China .
The country is expected to overtake the US in oil consumption by 2018 , at 21 million barrels of production per day .
The general pattern that he presented is that emerging economies will overtake supply from the developed economies of the world .
Oil consumption in the latter will be driven down by high prices resulting in increased fuel efficiency and the development of large scale alternatives .
" Belt tightening is expected to happen " says Kopits .
So in one future possibility a ' bullish path ' emerges where the pattern we just saw happening repeats itself , emerging economies grow , prices rise and developed economies have to give way and are forced to use less oil .
The big question in this future is the amount of growth in emerging economies , most notably China .
Allen Stevens , of Stifel - Nicolaus ( PDF ) showed an interesting graph in his presentation comparing per capita consumption in various countries , showing the huge gap between oil consumption in emerging and developed economies .
Figure 5 - Per capita oil consumption in USA , Japan , South Korea , Hong Kong , China and India , chart from Stifel - Nicolaus
Figure 6 - Chinese oil demand by end use from 1990 to 2030 , chart from PFC Energy
Figure 7 - China 's GDP and lending , chart from Dave Cohen of ASPO USA
The view that Chinese demand will move up so quickly was contested by Michael Rodgers of PFC Energy ( PDF ) who gave an outlook on future oil & gas production and consumption in China ( PDF ) .
Based on their model that included eight categories of oil demand , energy efficiency , solid but slowing GDP growth patterns , and a similar car trajectory as in developed countries , Chinese oil demand was foreseen to hit 11 million b/d by 2015 and slightly more than 12 million b/d by 2020 , shown in the figure below .
This slower growth was also portrayed in Dave Cohen of ASPO - USA ( presentation found here ( PDF ) .
Cohen showed a second type of future with a more protracted economic downturn -- either a very long slow recovery with many up and down patterns or a more L shaped depression similar to the great depression of the 1930s .
The underlying mechanism for this pattern would be the inter - linkage between the Chinese and United States economy .
It is clear that Americans must repair their balance sheets and are in deep debt trouble , but also the Chinese economy is not faring so well according to Dave Cohen .
He showed that China 's GDP numbers are inflated because of the way output is calculated , and that recent GDP growth in China is ( almost ) entirely due to a huge internal governmental stimulus which is not a sustainable economic investment pattern .
" The Chinese , traditionally a nation of savers , needs to build up their domestic demand .
This requires steady “ organic ” year - over - year growth over the next decade or longer .
Otherwise , the economy overheats and you get mis-allocation of resources ( capital ) and bubbles ( like now ) , " according to Cohen .
He concludes that China will not provide the consumption engine the world economy needs for sustained growth as their economy and domestic demand is too small , and because of these factors , that Chinese oil demand will not grow in the future at the levels seen pre-2008 .
The implication of these factors is that there will be a much slower return to high oil prices and several cycles of contraction before the world 's balance sheets are again at a reasonable level .
A third possible future which looks at the financial system as the driver of our current situation was shown by Nate Hagens of The Oil Drum ( PDF1 ) , ( PDF2 ) .
Hagens disagrees with Kopits in calling this the first peakoil recession : " I do not think peak oil caused this financial crisis ; peak oil is one of many symptoms of an exponential growth based system running into finite limits . "
Due to continued exponential growth in our financial system that was not based on accumulating sufficient resources , we have accumulated so much debt that this can no longer be paid off under any scenario .
" We have an amazing overshoot of debt , by my calculations the total amount of debt , not derivatives but total debt , is between 230 and 290 trillion dollars ... That 's beyond the ability to pay back ... Basically we have overextended the relationship between debt and real assets . " according to Hagens .
He showed the amount of debt accumulation in the United States shown in figure 8 below , but it is n't just the United States .
" The whole world is around 300 % to 400 % in debt relative to GDP . "
Figure 8 - Debt accumulation , chart shown by Nate Hagens made by Hannes Kunz of the IIER
Figure 9 - Conceptual development of GDP and energy prices , chart shown by Nate Hagens
Synopsis - uncertainty over our future path
As money is a claim on future resources , and these resources cannot be forthcoming due to limits of growth , a debt deflationary spiral will ensue , resulting in a downward trajectory of GDP , causing a decline in resource prices that results in further underinvestment in resource production .
As the world comes out of this deflationary cycle , the physical resource basis for renewed growth will have degraded significantly , higher prices will kick - in again and GDP will be affected .
There was no comment on how long this reinforcing cycle would continue or where it would end .
Under this scenario we would have already reached peak prices according to Nate Hagens because the future economy can sustain only much lower prices due to the erosion of resource capital .
Conceptually this trajectory is shown in figure 9 .
Although supply side analyses show that oil supply can remain on a plateau until around 2014 and would decline relatively slowly afterwards , the picture may change significantly because of the current disconnect between levels of debt in most economies of the world and the physical resource base .
Several future scenarios could emerge as a result of this situation .
In one future scenario we will witness continued high oil prices as emerging economies are able to sustain renewed strong growth and thereby outbid developed countries with respect to future oil consumption .
The resulting decline in consumption in OECD countries will be relatively smooth as high prices induce massive investment in energy efficiency and alternative fuels .
This assumes that such fast growth is possible on the existing physical resource basis and that the current debt situation can be managed in some way .
In a second future scenario , we see a much slower growth scenario in emerging economies as they too suffer from overhanging debt and are too interlinked with developed countries to be able to sustain high growth levels .
The future will in that case be more like a U shaped or even great depression like L shaped situation ; oil ( and resource ) price cycles will occur with high price volatility and a lack of sustained investment .
We can muddle through , but at significant reduction in GDP as huge shocks ripple through the system , and also huge risk of political and geopolitical cascades .
In a third scenario , the debt situation has become too big to solve globally , and we enter a deflationary self - reinforcing spiral .
GDP will spiral downward , resulting in much less investment in the physical base of our economies .
In this scenario , even when the economy recovers , resource scarcity kicks in due to a serious lack of investment , and GDP again declines under the pressure of very high prices .
As to which of these futures ( or variants ) will occur , I have not made sufficient analysis to offer an opinion , but I am sure that collectively there is sufficient knowledge to point to which direction is most probable .
Thanks to ASPO - USA
I want to expressly thank ASPO - USA for organizing this great conference in Denver which has brought me many useful insights in the relationship between oil and our economy .
The other day I was pondering on Linked Open Data Source Dynamics and as a starting point I wanted to learn more about the caching characteristics of LOD data sources .
Now , in order to establish a baseline , one should have a look at what HTTP , one of the pillars of Linked Data , offers ( see also RFC2616 , Caching in HTTP ) .
So , I hacked a little PHP script that takes 17 sample resources from the LOD cloud ( from representative datasets ranging from DBpedia over GeoSpecies to W3C Wordnet ) .
The results of the LOD caching evaluation are somewhat deflating : more than half of the samples do not support cache control and less than 20 % support Last - Modified or ETag headers .
I know , I know , this is just a very limited experiment .
And yes , very likely there are not yet that many applications out there consuming Linked Data and hence using up the whole bandwidth .
However , given that one of the arguments for the scalability on the Web is the built - in HTTP caching mechanism , LOD dataset publisher might want to consider having a closer look into what the server or platform at hand is able to offer concerning caching support .

Iranian women are often the target of crackdowns on Western - style dress
Iranian police have warned shopkeepers not to display female mannequins without a hijab , or showing bodily curves , Irna news agency reports .
Display of bow ties and neckties , and the sale of women 's underwear by men are also banned , the police said .
The move is part of a crackdown on Western influences and enforcement of dress codes in recent years .
" Un - Islamic behaviour " has been targeted since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's first election in 2005 .
" Using unusual mannequins exposing body curves and with heads without hijabs [ Muslim veils ] are prohibited to be used in the shops , " police said in a statement carried by Irna .
Correspondents say that in the past such campaigns usually only lasted throughout the summer , but last year 's crackdown , including on tight trousers for women , was still continuing in the winter .
Iranians who violate dress codes for the first time are generally cautioned , but repeat offenders can face court action and " guidance classes " .
It 's " too early " to say whether Rep.
Ron Paul will run again for president , the Texas Republican said Saturday .
The libertarian congressman told a crowd in Iowa , the starting point for a presidential campaign , that he is simply focused on reelection to the House .
" It ’s not on my mind , it ’s too early , and I will be filing for my congressional seat , ” Paul said in an interview with IowaPolitics.com .
“ I do n’t have any plans made , " he said .
Paul 's insurgent run for the Republican nomination in 2008 allowed him to build a semi- formidable grassroots organization and political action committee ( PAC ) .
The 74 - year - old 's son , physician Rand Paul , is currently running for Senate in Kentucky .
Recently I ran the following twitter :
“ I ’m in a board meeting .
Having a miscarriage .
Thank goodness , because there ’s a fucked - up 3 - week hoop - jump to have an abortion in Wisconsin . ”
Why the uproar over this twitter ?
Not only have bloggers written whole posts about the disgustingness of it , but 70 people unfollowed me , and people actually came to my blog and wrote complaints about the twitter on random , unrelated posts .
So , to all of you who think the twitter was outrageous , think about this :
Most miscarriages happen at work .
Twenty - five percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage .
Seventy - five percent of women who are of child - bearing age are working .
Most miscarriages run their course over weeks .
Even if you are someone who wanted the baby and are devastated by the loss , you ’re not going to sit in bed for weeks .
You are going to pick up your life and get back to it , which includes going back to work .
This means that there are thousands of miscarriages in progress , at work , on any given day .
That we do n’t acknowledge this is absurd .
That it is such a common occurrence and no one thinks it ’s okay to talk about is terrible for women .
Throughout history , the way women have gained control of the female experience is to talk about what is happening , and what it ’s like .
We see that women ’s lives are more enjoyable , more full , and women are more able to summon resilience when women talk openly about their lives .
To all of you who said a miscarriage is gross :
Are you unaware that the same blood you expel from a miscarriage is what you expel during menstruation ?
Are you aware that many people are having sex during menstruation and getting it on the sheets ?
Are you aware that many women actually like period sex ?
Wait .
Here is a link I love , at askmen.com , telling men that women like it so much that men need to be aware of this preference .
To all of you who are aghast that I let myself get pregnant : having sex is playing with odds .
There are no 100 % sure methods of birth control .
I am 42 years old .
The likelihood of someone my age getting pregnant even with fertility treatment is less than 5 % .
The likelihood that a pregnancy in someone my age ends in a miscarriage is almost 75 % .
This means that even if I had done nothing for birth control it would have been as effective as a 25 - year - old using a condom .
So everyone who is complaining that I ’m an idiot for getting pregnant should go buy a calculator .
To all of you who said I should not be happy about having a miscarriage :
You are the ones short on empathy .
Any woman who is pregnant but wishes she were n’t would of course be grateful when she has a miscarriage .
Yes , there are many women who want the baby and have a miscarriage .
I was one of them .
I cried for days .
I get it .
But if you have ever had an abortion , which I have , you would know that a miscarriage is preferable to an abortion .
Even the Pope would agree with that .
And what is up with the fact that just one , single person commented about how Wisconsin has a three - week waiting period for abortions ?
It is absolutely outrageous how difficult it was going to be for me to get an abortion , and it ’s outrageous that no one is outraged .
Wisconsin is one of twelve states that have 24 - hour waiting periods .
This puts a huge burden on an overworked system .
These are also the states where there are few ways to get an abortion .
For example , in Wisconsin , the only place to get abortion that is covered by insurance is at a Planned Parenthood clinic .
There are 3 of them in all of Wisconsin .
In Chicago , you can get an abortion at Planned Parenthood with less than 24 hours notice .
In Wisconsin , there is a week and a half wait to get the first meeting and a week and half wait to get the abortion .
A digression : I ’m linking to Planned Parenthood so everyone can make a donation .
This organization is enabling women to have the right to abortion .
Planned Parenthood seems to be the only effective , community - level force against states that are attempting to legislate the choice into oblivion .
To all of you who think this has nothing to do with work :
I think what really upsets people is the topic .
We are not used to talking about the female experience , and especially not in the context of work .
But so what ?
We can start now .
The female experience is part of work .
What we talk about when we talk about work defines how we integrate work into our lives .
If work is going to support our lives , then we need to talk about how our lives interact with work .
We need to be honest about the interaction if we hope to be honest about our work .
Melbourne 's new train operator is investigating a spate of cancellations on the company 's first morning in charge .
Metro took over the rail network from Connex at 3:00 am , running its first service from Frankston , just before 4:30 am .
Metro chief executive , Andrew Lezala , says they have had too many cancellations this morning and staff are trying to fix the problems .
" Most of those are rolling stock - related faults , so reliability faults with the rolling stock , " he said .
" So clearly we 've got a lot of work to do to address those and put some long - term fixes in place . "
The Premier , John Brumby , says he expects the new transport operators to run a more punctual and reliable system , but says it will not happen overnight .
" They 'll happen over the course of the next few months and the next few years , " he said .
" I am very confident that you are going to see steady and continuous improvement in the way in which our public transport system operates in our state . "
The new tram operator , KDR has pledged to improve service as well .
Company spokesman Colin Tyrus says all tram services will be reviewed , to ensure they have the largest capacity trams where they are needed most .
" We do have a fleet of more than 100 high - capacity low - floor trams already out of our total fleet , so we 'll deploy them to the areas they 're most needed . "
" What we 'll be doing is improving our services to customers .
There will be no cutbacks , " he said .
The State Opposition says the new train and tram operators face huge problems .
The Opposition 's transport spokesman , Terry Mulder , says a change of uniform and a coat of paint is not going to fix the problems that we have with infrastructure .
" They 've got one hell of a job ahead of them .
I wish them luck , " he said .
" I 'd just say to the commuters .
The system out there at the moment , these people do n't own it , they 've inherited it . "
" But it is up to the Brumby Government to provide these operators with what they need to run the system , " he said .

Mercury Rising
by Staff Writers
MOffett Field CA ( SPX ) Nov 05 , 2009
A NASA spacecraft 's third and final flyby of Mercury gives scientists , for the first time , an almost complete view of the planet 's surface and provides new scientific findings about this relatively unknown world .
The Mercury Surface , Space Environment , Geochemistry and Ranging spacecraft , known as MESSENGER , flew by Mercury on Sept. 29 .
The probe completed a critical gravity assist to remain on course to enter into orbit around Mercury in 2011 .
Despite shutting down temporarily because of a power system switchover during a solar eclipse , the spacecraft 's cameras and instruments collected high - resolution and color images unveiling another 6 percent of the planet 's surface never before seen at close range .
Approximately 98 percent of Mercury 's surface now has been imaged by NASA spacecraft .
After MESSENGER goes into orbit around Mercury , it will see the polar regions , which are the only unobserved areas of the planet .
" Although the area viewed for the first time by spacecraft was less than 350 miles across at the equator , the new images reminded us that Mercury continues to hold surprises , " said Sean Solomon , principal investigator for the mission and director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington .
Many new features were revealed during the third flyby , including a region with a bright area surrounding an irregular depression , suspected to be volcanic in origin .
Other images revealed a double - ring impact basin approximately 180 miles across .
The basin is similar to a feature scientists call the Raditladi basin , which was viewed during the probe 's first flyby of Mercury in January 2008 .
" This double - ring basin , seen in detail for the first time , is remarkably well preserved , " said Brett Denevi , a member of the probe 's imaging team and a postdoctoral researcher at Arizona State University in Tempe .
" One similarity to Raditladi is its age , which has been estimated to be approximately one billion years old .
Such an age is quite young for an impact basin , because most basins are about four times older .
The inner floor of this basin is even younger than the basin itself and differs in color from its surroundings .
We may have found the youngest volcanic material on Mercury . "
One of the spacecraft 's instruments conducted its most extensive observations to date of Mercury 's exosphere , or thin atmosphere , during this encounter .
The flyby allowed for the first detailed scans over Mercury 's north and south poles .
The probe also has begun to reveal how Mercury 's atmosphere varies with its distance from the sun .
" A striking illustration of what we call ' seasonal ' effects in Mercury 's exosphere is that the neutral sodium tail , so prominent in the first two flybys , is 10 to 20 times less intense in emission and significantly reduced in extent , " says participating scientist Ron Vervack , of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , or APL , in Laurel , Md .
" This difference is related to expected variations in solar radiation pressure as Mercury moves in its orbit and demonstrates why Mercury 's exosphere is one of the most dynamic in the solar system . "
The observations also show that calcium and magnesium exhibit different seasonal changes than sodium .
Studying the seasonal changes in all exospheric constituents during the mission orbital phase will provide key information on the relative importance of the processes that generate , sustain , and modify Mercury 's atmosphere .
The third flyby also revealed new information on the abundances of iron and titanium in Mercury 's surface materials .
Earlier Earth and spacecraft - based observations showed that Mercury 's surface has a very low concentration of iron in silicate minerals , a result that led to the view that the planet 's crust is generally low in iron .
" Now we know Mercury 's surface has an average iron and titanium abundance that is higher than most of us expected , similar to some lunar mare basalts , " says David Lawrence , an APL participating mission scientist .
The spacecraft has completed nearly three - quarters of its 4.9 - billion - mile journey to enter orbit around Mercury .
The full trip will include more than 15 trips around the sun .
In addition to flying by Mercury , the spacecraft flew past Earth in August 2005 and Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 .
Studying Mercury could yield important information about how rocky , terrestrial planets form and evolve .
Such information can help astronomers determine how and where potentially habitable planets are most likely to form beyond the solar system .
Last week , I posted about Australian senator Nick Xenophon ‘s inquiry into the Church of Scientology ’s tax exempt status because of the crimes they have committed .
Aaron Saxton was an “ enforcer of the Church of Scientology ’s policies in the Sea Org ”
Xenophon cited seven former Scientologists when making his case against them — Saxton was one of them .
Bef [ redacted ] , a student , managed to get an interview with Saxton and asked him quite a bit about the Church of Scientology .
He got some good answers , too .
If you trust what Saxton says , this is damning information .
Here are just a couple of the excerpts from Saxton ’s replies :
The Church of Scientology has one unique factor about it from other religions .
Every other religion , you ’re given all the information at the start .
So when a person defends the Catholic Church , he can because he has read the entire bible .
The average Scientologist has done less than 10 % of the actual materials in the Church , he does n’t know what he ’s defending ; he has no idea .
You could give him Star Trek XI as OT8 and he will defend it , because he must defend the Church otherwise he is instructed to leave . …
As far as you know while you ’re working there , Scientology is dominating the world , and you want it to dominate the world .
The goal of the Sea Org is not to have Scientology worldwide , the goal of the Sea Org is to control all activities on the planet and to eliminate all people to who are hostile to their stated goals , whatever they may be .
…
We had a Cadet Org set up at Flag Land Base that had more than 50 children .
These kids were n’t allowed to mix with other children , they were n’t allowed to go to a school because they would learn the wrong information about life .
These kids , by the age of 7 , are telling you that they know that they ’ve lived for 75 trillion years , that they know they ’re supposed to be superhuman beings , and the reason why they ’re not is because they were bad people in a past life , and this is why they lost their abilities .
They know that if anybody does n’t join the Sea Org , that they ’re helping to destroy the planet , and they ’re an enemy and they are not to be spoken to .
Ugh .
Makes me sick .
Read the full interview .
Just do n’t do it before you have a big meal .
If you 're fan of turn - based hexagon strategies you 'll have to check this one out :
http://www.wesnoth.org/
Game is set in fantasy world so you can command dwarves , elves , undead and of course human troops ( much like the classic game fantasy general ) , not to mention you 've got opportunity to hook up with extremely attractive princess ( you have to fight her several times before :) .
Rules are pretty complex , yet easy to understand - every kind of terrain has different defense modifiers and movement penalties .
Units have different types of attacks and different vulnerabilities .
For example skeletons are vulnerable to blunt and holy damage while they are pretty hard to harm in any other way , elevens gets defense bonuses when ending their turn in forest , mounted units can do double damage when charging ( but then they also take double damage from retaliation strike ) etc .
What is really great about this game is changing of night and day - chaotic units such as undead or robbers are strongest in the night , while lawful units are strongest in bright day , so you have to plan ahead - attacking undead fort in deep night is nearly suicidemission even for experienced veteran units , while taking them down in bright day is a piece of cake .
Also for a game made by community ( so it is totally free - really ) it has got really good graphics & music background .
Atlantis vaults into orbit on station delivery mission
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : November 16 , 2009
The space shuttle Atlantis roared to life and raced into orbit Monday on a critical mission to deliver 15 tons of equipment and spare parts to the International Space Station , gear needed to protect against failures after the shuttle fleet is retired next year .
Credit : Stephen Clark / Spaceflight Now
The shuttle 's three hydrogen - fueled main engines fired up at 120 - millisecond intervals and six seconds later , after computers verified the powerplants were operating normally , Atlantis ' twin solid - fuel boosters ignited with a flash at 2:28:10 p.m. EST , instantly pushing the orbiter skyward .
As commander Charles Hobaugh and pilot Barry " Butch " Wilmore monitored the computer - controlled ascent , Atlantis wheeled about its vertical axis and arced away to the notheast , into the plane of the space station 's orbit in the first step of a complex two - day rendezvous .
The shuttle 's boosters operated normally , separating from Atlantis ' external fuel tank as planned two minutes and four seconds after liftoff , and the spaceplane continued toward its planned preliminary orbit on the power of its three main engines .
A television camera mounted on the side of Atlantis ' external tank provided spectacular views as the shuttle thundered toward space , showing the Florida coastline and scattered clouds dropping away below as the ship accelerated toward space .
The camera was in place to monitor the external tank 's foam insulation and to look for any signs of debris impacts that might damage fragile heat shield tiles .
Nothing obvious could be seen .
Eight - and - a - half minutes after liftoff , the main engines shut down as planned , Atlantis separated from the now - empty external tank and the crew began preparing the ship for orbital operations .
" We really appreciate all the effort that 's gone into making this launch attempt possible , " Hobaugh said during a final hold in the countdown .
" We 're excited to take this incredible vehicle for a ride and meet up with another incredible vehicle , the International Space Station . "
Joining Hobaugh and Wilmore for the 129th shuttle mission are Leland Melvin , a materials science expert and one - tiome pro football draft pick , and spacewalkers Michael Foreman , Randolph Bresnik and Robert Satcher , an orthopedic surgeon with a doctorate in chemical engineering .
Hobaugh , Foreman and Melvin are shuttle veterans while Satcher , Wilmore and Bresnik are making their first shuttle flight .
In a bit of bad timing , Bresnik 's wife is scheduled to deliver the couple 's second child , a girl , on Nov. 20 , while the crew is still in space .
Over the next two days , the astronauts will inspect the shuttle 's heat shield , check out the spacesuits that will be used during three station excursions and prepared Atlantis for docking with the lab complex around noon Wednesday .
The primary goals of Atlantis ' flight are to bring space station flight engineer Nicole Stott back to Earth after three months in space and to deliver nearly 30,000 pounds of spare parts and equipment that would be difficult or impossible to get to the outpost after the shuttle is retired next year .
" In terms of being the flight that brings up all the spares for station , this is really full , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , NASA 's director of space operations .
" This flight , and a couple of the other shuttle flights that come later , really set us up very well for kind of the end of the shuttle servicing era . "
Awaiting a decision by the Obama administration on what sort of spacecraft will replace the shuttle and whether the moon or some other target will be NASA 's next objective , the agency is pressing ahead with the Bush administration 's directive to complete the space station and end shuttle flights by the end of 2010 .
The International Space Station currently is only funded through 2015 , but there appears to be widespread political support to extend operations through 2020 .
That would mean operating the lab complex for 10 years without the shuttle and its cavernous cargo bay to deliver large spares and other components .
With just six missions left on NASA 's shuttle manifest between now and the end of fiscal 2010 , Atlantis ' mission is one of two devoted primarily to delivering critical spare parts and equipment - orbital replacement units , or ORUs - that are too large to be delivered by European , Russian or Japanese cargo ships .
" We 're looking for the long - term outfitting of station , " said Hobaugh .
" Our flight is one of the first flights that externally will provide a lot of those spare parts and long - lead type replacement items that are required to keep it healthy and running for quite some time . "
Mounted on pallets in Atlantis ' payload bay are two spare control moment gyroscopes , used to control the station 's orientation in space ; a high pressure oxygen tank for the station 's airlock ; and a spare pump module , nitrogen tank and an ammonia reservoir for the lab 's cooling system .
The pallets also carry a replacement robot arm latching end effector , or mechanical hand ; a spare power cable spool used by the arm 's mobile transporter ; a solar array battery charge - discharge unit ; and a device used to prevent potentially dangerous electrical arcs between the station and the electrically charged extreme upper atmosphere .
A box housing spare circuit breakers that can be installed by the station 's robot arm and a Canadian robot known as DEXTRE is mounted on one of the pallets and a materials exposure experiment carried aloft in the shuttle 's cargo bay will be mounted on ELC - 2 during the crew 's final spacewalk .
Atlantis also is carrying a spare S - band antenna assembly , along with supplies for the lab 's six - member crew , gear for an amateur radio experiment and a system that can be used to track ships at sea .
The two cargo pallets will be mounted on the left and right sides of the station 's main solar power truss and plugged into the lab 's electrical grid to power heaters and provide telemetry .
The new oxygen tank will be attached to the station 's airlock during a spacewalk .
The rest of the hardware will simply sit , waiting for the day it might be needed .
" It is establishing critical spares on board the International Space Station , " said lead shuttle Flight Director Mike Sarafin .
" We 're going to warehouse parts that only the shuttle can deliver in large volume to the International Space Station for the pending retirement of the space shuttle , roughly a year from now .
" We 're going to deliver two large external logistics carriers full of spares and position those outside the International Space Station so that when and if some of the hardware that 's required to sustain the power production and thermal environment on board the space station eventually fails , we 've got that hardware there and available and we do n't need another vehicle to bring it to the space station . "
After the shuttle is retired , supplies and equipment will be delivered to the International Space Station by unmanned Russian Progress spacecraft , the European Space Agency 's Automated Transfer Vehicle , or ATV , Japan 's new HTV cargo carrier and commercial providers now in the process of designing future vehicles .
On Nov. 12 , a new Russian docking module called Poisk automatically locked itself to an upward facing port on the Zvezda command module , providing a fourth docking port for the Russian segment of the station - a necessity for long - term support of up to six full - time crew members .
But none of the unmanned cargo ships is capable of delivering the very large components routinely carried by the space shuttle that are too big to pass through the station 's hatches .
Most of the spares being launched aboard Atlantis have no other way of getting to the station .
The shuttle also provides a way to bring failed components back to Earth for repairs or refurbishment .
Atlantis , for example , will bring down components in the space station 's urine recycling system that have encountered problems in recent weeks .
The station crew has enough fresh water and stowage to get along with no major problems until refurbished hardware can be launched on an upcoming shuttle flight .
But the issue illustrates the sort of capability that will be lost when the shuttle is retired .
" This is why these ( spare components ) need to fly now on the shuttle , " said station Flight Director Brian Smith .
" There 's no other way to get these ORUs ... to the ISS .
And these are all critical spares .
You can tell by what their function is we have to have these pre-positioned because they all serve vital roles on the space station . "

It was 1903 when Robert Blair 's great - grandfather began farming the dry ridge overlooking the Clearwater River near Lewiston , Idaho .
In 2001 , when Blair took the reins , the farm 's books were still kept by hand .
Now , he has deployed a set of Darpa - like technologies , including unmanned aerial vehicles and self - steering tractors .
" In six years , I went from just having a cell phone to my tractor driving itself , and having a small airplane flying and landing itself on a farm , " Blair said .
The new precision farmers are hacking together a way of making food in which the virtual and physical worlds are so tightly bound that having his tractor steered by GPS - guidance with inch - level accuracy is ho-hum .
Autosteering of farm machinery has exploded over the past several years , according to an annual survey by Purdue University 's Center for Food and Agricultural Business .
In 2004 , just 5 percent of agricultural retail outlets offered autosteering .
In 2008 , more than half did .
In a 2009 issue of Precision Farmer Magazine , Montana wheat farmer Steven Swank described the benefits of a souped - up GPS called " real - time kinematic " ( RTK ) satellite navigation .
" RTK is so much more relaxing .
It allows you to multitask , and that ( allows ) me to spend more time with my family , " Montana wheat farmer told Steven Swank .
" I even watched a DVD in the cab with my daughter recently . "
Blair , at 40 , is a leader of this next generation of farmers who are adapting the precision dreams of the '90s to the realities of the soil and the history of their acreage .
People dreamed of vastly reducing pesticide and fertilizer use by applying just the right amount to each plant , but the variable - rate technologies have been only patchily adopted .
Instead , a new crop of younger growers has started to use something like augmented reality .
Data draped over their land guides their tractors and their decision - making .
" The big story is the generational shift going on right now , " said Joe Russo , president of the agriculture technology company , ZeDX .
" The younger people are starting to get ahold of these farms and they have a much different attitude to technology .
They Twitter , they got smartphones , they 're always on the computer .
Precision ag is gonna ride that wave . "
Farmers have adopted autosteer , especially , because it has made them money .
By eliminating the slop - space that even the best farm machinery operators needed , it allows them to put more rows in their fields , effectively increasing their per-acre yields .
For high - value crops , it was an obvious technology to adopt .
" The payback was so much more than variable rate ever was that it was a no- brainer , " said Paul Schrimpf , who has been covering precision agriculture for the magazine CropLife .
Blair wants to push further , though .
He 's leading a charge to adapt unmanned aerial vehicles — like the Predator Drones zipping across Afghanistan — to the task of crop surveillance .
In true maker fashion , he 's not waiting for the technology to be delivered to him .
He has founded a company and built a prototype of his UAV that uses an off - the - shelf digital camera to take photos of his farm .
The images it produces are n't just pretty pictures , they can be converted into data that can be used in water , fertilizer and pesticide decision - making .
Based on the color data captured by the CCD , Blair can obtain a value called the normalized differential vegetative index , which he can use to find patterns in his fields .
" Now we have a numeric value and we can write an algorithm to find different things , " Blair explained .
" Is a stressed crop showing a different value than one that 's healthy ? "
Farmers like Blair have antecedents in the farmer - scientists of the Green Revolution , but ever - cheaper information technology has let them map the data to their land with ever greater resolution .
Blair is slowly turning the vast , uncontrolled experiment that is his farm into a living laboratory that also happens to make money .
Innovating on a farm is tough .
Raising living things is not software development : Biology takes time , an iteration takes a year .
Being pegged to the cycle of the Earth rotating around the sun makes farmers a little more conservative than those who spend every waking moment bathed in fluorescent light and charged on Mountain Dew .
Still , some farmers press ahead trying to use technology to fatten their margins .
Blair 's e-mail signature includes the Thomas Jefferson quote , " I am not afraid of new inventions or improvements . "
Here 's how precision agriculture works on Blair 's farm .
He has incorporated several pieces of of the overall platform including yield monitors , boom control , variable rate applications and autosteering .
First , he installed yield monitors , which are a kind of real - time scale that records the amount of wheat harvested in small chunks of a field .
They 've become increasingly popular because they quantify the kind of hard - won data that farmers used to spend decades understanding : what parts of their land are the best ( and the worst ) .
" What the technology has allowed us to do is to see where those areas are and define them , " Blair said .
The yield monitors generate maps ( as in the small image ) that tell Blair which parts of his fields produce 120 bushels of wheat and which just 20 .
With that resolution , he can manage that land according to what it needs .
To determine the optimal fertilization and chemical inputs for different areas of his farm , Blair conducted tests over a period of five years to figure out how his crops responded to different amounts of nitrogen .
Often , he 'll reduce the amount of fertilizer on the poor producing areas of his land because their limiting factor is n't nitrogen , but some other factor like water or another soil component .
Now , his poor land planted with winter wheat might only get 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre instead of the 100 he'd put on the best land .
Beyond variable - rate application like this , Blair also uses automatically controlled sprayers .
These booms , pipes with nozzles set into them at regular intervals , are mounted on farm machinery and used to apply chemicals and fertilizers .
They tend to spray in large rectangles , even if the farm land is n't a prefect rectangle .
With automatic controls on the booms , they can be programmed to only spray on the farmland , not on adjacent areas .
It might not seem like a major area for savings , but the math works .
" Let 's say you have two Round Up sprayings at $ 20 a pop .
Then insect spray at $ 30 an acre .
That ’s $ 70 an acre , " Blair said .
" You 're able to save 10 percent , that 's $ 7 an acre . "
Multiply that by the 1500 acres he farms , and it 's clear how quickly he could be paid back on any four - digit investment .
Lastly , autosteering makes it easier to run the farm and ensures that he does n't waste any land because of farm machinery operator mistakes .
" I get on a big field with my autosteer , as soon as I make sure I 'm on the track , I 'm on my PDA phone checking e-mail , " Blair said .
" I 'm looking at the internet .
What 'd the market do today ?
I 'm reading news . "
Everything he does on his farm is devoted to gathering and using data to maximize the efficiency of his farm .
" People that have vision of where agriculture is going to go seem to realize that the key is the databases , " Blair told PrecisionAg.com in a video to celebrating his 2009 win for Precision Farmer of the Year .
And it 's the search for more — and more timely — data that led him to developing his own UAV .
He wanted to correlate what his fields looked like during the growing season with the yields at harvest time .
Blair 's UAV is hand - launched , which means that he literally runs , jumps and throws it in the air like a javelin .
The craft locates itself and flies a predetermined path over his farm , sending back images like the one above .
Piloted fixed - wing aircraft can provide similar resolution , but Blair thinks his company can compete on price and deliver equal or better results .
It 's possible to get similar photos from satellites , but the resolution ( in time and space ) is n't good enough .
" With what I 've been able to fly on my own farm , I 'm looking at goldfish in a pond , " he said .
And he can fly his UAV whenever he wants .
It 's some gee - whiz technology out on the Idaho ridge , but Russo of ZeDX , was skeptical .
UAVs are relatively expensive and complex technology .
" There are not many farmers that are going to do that , " Russo said .
" It 's not just the machine , but the time and changing your practices .
All the backend costs . "
And , for the time being , the Federal Aviation Administration has not come up with rules for UAVs that would allow Blair to actually sell his UAVs or the images they produce .
Like so many other precision farming techniques — and technologies more generally — the path from good idea to widespread implementation is likely to be a lot longer and difficult than first anticipated .
The precision farming transformation began in the Midwest in the 1980s .
" You look at ' 86 , ' 87 , ' 88 , I equate it to the moon launch of precision agriculture , " said CropLife ’s Schrimpf .
" You had guys putting 286 boxes into cabs and using aerial imagery that was shot by a plane and trying to use it to control an applicator . "
It gathered steam amidst the noise and fury of the internet boom , but only now has precision farming spread to the rest of the country and truly begun to impact the lives of farmers .
Sixty - eight percent of farmers have tried or use some precision farming technique , according to a Farm Industry News reader survey .
Questions remain , though , about how much precision farming is going to change the big picture problems that food system critics like Marion Nestle and Michael Pollan have identified .
Genetic engineering of crops and precision engineering used to be presented as the technological fixes to the agricultural challenges of our era .
They were going to keep farming profitable enough to keep people putting out enough food to feed the nearly 7 billion people of the world — while minimizing environmental downsides of industrial farming .
William Booth in a 1999
Wired article breathlessly summarized the promise of precision farming : " If machines and computers can help a farmer apply just the exact amount of disincentive and encouragement , exactly where it is needed , it will not only save billions of dollars and jack up profits , but give the farmland and the surrounding streams and forests a much needed respite from the relentless dousing of nasty and wasteful fertilizers , herbicides , and pesticides . "
The scientific research on the ability of precision agriculture to reduce chemical usage is somewhat mixed , but on balance , a review by agronomists Jess Lowenberg - Deboer of Purdue University and Rudolfo Bongiovani of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology in Argentina found decided benefits .
" Most of the papers reviewed indicate that PA can contribute in many ways to long - term sustainability of production agriculture , confirming the intuitive idea that PA should reduce environmental loading by applying fertilizers and pesticides only where they are needed , when they are needed , " they wrote in a paper published in a 2004 paper in the journal Precision Agriculture .
" The concepts of precision agriculture ( PA ) and sustainability are inextricably linked , " they concluded .
But even some precision ag proponents are n't sure that the technologies will solve the big problems that the globe 's food system faces .
" From a macro perspective , I do n't know that there is a direct correlation between precision farming and massive increases in yield that could help feed the world , " said Nate Taylor , who works with Russo at ZeDX .
Long - time precision farming researcher , John Phillips , who recently retired from his post at Cal Poly , San Luis Obispo , said much the same about the environmental benefits that precision farming could deliver .
Precision farming could be " a big player " in reducing the amount of nitrogen that leaches into groundwater , but it would n't be the primary solution .
" We 'd have to see some changes in the rest of the farming system , " Phillips said .
And the economic benefits ?
Croplife 's Schrimpf said that the profitability — and adoption — of technologies that reduce environmental impacts tend to float on the sea of natural gas prices .
" In years when fertilizer is expensive , dealers can possibly sell precision farming on the fact that you could save fertilizer at the end of the day , " Schrimpf said .
" When fertilizer is really cheap , growers do n't necessarily get that benefit . "
Instead of investing in and committing to precision agriculture , they just purchase variable - rate services , say , in some years from specialized companies .
For all those reasons , everyone agrees that precision agriculture has n't taken off as quickly as people thought it might .
Farming , though , is changing in ways that would be shocking in any industry , let alone human civilization 's oldest and most fundamental one .
In 1903 , when Blair 's great - grandfather founded the farm , there was exactly one working airplane and few cars in the entire world .
More than 35 percent of the U.S. population farmed for a living .
There was no synthetic fertilizer .
No hybrid plant varieties .
No transistors .
Most power on the farm came from human and animal muscles .
Change might seem to come slowly to farms .
And the many techno - utopian farms imagined in the past never seem to come about , but in just a few generations of a long - lived family , the layers of technology can create astounding change .
" We 've gone from horses to tractors driving themselves , " Blair concluded .

I finally did the commentary for my 50nl video .
Check it out here : http://www.box.net/shared/1pihr8fzt0
There are some audio issues at the 44 to 45 minute mark but other than that its decent .
Post any questions or comments here and I ’ll respond to them .
Three years ago , Martin Gardner ‘s good friend , MAA Editorial Director Don Albers , interviewed him at length about his childhood , the roots of his fascination with math , and about his career .
Over the next few weeks , I ’ll be posting the interview in chunks , because his story is absolutely fascinating .
* * *
On October 21 , Martin Gardner celebrated his ninetieth birthday .
For 25 of his 90 years , Gardner wrote the monthly “ Mathematical Games ” column for Scientific American .
His columns have inspired thousands of readers to learn more about the mathematics that he loved to explore and explain .
Among his column correspondents were several distinguished mathematicians and scientists , including John Horton Conway , Persi Diaconis , Ron Graham , Douglas Hofstadter , Richard Guy , Don Knuth , Sol Golomb , and Roger Penrose .
Gardner ’s columns have earned him a place of honor in the mathematical community , which has given him many awards .
But he has always declined invitations to accept awards in person , on the grounds that he is not a mathematician .
“ I ’m strictly a journalist , ” he insists .
“ I just write about what other people are doing in the field . ”
His modesty is admirable , but we insist that he is far more than a journalist .
In addition to his massive contributions to mathematics , Gardner has written about magic , philosophy , literature , and pseudoscience .
Over his first ninety years , he has produced more than 60 books , most still in print ; many have been bestsellers .
His Annotated Alice has sold over a million copies , and the 15 volumes collecting his “ Mathematical Games ” columns have gone through several printings ( Now beginning a run with Cambridge as a complete set ) .
In his ninetieth year , he has returned to Oklahoma , where he was born .
He is in good health and full of energy .
We look forward to more from him as he begins his second 90 years .
What follows is a portion of an interview done at Gardner ’s home in Hendersonville , NC in the fall of 1990 and spring of 1991 .
Magic
DA : In 1914 you were born in Oklahoma .
What did your father do ?
Gardner :
My father was a geologist who owned his own oil company .
He was what they called a “ wildcatter . ”
It was a very small company consisting of himself , a secretary , and an accountant .
He would go out and look for oil domes .
This was before the seismograph .
If he found a place that had a prospect of oil , he would hire a drilling company .
Most of them were dry holes , but every once in a while he would hit oil .
DA : Does your interest in magic go back to your father ?
Gardner : Magic was n’t a special hobby of his , but he did show me some magic tricks when I was a little boy .
I learned my first tricks from him , in particular one with a knife and little pieces of paper on it .
I then got aquatinted with a few local magicians in Tulsa , Logan Waite and Wabash Hughes , who worked for the Wabash Railroad .
DA : At what age did this occur ?
Gardner : I was a high school student at the time .
I ’ve never performed magic ; it ’s just been a hobby .
The only time I got paid for doing magic was when I was a student at The University of Chicago ; I used to work at the Marshall Field department store during the Christmas season demonstrating Gilbert magic sets .
I learned a lot from the experience .
That was the first time I realized that you ’re really not doing a magic trick well until you ’ve done it in front of an audience about a hundred times .
Then it becomes second nature , and you know what to say .
DA : What are the elements of a successful magic trick ?
Gardner :
The most important thing is to startle people , and have them wonder how it ’s done .
Close - up magic that you do on a table right in front of people is very different from the stage illusions that David Copperfield does .
It ’s close - up magic that most intrigues me , especially those that have a mathematical flavor .
In fact , I ’ll show you a little trick here .
( He then proceeded to demonstrate a neat topological trick that baffled the interviewer . )
In recent years magicians have gotten interested in rubber band tricks that are all topologically based , i.e. , they ’re violating topological laws .
There are entire books published on rubber band magic .
( He then demonstrated another trick , and another . )
I did a book for Dover Publications on mathematical tricks that has a chapter on topological tricks .
I did two massive books for the magic profession : The Encyclopedia of Impromptu Magic and Martin Gardner Presents .
DA : ( Looking at the books . )
Massive is right .
Gardner :
The first book covers tricks that do n’t require any special equipment .
A lot of them are just jokes and gags of the type ‘ bet you ca n’t do this . ’
DA : Your interest in magic is deep .
Gardner : I waste a lot of time on it .
Dai Vernon was one of the great inventors of magic .
He was a great influence on Persi Diaconis .
Persi traveled with Dai for a long time .
I knew Vernon very well .
I knew Persi when he was a student at CCNY .
You probably heard the story how he got into Harvard .
DA : As I recall , he gave you credit for writing a letter of recommendation to Fred Mosteller , the statistician .
Gardner : Mosteller is a magic buff .
When Persi said he wanted to get into Harvard , I wrote to Fred and said that Persi can do the best bottom deal and second deal of anybody I know , and that got him into Harvard .
I talked to Fred on the phone about it and he said , “ Is he willing to major in statistics ? ”
And Persi said sure he ’d major in statistics if that would get him into Harvard .
So he went up to Harvard , and they had a session together , probably doing card tricks .
Mosteller got him into Harvard .
DA : Well , it was a good move on Mosteller ’s part .
I ’m certainly convinced now that your interest in magic is just not a passing fancy .
Gardner :
It ’s my major hobby .
I ’ve enjoyed knowing a lot of famous magicians .
Tulsa Roots
DA : What did your mother do ?
Gardner :
She was a kindergarten teacher before marriage , but then became a housewife , caring for three children .
Her hobby was painting , and I have a number of her paintings hanging in the house .
Both of my parents lived into their nineties .
I had a brother and sister , both younger , who are deceased .
I learned to read before I went to school .
My mother read the Wizard of Oz to me when I was a little boy , and I looked over her shoulder as she read it .
I learned how to read that way .
It was very embarrassing when I was in first grade , because the teacher would hold up cards that said ‘ cat ’ and ‘ dog ’ and I was always the first to call out the word .
She had to tell me to shut up , to give the other children a chance to learn how to read .
DA : But do n’t you think she was doing something to teach you to read ?
Gardner :
No , she did n’t even know I was learning how to read .
DA : As a kid , do you remember other strong interests in addition to magic ?
Gardner : I was very good at math in high school .
In fact , it and physics were the only subjects in which I got good grades .
I was bored to death by the other classes .
I flunked a class in Latin and had to take it over .
I just do n’t have a good ear for languages .
DA : How about sports ?
Gardner : I played a lot of tennis .
My father was fairly wealthy , and we had our own tennis court .
I also was on the high school tumbling team .
I particularly liked the high bar .
DA : Ron Graham is a good tumbler , too .
Gardner :
Oh yes !
Once I was meeting him for lunch at Bell Labs .
A long flight of stairsled to the front door of building .
Ron greeted me by walking down the stairs on his hands !
He is also an expert juggler and unicycle rider .
DA : You said that you did well in physics , too .
Gardner : Yes .
My goal was to go to Caltech .
A lot of exciting physicists were there — Millikan for one .
But Caltech at that time required two years of liberal arts at a college before transferring .
So I went to The University of Chicago intending to transfer to Caltech after two years , but I got hooked on philosophy , mainly to find out what I believed .
DA : Did you encounter the philosopher Rudolph Carnap as an undergraduate ?
Gardner :
No , he was n’t there then , but he was there after my four years of service in the Navy during World War II .
Using the G.I. Bill , I went back to Chicago and took a course from him in the philosophy of science .
I was so impressed by the course that I later persuaded him to do a book on the subject .
His wife taped the lectures , and I edited them into a book .
Carnap was a big influence on me .
He convinced me that questions about metaphysics are meaningless since they cannot be answered empirically or by reason .
The essence of Carnap ’s philosophy is that an assertion has “ cognitive content ” only if it can be justified by logic or by empirical testing .
DA : You got your B.A. in 1936 , then worked briefly for the Tulsa Tribune as a reporter , and then came back to The University of Chicago to the PR office writing news releases ( primarily science releases ) , and took a graduate course from Carnap .
What else did you do until the outbreak of World War II ?
Gardner : I had various jobs .
I worked as a caseworker for the Chicago Relief Administration , I had to visit 140 families regularly in what was called the Black Belt .
I also had several odd jobs : waiter , soda jerk , etc. Remember , this was at the height of the Great Depression .

A prison officer has resigned following claims she had an " inappropriate relationship " with a murderer who strangled his former girlfriend with his belt , it was revealed today .
Shirley Fowle , 42 , fell for 28 - year - old Alan Dalby while serving his sentence at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey , Kent , the Sun newspaper reported .
A Prison Service spokesman said today : " A prison officer resigned last week from HMP Swaleside following allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Fowle told the Sun : " Everybody has a past - everybody tries to kill someone in their temper .
I have n't had sex with the guy .
All I did was have a relationship . "
Dalby was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court in October 2002 of murdering student Natalie Janiak , 18 , either in his home or in the back of a friend 's van after having consensual sex with her .
He tried to cover his tracks by telling mutual friends , her mother and the police that he and Natalie had gone to a common in Blackheath , south - east London , for sex .
Dalby claimed that they had argued and that Natalie stormed off , never to be seen again .
But he confided to a female friend that he had killed Natalie , and , despite covering for him at first , she later told police about his confession .
To start with , Dalby maintained his original story that he and Natalie had rowed before she vanished , but shortly before his trial he admitted he had killed her .
He then concocted a further story , claiming he restrained Natalie with a belt after she went berserk when the friend told her she was pregnant with Dalby 's child .
A judge said the accounts Dalby gave for Natalie 's death were " all implausible " and that it was impossible to know his true motive for murdering her .
Speaking following Ms Fowle 's resignation , the Prison Service spokesman added : " The vast majority of our staff are honest and hard working , but one corrupt officer can jeopardise the safety of the whole prison .
" Swaleside Prison supports a culture which values integrity above all and rejects corruption and dishonesty wherever it is found . "
HMP Swaleside is a Category B prison for inmates serving four years or more or should have at least 18 months left to serve .
It has 460 places for lifers and has an operational capacity of 954 .
Taxing medical marijuana sales is an idea worth considering , not because it is a potential cash cow for fiscally constrained governments , but because it could raise revenue needed to cover the services the flourishing businesses will require .
But caution is in order .
There are some dominoes that need to fall first .
The topic came up again last week , as Denver City Council members Chris Nevitt and Charlie Brown publicly expressed support for imposing a city sales tax on medical marijuana sales .
“ We ’ve got to tax this damn thing at the city rate , which is 3.62 percent , ” Brown told us .
“ We ’re talking millions of dollars here . ”
And that may be .
But some questions about legality of taxation and the future of medical marijuana have to be answered first .
And we think that overall , cities such as Denver ought not look to the emerging industry as a windfall that could close budget gaps .
First , the legality of taxing the commodity is up in the air .
Colorado Attorney General John Suthers is researching the issue , and his decision will turn on whether the substance is deemed a prescription or something more like an herbal remedy .
The latter seems more likely , since marijuana is n’t a drug that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
And herbal remedies are already taxed .
Second , we do n’t think governments ought to take advantage of the medical marijuana laws in the way that so - called “ ganjapreneurs ” have been doing .
Meaning , governments would be just as wrong to reap great wads of cash from back - door legalization efforts as are the mass dispensaries , some of which are just barely pretending to be serving the most infirm among us .
Amendment 20 , which passed in 2000 , did not approve the legalization of marijuana in Colorado , despite the wishful thinking of some .
Furthermore , legislators are poised to address the medical marijuana issue in the upcoming session , which begins in January , and their decisions could seriously affect how medical marijuana is delivered in Colorado .
( See Alicia Caldwell ’s article from today ’s Perspective section . )
If their decisions shrink the number and reach of distributors , then a basic sales tax should be enough .
But if lawmakers create a structure that encourages a broader distribution model — with attendant regulatory and service requirements — then other fees and taxes would be worth contemplating .
It would seem prudent , we think , to wait until the shape of medical marijuana is more clearly defined before settling on a taxing structure .
It ’s smart to get ahead of the game and contemplate the tax and revenue - generating alternatives .
But we hope governments will exhibit some foresight and restraint before they make decisions they might have to revise once the medical marijuana landscape is clearly defined .

CIA Interrogation Tapes Destroyed Shortly After News Reports on CIA Black Sites and Interrogation Methods
Created : November 25 , 2009 13:45 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Marcy Wheeler at Firedoglake has an interesting take today on the most recent summary of classified documents that the government turned over to the American Civil Liberties Union Friday , as part of its response to the organization ’s Freedom of Information Act requests about the destruction of 92 videotapes of CIA interrogations .
The documents reveal what Wheeler calls “ a tension between the torturers in the field growing increasingly panicked about the torture tapes ” and wanting the CIA to destroy them , and the reluctance , at first , of the CIA ’s Office of General Counsel to do that .
The ACLU , meanwhile , has identified an important point about the chronology of the CIA ’s internal communications about the tapes .
Although the communications remain classified , the dates and summaries of their content provided by the government reveals that a request to destroy the 92 tapes were made just days after The Washington Post reported on the existence of secret overseas CIA prisons known as “ black sites . ”
Another request was made on the day The New York Times reported that the CIA inspector general had issued a report questioning the legality of the agency ’s interrogation methods .
The tapes were destroyed that same day .

MacRuby is steadily moving ahead , as a status update on the MacRuby - devel list shows .
Next to the various improvements , there 's now an easy way to try out MacRuby :
Claudio Poli contributed a web application that periodically builds binary installers of MacRuby trunk .
It is available here : http://macruby.icoretech.org .
Feel free to use this in case you want a simpler way to follow trunk .
Please note that these installers wo n't work on Mac OS versions below 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) .
MacRuby now has support for Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) , the optimized thread pool and queuing support introduced in Mac OS X Snow Leopard .
The MacRuby GCD support currently allows to queue up tasks for execution on work queues and support for handling timer events on queues , support for other dispatch sources has not been added yet .
GCD was recently open sourced , and the userspace part is already available as a FreeBSD package .
The MacRuby status update also announces that a first release candidate for MacRuby 0.5 is expected any time now , with a final release expected by the end of the year .
As a reminder , MacRuby 0.5 will include many of the improvements developed this year , such as the new LLVM based VM , JIT and AOT , the updated threading system that works without the GIL / GVL inherited from the YARV VM , and much more .
. NET users can try out the new IronRuby 0.9.1 which brings bug fixes and a few improvements to performance , details of IronRuby 0.9.1 in the release notes .
IronRuby 0.9.1 binaries are available at CodePlex , the source code is at GitHub .
Everyone waiting for a Ruby 1.9.2 - shaped christmas present might have to wait a bit longer .
Yuki Sonoda announced the delay on the ruby - core list , giving this explanation :
Ruby 1.9.2 must pass [ its RubySpec ] before release .
I believe this makes it clear , what Ruby 1.9 is .
And this brings us more compatibility between implementations .
Details will be decided in a meeting of the Ruby developers .
In 1.8.7 news , Evan Phoenix announces :
Thanks to @malafortune , a little elbow grease , and a lot of specs , Rubinius is now largely updated to ruby 1.8.7 !
Rubinius is thus joining MRI and JRuby with support for 1.8.7 .
Use Vegan Recipes Search for better results
Because the symptoms of lupus wax and wane and differ from person to person , it has been difficult to demonstrate in a clinical trial that a drug is effective against the disease .
The drug is likely to cost $ 20,000 a year or more , in line with biotechnology drugs for other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis .
Analysts estimate Benlysta sales could reach a few billion dollars a year .
Human Genome executives said Monday that there were about 325,000 Americans with systemic lupus under the care of rheumatologists .
They estimated that the 200,000 with the most severe disease would be candidates for Benlysta .
In the primary measure of the drug ’s effectiveness , 43.2 percent of patients taking a high dose of Benlysta had a significant improvement in symptoms after one year compared with 33.8 percent of those getting a placebo .
That suggests that only one of 10 people who take Benlysta will do better than they would on a placebo .
There were also some secondary measures for which the higher dose did not differ from a placebo in a statistically significant way in the second trial , like the assessment of doctors as to how their patients were faring .
In the first trial , the differences were statistically significant for the most part .
The second trial , involving 819 patients , took place primarily in North America and Western Europe , while the first trial involved patients in Asia , South America and Eastern Europe .
Because medical care in the United States and Western Europe is probably better than in those other regions , analysts say there could have been less room for Benlysta to make a difference .
The companies said the rate of side effects was not very different between those on Benlysta and those taking the placebo .
However , three patients taking the drug died and five developed tumors , while none getting the placebo died and only one developed a tumor .
Since twice as many patients got the drug as got the placebo , these differences might not mean anything .
At what cost victory ?
The Iowa Hawkeyes are now 8 - 0 on the season , their first ever 8 - 0 start to a season in school history .
Getting to that point was not easy .
As I wrote in a column from Sunday , Iowa has had to play four straight conference games against teams who believed they had a shot at a Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl .
With Penn State , they were thinking national championship , so you know Iowa got the best shot they could muster that night .
Michigan was coming off of a loss at Michigan State , but that was just their first loss and they still felt like they could win the rest , as they had Penn State and Ohio State at home .
Wisconsin knew that if it beat Iowa , it would be favored in its remaining games and they had a shot at a Big Ten title and BCS bid .
Michigan State knew that if it lost to Iowa , it had no chance at a Big Ten title , but if it won and took care of business the rest of the way , their destiny was in their own hands .
When you play a slate like that , it exacts a physical toll .
Iowa navigated that arduous four game stretch , winning all four games including three on the road .
That was quite an accomplishment , and one that I will never forget .
Yet , it took a toll … the physical play caught up with Iowa on Saturday night , as Dace Richardson , Adam Robinson , Colin Sandeman , Brett Greenwood and Brandon Wegher suffered injuries .
Those are just the injuries we could tell from watching the game .
The MSU contest was easily the most physical game this year , and one of the most physical games in memory .
MSU laid it all on the line , because that ’s all they had left to do .
Richardson will be out until at least the bowl game , with a lower leg / foot break .
No word on Sandeman or Greenwood with regards to availability for the Indiana game .
Wegher will be available for that game , but its a strong possibility that Adam Robinson , Iowa ’s leading rusher , may not be available for this week ’s game against Indiana , or beyond ; Iowa will know this week if he will require surgery on his ankle .

So as they have had to do so many times this year , the Hawkeyes will march forward with their ‘ next man in ’ philosophy .
The home games against Indiana and Northwestern , games that many Iowa fans , me included , had already put in the win column , become more treacherous now .
I said prior to the Michigan State game that if the Hawkeyes won in East Lansing , they would have one foot in Pasadena .
I still feel they are in the driver ’s seat for the Rose Bowl , but only if they win their next two games .
That will give them some ‘ breathing room ’ if they are unable to win in Columbus for just the 3rd time since the late 1950’s .
Of course , they must beat Minnesota in the season finale , but there is no way that Iowa loses that game with the Rose Bowl on the line , or perhaps more .

Iowa is going to be down to Brandon Wegher and Paki O’Meara at running back for at least the Indiana game .
I think those two are capable , but the margin for error and injury has evaporated from this team .
Jeff Brinson has had a foot injury that just will not heal , and he has not been a factor in games or practice as of late .
Iowa can always pull the redshirt off of Brad Rogers .
Some will wonder if you make a move like that in game nine of a season .
Iowa pulled the redshirt off of offensive lineman Mike Jones in game seven of his freshman year .
Seasons like this do n’t come around very often , and if the coaches feel Rogers can help them win now , and need him to help them win now , I do n’t think they would hesitate and players love opportunities to get involved , especially during a season like this one .
But I have not heard any indications of that ; it ’s just roster speculation .

The 2009 Iowa football story has been truly amazing to this point , and if this season ends in Pasadena , one way or another , it may be the most amazing chapter in Iowa football history because of what they had to overcome to get there .
Oklahoma State 's 2009 football campaign just suffered a huge blow .
In a release put out by the school 's sports information department , it was announced today that wide receiver Dez Bryant has been ruled ineligible by the school .
According to the release , Bryant violated NCAA bylaw 10.1 ( d ) .
A provision dealing with false or misleading information , bylaw 10.1 ( d ) states the following :
(d) Knowingly furnishing or influencing others to furnish the NCAA or the individual 's institution false or misleading information concerning the an individual 's involvement in or knowledge of matters relevant to a possible violation of an NCAA regulation ;
In short , Bryant lied to the NCAA about his interactions with a former NFL player not associated with the Oklahoma State program .
Sources close to OStateIllustrated.com say that the former NFL player Bryant had contact with was Deion Sanders .
Apparently , Bryant met with Sanders and also worked out with him over the course of the last few months .
That contact led to initial questioning from the NCAA .
At that time , Bryant apparently gave false details about the contact .
" I made a mistake by not being entirely truthful when meeting with the NCAA , " Bryant said .
" I sincerely regret my mistake and apologize to my teammates , coaches , OSU fans and the NCAA . "
OSU has begun the process of applying to the NCAA for reinstatement on the matter .
" We are certainly disappointed , but we are moving forward as we would with any challenge during the season , " said Cowboy head coach Mike Gundy
While it sounds like Bryant is done for the season , that 's not necessarily true .
Punishment for the violation of NCAA bylaw 10.1 ( d ) can range from anywhere to a suspension of a few games to banishment from the field of NCAA competition .
But the issue at hand is n't the alleged contact between Bryant and Sanders .
Rather , it is that Bryant lied to the NCAA about his actions and did not fully disclose the details of the contact with Sanders that led to this ruling .
More details to follow as information about this matter comes to light .

The Royal Mail owns and maintains the database of postcodes Websites that help people find jobs or hospitals have been hit by legal action threatened by the Royal Mail .
The threat was issued against the company supplying them , and many other sites , with postcode data .
Royal Mail said the legal action was threatened to stop " unauthorised access " to the postcode data .
Ernestmarples.com , which supplied the address data , said it did not have the resources to fight a legal battle so has turned off its feed .
Sites affected by the withdrawal of data include Job Centre Pro Plus , HealthWare ( locates nearby pharmacies and hospitals ) , Planning alerts.com ( monitors planning applications ) , Straight Choice ( finds out who sent political leaflets ) and many more .
Commenting on its action the Royal Mail said : " We have not asked anyone to close down a website .
" We have simply asked a third party to stop allowing unauthorised access to Royal Mail data , in contravention of our intellectual property rights , " it added in a statement .
The third party was Ernestmarples.com which supplied postcode data to the sites .
Typically those wanting to use the regularly updated list of 1.7 million postcodes pay the Royal Mail for access .
Many of the sites hit by the action are volunteer efforts that would be unable to afford the licence fees - about £ 4000 per annum for unlimited access .
Harry Metcalfe , co-founder of Ernestmarples.com , declined to say how it got access to the postcode data .
" There are certain legal questions around the specifics of what we are doing , " Mr Metcalfe told BBC News .
" The advice we have received so far is that allowing the service to continue operating while we attempt to resolve this issue would be unwise . "
In the interim , the company is searching for alternative free sources of postcode data even though those are known to be less accurate and not as regularly updated .
Mr Metcalfe said Ernestmarples.com would talk to the Royal Mail about getting access to the full postcode data .
Ernestmarples.com is named after the post master general who oversaw the introduction of postcodes in 1959 .
Jim Killock , head of the Open Rights Group which campaigns on digital issues , said the action showed why the UK needed a more open approach to official data .
" It is easy to see that large numbers of small business ideas and not for profit services are being blocked by these licence fees , " he said .
" It is in effect a tax on innovation . "

A few weeks ago I related a charming anecdote about the Cracked offices that involved thinly veiled racism , sexual assault , rampant stupidity and may or may not have actively advocated huffing gasoline ( several times ) .
Then I figured :
That would make a great children 's book !
I was wrong , but here it is anyway .

In the penalty announced Thursday , $ 10 million will go to the United States Treasury , $ 10 million will go to the reliability council and $ 5 million is to be spent by Florida Power & Light on reliability improvements .
Those improvements will be subject to prior approval by the reliability council and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .
The settlement also requires the company to make additional “ substantial , wide - ranging and specific reliability enhancement measures . ”
The agreement specifies that the company cannot collect the penalty from ratepayers .
The blackout was caused by an engineer who disabled protective circuits while he tried to fix an equipment problem at a substation west of Miami .
The company said Thursday that its engineer had done so “ without authorization and contrary to F.P.L. ’s policies and procedures . ”
The failure led to the sudden shutdown of several generating stations , including the two nuclear plants at Turkey Point .
About a third of the homes and businesses that lost power were customers of other utilities , illustrating the interconnected nature of the power grid .
As part of the settlement , Florida Power & Light did not admit any violations or acknowledge any liability .
It said the standards it was accused of violating were “ ambiguous and subjective . ”
In a statement , the company ’s president and chief executive , Armando J. Olivera , noted that the blackout took place more than 18 months ago and that litigation to resolve the case would be expensive and “ would require the time and attention of the same people who are responsible for the reliability of the grid . ”
“ As a result , ” Mr. Olivera said , “ we believe a settlement is an appropriate course of action at this time . ”
History comes back to haunt us .
Just over 20 years ago , the then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev : " Britain and western Europe are not interested in the unification of Germany .
The words written in the Nato communique may sound different , but disregard them .
We do not want the unification of Germany . "
She went on to say , inaccurately : " I can tell you that this is also the position of the US president . "
That 's according to the Russian record made by one of Gorbachev 's closest aides .
A British note of the conversation , quoted in a volume of documents just published by Foreign Office historians , adds some fascinating new detail .
This was an act of spectacular disloyalty to an old , faithful , and important Nato ally .
It showed a real lack of respect for the aspirations of the East Germans protesting on the streets , who would soon say clearly that their hopes of freedom – the political value with which Thatcher liked to most closely identify herself – would best be realised by unification with an already free German state .
And it was very shortsighted .
She was not just expressing her worries in private to a western ally ; she was expressing them directly to the man who had the power to stop German unification .
The British note goes on : " Mr Gorbachev said that he could see what the prime minister was driving at .
The Soviet Union understood the problem very well and she could be reassured .
They did not want German reunification any more than Britain did .
It was useful that the matter had been raised and that he and the prime minister knew each other 's mind on this delicate subject . "
Things are made no better by the fact that François Mitterrand and the French were conveying much the same message to Moscow .
Gorbachev 's close adviser , Anatoly Chernyaev , who made the record of the Thatcher conversation , notes in his diary on 9 October 1989 that Mitterrand 's aide Jacques Attali " talked with us about a revival of a solid Franco - Soviet alliance , ' including military integration – camouflaged as the use of armies in the struggle against natural disasters ' . "
Linking these French whispers to Thatcher 's remarks , Chernyaev reflects : " In brief , they [ that is , the French and the British ] want to prevent this [ German unification ] with our hands . "
At a witness seminar last week , organised by the Foreign Office historians , Hans - Dietrich Genscher , the West German foreign minister at that time , reacted with magnificent condescension .
Obviously he was aware of Thatcher 's opposition , he said , but he did n't worry too much about it , because he knew that so long as the Germans had the US behind them , the Brits would always come round in the end .
Which of course they did , but not without squandering a heap of goodwill in Germany .
At the same seminar , William Waldegrave , who at that time was a junior Foreign Office minister , roundly declared that this was " one of the sorriest episodes in British diplomatic history " .
And the now - published records show that the Foreign Office , from the then foreign secretary Douglas Hurd down , did repeatedly warn ( although not without some mandarin trimming along the way ) that Thatcher 's vocal opposition was impolitic , misguided and short - sighted .
That is doubtless one reason why the Foreign Office is hurrying to publish the documents now , after just 20 years .
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall , Hurd , Waldegrave , senior officials and diplomats would warn time and again against the folly of being an " ineffective brake " on German unification .
It is particularly interesting for me to read the internal pre-history of what became known as " the Chequers seminar " in March 1990 , attended by six historians of Germany , of whom I was one .
Since that famous or infamous event is represented only by a vivid but misleading summary by Thatcher 's private secretary Charles Powell , which caused a scandal when it was leaked in Germany , it 's worth saying again what several other participants have already put on record : the overwhelming message of all the historians present was that the Federal Republic , as it had proved itself over 40 years , must be trusted and supported in carrying through the unification of Germany in freedom .
I remember one electrifying moment when the veteran conservative historian Hugh Trevor - Roper – who had been in Germany immediately after the end of the second world war , interrogating senior Nazis for his classic account of the Last Days of Hitler – suddenly said , Prime Minister , if anyone had told us in 1945 that there was a chance of a Germany united in freedom , as a solid member of the west , we could not have believed our luck .
And so we should welcome it , not resist it .
Twenty years on , we can see even more clearly how Trevor - Roper was right and Thatcher wrong .
None of her nightmares have been realised .
United Germany is not lording it over Europe , economically or any other way .
Even a severe economic recession has not driven German voters to the far right .
When Angela Merkel announces her new government , it will be a moderate liberal - conservative coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats : the very model of a modern centrist democracy .
Far from being an unstoppable force driving Europe towards a federal superstate , as Thatcher feared , this united Germany is far more comfortable being a sovereign state pursuing its national interests , as France does – in and through European institutions , but not subsumed by them .
And German unification opened the door to European unification , through the eastward enlargement of the EU , which itself has made impossible the federal superstate of Tory Eurosceptic nightmare .
Even in this success story there are causes for concern .
A political system originally designed to prevent a reversion to dictatorship has developed almost too many checks and balances , so necessary reform is difficult .
Germany 's special relationship with an authoritarian Russia is a European problem .
But there are justified concerns about every major European state – and not least about Britain .
Europe used to have sleepless nights over something called " the German question " .
Two decades later , a bigger worry should be the British question .
It 's in Britain that the leader of a far - right , nationalist , xenophobic party will be appearing on a mainstream television show tonight .
( A bad editorial call , by the way , but that 's another story . )
It 's Britain that has a discredited parliament , a constitutional mess , the erosion of civil liberties and a chronic identity problem .
It 's Britain that still can't work out where it belongs in the world , and what kind of country it wants to be .
Then as now , the only thing you can be sure of – as wily old Genscher knew – is that London will ultimately go along with Washington .
So I trust US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a clear warning to shadow foreign secretary William Hague when they met in Washington yesterday , similar to the message an earlier US administration quietly delivered 20 years ago : " Do n't be stupid .
Do n't marginalise yourselves in Europe . "
But how ridiculous and demeaning it is that we have to rely on the Americans to persuade British Conservatives to behave like halfway rational Europeans .
Osteoporosis literally means that the bones become porous , and break People with coeliac disease may be more susceptible to osteoporosis because their own immune system attacks their bone tissue , a study suggests .
Osteoporosis is a known risk of coeliac disease and has been explained by a failure to absorb calcium or vitamin D . But a study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests coeliac patients produce antibodies which attack a key protein that maintains bone health .
They could easily be treated with drugs to prevent bone loss , researchers say .
It also explains why osteoporosis in those with the digestive disorder may not respond to calcium and vitamin D. Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten , a protein found in wheat , barley , rye and oats which damage the small finger - like villi that line the small intestine and play a key role in digestion .
When damaged and inflamed , the villi are unable to absorb food properly , causing diarrhoea and malnutrition .
It affects one in 100 people , and of these a significant proportion may go on to develop osteoporosis - a disease of bone that leads to an increased risk of painful and disabling fractures .
Protein clue Scientists at the University of Edinburgh say it may be a protein called osteoprotegerin which holds the key to the link between coeliac disease and osteoporosis .
Our traditional understanding of its cause has left some people with the condition with little hope that their symptoms and quality of life will improve
Sarah Sleet
Coeliac UK
In 20 % of the coeliac patients tested , antibodies were produced which stopped this protein - crucial for maintaining bone strength - from working effectively .
Lead researcher Professor Stuart Ralston from the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine , said : " This is a very exciting step forward .
Not only have we discovered a new reason to explain why osteoporosis occurs in coeliac disease , but we have also found that it responds very well to drugs that prevent bone tissue removal .
" Testing for these antibodies could make a real and important difference to the lives of people with coeliac disease by alerting us to the risk of osteoporosis and helping us find the correct treatment for them . "
Sarah Sleet , head of Coeliac UK said : " Osteoporosis is a damaging complication of coeliac disease and our traditional understanding of its cause has left some people with the condition with little hope that their symptoms and quality of life will improve .
" This new breakthrough in understanding and treatment will give renewed hope to our members struggling with their condition . "
Dr Claire Bowring , medical policy officer with the National Osteoporosis Society said : " We already know that coeliac disease is a risk factor for osteoporosis and that early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease gives the best chance of improving bone density .
" A better understanding of the relationship between coeliac disease and osteoporosis will enable clinicians to manage both conditions more effectively .
" Although this research is at an early stage it is certainly interesting and we look forward to more extensive work to identify how prevalent this antibody is in people with coeliac disease . "

Research can be serendipitous .
Sometimes doctors will stumble on an effective medication or they will find a drug they expected to work on one condition actually helps another .
Such is the case with a gonorrhea medication developed in the 1930s .
Preliminary evidence published this week shows that the substance , called acriflavine , may work as a cancer therapy .
Researchers from Johns Hopkins University discovered that the drug has the ability to stop the growth of new blood vessels , which may then curb tumor growth .
Mice who were engineered to develop cancer showed no tumor growth when they were injected with acriflavine daily .
The study showed that acriflavine inhibits the function of a protein called HIF - 1 , which promotes new blood vessel formation .
" Mechanistically , this is the first drug of its kind , " Jun Liu , an author of the paper and a professor of pharmacology and molecular sciences , said in a news release .
" It is acting in a way that is never seen for this family of proteins . "
Researchers at Johns Hopkins continue to explore new uses for old drugs in the school 's expansive drug library .
" The more drugs you have , the more possibilities , the higher the chance you rediscover something that will help , " Liu said .
" Oftentimes , we are surprised that a drug known to do something else has another hidden property . "
The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

During his 13 - year tenure at Cisco , Volpi helped spearhead Cisco 's acquisition strategy in the late 1990s and early 2000s .
He left the company as senior vice president of Cisco 's routing and service provider technology group over two years ago to join Joost , an Internet video start - up .

Volpi then became embroiled in litigation with Joost and Skype cofounders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis over majority ownership of Skype , which was being sold by eBay .
A series of revealing e-mails involving Volpi 's involvement in the Skype dealings emerged and he and his investment group were ultimately left out of the sale .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Even though President Obama is not on the ballot this November , he and the Democrats who control Congress have a lot on the line .
Among the many contests being voted on in a little more than week , two statewide battles for governor are grabbing a lot of national attention .
The president heads back on the campaign trail in Virginia on Tuesday , not for himself but for fellow Democrat gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds .
Recent polls suggest Deeds , a state senator from the rural western part of Virginia , trails his Republican opponent , former Virginia attorney general Bob McDonnell .
While the contest in Virginia focuses on state issues and the two candidates themselves , it 's also seen by some as an early ballot box test , or referendum , on the Obama White House and the policies it 's pushing .
" The race in Virginia is partially about the broad national environment , how the two political parties are doing , and how the president is doing , " said Stuart Rothenberg , editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .
McDonnell 's campaign appears to be trying to nationalize the contest by linking Deeds to the Democrats who control the White House and Congress .
A McDonnell television ad says " Creigh Deeds supports Washington 's job - killing policies . "
" I have made the national issues an issue in this race , " McDonnell told CNN 's Jessica Yellin .
At a debate last month , Deeds was asked by the moderator if he was a " Barack Obama Democrat . "
" I would try to escape that by saying I'm a Creigh Deeds Democrat , " responded Deeds , who also acknowledges that " a lot of what 's going on in Washington has made it very tough . "
Democrats have made major gains in Virginia this decade .
Last November , Obama became the first Democrat to win the state in a presidential election in 40 years .
The party has won back both of Virginia 's U.S. Senate seats and come out on top in the past two gubernatorial elections .
But the current governor , Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine , is term - limited and prevented for running again .
If they win back the governor 's office , " the Republicans could now show they are alive and well and they are competitive in Virginia , but it also sends a national message about the Republicans ' ability to come back in the Obama era , " said Mark Rozell , a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia .
Democrats also control the other governor 's seat up this year .
In New Jersey , Gov. Jon Corzine is fighting for a second term and for his political life .
Corzine trailed his Republican challenger , former New Jersey federal prosecutor Chris Christie , in polls during the summer but has pulled even in just about all recent surveys .
Growing support for independent candidate Chris Daggett may be a major contributing factor .
Obama teamed up with Corzine on the campaign trail last week and the president is expected back in New Jersey just two days before election day .
With the economy fighting to escape from recession , the climate is tough for any incumbent .
Corzine has the misfortune of being the only governor facing re-election this year .
" The New Jersey race is about Governor Corzine 's performance .
It 's about the state 's economy and jobs .
In this regard the governor is on the hook and that 's why the election is overwhelmingly a referendum on his performance , " Rothenberg said .
And if the economy does n't rebound strongly in the first half of 2010 , incumbent governors , senators and representatives up for re-election could find themselves in a similar situation a year from now .
If the Republicans grab back the seat in New Jersey , or Virginia , they will claim that the results are a reflection on the Obama White House .
And they 'll say that the results in '09 are a taste of things to come in 2010 , when the Democrats have to defend their majorities in the Senate , House and governors ' offices across the country .
That was the case in 1993 and 1994 , but history was not repeated in 2001 and 2002 .
The book on 2009 and 2010 is still open .
Natural selection has ensured that we are well - endowed with selfish genes .
We will always put self before family , family before community , community before country .
Hence efforts to get international agreement on controlling global carbon emissions will always be bedeviled by the “ after you ” syndrome .
The latest report of the UN population division of March 11 , 2009 shows that the world 's population is 6.8 billion , and is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050 .
When I was born in 1930 , there were only 2 billion people on Earth .
What has happened to cause this staggering increase , and for how long can it continue ?
Back in 1972 , the Club of Rome pointed out that there are indeed limits to growth , as exemplified by the finite limits to our reserves of fossil fuels .
But we failed to realize that we are living under a glass ceiling that traps our carbon emissions and causes the Earth to warm up .
It is an ill bird that fowls its own nest , but that is exactly what we are doing to our environment .
We always used to think that the future was boundless ; the sky 's the limit .
But it is slowly beginning to dawn on us that the phrase has acquired a sinister new meaning ; today , the sky is the limit .
It is human activities , whether it be the farts of our domestic cattle and sheep , or the burning of our forests , or the emissions of our power stations , or the exhausts of our cars , or the production of cement , or the cremation of our bodies at the end of our days , that are all are contributing to global warming .
What can we do about it ?
Unfortunately , natural selection has ensured that we are well - endowed with selfish genes .
We will always put self before family , family before community , community before country .
Hence efforts to get international agreement on controlling global carbon emissions will always be bedeviled by the “ after you ” syndrome .
With the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference set for December , can we expect any breakthroughs in this potential stalemate ?
Perhaps there is some hope .
A young PhD student at the London School of Economics , Thomas Wire , has just carried out a detailed cost - benefit analysis of all the ways in which we might be able to reduce future carbon emissions .
His startling conclusion is that it is family planning that is one of the cheapest ways of combating climate change .
Each $ US7 spent on basic family planning would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than one ton , so family planning must be seriously considered at Copenhagen .
This fits in rather well with our own thinking .
In January this year , the University of California at Berkeley hosted a two - day discussion of “ The World in 2050 ” , with 42 participants from all around the world .
The conclusion was that it was rapid population growth in some regions , combined with increasing affluence and explosive growth in fossil fuel and natural resources consumption , that was seriously endangering a broad range of natural systems that support life .
The world 's population is growing by 78 million this year alone , and more than 95 per cent of this growth is in low - income countries , especially in sub-Saharan Africa .
There is a large unmet need for family planning , with 200 million women wishing to delay or stop the next pregnancy , and more than 100 million women not using any contraception because they have no access to it .
Even in the U.S. , one of the most affluent and effluent nations in the world , half of all pregnancies are unintended .
There is also increasing evidence to show that rapid population growth , which produces a large number of uneducated , unemployable , testosterone - driven young men , is a recipe for civil unrest .
The manuscripts from our Bixby conference in California have just been published by the Royal Society of London as a theme issue of its Philosophical Transactions – Biological Sciences , entitled “ The impact of population growth on tomorrow 's world ” .
The Royal Society has agreed to give a copy to each delegate attending the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference .
If we could ensure that all the women of the world had the ability to control their own fertility , so that every birth was a wanted birth , we would no longer have a plague of people , and the world would breathe more easily in the years to come .

Delivering on President Obama ’s promise to boost the labor movement , the administration has announced a $ 35 million federal construction project in New Hampshire that requires union representation for the workers and forces nonunion employees to pay dues and contribute to a union pension fund .
Mr. Obama issued an executive order in the first weeks of his presidency that would make the requirement , known as a “ project labor agreement ” or PLA , the norm for all government contracts on large - scale construction jobs .
The order is under review and a final rule is not expected for months , but that did not stop the Labor Department from rushing to use a PLA to build its new Job Corps Center in Manchester , N.H .
The PLA executive order replaced a Bush administration order that discouraged the use of such agreements .
It was one in a series of early policy moves by Mr. Obama that has dramatically improved the unions ’ fortunes , though the president has not delivered on labor ’s top legislative priority , the so - called “ card - check ” bill that would make it easier to organize workplaces .
Critics say imposing the union - friendly rules on the New Hampshire job - the first federal construction contract with such stipulations since President Clinton was in office - will drive up costs , delay the project and force most of the workers to pay union dues and pension contributions for which they likely will never receive benefits .
North Branch Construction , a Concord , N.H. - based general contractor and member of the business group Associated Builders and Contractors ( ABC ) , filed a bid protest this week with the Government Accountability Office , claiming the PLA “ unduly restricts competition . ”
“ PLAs are special - interest handouts that deny taxpayers the accountability they deserve from government contracts , ” said Ken Holmes , president of North Branch Construction .
Sen . Judd Gregg , New Hampshire Republican , said the scarcity of local unionized workers and a separate requirement that contractors must have completed three previous successful PLA projects to qualify to bid will essentially prevent local firms from competing for the Manchester project .
“ The administration ’s decision to discriminate against successful and independent construction firms simply because New Hampshire employees choose to work in a union - free workplace and not bow down to the demands of Big Labor is extremely unfair to our state , ” the senator said , calling on the administration to revoke the PLA .
“ In a time of economic hardship , it is simply absurd to discriminate against local contractors and construction workers for the benefit of national labor unions , ” he added .
Union officials argue that PLAs , which incorporate collective bargaining agreements into the contract , ensure the construction companies hire highly skilled workers and pay them fair wages .
“ Rather than all the money going to the contractor profit , a fair share goes into the worker ’s paycheck , ” said Greg Denier , communications director for Change to Win , a coalition of unions that includes the Laborers ’ International Union of North America .
Brett McMahon , vice president of business development for Miller & Long Co. Inc. , the country ’s largest concrete subcontractor and the largest employer of construction workers in the Mid-Atlantic region , argued that it was the unions that are exploiting the workers .
“ In order to go to work , you have to pay for it , ” Mr. McMahon said .
He said that unless the workers join a union , they would not be expected to accumulate enough consecutive hours on union jobs to become vested in the pension plan .
The money paid into the plan would then be forfeited to the fund .
He also noted that the economic recession has left few large - scale construction jobs other than federal projects , and that most construction workers are not union members .
As a result , he said , the PLA forces nonunion workers desperate for jobs to choose between joining the union or forfeiting any payments to the unions .
Tom Owens , spokesman for the AFL - CIO ’s Building and Construction Trades Department , said the money paid into union pension funds can be used only to benefit workers .
He also said pension contributions do not come out of workers ’ paychecks .
“ It comes from the contractor , ” he said .
He said Miller & Long is the perfect example of why PLAs are necessary .
He said the company has a history of assembling the most inexpensive work force it can find , relying mostly on illegal immigrants - a practice , he said , that had suppressed wages and forced black workers out of the construction industry .
Mr. McMahon called the union ’s accusations a “ tired old refrain ” that has no bearing on the PLA issue .
“ You do n’t stay in business 60 years by doing that , ” he said .
He also challenged the AFL - CIO ’s characterization of the pension contribution , saying that payment into the union fund is calculated as part of a worker ’s total compensation package .
About 16 percent of the country ’s construction trades workers were union members or covered by union contracts in 2008 , despite union workers generally receiving higher pay and better benefits than their nonunion counterparts , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
In New Hampshire , just 8.7 percent of construction workers are unionized .

Homemade soap is delightful to use on your skin or hair .
And handmade soap makes a wonderful gift for Christmas and birthdays .
You could also offer it as a hostess gift or a party or shower favor .
The only problem with homemade soap is that once you start using it , you will be hooked forever .
I know because I have been using this recipe for years !
A Note About Safety Remember :
When you make soap at home , you need to follow all the safety precautions listed below .
Pay close attention to the recipe , follow the steps in order , and conform to proportions as a change could result in product failure , dangerous chemical reaction , or burn .
The soap that has the colored spots was made by cutting up glycerine soap into rod shapes and added to the soap mixture just before pouring into the mold .

Safety Precautions
Never use aluminum in the soap making process
Do not touch lye — wear gloves and protect your eyes by wearing safety glasses .
Do not leave the lye solution unattended .
Keep away from children and nosey pets
Ventilate the area well .
Open a door and window or activate an exhaust fan to avoid inhaling dangerous fumes .
I do both .
I f you get lye on your skin , rinse immediately with cold water for several minutes .
Then rinse with vinegar as it counteracts lye because it is an acid .
If you do n't have vinegar , you can use orange juice .
If you spill lye solution on the counter - top , wash immediately with vinegar .
It is best to cover counter - tops with plastic for safety and to avoid a big mess .
Always add the lye to the water ( otherwise can create a dangerous reaction ) .
What Are Lye and pH ?
If it does n't have lye in it , it 's not soap .
Some producers of " homemade " soap , understanding peoples ' aversion to lye , list sodium hydroxide or caustic soda as an ingredient instead of lye .
Sodium hydroxide is lye .
Caustic soda is lye .
Many commercial soaps do not list lye or sodium hydroxide as an ingredient .
That 's because the " cleansing bar " you buy does not contain lye so is not soap — it 's detergent .
They may add lanolin or other softening agents including glycerin which is a byproduct of soap making .
But without lye , it just ai n't soap .
When you make soap at home , glycerin is created as a byproduct , making the soap wonderfully soothing for the skin .
Lye can be dangerous , yes .
But life is fraught with danger .
Stoves are dangerous .
Crossing the street is dangerous .
If you follow the rules and proper handling procedures , you will be fine .
The soap making process creates a chemical reaction called saponification , after which , fat is no longer fat and lye is no longer lye — together , they have become soap !
How to Test pH
Soaps and detergents have a slightly alkaline or base pH .
To assure yourself , if still in doubt , purchase some pH test strips .
Use the strips to test the pH on various bar soaps and personal cleaning products .
Then , test your own soap after it has cured .
You 'll see that the pH levels are similar .
Test soap after it has cured by creating a lather .
Levels should fall between 8 –10 .
Another method of testing pH is the simple tongue test .
Touch the tip of your tongue to the cured soap .
If you feel a slight buzzing sensation , the soap is not cured .
If you do n't feel the buzzing , it is soap .
Of course , even when the pH is fine , soap is still not going to be tasty .
Lye can be purchased at grocery stores ( Red Devil Lye ) or at a plumbing store .
Equipment Needed
Use only stainless steel , enamelware , glass , Pyrex , or plastic in the soap making process .
Large enamelware or stainless steel pot
Large mixing bowl or container made of stainless steel , glass , enamel - ware , or Pyrex for lye solution
Scale that weighs in ounces
2 glass - covered thermometers
Several large , heavy - duty plastic spoons
Plastic containers for weighing water , fats , and lye
Molds for soap ( commercial molds , or you can just use plastic food type containers )
Trash bags to cover counter
Stick blender
Stove
Sink
Apron , safety glasses , rags or paper towels

Homemade Soap Recipe
42 ounces Crisco
5 ounces canola oil
5 ounces castor oil
5 ounces coconut oil
17 ounces water
6 1/2 ounces lye
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 ounces or more of essential oil
coloring agents
herbs ( optional )
Weigh the fats photo by Dolores Monet
How to Make Soap
Dissolve sugar in a small amount of hot water ( set aside and use when you weigh the water ) Weigh 42 ounces Crisco ( or similar product ) into container .
Weigh the container first and adjust the scale to zero .
Place Crisco in large stainless steel or enamel - ware pot on low heat Weigh 17 ounces of water ( including the sugar water ) .
Weigh empty container first and adjust the scale to zero
Weigh lye , weighing container first , and pour the lye slowly into the water .
Ensure adequate ventilation by opening 2 windows .
Cover your nose and mouth .
Stand slightly away from the mixture as fumes will rise .
Gently stir until crystals have dissolved Measure canola , castor , and coconut oils separately ( again , wight the empty container first )
Add to the fats in the pot Use a separate container for the lye , the water , and the fats Allow fats and lye solutions to come to the same temperature - about 110 degrees F. this can be tricky .
The lye solution takes some time to cool .
If one of the mixtures is still warm and the other is near 110 degrees , place the container of the warmer ingredients in a cool water bath in the sink until the mixture cools .
When both mixtures have reached 110 F , slowly pour the lye solution int the fats Mix with stick blender until the mixture reaches the trace stage .
That is when you drag a spoon through the mixture and it leaves a path .
It 's kind of like pudding .
Add coloring agents and herbs
Add essential oils Stir Pour the thickened mixture into a mold that has been greased with olive oil .
You can use a large , rectangular Tupperware type container , a long wooden mold , or individual molds .
Lay plastic wrap over the top Cover with a towel Set aside for 3 days Remove soap from the container .
Slice into bars
Store the bars of soap on a rack where they can get good air ventilation .
Soap must be cured for 30 days before use .
Do not use soap before it is cured .

Add lye to water - you may have to stir 1 / 7
Questions & Answers
Question :
What is the purpose of using sugar in soap making ?
Answer : Adding a tablespoon of sugar to the water before you add lye gives the finished product a nice lather .
Make sure the sugar is completely dissolved .
The recipe made without the addition of sugar does not create a lot of lather .

Hi Kelly - there are lots of books about making soap at home .
If you want to get into the craft , it 's a good idea to read several .
That way you will get lots of tips as well as many different recipes using a wide variety of ingredients .
I would not make soap by memory alone but keep a list of ingredients as well as the measurements .
Also keep a short list of instructions .
I check off each ingredient as it is added .
That way you wo n't make a mistake that could ruin the batch .
Kelly Ann Christensen from Overland Park , Johnson County , Kansas on January 26 , 2020 :
I 'm going to try to remember this article .
I was in the middle of collecting items to begin making homemade soap when my life was majorly interrupted once again .
Have you read Smart Soapmaking ?
That was the book I purchased to begin , but it appears I will have to buy it again , too .
Shiiba on November 12 , 2018 :
Aurora , you look pretty " out of your mind " to me .
Lye is not used for " eating away dirt " , it is an essential element for the process of saponification with triglycerides .
When this process occurs there should not be any sodium or potassium hydroxide left , or you could get some good lye burns .
Soap based surfactants should have a pH of 9 - 10 which is n't in any way harmful for your skin .
Anyways , you should probably do some research before you speak .
As your level of ignorance worries me .
P.S : I hope you are cleaning yourself with any soap - based surfactant or syndet because you will be having quite a poor hygiene if not .
Dolores Monet ( author ) from East Coast , United States on December 21 , 2017 :
Hi Aurora - please do not use lye on your body .
If lye touches your skin wash right away .
In the soap making process , a chemical reaction changes the ingredients .
Do n't just trust me however .
Questioning an online article is a good idea .
Read further in order to make sure the information is correct .
Aurora on December 14 , 2017 :
So lye is used as an corrosive ingredient to eat away at dirt and grime .
And to rub it on the largest organ of your body is okay ?
Y’all out of ya damn mind .

HTC ’s Sense UI is a big hit .
Â
Pretty much everyone who has played with it will agree that what HTC has done with the stock Android experience is something special .
Â
Before Android came about , they were the company responsible for making Windows Mobile look nice with Touch Flo and Touch Flo 3D .
Â
Inevitably , the question will arise “ What ’s next for HTC ? ” Â
If recent patent filings are any indication , the next look of Android could resemble a virtual book with pages that turn .
Gizmodo is not the only one to notice that this has the making of a Palm Pre - like navigation and we ’re not the only one to agree .
Â
We ’re actually fans of the card system .
Â
In fact , we ’ve been asking for modders to come up with a desktop replacement app that mimics it for Android .
Each page of the virtual book is the UI of a service or function of the handheld electronic device .
Flipping the pages of the virtual book means browsing and selecting the services and functions provided by the handheld electronic device .
This book - like UI enables the user to use and manage these applications , widgets , and web pages in an easy and intuitive way like browsing a conventional printed book .
The book - like UI hides the differences among applications , widgets , and web pages so that the handheld electronic device can be accessed through a uniform and convenient UI .
It sounds as if the contacts will get a Rolodex - esque flick through feel .
Â
The image below shows pages collapsing and scrolling which certainly seems like it would feel intuitive .
Â
Here ’s hoping this comes to Android and not Windows Mobile .

Bonfire Night : Guy Fawkes fireworks displays in London and across the UK
It 's November 5th and unless you are busy preparing your own gunpowder , treason and plot then you may be wondering where you can celebrate Bonfire Night this year .
Luckily , anyone wishing to find a toffee apple or two is not short of options , there are hundreds of events across the country both big and small .
Here Travelmail has outlined six of the best places that will help make your Bonfire Night go with a bang , plus where to find the best of the rest .
Towering celebration : Bonfire Nights is celebrated at dozens of locations across London
London
Where it all began , London has a plethora of events this Bonfire Night both in the centre of the city and in local areas .
One of the best sources of information on where to celebrate is www.viewlondon.co.uk, which has an extensive list of events across the capital for both tonight and over the weekend .
Of the most popular events is Battersea Park 's display , which this year takes place on Saturday 7th November .
The event is to be themed around love , with the fireworks designed by the internationally renowned Pains Fireworks .
Admission to the Battersea celebrations costs £ 6.00 ( with a £ 1.00 charge for children under 10 years old ) .
Nearest train : Battersea Park or Queenstown .
Nearest Tube : Pimlico .

Devon
Keep on rolling .
The Bonfire Night celebrations in Ottery St Mary , Devon
The 5th of November is celebrated in flamboyant style in Ottery St Mary , Devon , which has become famous due to its tradition of carrying flaming tar barrels through the town as part of its annual Bonfire Night celebrations .
The small town , which lies between Exeter and Honiton , has held the event for hundreds of years and many believe it pre-dates the actual Gunpowder Plot itself .
Ottery St May remains the only town in the UK which still carries full - sized flaming barrels though the streets .
The barrels range in size from small to large so children can get involved too .
The event culminates in one giant barrel carrying at midnight .
For more information on the event visit : www.otterytarbarrels.co.uk.
Edinburgh
Edinburgh ’s annual Bonfire Night celebrations are a slightly more sedate affair than the barrel - carrying shenanigans on England 's South Coast .
The city plays host to a frenzy of catherine wheels and bangers at the Meadowbank Stadium , which is the main focus of the evening 's celebrations and will showcase Edinburgh 's largest firework display of the year .
The event will also have a bagpipe performance and entertainment which carries on throughout the evening .
The event opens at 6:30 pm with the main proceedings starting at 7:30 pm .
Tickets are priced at £ 5 .
For more information visit : www.edinburghleisure.co.uk.
Lewes
All dressed up : Some of the costumes at the Lewes Bonfire Night
The bonfire celebrations in the Sussex town of Lewes list as the most important event on the town ’s calendar .
The main reason for the Bonfire fervour is that the town not only marks the uncovering of the Gunpowder Plot but also the anniversary of the seventeen Protestant martyrs of the town who were executed during the reign of Queen Mary 1 between 1553 and 1558 .
Last year the town courted controversy after the bonfire council decided to burn an effigy of newly - elected U.S. President Barack Obama , and this year Alastair Darling , Gordon Brown and key figures from the banking world are likely to go up in smoke .
Expect to see processions of costumed Elizabethans or Vikings along with a carnivale atmosphere of rebellion .
Not for the faint - hearted .
For more information visit : http://www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk/.
Be careful not to get in the way of the Lewes Bonfire processions , a magistrate who once interfered in the 19th Century was thrown into the river
Liverpool
Liverpool is hosting a free firework event which will see three of the city ’s major parks , Sefton , Newsham and Walton Hall light up in time to space - themed music - a reference to the anniversary of the Apollo Moon landings - for an extraterrestrial twist .
The fireworks start at 7.30 pm but there is no officially planned bonfire at the parks themselves .
For more information on the event visit : http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/
Manchester
Manchester is set to have some of the best bonfire night events in the country this year .
Over 100,000 people attended the celebrations last year and admission to any of the council - organised events is free of charge .
Events have been ongoing all week but the main firework display is tonight .
The event starts at 7:30 pm with the bonfire lit at 8 pm .

One of the Accessories that comes shipped with my Dell M1330 laptop is a media Remote control which allows the laptop media player to be controlled remotely .
Unfortunately Dell in their wisdom left this cool accessory out of the default configuration of the M1330 that ships with Ubuntu pre-installed .
Thankfully there is an even better tool available which is much more useful than the XPS media remote , Its is called Remuco
Remuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile devices equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi .
With Remuco , you can remotely control your favorite media player .
You can switch to the next , previous , or any other media within the current playlist , browse your media library and activate other playlists , rate your media , adjust volume , and more .
On the mobile device ( the remote control ) , it displays information about the current media , including cover art .
source
** Ok the name is by no means cool or an a good indicator of what it can do , some of its features include **
Features
Remuco allows you to control :
* Playback
* Seek forward or backward in current playing item
* Set the playlist to repeat or shuffle
* Control volume

* Volume level
* Progress level of current playing song and its current rating
Media browser features includes :
* Browse Currently active playlist and apply actions to them
* Browse the play queue and apply actions to them
* Browse the players media library and apply actions to them
* search for items in the player ’s media library and apply actions to items in the search result
* browse the local filesystem and apply actions to files
*** Not all feature is available on all media player example Rhythmbox seems to be better support compared or other media player ***
Installation
Installation of Remuco is in two part , A player adapter is installed on your PC and the client on your mobile device
How to install the player adapter :
( K) Ubuntu
First you need to add the 3rd party repository to your sources .
list this can be done from synaptic
System -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Repositories .
Here you can enable the repositories for Ubuntu Software and Third Party Software .
For Third Party Software select Add -> enter the repository ’s address .
Ubuntu 9.04

Ubuntu 8.10
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/remuco-team/ppa/ubuntu intrepid main
Ubuntu 8.04
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/remuco-team/ppa/ubuntu hardy main
Now you need install the repository Key
Open your terminal and enter :
sudo apt - key adv -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com -- recv-keys 51A6F565
Now you will need to reload your sources by clicking the reload button on synaptic once done search for the team remuco , and you will see a list of remuco adapters for different Media players for linux
e.g I am on kde and i use amarok so i just installed the remuco - amarok package
Other Linux Distros can check here for installation Instructions
you now need to add remuco to the list of startup application
Amarok
The Amarok adapter requires Amarok 2 .
The Amarok adapter can be started with :
remuco-amarok
Audacious
The Audacious adapter can be started with :
remuco-audacious

NOTE : With the exception of Rhythmbox and Totem , Remuco adapter for other Media players can be started automatically by adding remuco - media - player name to your startup session e.g for amarok add remuco - amarok to ( gnome ) System / Preference / Sessions ( or startup application ) .
( KDE ) System - settings / Advance Autostart
Client side installation
Installation on your mobile can be done by downloading remuco package here ( the latest version on remuco in blog time is 0.9.0 ) extract the .tar.gz and goto / client / app / and send the . jar file to your mobile device and install it from there
( Note : The client requires a mobile device with JavaME support ( MIDP ≥ 2.0 , CLDC ≥ 1.1 ) .
If you use Bluetooth to connect to a player adapter , additionally JSR - 82 ( Java Bluetooth ) must be supported . )
Once installed on the device in my case i open terminal and run the following command remuco - amarok then i start amarok and start the client on my Nokia E71
Connected remuco to my laptop , it did its thing and yola i was able to control my amarok player from my phone .
Remember to first go to More and key - binding to set your own control key preference
Happy listening and I hope this helps someone .. ( sorry if this is badly written have n’t had time to blog in a while been very busy 😦 so am a bit rusty i guess )

First we bailed out the teetering Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs ; then we had to watch this behemoth firm , flush with taxpayer funds , recoup its losses and plan more big bonuses , while one in ten Americans is jobless .
Now we learn , via Huffington Post , of Goldman ’s dispassionate analysis of which health care reform scenario stands to make its clients the most money .
Best bet , says Goldman , is to jettison reform altogether and watch insurance stocks rise 59 percent .
And if that ca n’t happen , they should hope for the weakest bill possible .
This , folks , is how power really operates in this country .
While the rest of us suckers , who cling to the notion that we still live in a democracy , are dutifully calling our members of Congress about health care reform , the movers and shakers are calling their brokers .
And when they ’ve done that , they make another campaign contribution or send another lobbyist to the Hill .
Is it any wonder that we ca n’t seem to get a decent bill passed ?
Here ’s Sam Stein ’s summary of the Goldman Sachs internal memo :
UC Berkeley ( funded by DARPA ) has created cyborg beetles guided wirelessly via laptop .
These spy beetles were created with the intent of bugging actual conversations , literally acting as the " fly on the wall " .
The beetles range anywhere from 2 to 20 centimeters .
From Daily Mail :
" Using implants , they worked out how to control a beetle 's take - off , flight and landing by stimulating the brain to work the wings .
They controlled turns through stimulating the basilar muscles on one side or the other to make the wings on that side flap harder .
The embedded system uses nerve and muscle stimulators , a microbattery and a microcontroller with transceiver .
DARPA 's ultimate aim is to create cyborg insects that can fly more than 300ft to their target and then stay put until commanded to buzz off again . "
Yikes .

Chromium OS - Digging deeper into the open source Chrome OS
By Dj Walker - Morgan
Google 's Chromium OS running on an ASUS EEE PC 1000HA
With the arrival of the first code of Chrome OS , also known as Chromium OS in its open source form , the H takes a deeper look at the browser - centric operating system .
When Google announced Chrome OS , many people assumed Google was launching an assault on the desktop - going after Microsoft Windows and were just not saying that was what they were doing .
Now Chromium OS , the open source branch of Chrome OS , has arrived The H has taken the source code and built it to see how it feels in practice .
Chromium OS is designed around one philosophy , that the web and web applications are all that a netbook needs .
This was , notionally , the original idea behind netbooks such as the Eee PC 700 series , but that generation of netbooks rapidly developed into " tiny laptops " with similar , albeit scaled down , specifications to those of a laptop computer .
They also included the same issues of laptops ; data tended to be stored locally , there was little integration with the web and web applications and the browser was just another application .
Netbooks like this have been successful in their own ways , but Google wanted something else to be in play in the market , a truly thin client environment where there was only one application running on the operating system , the browser .
The first part of that development process was the creation of the Chrome browser which provided Google with a browser which matched where the company feels web applications are going .
It includes a stronger security model , faster JavaScript , and a minimalist user interface .
Chrome runs on Windows , with a Mac version due this year and a Linux version due next year .
The next stage for Google was to create an operating system which put that browser onto netbook level hardware , optimised for that hardware and integrated with Google 's cloud .
Announced earlier this year , Chrome OS is that operating system .
What 's inside Chromium OS ?
Although Google 's current release of Chromium OS can be run on current netbook devices , it is aimed at a device which does n't , quite , exist yet ; a tablet or clamshell device , possibly with touch support , definitely with 802.11n
Wi -Fi and solid state storage .
The storage on a Chrome OS device is there to act as a cache for data which is stored on the cloud , in Google 's case , their clouds and services .
This means that the cost of the device is lower as it does not need to include a large hard drive or flash drive .
The Chromium OS architecture
The operating system itself is a lightweight Debian GNU / Linux based operating system which contrary to earlier rumours , includes , an X Window based windowing system with support for OpenGL and the Clutter UI animation library .
The latter components play a part in providing the quite rich animation which appears on screen .
An important change at the lower levels of Chrome OS , and one which cannot be tried out just yet , is Google 's development of custom firmware for Chrome OS devices which is focussed on booting as quickly as possible by only looking for hardware expected by Chrome OS ; this does n't stop Chrome OS being booted on a device with a traditional BIOS , but it does mean that the boot time on these devices is n't as fast as Google is aiming for with custom firmware in place .
Next - Running Chromium OS

Iraq Inquiry bombshell : Secret letter to reveal new Blair war lies
Resolve : Blair and Bush in April 2002 , when they secretly agreed on ' regime change ' in Iraq
An explosive secret letter that exposes how Tony Blair lied over the legality of the Iraq War can be revealed .
The Chilcot Inquiry into the war will interrogate the former Prime Minister over the devastating ' smoking gun ' memo , which warned him in the starkest terms the war was illegal .
The Mail on Sunday can disclose that Attorney General Lord Goldsmith wrote the letter to Mr Blair in July 2002 - a full eight months before the war - telling him that deposing Saddam Hussein was a blatant breach of international law .
It was intended to make Mr Blair call off the invasion , but he ignored it .
Instead , a panicking Mr Blair issued instructions to gag Lord Goldsmith , banned him from attending Cabinet meetings and ordered a cover - up to stop the public finding out .
He even concealed the bombshell information from his own Cabinet , fearing it would spark an anti-war revolt .
The only people he told were a handful of cronies who were sworn to secrecy .
Lord Goldsmith was so furious at his treatment he threatened to resign - and lost three stone as Mr Blair and his cronies bullied him into backing down .
Sources close to the peer say he was ' more or less pinned to the wall ' in a Downing Street showdown with two of Mr Blair 's most loyal aides , Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan .
The revelations follow a series of testimonies by key figures at the Chilcot Inquiry who have questioned Mr Blair 's judgment and honesty , and the legality of the war .
The Mail on Sunday has learned that the inquiry has been given Lord Goldsmith 's explosive letter , and that Mr Blair and the peer are likely to be interrogated about it when they give evidence in the New Year .
Lord Goldsmith gave qualified legal backing to the conflict days before the war broke out in March 2003 in a brief , carefully drafted statement .
As The Mail on Sunday disclosed three years ago , even that was a distortion as Lord Goldsmith had told Mr Blair a week earlier he could be breaking international law .
But today 's revelations show that Lord Goldsmith told Mr Blair at the outset , and in writing , that military action against Iraq was totally illegal .
Pressured : Lord Goldsmith leaves No10 in March 2003 after talks with Blair
The disclosures deal a massive blow to Mr Blair 's hopes of proving he acted in good faith when he and George Bush declared war on Iraq .
And they are likely to fuel further calls for Mr Blair to be charged with war crimes .
Lord Goldsmith's ' smoking gun ' letter came six days after a Cabinet meeting on July 23 , 2002 , at which Ministers were secretly told that the US and UK were set on ' regime change ' in Iraq .
The peer , who attended the meeting , was horrified .
On July 29 , he wrote to Mr Blair on a single side of A4 headed notepaper from his office .
Friends say it was no easy thing for him to do .
He was a close friend of Mr Blair , who gave him his peerage and Cabinet post .
The typed letter was addressed by hand , ' Dear Tony ' , and signed by hand , ' Yours , Peter ' .
In it , Lord Goldsmith set out in uncompromising terms why he believed war was illegal .
He pointed out that :
War could not be justified purely on the grounds of ' regime change ' .
Although United Nations rules permitted ' military intervention on the basis of self - defence ' , they did not apply in this case because Britain was not under threat from Iraq .
While the UN allowed ' humanitarian intervention ' in certain instances , that too was not relevant to Iraq .
It would be very hard to rely on earlier UN resolutions in the Nineties approving the use of force against Saddam .
Lord Goldsmith ended his letter by saying ' the situation might change ' - although in legal terms , it never did .
The letter caused pandemonium in Downing Street .
Mr Blair was furious .
No10 told Lord Goldsmith he should never have put his views on paper , and he was not to do so again unless told to by Mr Blair .
The reason was simple : if it became public , Lord Goldsmith 's letter could make it impossible for Mr Blair to fulfil his secret pledge to back Mr Bush in any circumstances .
More importantly , it could never be expunged from the record as copies were stored in No10 and in the Attorney General 's office .
Although Lord Goldsmith had Cabinet status , he attended meetings only when asked .
After his letter , he barely attended another meeting until the eve of the war .
Mr Blair kept him out to reduce the chance of him blurting out his views to other Ministers .
When Mr Blair is quizzed by the Chilcot Inquiry , he will be asked why he never admitted he was told from the start that the war was illegal .
Equally ominously for Mr Blair , a defiant Lord Goldsmith is ready to defend the letter when he appears before the inquiry .
Friends of the peer , widely derided for his role in the Iraq War , believe it will vindicate him .
A source close to Lord Goldsmith said : ' He assumed , perhaps naively , that Blair wanted a proper legal assessment .
No10 went berserk because they knew that once he had put it in writing , it could not be unsaid .
' They liked to do things with no note - takers , and often no officials , present .
That way , there was no record .
Everything could be denied .
Heavy - handed : Baroness Morgan and Lord Falconer are said to have ' more or less pinned Lord Goldsmith to the wall and told him what Blair wanted '
' Goldsmith threatened to resign at least once .
He lost three stone in that period .
He is an honourable man and it was a terribly stressful experience .'
Lord Goldsmith 's wife Joy , a prominent figure in New Labour dining circles , played a crucial role in talking him out of quitting .
' Joy was always very ambitious on Peter 's behalf and did not want to see him throw it all away , ' said a source .
Lord Goldsmith 's letter contradicts Mr Blair 's repeated statements , before , during and after the war on its legality .
In April 2005 , the BBC's Jeremy Paxman repeatedly asked him if he had seen confidential Foreign Office advice that the war would be illegal without specific UN support .
Mr Blair said : ' No . I had the Attorney General 's advice to guide me . '
At best , it was dissembling .
At worst , it was a blatant lie .
Mr Blair knew all along that Lord Goldsmith had told him the war was illegal , and that when the peer finally gave it his cautious backing , he did so only under extreme duress .
The Mail on Sunday has also obtained new evidence about the way Lord Goldsmith was bullied into backing the war at the 11th hour .
He was summoned to a No10 meeting with Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer and Baroness Sally Morgan , Mr Blair 's senior Labour ' fixer ' in Downing Street .
No officials were present .
A source said : ' Falconer and Morgan performed a pincer movement on Goldsmith .
They more or less pinned him up against the wall and told him to do what Blair wanted . '
After the meeting , Lord Goldsmith issued his brief statement stating the war was lawful .
Lord Falconer said in response to the latest revelations : ' This version of events is totally false .
The meeting was Lord Goldsmith 's suggestion and he told us what his view was . '
Baroness Morgan has also denied trying to pressure Lord Goldsmith .
The legal row came to a head days before the war , when the UN refused to approve military action .
Stranded , Mr Blair had to win Lord Goldsmith 's legal backing , not least because British military chiefs refused to send troops into action without it .
On March 17 , three days before the conflict started , Lord Goldsmith said the war was legal on the basis of previous UN resolutions threatening action against Saddam - even though in his secret letter of July 2002 , he had ruled out this argument .
A spokesman for Lord Goldsmith said : ' This letter is probably in the bundle that has been supplied to the inquiry by the Attorney General 's department .
It is presumed they will want to discuss it with him .
If so , Lord Goldsmith is content to do so .
' His focus is on the legality of the war , its morality is for others . '
A spokesman for the Chilcot Inquiry said : ' We are content we have obtained all the relevant documents . '
A spokesman for Mr Blair refused to say why the former Prime Minister had not disclosed Lord Goldsmith 's July 2002 letter .
' The Attorney General set out the legal basis for action in Iraq in March 2003 , ' he said .
' Beyond that , we are not getting into a running commentary before Mr Blair appears in front of the Chilcot committee . '
Leading international human rights lawyer Philippe Sands said : ' The Chilcot Inquiry must make Lord Goldsmith 's note of 29 July , 2002 , publicly available to restore public confidence in the Government . '

Blair ' knew WMD claim was false '
By DAVID ROSE
By the time Tony Blair led Britain to attack Iraq , he had stopped believing his own lurid claims about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction , according to an unpublished interview with the late Robin Cook , the former Leader of the Commons who resigned from the Cabinet just before the invasion in March 2003 .
In the interview , which Cook gave me in 2004 , the year before his death , he described Blair 's actions as ' a scandalous manipulation of the British constitution ' , adding that if the then Prime Minister had revealed his doubts , they would have rendered the war illegal .
Cook , who was in almost daily contact with Blair in the months before his resignation , said that in September 2002 , when the Government published its infamous dossier claiming Saddam had tried to buy uranium for nuclear weapons and could deploy WMDs within 45 minutes , Blair did believe these claims were true .
But he added :
' By February or March , he knew it was wrong .
As far as I know , at no point after the end of 2002 did he ever repeat those claims . '
Tony Blair secures MPs ' support for war on March 18 , 2003 , as Clare Short looks on .
But according to Robin Cook , the PM already knew WMD claims were untrue
On March 18 , Blair had to face the Commons to ask it to vote for war but he knew , Cook added , ' that if he now publicly withdrew the dossier 's claims , his position would be lost ' .
Therefore Blair kept silent and so secured the war resolution , though 139 Labour MPs voted against him .
Cook added that if Blair had revealed his doubts , this would also have made it impossible for Lord Goldsmith to issue the fateful legal advice that Britain 's Service chiefs had been demanding : that war would be lawful .
' What I 've never seen satisfactorily defended by the Government is whether that opinion still stands up if the premise on which it was based - the claims in the dossier - turn out to be false , ' Cook said .
' Tony did n't focus on WMDs only for political reasons , but for legal reasons .
He knew he was not going to get the Attorney General on side on any basis other than that Saddam had illegal weapons and could not be disarmed by any means other than war . '
Cook 's is not the only bombshell that remains unpublished .
Last week , Sir Christopher Meyer , the former British Ambassador to Washington , told the Chilcot Inquiry that though Blair kept insisting almost to the end that ' nothing was decided ' on Iraq , his decision to support the invasion actually went back to April 2002 , when he visited President Bush 's Texas ranch .
However , both Meyer and other British and American officials told me in 2004 that Blair made up his mind even before April and that even then , Blair was saying in private that Britain would join the attack as long as Bush got UN backing .
That meant proving Saddam had active WMDs , as the UN would not authorise an attack on any other basis .
Revelations : Sir Christopher Meyer and the late Robin Cook
Meyer told me : ' Some time during the first quarter of 2002 , Blair had become resigned to war . '
Having committed himself to war , Blair believed he had to get military action approved by the UN to make the invasion legal , and to get the support of his own party back home .
But leading figures close to Bush were deeply hostile to this idea , and would have much preferred to attack unilaterally .
Perhaps the most shocking disclosures concerned Blair 's propensity to bend the truth .
For example , on July 26 , 2002 , Clare Short , then International Development Secretary , asked Blair whether war was looming .
His response was that she should go on holiday untroubled , because ' nothing had been decided , and would not be over the summer ' .
In fact , at that very moment , his adviser Sir David Manning was engaged in feverish diplomacy in Washington - because although Blair thought Bush had promised to go to the UN , he seemed to be changing his mind .
Manning even had a personal audience with Bush .
A few days later , Bush and Blair spoke by telephone .
A senior White House official who read the transcript told me : ' The way it read was that , come what may , they were going to take out the regime .
I remember reading it and thinking , " OK , now I know what we 're going to be doing for the next year . " '
Later , both leaders would state repeatedly that they had not decided to go to war .
But the official said : ' War was avoidable only if Saddam ceased to be president of Iraq .
It was a done deal . '
Yet the hawkish neo-conservatives at the Pentagon were still fighting hard to avoid the UN route , which would require a narrowing of focus on to WMDs .
The crunch came at a summit at Camp David on September 7 , 2002 , when , most unusually , not only Bush but the neo-con vice president Dick Cheney met Blair .
Cheney 's role , Meyer said , was solely to try to persuade Bush not to go to the UN .
In desperation , Blair , according to another White House official , told Bush and Cheney that he could be ousted at the Labour conference later that month if Bush ignored the UN .
Afterwards , the official said , he and his colleagues pored over the party 's constitution , discovering that it was most unlikely that this threat would materialise .
But by then it was too late : a week after the summit , Bush spoke at the UN General Assembly , and announced America would be seeking what became Resolution 1442 - the resolution that , in Lord Goldsmith 's eyes , allowed British soldiers to kill Iraqis without being prosecuted for murder .
But not all who once saw Blair as a friend have forgiven him .
' Blair was absolutely the reason why we went to the UN , because it was believed that his political fortunes absolutely demanded it , ' said David Wurmser , formerly Cheney 's chief Middle East adviser .
' It really was a political concession to Blair - and also a disastrous misjudgment . '
Is your website using Ajax ?
Are you calling a server process from a client - side application ?
If so , prepare yourself for a visit from Eolas ’ lawyers .
The company filed a US patent in 2002 and they are actively progressing infringement cases against a long list of companies including Adobe , Amazon , Apple , Blockbuster , Citigroup , eBay , Pepsi , Go Daddy , Google , JC Penney , JP Morgan Chase , Office Depot , Perot Systems , Playboy Enterprises , Staples , Sun Microsystems , Texas Instruments , Yahoo , and YouTube .
A Brief History of Ajax
Ajax is a conceptual technique .
The technologies have been available for over 10 years , but Ajax adoption became widespread after Jesse James Garrett ’s article in February 2005 which described the techniques and provided a great acronym : Asynchronous JavaScript and XML .
Despite its name , Ajax does not necessarily depend on asynchronous calls , JavaScript or XML .
Today , Ajax is a useful term applied to any system that communicates with a back - end web server to update content without requiring a full web page refresh ( although many marketing departments confusingly refer to Ajax when describing any type of animation or interactivity ! )
Most Ajax systems utilize the XMLHttpRequest object which permits programmatic server communication .
It was introduced by Microsoft in March 1999 when Internet Explorer 5.0 was released .
The original implementation was an ActiveX object devised specifically for the Outlook Web Access system .
Most browser vendors followed Microsoft ’s lead and implemented XMLHttpRequest as a native browser object .
Many of the dynamic web applications we rely on today would not be possible without Ajax techniques .
Does Eolas Have a Valid Ajax Patent ?
Eolas Technologies is the company that fought Microsoft over the use of embedded browser applets , such as Flash .
Eolas won that case and were awarded over $ 500 million in 2003 .
For several years , IE had to show a ridiculous alert box whenever an embedded object was encountered in the HTML .
Eolas 7,599,985 is a continuation of the original patent and has the snappy title “ Distributed hypermedia method and system for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document ” .
It was filed on 9 August 2002 and describes Ajax - like systems .
Here ’s an excerpt :
A system allowing user of a browser program on a computer connected to an open distributed hypermedia [ web page ] to access and execute an embedded programming object .
The program object is embedded into a hypermedia document much like data objects .
The user may select the program object from the screen .
Once selected the program executes on the user ’s ( client ’s ) computer or may execute on a remote server or additional remote computers in a distributed processing arrangement .
After launching the program object , the user is able to interact with the object as the invention provides for ongoing interprocess communication between the application object ( program ) and the browser program .
The present invention allows a user at a client computer connected to a network to locate , retrieve , and manipulate objects in an interactive way .
The invention not only allows the user to use a hypermedia format to locate and retrieve program objects , but also allows the user to interact with an application program located at a remote computer .
Interprocess communication between the hypermedia browser and the embedded application program is ongoing after the program object has been launched .
The use is able to use a vast amount of computing power beyond that which is contained in the user ’s client computer .
To most developers , the Eolas claim is absurd :
Ajax is a programming technique — not a technology .
Eolas did not define the name ‘ Ajax ’ or provide technical implementation details .
Ajax technologies and techniques existed before the patent was filed .
Microsoft ’s first implementation of XMLHttpRequest was developed 40 months before the Eolas patent was filed , although it took several years for developers to realize its power .
Prior to XMLHttpRequest , on - page server communication was still achieved using more rudimentary techniques such as IFrames or dynamic script injections .
Ajax has been adopted by millions of websites — can Eolas file lawsuits against them all ?
The patent is vague and could be applied to a wide range of web page interactions .
However , it has been ruled as valid by the US Patent Office on three separate occasions .
If Eolas win their infringement case , there is nothing to stop them taking out a lawsuit against … everyone .
Will Common Sense Prevail ?
Who knows what will happen once the lawyers become involved .
I ’m no legal expert , but it appears that Eolas have filed a US patent — which does not necessarily apply worldwide .
Could we see a situation where US companies hand their web development and hosting to offshore providers to avoid a lawsuit ?
If that ’s the case , perhaps Eolas should consider their impact on the US economy ?
Does Eolas have a valid Ajax patent ?
Is this another good reason to abolish software patents ?
Read the Eolas Lawsuit press release and decide for yourself .
The American dollar is in the midst of a large fall in its value , or depreciation , as measured against other major currencies .
The decline has been steady since 2002 and our currency is down about 35 percent from that peak .
After strengthening slightly more than 10 percent during the global financial crisis of the past 18 months , the dollar is again falling back toward its pre-crisis lows , representing its weakest international value since 1967 .
But there is a definite possibility that the dollar could soon decline further or faster .
At the level of general economic strategy , the American government has responded to a financial sector crisis with an expansionary fiscal policy , and the Federal Reserve is implementing loose monetary policy .
Andrew Haldane , responsible for financial stability at the Bank of England , puts it this way :
“ For the authorities , [ excessive risk - taking by the financial sector ] poses a dilemma .
Ex-ante , they may well say “ never again . ”
But the ex-post costs of crisis mean such a statement lacks credibility .
Knowing this , the rational response by market participants is to double their bets .
This adds to the cost of future crises .
And the larger these costs , the lower the credibility of “ never again ” announcements .
This is a doom loop . ” ( link to the paper )
In addition to a financial crisis , we also have a large current account deficit , meaning that we buy more from the world than we sell .
The deficit was $ 100 billion in the latest available ( second quarter ) data , which is around 3 percent of gross domestic product , and we finance that with capital inflows from abroad .
( The current account deficit is down from around 6 percent , but two - thirds of the decline is due to the lower price of oil ) .
In the past , many of those inflows have been private investments of various kinds , but as investors around the world question whether United States government debt , and its dollars , are really worth the paper , it is increasingly difficult for us to finance our deficit with the outside world .
What does this mean for the dollar ?
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner continues to repeat that a strong dollar is “ very important ” for the American economy , but United States fiscal and monetary policy pushes toward depreciation .
To bail out our banks , we need cheap money , and this implies some inflation .
To finance our current account deficit , investors need to think they are buying inexpensive assets from us .
Everything points to a cheaper dollar .
( The same thing is happening in Britain , but the Bank of England is increasingly explicit about this point and the unsavory broader situation . )
A “ hard landing ” scenario for the dollar could be painful .
The 1980s classic , Stephen Marris ’s “ Deficits and the Dollar : The World Economy at Risk , ” stresses that a rapidly falling dollar would push up United States inflation , resulting in higher interest rates and a deep recession ( pp. lx- lxi ) .
Writing in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs , Fred Bergsten emphasizes that such outcomes are still possible today .
A weakening dollar will cause inflation fears , so yields on long - term government bonds will rise to compensate investors for inflation , and we will need to pay more and more to finance our large debts .
The idea that the American dollar might follow emerging markets such as Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2002 , or Britain in the 1970s — and so depreciate by 50 percent or more in a relatively short time — is certainly implausible now .
But such a “ doom scenario ” is not unrealistic in the future without change .
In this context , the American government needs to control its budget deficit to keep this adjustment on track , and to stop confidence in the dollar from falling further .
Our government collects far too little in taxes for what it spends .
There is no choice but to raise taxes soon and rein in spending .
Short - term rates ( controlled by the Fed ) will stay low , while long - term rates ( market - determined and affected by trust in our Treasury and Fed to keep the value of dollar strong ) will rise as people fear their dollar investments will be debased .
There is no doubt that both the Fed and the Bank of England know what is happening .
The spread between short - and long - term rates ( known as the “ yield curve ” ) will rise , and banks will benefit ; would - be home buyers and people with overdrafts or outstanding credit card balances pay more , while savers get little .
This is how the public pays for the past losses of our financial system .
We do n’t have to do this again and again .
We could start by changing our financial system from the roots .
We need to credibly remove the promise to bail out our large banks each time they fail .
This means forcing them to hold more capital , dividing them up so they are smaller , and then letting them fail when they make poor gambles .
The Treasury ’s past and current close connections to Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and other major investment banks illustrate how our own doom machine functions .
We need to break up these “ banks ” so they are small enough to fail , and also ensure that no bank , regardless of its connections , is able to demand that the Fed and the Treasury support its solvency in the future to prevent financial collapse .
In this context , a weakening dollar helps the administration to put an unstable financial system back on its feet — and to crank up our “ doom machine . ”

Another World Was Possible
In keeping with recent celebrations of the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , let ’s consider just how far the actual results fell short of their promise .
To take just one example : the West systematically suppressed all economic alternatives to neoliberalism in the countries of the former Soviet bloc after the fall of communism .
In Russia , neoliberal intellectuals like Jeffrey Sachs eagerly supported derailment under Yeltin of Gorbachev ’s market socialist agenda for mutualizing state - owned factories as worker cooperatives .
( The latter “ land to the tillers ” and “ factories to the workers ” policy , by the way , was exactly the model of post - Soviet privatization Rothbard proposed : treating state property as unowned and letting it be homesteaded by the work force . )
In Poland , Lech Walesa was pressured to throw Solidarity under the bus , and to sacrifice their vision of placing the former state economy under workers ’ control .
It ’s interesting , by the way , how workers ’ resistance against pro-Soviet regimes was used by the West for all it was worth , and then cut loose and discarded .
In virtually every anti-Soviet uprising of the post - WWII period , the resistance was libertarian socialist in character .
In East Germany in 1953 , Hungary 1956 , Czechoslovakia 1967 , and Poland 1981 , the resistance organized workers ’ councils in the factories and saw themselves as fighting against a bureaucratic ruling class that had supplanted the capitalists .
Come to think of it , as another example of history ’s tendency to rhyme if not repeat , this sounds a bit like events in the Soviet Union before the Bolshevik party machine hijacked the sovyets and Lenin suppressed the workers ’ committees and placed the factories under one - man management .
In South Africa , Nelson Mandela was persuaded to gut the ANC ’s agenda for land reform , and to abandon any attempt at reparations , worker control , or otherwise addressing the issue of unjust acquisition in the mining industry ( which had been built by slave labor ) .
Both Walesa and Mandela were coopted as brand - name logos , like Vlaclav Havel : The Triumph of Democracy ( TM ) , or The Walls Came Tumbling Down ( TM ) .
Walensa and Mandela were eviscerated of everything substantive they ’d fought for , and reduced to little more than patronizing “ good guy ” icons in Michael Jackson ’s “ Man in the Mirror ” video .
If Gandhi ’s national liberation struggle had happened today , the folks in the State Department and IMF would probably have reduced him to the same kind of superficial icon , taking away the spinning wheel and all the talk of industrial swadeshi .
Come to think of it , that sounds an awful lot like the domesticated and non-threatening Martin Luther King , Jr. ( who was allowed to keep the “ I Have a Dream Speech ” but had to lose the poor people ’s movement ) .
And since then , there ’s been a global Democracy ( TM ) industry , composed of such bodies as the Soros Foundation , the National Endowment for Democracy , and the International Republican Institute , busily at work replacing post -Soviet kleptocracies with telegenic suits willing to take orders from Washington and the World Bank .
The first order of business of such regimes , as in Poland and South Africa , and the new “ democracy ” in Iraq , is to accede to the WIPO treaty and the Urugay Round of GATT , and organize the sale of state industry with all deliberate speed to international finance capital ( on terms entirely favorable to the latter , of course ) .
The fall of communism and subsequent neoliberal revolution amounted , in practice , to the collapse of a wall encircling the Soviet bloc , and its replacement by a set of corporate walls surrounding the entire planet .
In the midst of all the hoopla around the Berlin Wall , let ’s stop to reflect on what might have been .
The Empowering Spirits Foundation will hold the Love Unites Kiss - In , outside the San Diego Mormon Temple in protest of the recent arrest of Derek Jones and Matthew Aune who shared a kiss by the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City .
The church maintains that they can stop this behavior because it is private property , but hundreds have protested saying that the Church has not interfered with the many heterosexuals who goto the romantic spot to kiss .
This is a peaceful protest to show the LDS church not to persecute against love .
They ask that supporters paint red hearts on their cheeks , foreheads , or wear paper hearts on your clothing .
Signs that are encouraged include : Love Unites , Free Hugs , Free Kisses , Love Knows No Boundaries , Equality for All , etc .

Children in New South Wales could be imprisoned for up to six months if they are caught carrying cans of spray paint without a legitimate reason .
The new measures are part of a crackdown on graffiti .
The State Government will make it an offence for juveniles to carry spray paint without an excuse , such as school work or employment .
The act will be punishable by fines of up to $ 1,100 or six months in jail .
It is the first time the courts will have the power to imprison minors for the act of possessing spray cans alone .
Premier Nathan
Rees is also planning to announce an annual graffiti clean - up day , where community members will volunteer their time to help chemically remove paint .
The idea is loosely based on the popular clean - up Australia day .
Graffiti artist James McCallum says the Government is taking an uninformed approach that might have a lot of unintended consequences .
" Especially when you 're talking about getting tough on in this case , kids who are disenfranchised , who are actually in doing graffiti , engaging with their community , " he said .
" That 's kind of the ironic thing as well .
The simple response of saying that we 'll throw them in prison or charge them $ 1,100 is not exactly worthy of the State Government . "
The two sides made a preliminary deal in June The sale of General Motors ' ( GM's ) Swedish unit Saab has been called off after the would - be buyer pulled out of the deal .
Swedish sportscar maker Koenigsegg said it had " come to the painful and difficult conclusion " that it could no longer carry out the acquisition .
GM said it was " very disappointed " by the decision .
The two sides had announced a preliminary agreement over the sale of loss - making Saab in June .
Stronger GM
" Given the sudden change in direction , we will take the next several days to assess the situation and will advise on the next steps next week , " said GM president and chief executive Fritz Henderson .
I think GM will now simply maintain Saab
Independent car industry analyst Robin Roberts
The news comes three weeks after GM announced that it was calling off plans to sell its other European business , Opel , along with its UK brand Vauxhall .
GM had agreed to sell Opel and Vauxhall to Canadian car parts firm Magna , but changed its mind .
It had put both Opel and Saab up for sale at the start of the year before it went into bankruptcy protection in the US on 1 June , which it then exited in just over one month after support from the US government .
GM 's finances have greatly improved since then , leading to its decision to keep Opel and Vauxhall .
Another U - turn ?
Independent car industry analyst Robin Roberts said it was likely that GM would be pleased to keep Saab .
" I think GM will now simply maintain Saab , " he said .
" Saab may currently be loss - making , but GM desperately needs to have a prestige brand in Europe .
" But if it does now seek to find another buyer , there are a number of Chinese firms who would love to have Saab , such as Beijing Automotive . "
However , David Cole , chairman of the US Center for Automotive Research in Ann , said simply shutting down Saab remained " one option " .
Mr Roberts added that there had been growing speculation in recent weeks that Koenigsegg may pull out of the deal .
Delay Koenigsegg itself blamed its decision on " delays in completing the deal " , which had " led to risks and uncertainties " .
If the deal had gone ahead , it would have greatly increased the size of Koenigsegg .
The specialist maker of performance cars currently employs 45 people , and produces just 18 vehicles per year .
Saab , by contrast , has a workforce of 3,892 , and produced 90,281 cars in 2008 .
To finance the deal , Koenigsegg was seeking a 400 m euro ( $ 600 m ; £ 360 m ) loan from the European Investment Bank , and wanted the Swedish government to act as a guarantor .
Stockholm had yet to make a decision on the issue .
Saab spokesman Eric Geers said the company was disappointed by the development .
" We had hoped this deal would go through , " he said .
" We have a good business plan , but now Koenigsegg has pulled out , so we will have to see what will happen . "

Der CCC - Mann Frank Rieger hat in der aktuellen Wikipedia - Debatte nun vorgeschlagen , die Wikipedia aufzuspalten in eine Version für ( sinngemäß ) Fundamentalisten , nicht ausgelastete Studienräte und Telefonhörerdesinfizierer , die allesamt Spaß an Löschdiskussionen mit der spanischen Inquisition haben , sowie in eine entspanntere Version für Menschen , die nach sinnvollen Informationen suchen oder diese teilen wollen .
Nun hatte es ja in den letzten Jahren einige „ forks “ gegeben , die es jedoch nicht einmal auf Sektengröße gebracht haben .
Nun wird eine Spaltung des Bestehenden angedacht , ein Gebiet , auf dem wir Deutschen sowohl auf religiösem als auch geopolitischem Gebiet historische Referenzen vorweisen können !
Und diese Spaltung soll geordnet unter dem gemeinsamen Dach der Wikimedia ablaufen !
Geringe Realisierungschance
So vernünftig dieser Vorschlag klingt , so sind die Realisierungschancen eher gering , denn bei den die Wikipedia dominierenden Hardlinern , die sich dem Löschen verpflichtet fühlen , scheint es ein generelles Toleranzproblem zu geben , was „ Konkurrenz “ im eigenen Haus mit einschließen dürfte .
Mit Recht werden die Fundamentalisten befürchten , dass sie auf lange Sicht unter ihresgleichen bleiben werden , während die an dumpfen Diskussionen mit fachfremden Regelkundlern uninteressierten Experten und die anderen coolen Leute zum neuen Flügel mit dem nützlichen Wissen abwandern werden .
Wie jede Organisation werden daher auch die Löschfanatiker zum Selbsterhalt streben .
Eigentliches Problem : Unterirdische Diskussionskultur
Das eigentliche Problem liegt aber meines Erachtens weniger in einer weiten oder engen Fassung der Regeln , denn Regeln müssen in der einen oder anderen Weise dennoch ausgelegt werden .
Die Auslegung jedoch , die Verfahren und vor allem die Streitkompetenz der Admins sind meiner Auffassung nach die eigentliche Ursache , welche die Wikipedia lähmt .
Die Admins sind ehrenamtlich tätig , können Streiten nur begrenzt Zeit widmen und verfügen über keine Ausbildung in der Handhabung von geistigen Auseinandersetzungen , juristischen Streiten oder pädagogischen Herangehensweisen .
Aufgrund der Hilflosigkeit versuchen es Admins häufig mit unangemessen autoritärem Auftreten und der vorschnellen Verhängung von Sperren , was für erwachsene Autoren mit einem Minimum an Selbstachtung ein klares Exit - Signal bedeutet .
Lösungsvorschlag : Professionelle Mediatoren
Wäre es nicht ein sinnvoller Ansatz für den relativ vermögenden Wikimedia - Verein , professionelle Mediatoren anzustellen , die Streitereien distanziert analysieren , ggf .
Sachverständige zuziehen und mit den Parteien auf Augenhöhe reden ?
Die Löschfanatikern , die eher an Karrikaturen erinnern , gelegentlich mal offline ein Feed Back geben oder sinnvolleren Aufgaben zuführen ?
Glaubenskriegern , die sich in bestimmten Artikeln verschanzt haben , freundlich auf die Finger klopfen – und zwar auch dann , wenn es sich um „ verdiente Wikipedianer “ handelt ?
Perhaps surprisingly for such a well - known part of the scriptures of three great religions , Christianity , Judaism and Islam , there are two very different candidates within the Bible for the title of ' The Ten Commandments ' .
These are known as the Ethical Decalogue and the Ritual Decalogue .
The Ethical Decalogue is the more familiar of the two , with its injunctions against killing and covetousness .
The Ritual Decalogue is far less known , and - as the name suggests - is mostly concerned with sacrifices and ceremonies .
What the Bible Actually Says
There is no clear story of Moses going up the mountain and being handed the Ten Commandments on two stone tablets .
The phrase ' Ten Commandments ' appears just twice in the Bible , and on neither occasion is it directly linked to the Ethical Decalogue .
Here is a list of all the verses relevant to the Ten Commandments , in the order in which they appear :
Exodus 20 has God speaking the Ethical Decalogue from Mount Sinai to the assembled Hebrews , but makes no mention of anything being written down and does not refer to them as the Ten Commandments .
In Exodus 24 , Moses writes lengthy laws , then God calls him up the mount to give more laws , but in fact gives several chapters of ritual bumph on technical specifications for the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle .
At the end of this , he gives stone tablets written ' with the finger of God ' in Exodus 31 .
Moses then descends , sees the Hebrews worshipping a golden calf and smashes the tablets .
In Exodus 34 , God tells Moses to carve two tablets ' like the first ' .
God gives the Ritual Decalogue and tells Moses to write the Ten Commandments on the tablets .
In Deuteronomy 5 , Moses gives the Ethical Decalogue to the Hebrews , saying God wrote it on two stone tablets - but does not mention the Ten Commandments by name .
In Deuteronomy 10 , the story is repeated with slight variations .
Moses is again told to carve two new tablets ' like the first ' , which God will carve the same words on .
God proceeds to do this ; this is referred to as the Ten Commandments , but it is not stated which Commandments are being referred to .
The Ritual Decalogue comes midway through a section describing the giving of the Ten Commandments , and the text immediately after the Ritual Decalogue reads :
And the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water .
And he wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant , the Ten Commandments .
The phrase ' Ten Commandments ' is used just twice in the entire Bible , and neither of those occasions is close to a list of the ' ordinary '
Ten Commandments , the Ethical Decalogue .
From all this , the natural reading is that the Ritual Decalogue is the Ten Commandments , although with some confusion over what is carved in stone and by whom .
However , natural readings can be misleading and there are other interpretations that have been put forward with the aim of proving that the Ethical Decalogue is the real Ten Commandments .
Popular Views on the Ethical Decalogue vs the Ritual Decalogue
If the Ethical Decalogue is to be considered the Ten Commandments , it is necessary to show that the Ritual Decalogue is not .
There are several possible ways this might be done .
Two Sets of Tablets
The story makes clear that there were in fact two sets of stone tablets .
Moses smashes the first set in anger , and has to climb the mountain again for a replacement .
You can almost guarantee that some bright spark will suggest that the Ritual and Ethical Decalogues could be from the first and second sets of tablets .
However , this is a non-starter ; it is explicit that the words of God are unchanged , and are the same on both sets of tablets .
The Number of Commandments
One argument in favour of the Ritual Decalogue would be that the Ethical Decalogue does not seem to consist of ten distinct Commandments .
There are at least four different ways of breaking the text up into ten chunks , depending upon whether coveting houses is the same as coveting wives ; whether ' I am the Lord your God ' is a Commandment , part of a Commandment or preamble ; and whether making idols constitutes worshippping other Gods .
However , this last point applies equally to the Ritual Decalogue , which could also be said to have only nine Commandments .
There is a Break Between the Ritual Decalogue and the Phrase ' Ten Commandments '
The main - indeed , only - cause to suggest that the Ritual Decalogue is the Ten Commandments is that it seems to be described as such in the text .
If it could be shown that the phrase ' Ten Commandments ' is not referring to the Ritual Decalogue , then the case would be closed .
In the original Hebrew text , there is a subject break at the end of the Ritual Decalogue , just before Moses spends 40 days and 40 nights on the mountain and , crucially , before he is told to carve the Ten Commandments .
Thus , a line of argument dating back at least as far as the 13th Century Jewish scholar Nahmanides suggests that in the intervening period , God gave many other instructions to Moses , including the Ethical Decalogue .
The confusion over whether Moses or God carves the stone tablets has frequently been used to support this .
God , it is claimed , wrote the Ethical Decalogue , but told Moses to write the Ritual Decalogue .
There are some problems with this idea ; firstly , the Biblical text makes no mention of what , if anything , God said to write other than the Ritual Decalogue , so it is based on an assumption .
The text does also seem to flow across the subject break ; the Ritual Decalogue begins by describing itself as a covenant , and immediately afterwards Moses is instructed to carve ' this covenant ' in stone as the Ten Commandments .
The argument over who carved the second set of tablets is also problematic , as both Moses and God are explictly said to have done so .
Nevertheless , this continues to have some support .
Richard E. Friedman has even suggested that Moses was instructed to write the Ritual Decalogue on the back of the tablets containing the Ethical Decalogue .
The Ten Commandments are Given ' Out of the Fire '
As well as distancing the title ' Ten Commandments ' from the Ritual Decalogue , it is also necessary to associate it with the Ethical Decalogue .
This is tricky , as nowhere in the Bible is the Ethical Decalogue directly described as the Ten Commandments .
The only other place that the phrase ' Ten Commandments ' is used is in Deuteronomy 10 , where they are said to have been given ' out of the midst of the fire ' .
The only set of commandments given from a fire , the claim goes , are the Ethical Decalogue from Exodus 20 .
This therefore links the phrase ' Ten Commandments ' with the Ethical Decalogue .
The Ritual Decalogue has God in the form of a cloud , and therefore cannot be the Ten Commandments .
Naturally , it is not quite so simple .
Exodus 19 does indeed mention God speaking to Moses from fire , but this is not where the Ethical Decalogue is given .
Moses then descends the mountain and God gives the Ethical Decalogue to the Hebrews as a whole in the form of a thunderous smoke .
God is also said to speak in fire and cloud and write on tablets of stone in his long speech from Exodus 24 to Exodus 31 , so it would seem more natural for these to be the tablets being referred to , yet the orders given mostly concern the Ark of the Covenant and are clearly not Ten Commandments at all .
In fact , references to ' clouds ' , ' smoke ' , ' fire ' , ' thunder ' and ' lightning ' are used seemingly interchangably throughout this section to describe the appearance of God throughout the Exodus from Egypt .
This raises problems in trying to connect two verses simply by their use of one of these words .
Scholarly Views on the Two Decalogues
Each of the opinions given above answers some problems with understanding the Biblical text , but raises others .
However , the largest problem with all of them is that they work on the basis of an assumed inerrant text , something that non-fundamentalist experts have long since abandoned .
Scholarly opinion on the Ritual Decalogue largely disagrees with all the theories given above .
It is generally accepted among historians that the whole story of Moses is historically inaccurate , with the Exodus , wandering in the wilderness and invasion of Canaan all contradicted by archaeological findings .
It is , therefore , doubtful that there ever were any tablets , so it 's not really meaningful to ask which set of Commandments is the ' real ' one handed to Moses .
Nonetheless , an explanation is still required for how two such different lists of Commandments came to be in the same holy scripture .
The Ritual Decalogue is a shorter version of the immediately preceding section of the Book of Exodus , known as the Covenant Code .
It is not clear whether the Decalogue is a synopsis of the Code , or the Code is an expansion of the Decalogue , or if both are taken from a now - lost document .
It does seem , though , that the two are closely linked .
The most widely - accepted explanation of how the Old Testament came to be written , the Documentary Hypothesis , posits four separate authors for the first books of the Old Testament ( the Pentateuch or Torah ) , spread out over time .
It states that the Jahwist ( from Judah ) produced the Ritual Dialogue , while the Elohist ( Israeli ) tradition used the more complex Covenent Code .
Again , it is not clear whether one was based on the other or whether both came from a third source , now lost , but both were combined to give a single document called the Jahwist / Elohist source .
The Ritual Decalogue was replaced with the Ethical Decalogue by a later author , known as the Priestly source .
By this hypothesis , the modern text was produced by a fourth writer , the Deuteronomist , who tried to combine both the Jahwist / Elohist document ( containing the Ritual Decalogue ) and the Priestly document ( containing the Ethical Decalogue ) , giving us the combined text we have today ( containing both ) .
This would explain why we have three slightly different accounts of the giving of the replacement tablets .
Towards the end of the twentieth century , many variations on the Documentary Hypothesis were proposed , with assorted datings for each source and many of the elements being broken down further into sub-sources .
The impact of this on our understanding of how the two Decalogues came to be in the same scritpture is fairly minimal .
For several reasons , all these variations agree that the first five books of the Old Testament reached their current form in the years surrounding the Chaldean ( or New Babylonian ) invasion of Jerusalem and the Exile of the Hebrews in Babylon ( c. 586 - 537 BC ) .
Both Decalogues bear a surprising resemblance to Old Babylonian laws , which were displayed in numbered lists carved in stone , and there is other evidence of Babylonian and Mesopotamian influences in the Old Testament .
Thus , it is likely that both the Babylonian empires were an influence on Jewish scripture , directly or indirectly .
Some scholars also feel that the repeated references in the Ritual Decalogue to cattle and crops indicates a settled culture , not the nomadic people described in Exodus .
It is unlikely that we will ever find the exact truth of the origin of this scripture .
For now , the Ethical Decalogue is likely to stand as one of mankind 's earliest and greatest attempts at a synopsis of morality , however imperfect .
The Ritual Decalogue has become a footnote to history and a boon to triviaphiles .

For a more complete description of what Spunk is about you can view the Spunk Manifesto .
Ian Heavens , Spunk Co-founder
1957 -2000 Ian Heavens : Revolutionary
Many remember how sincere , genuine and giving Ian was .
As well as bringing joy to those around him Ian had a vision of a fairer world .
He believed the anarchist movement could bring about a better world .
In 1993 , with his skills and access to the internet , he found his opportunity to give anarchism a boost in cyber space .
Spunk was born .
Along with others from around the world , that he knew from an email list , he devoted much time and energy to building the Spunk internet archive .
He also gave workshops about the then new internet to other activists .
Many wanted to stifle the internet as a vibrant exchange of ideas .
Ian was a casually of the attack on the new - found freedoms to promote revolution electronically .
After being smeared by the Sunday Times Ian decided to keep a " low profile " as far as openly revolutionary activity was concerned .
Ian played a central role in the Mutiny Collective , which puts on fundraising gigs for the Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh .
He enthusiastically did the one hundred and one things needed to ensure a successful gig .
Not to mention often playing with Bloco Vomit at an ACE gig !
Not only were the Mutiny gigs crucial for raising money , they were vital and exciting events in their own right .
Always concerned to break down musical and cultural barriers , Ian helped organise gigs which brought together punks and poets , music from the eclectically experimental to traditional folk , information stalls and wild pogoing ..... at ACE and Spunk we will always remember him .

Plunder , Rot , Fear , Greed and Desire .
Laconic chapter headings tell the story .
This brilliant , dismaying book by a reporter who delivers fact , analysis and eloquent anger with equal aplomb is designed to make you shudder the next time you drive on to a garage forecourt .
Where did my last 20 litres come from ?
How many sickened and died in Africa or South America to keep the pumps I depend on full ?
And what will happen to me when , more swiftly than I can possibly realise , those pumps run dry ?
Peter Maass travels far , wide and indefatigably , notebook in hand , visiting places where the world averts its eyes .
Welcome to Equatorial Guinea , Africa 's third largest exporter of oil and gas ; population , 600,000 .
If you average out oil revenues across its citizens , it would be richer per capita than Saudi Arabia .
In fact , it is dirt , diseased poor .
The managers at its mighty new natural gas plant arrive from America and Europe ; the workers they control are flown in from India and the Philippines .
Nothing – not food , not goods , not the well - being of trade – comes from the mean streets of Malabo .
Nothing – not health or education – goes the other way .
Wealth here begins and ends with Teodoro Obiang , the great but tactfully obscure dictator , his sons , his wives , the brutal regime that Mark Thatcher did n't quite manage to overthrow a few years back .
You can read about Obiang – and the $ 300 m to $ 500 m in his Washington bank " investment accounts " – in a US Senate report on " Money Laundering and Foreign Corruption " .
We know in dismal detail what he stands for , but do n't expect anything to change .
We can rail at Mugabe , because Zimbabwe has no oil .
But President Obiang of Equatorial Guinea remained an honoured guest on the White House circuit long after his cover was blown .
Welcome , too , to the Niger Delta , eighth - largest oil - exporting region on the planet .
Nigeria has earned more than $ 400 bn from oil , yet , as Maass grimly notes , nine out of 10 Nigerians live on less than $ 2 a day and one in five children dies before its fifth birthday .
Some 80 % of Nigeria 's oil wealth goes to 1 % of its population ( on World Bank figures ) .
It is , frankly , stolen as it trickles through the system , from ministers to bureaucrats to policemen scratching their palms .
And , because this is Nigeria , not some tiny , fly - blown state , because the land teems with young men without schooling or jobs , all this leads to big troubles and , sometimes , big headlines .
The Delta that Maass visits is the eighth circle of Hell : filth , choking fumes , venality , desolation .
Rebels kidnap oil workers , organise resistance armies , often live openly in their towns or villages until Nigerian troops arrive , but they are not the villains of this piece , merely fighters for a better life for the people who live here yet see not a smidgen of hope through their pain .
The country may be near collapse , corroded from within , unable to govern amid ungovernable decay ( this is the chapter called Rot ) , but savage injustice fuels constant resistance .
There are no winners , just more and more losers .
Oil has brought Nigeria little but misery and violence , and , as you voyage onwards , the story repeats itself with malignant force .
Ecuador ?
A contaminated land .
Kazakhstan ?
Russia ?
The strong men take command .
Iraq , Iran , Saudi Arabia ?
We can all begin to write the script there .
Put Norway , Canada ( and perhaps Aberdeen ) to one side and it's hard to find anywhere that takes the gush of oil without an accompanying stench of corruption and a slick of environmental destruction oozing in its wake .
But Maass plays much more than a mere polemicist .
In a way , it 's the things that do n't fit his thesis that make it most compelling .
We 're not just talking voracious capitalism , are we ?
When Teodoro Obiang heads some military parade , the roads he drives along are laid by Chinese workers .
Nor are we talking simple populist idealism .
When Hugo Chávez of Venezuela wins an election , he looks first and hardest at the price of oil because that 's the key to his popularity .
When Rumsfeld and Bush pour armies into Iraq , it 's easy to say that war is all about oil – but why then leave Baghdad 's biggest , most precious refinery to its fate ?
A master plan or a masterpiece of incompetence ?
Conspiracy theories do n't always fit .
We can make the supreme villains here the giants of American and European capitalism , the Exxons , the Shells , the BPs , but , increasingly , from Quito to Caracas to Moscow , it 's the state oil and gas companies – owned by the people , for the people , but strangely not doing much good for the people – which do the continuing damage .
Must we blame rough men from Texas or smooth men from Pall Mall for offering gifts to the rulers who greet them on the runway , hands outstretched , money bags open ?
How much , at root , do we pump - fillers care as long as we get our fix ?
The strength of Crude World , filled with vivid reporting , is that it leaves you no option but to care .
Its weakness is that it also offers no very convincing alternative .
What happens when the oil runs out ?

High Court Ponders Fate of Tax Rebel By James P. Tucker , Jr. The Supreme Court will huddle on October 19 to consider whether to hear the appeal of a strong tax rebel who argues that the federal income tax is unconstitutional on numerous grounds .
It is believed to be the first time that a classic tax rebel ’s case has gone so far .
The justices met privately , which is routine , to decide whether to hear the case of Thomas T. Scambos , Jr. v. U.S. Department of Justice on October 19 .
Their decision has not yet been made public .
If Scambos prevails , it will be the first time the high court has heard open arguments from a classic tax rebel .
It will be a dramatic moment in history that the mainstream media will be compelled to cover .
It requires the approval of four justices for the case to be heard .
A possible vote for approval is Justice Clarence Thomas , who also has called for hearing challenges to President Obama ’s constitutional qualifications for office on grounds he was born in Africa , not Hawaii .
The fearful court refused to accept that challenge .
If the other self - proclaimed “ conservatives ” vote according to the views they voice , the case will be heard .
They are : Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito .
Scambos has petitioned for a writ of certiorari , which asks the high court to take his case from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and directly hear his appeal .
Of his numerous challenges to lower court dismissals of cases by tax rebels , Scambos attacked the rejection of constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment ’s prohibition against compelling a citizen to be a “ witness against himself . ”
Courts have long agreed that this includes surrendering personal documents .
In 1886 , his petition says , “ the question of Fifth Amendment protection for the books , records and personal documents of a witness who may be implicated in a crime was first considered in Boyd v. United States , where the Supreme Court expanded Fifth Amendment protection against compulsory testimony to include the books and records of the witness . ”
The court said : “ Any compulsory discovery by extorting the party ’s oath , or compelling the production of his private books and papers , to convict him of a crime , or to forfeit his property , is contrary to the principles of a free government .
It is abhorrent to the instincts of an Englishman ; it is abhorrent to the instincts of an American .
It may suit the purposes of a despotic power , but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of political liberty and personal freedom . ”
The court further said : “ And we are further of the opinion that a compulsory production of the private books and papers of the owner of goods sought to be forfeited in such a suit is compelling him to be a witness against himself , within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment .
[ It ] is the equivalent of a search and seizure — and an unreasonable search and seizure — within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . ”
AFP correspondent James P. Tucker Jr. is a veteran journalist who spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .

( This summary includes my argument , a method for judging the outcome of this bet and some other thoughts on how to measure awareness ... )
A. MY PERSPECTIVE ...
Even if a computer passes the Turing Test it will not really be aware that it has passed the Turing Test .
Even if a computer seems to be intelligent and can answer most questions as well as an intelligent , self - aware , human being , it will not really have a continuum of awareness , it will not really be aware of what it seems to " think " or " know , " it will not have any experience of it's own reality or being .
It will be nothing more than a fancy inanimate object , a clever machine , it will not be a truly sentient being .
Self - awareness is not the same thing as merely answering questions intelligently .
Therefore even if you ask a computer if it is self - aware and it answers that it is self - aware and that it has passed the Turing Test , it will not really be self - aware or really know that it has passed the Turing Test .
As John Searle and others have pointed out , the Turing Test does not actually measure awareness , it just measures information processing --- particularly the ability to follow rules or at least imitate a particular style of communication .
In particular it measures the ability of a computer program to imitate humanlike dialogue , which is different than measuring awareness itself .
Thus even if we succeed in creating good AI , we wo n't necessarily succeed in creating AA ( " Artificial Awareness " ) .
But why does this matter ?
Because ultimately , real awareness may be necessary to making an AI that is as intelligent as a human sentient being .
However , since AA is theoretically impossible in my opinion , truly self - aware AI will never be created and thus no AI will ever be as intelligent as a human sentient being even if it manages to fool someone into thinking it is ( and thus passing the Turing Test ) .
In my opinion , awareness is not an information process at all and will never be simulated or synthesized by any information process .
Awareness cannot be measured by an information processing system , it can only be measured by awareness itself --- something no formal information processing system can ever simulate or synthesize .
One might ask how it is that a human has awareness then ?
My answer is that awareness does not arise from the body or the brain , nor does it arise from any physical cause .
Awareness is not in the body or the brain , but rather the body and the brain are in awareness .
The situation is analagous to a dream , a simulation or virtual reality , such as that portrayed in the popular film " The Matrix . "
We exist in the ultimate virtual reality .
The medium of this virtual reality is awareness .
That is to say that whatever appears to be happening " out there " or " within the mind " is happening within a unified , nondualistic field of awareness : both the " subject " and the " object " exist equally within this field and neither is the source of awareness .
This is similar to the case where we project ourselves as dream protagonists in our own dreams --- even though our dream bodies appear to be different than other dream - images they are really equally dream appearances , they are no more fundamental than dream - objects .
We identify with our dream - bodies out of habit and because it 's practical because the stories that take place appear from the perspective of particular bodies .
But just because this virtual reality is structured as if awareness is coming from within our heads , it does not mean that is actually the case .
In fact , quite the opposite is taking place .
Awareness is not actually " in " the VR , the VR is " in " awareness .
Things are exactly the opposite of how they appear .
Of course this is just an analogy --- for example , unlike the Matrix , the virtual reality we live in is not running on some giant computer somewhere and there is no other hidden force controlling it from behind the scenes .
Awareness is the fabric of reality and there is nothing deeper , nothing creating it , it is not running on some cosmic computer , it comes out of of nowhere yet everything else comes out of it .
If we look for awareness we can't find anything to grasp , it is empty yet not a mere nothingness , it is an emptiness that is awake , creative , alert , radiant , self - realizing .
Awareness is empty and fundamental like space , but it goes beyond space for it is also lucid .
If we look for space we do n't find anything there .
Nobody has ever touched or grasped space directly !
But unlike space , awareness can at least be measured directly -- it can measure itself , it knows its own nature .
Awareness is simply fundamental , a given , the underlying meta-reality in which everything appears .
How did it come to be ?
That is unanswerable .
What is it ?
That is unanswerable as well .
But there is no doubt that awareness is taking place .
Each sentient being has a direct and intimate experience of their own self - awareness .
Each of us experiences a virtual reality in which we and our world are projections .
That which both projects these projections and experiences them is awareness .
This is like saying that the VR inherently knows its own content .
But in my opinion this knowing comes from outside the system , not from some construct that we can create inside it .
So any awareness that arises comes from the transcendental nature of reality itself , not from our bodies , minds , or any physical system within a particular reality .
So is there one cosmic awareness out there that we are all a part of ?
Not exactly , there is not one awareness nor are there many awarenesses because awareness is not a physical thing and cannot be limited by such logical materialist extremes .
After all if it is not graspable how can we say it is one or many or any other logical combination of one or many ?
All we can say is that we are it , whatever it is , and that we can not explain it further .
In being awareness , we are all equal , but we are clearly not the same .
We are different projections and on a relative level we are each unique , even though on an ultimate level perhaps we are also unified by being projections within the same underlying continuum .
Yet this continuum is fundamentally empty , impossible to locate or limit , and infinitely beyond the confines of any formal system or universe , so it cannot really be called a " thing " and thus we are not " many " or " one " in actuality , what we really are is totally beyond such dualistic distinctions .
Awareness is like space or reality , something so fundamental , so axiomatic , that it is impossible to prove , grasp or describe from " inside " the system using the formal logical tools of the system .
Since nothing is beyond awareness , there is no outside , no way to ever gain a perspective on awareness that is not mediated by awareness itself .
Therefore there is no way to reduce awareness to anything deeper ; there is no way to find anything more fundamental than awareness .
But despite this awareness can be directly experienced , at least by itself .
That which is aware is self - aware .
Self - awareness is the very nature of awareness .
The self - awareness of awareness does not come from something else , it is inherent to awareness itself .
Only awareness is capable of awareness .
Nothing that is not aware can ever become aware .
This means awareness is truly fundamental , it has always been present everywhere .
Awareness is inherent in the universe as the very basis of everything , it is not something anyone can synthesize and we cannot build a machine that can suddenly experience awareness .
Only beings who are aware already can ever experience awareness .
The fact that we are aware now means that we were always aware , even before we were born !
Otherwise we never could have become aware in the first place !
Each of us " is " awareness .
The experience of being aware is unique and undeniable .
It has its own particular nature , but this cannot be expressed it can only be known directly .
There is no sentient being that is not aware .
Furthermore , it would be a logical contradiction to claim that " I am not aware that I am aware " or " that I am aware that I am not aware " and thus if anyone claims they are not aware or have ever experienced , or can even imagine , there not being awareness they are lying .
There is nobody who does not experience their own awareness , even if they do n't recognize or admit that they experience it .
The experience of being self - aware is the unique experience of " being " --- an experience so basic that it is indescribable in terms of anything else --- something that no synthetic computer will ever have .
Eventually , it will be proved that no formal information processing system is capable of self - awareness and that thus formal computers cannot be self - aware in principle .
This proof will use the abstract self - referential structure of self - awareness to establish that no formal computer can ever be self - aware .
Simply put , computers and computer programs cannot be truly self - referential : they always must refer to something else --- there must at least be a set of fixed meta-rules that are not self - referential for a computer or program to work .
Awareness is not like this however , awareness is perfectly self - referential without referring to anything else .
The question will then arise as to what self - awareness is and how it is possible .
We will eventually conclude that systems that are self - aware are not formal systems and that awareness must be at least as fundamental as , or more fundamental than , space , time and energy .
Currently most scientists and non-scientists consider the physical world to be outside of awareness and independent of it .
But considering that nobody has or will ever experience anything without awareness it is illogical to assume that anything is really outside of awareness .
It is actually far more rational to assume that whatever arises or is experienced is inside awareness , and that nothing is outside of awareness .
This assumption of everything being within awareness would actually be a more scientific , observation - based conclusion than the opposite assumption which is entirely unfounded on anything we have ever or will ever be able to observe .
After all , we have never observed anything apart from awareness have we ?
Thus contrary to current beliefs , the onus is on scientists to prove that anything is outside of awareness , not the other way around !
Awareness is quite simply the ultimate primordial basic nature of reality itself --- without awareness there could be no " objective reality " at all and no " subjective beings " to experience it .
Awareness is completely transcendental , beyond all limitations and boundaries , outside of all possible systems .
What hubris to think we can simply manufacture , or evolve , awareness with a pile of electrified silicon hardware and some software rules .
No matter how powerful the computer , no matter what it is made of , and no matter how sophisticated or emergent the software is , it will still never be aware or evolve awareness .
No computer or machine intelligence will ever be aware .
Even a quantum computer --- if it is equivalent to a finite non-quantum computer at least --- will not be capable of awareness , and even if it is a transinfinite computer I still have my doubts that it could ever be aware .
Awareness is simply not an information process .
B. METHOD OF JUDGING THIS BET ...
So the question ultimately is , how do we measure awareness or at least determine whether a computer is or is not aware ?
How can we judge the outcome of this bet ?
I propose a method here : we let the bettors mutually agree on a judge .
If the judge is a computer , fine .
If the judge is a human , fine .
But both bettors must agree on the judge .
If both bettors accept that party as the judge then the result will be deemed final and reliable .
If a computer is chosen by both parties to judge this , then I will concede defeat --- but it would take a lot for any computer to convince me that it is aware and thus qualified to judge this competition .
On the other hand , my opponent in this debate may accept a human judge --- but obviously since they believe that computers can be aware if they accept a human judge they would be contradicting their own assertion --- if a computer is really intelligent and aware why would they choose a human judge over a computer judge ?
This " recursive " judge - selection judging approach appeals to our inherent direct human experience of awareness and the fact that we trust another aware sentient being more than an inaminate machine to judge whether or not something is aware .
This may be the only practical solution to this problem :
If both parties agree that a computer can judge and the computer says the other computer is aware , then so be it !
If both parties agree that a human can judge and the human says that the computer is not aware , so be it !
May the best judge win !
Now , as long as we 're on the subject , how do we know that other humans , such as our potential human judge (s ) , are actually aware ?
I actually believe that self - awareness is detectable by other beings that are also aware , but not detectable by computers that are not aware .
C. A REVERSE TURING TEST FOR DETECTING AWARENESS IN A COMPUTER ...
I propose a reversal of the Turing test for determining whether a computer is aware ( and forgive me in advance if anyone else has already proposed this somewhere , I would be happy to give them credit ) .
Here is the test : Something is aware if whenever it is presented with a case where a human being and a synthetic machine intelligence are equally intelligent and capable of expression and interaction BUT not equally aware ( the human is aware and the machine is not actually aware ) , then it can reliably and accurately figure out that the human being is really aware and the machine is not really aware .
I believe that only systems that are actually aware can correctly differentiate between two equally intelligent entities where one is sentient and the other just a simulation of sentience , given enough time and experience with those systems .
How can such a differentiation be made ?
Assuming the human and computer candidates are equally intelligent and interactive , what is the signature of awareness or lack of awareness ?
What difference is there that can be measured ?
In my opinion there is a particular , yet indescribable mutual recognition that takes place when I encounter another sentient being .
I recognize their self - awareness with my own self - awareness .
Think of it as the equivalent of a " network handshake " that occurs at a fundamental level between entities that are actually aware .
How is this recognition possible ?
Perhaps it is due to the fact that awareness , being inherently self - aware , is also inherently capable of recognizing awareness when it encounters it .
On another front , I actually have my doubts that any AI will ever be equally intelligent and interactive as a human sentient being .
In particular I think this is not merely a matter of the difficulty of building such a complex computer , but rather it is a fundamental difference between machine cognition and the congition of a sentient being .
A human sentient being 's mind transcends computation .
Sentient cognition transcends the limits of formal computation , it is not equivalent to Turing Machine , it is much more powerful than that .
We humans are not formal systems , we are not Turing Machines .
Humans can think in a way that no computer will ever be able to match let alone imitate convincingly .
We are able to transcend our own logics , our own belief systems , our own programs , we are able to enter and break out of loops at will , we are able to know inifinities , to do completely irrational , spontaneous and creative things .
We are much closer to infinity than any finite state automaton can ever be .
We are simply not computers , although we can sometimes think like them they cannot really think like us .
In any case , this may be " faith " but for now at least I am quite certain that I am aware and that other humans and animals are also aware but that machines , plants and other inanimate objects are not aware .
I am certain that my awareness vastly transcends any machine intelligence that exists or ever will exist .
I am certain that your awareness is just as transcendent as mine .
Although I cannot prove that I am aware or that you are aware to you I am willing to state such on the basis of my own direct experience and I know that if you take a moment to meditate on your own self - awareness you will agree .
After all , we cannot prove the existence of space or time either --- these are just ideas and even physics has not explained their origins nor can anyone even detect them directly , yet we both believe they exist , do n't we ?
Now if I claimed that a suitably complex computer simulation would someday suddenly contain real physical space and time that was indistinguishable in any way from the physical space and time outside the simulation --- you would probably disagree .
You would say that the only " real " space - time is actually not in the computer but containing the computer , and any space - time that appears within the computer simulation is but a mere lower - order imitation and nothing like the real space - time that contains the computer .
No simulation can ever be exactly the same as what it simulates , even if it is functionally similar or equivalent , for several reasons .
On a purely information basis , it should be obvious that if simulation B is within something else called A , then for B to be exactly the same as A it must contain A and B and so on infinitely .
At least if there is a finite amount of space and time to work with we simply cannot build anything like this , we cannot build a simulation that contains an exact simulation of itself without getting into an infinite regression .
Beyond this , there is a difference in medium :
In the case of machine intelligence the medium is physical space , time and energy --- that is what machine intelligence is made of .
In the case of human awareness the medium is awareness itself , something at least as fundamental as space - time - energy if not more fundamental .
Although human sentience can perform intelligent cognition , using a brain for example , it is not a computer and it is not made of space - time - energy .
Human sentience goes beyond the limits of space - time - energy and therefore beyond computers .
If someone builds a Turing Machine that simulates a Turing Machine simulating a Turing Machine , the simulation will never even start , let alone be useable !
As the saying goes , it 's Turtles All The Way Down !
If you have a finite space and time , but an infinite initial condition , it takes forever to simply set up the simulation let alone to compute it .
This is the case with self - awareness as well :
It is truly self - referential .
No finite formal system can complete an infinitely self - referential process in finite time .
We sentient beings can do this however .
Whenever we realize our own awareness direclty --- that is whenever we ARE aware ( as opposed to just representing this fact as a thought ) we are being infinitely self - referential in finite time .
That must mean we are either able to do an infinite amount of computing in a finite amount of time , or we are not computing at all .
Perhaps self - awareness just happens instantly and inherently rather than iteratively .
On a practical level as well we can see that there is a differnece between a simulated experience within a simulation and the actual reality it attempts to simulate that exists outside the simulation .
For example , suppose I make a computer simulation of chocolate and a simulated person who can eat the chocolate .
Even though that simulated person tastes the simulated chocolate , they do not really taste chocolate at all --- they have no actual experience of what chocolate really tastes like to beings in reality ( beings outside the simulation ) .
Even if there are an infinite number of levels of simulation above the virtual reality we are in now , awareness is always ultimately beyond them all --- it is the ultimate highest - level of reality , there is nothing beyond it .
Thus even an infinitely high - end computer simulation of awareness will be nothing like actual awareness and will not convince a truly aware being that it is actually aware .

I will update and refine my argument from time - time as needed if that is possible via this site in the future .
The battle for iPhone customers in the UK will be fought on the strength of the operators ' networks this Christmas , after Orange announced the official launch date and tariffs .
Yet analysts believe a price war is set to be unleashed next year .
Orange announced yesterday that the much - anticipated launch date of its iPhone in the UK will be next Tuesday .
This breaks the two - year exclusivity held by rival O2 , which has sold more than one million handsets .
The iPhone 3G will start at £ 30 a month , when customers sign up for a two - year contract , with the handset free .
A 3GS , which is twice as fast and has longer battery life , will come free on £ 45 plans with a 24 - month contract .
The device will be sold for £ 184.50 at £ 29.36 a month on an - 18 month contract .
O2 offers almost the same deal .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Orange will also offer a " high - end traveller " deal , with an all - inclusive roaming and data allowance at £ 125 a month .
There is a pay - as - you - go deal , with customers who top up by £ 50 able to get their hands on an iPhone for £ 333 .
While the expected Christmas price battle has proved a damp squib , Will Draper , analyst at Execution , thinks it is just round the corner .
" France Telecom will keep prices high in the run-up to Christmas to ensure they capture premium subscribers who were starved of the iPhone but were loyal to Orange , " he said .
" When Vodafone joins the market the gloves will come off . "
Vodafone secured a deal to also sell the iPhone on the day that Orange announced that it had broken O2's stranglehold on the device in the UK .
This marks a threat to O2's position as the biggest network operator in the UK .
It is especially under pressure as Orange has agreed a merger with T - Mobile UK , which will put it well out in front in the market .
Tom Alexander , chief executive of Orange , said : " The excitement for the iPhone is immense , " adding : " We have seem more than a quarter of a million customers register their interest on our website . "
Those 250,000 who pre-registered will be at the front of the queue , and will be able to take delivery of the phone when it is released next Tuesday .
Mr Alexander reiterated previous statements that the battle with O2 in the run-up to Christmas will be on the strength of the group 's 3G network .
He said Orange would match its customers ' enthusiasm " with a 3G mobile broadband network that covers more people in the UK than any other operator " .
He added : " Earlier this year we stated our ambition to become the destination brand of choice for high - end mobile users in the UK .
With the launch of the iPhone on November 10 we 're pleased to be fulfilling that ambition . "
Mr Draper said : " O2 has received some criticism for not investing adequately in its network to keep up with iPhone usage and a chunk of O2 customers will probably move over to Orange .
However , must customers do n't really care about the network .
Mainly they are happy as long as they can make a call and get their data in reasonable time . "
Orange now offers the phone in 28 countries and territories .
In the UK it will sell the device through its retail network of 402 stores and online , as well as through the Apple store , Carphone Warehouse and Phones4U .
Carphone Warehouse said yesterday it expects to sell one million handsets in total by Christmas , and following Orange 's launch .
The retailer , which has 820 stores across the UK , was the only independent retailer to sell the O2 iPhone .
Andrew Harrison , chief executive of Carphone Warehouse , called the iPhone a " phenomenal " handset .
If you ever bring up the fact that Ben Roethlisberger is a great NFL quarterback , the haters come flying out of the woodwork .
The guy does n’t get credit for winning every regular season game he started as a rookie from those who called him a “ game manager , ” so he responded by winning the Super Bowl the next year .
People hated on his post - Super Bowl XL season , so he responded with his best statistical season to date .
The bile flew after his terrible stats in XL , so he shut everyone up with a fantastic performance in XLIII .
But that ’s never enough for non-Steelers fans .
He did it because of his team , not his abilities .
Because all the Steelers teams of the 90s and early 2000s with fantastic defenses and amazing running games won so many Super Bowls behind mediocre QBs .
That ’s usually the case against Big Ben , that the run game and defense inflates his actual performance .
If this is the case , then why did n’t we just stock up on Lombardi Trophies with Neil O’Donnell , Mike Tomczak , Kent Graham and Kordell Stewart ( who has the same number of Pro Bowl selections as Ben ) ?
If people keep hating , then the must be right ?
Right ?
So we should just scrap the guy who finally got a good team over the hump .
We should lose the franchise QB who has as many rings as the entire Manning family combined .
And we should sign John Legend ’s kid .
You probably saw that Legend and his son were at Steelers camp ( here , here and here ) , and now we have video of the kid ’s skills .
That ’s actually a pretty nice throw , and is sure to make the Ben-haters wet their pants at his impeccable form .
LOOK …he ’s planted his feet when he throws , he must be an elite QB !
Ben could learn from him !
If we ’re trying to avoid off - field distractions , then we should cut Big Ben and his assaulting , mediocre - quarterbacking self and give money to an unproven , but highly - skilled prospect like little Legend .
You need star power and a three - step drop to win games , and not what Ben brings .
As rounds of golf go , it was more Caddyshack than Sunday at Augusta .
Four guys .
Twenty - eight beers .
A bottle of tequila and " some " weed .
" Power slides " in the cart , which may or may not have flipped over .
But who can remember ?
At the ninth hole , the foursome ran out of booze and bought more .
Someone ran out to the parking lot to fetch tequila .
But according to a Nova Scotia Superior Court judge , things did n't really run off the rails until Travis Hayter shanked one off the tee on the 15th .
That prompted Hayter to plant a couple more balls and take a couple more whacks .
On the third shot , Hayter took a running start – the sort Adam Sandler made infamous in Happy Gilmore – and gave it a great wallop .
Unfortunately , his bachelor party mates , including Alan Bezanson , cousin of the groom , were standing right in front of him .
Hayter 's ball struck Bezanson hard , ricocheting off his wrist and into his chest .
Bezanson dropped like a sack , yowling in pain .
He still managed to attend the wedding .
That was in 2002 .
Bezanson , a logger , has n't worked since .
Despite surgery , his wrist , the judge noted , may never fully heal .
Hayter 's defence rested in large part on his wretchedness as a golf player .
He noted in his defence that Bezanson 's thwacking with a close - range missile was " part of the natural risk of golfing . "
Justice Arthur J. LeBlanc , whose own golfing prowess goes unnoted , did n't buy that .
After years of legal wrangling , he has awarded Bezanson $ 227,500 in damages .
The judge noted the mitigating effects of alcohol but took particular aim at the swing .
" I am convinced that the ' Happy Gilmore ' shot would have been less controllable than a normal tee shot , " LeBlanc wrote in his decision .
While the judge 's decision does not preclude idiocy during the commission of golf , it does raise the question of whether the Happy Gilmore shot is an imminent danger to others , whether done with a snootful of beer or not .
" I do n't know if ( golf manufacturer ) TaylorMade 's ever done a study on that , " Jeff Thompson , Chief Sport Development Officer at Oakville 's Royal Canadian Golf Association , wondered .
Thompson said he 's never tried the Happy Gilmore , never even seen someone try it .
He would n't completely damn the shot – " I mean , if you 're by yourself and there 's no one anywhere near you " – but he would n't endorse its propulsive aspects either .
" I can see why people would think they'd get more distance , since they have momentum going into the ball , " Thompson said .
" But there are other factors .
It 's a lot harder to hit a target while running , for instance . "
Not , apparently , for Travis Hayter .

From the peak in Dec. 2007 through to FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s tally , total hours worked have declined by a cumulative - 8.6 % compared to a - 5.2 % drop in the total number of jobs over this same period .
Disposable income and the lack of it will not be able to drag us out of this recession any time soon .
Both the public and private sectors lost jobs , with private down - 210 k and government dropping - 53 k .
Other sub - categories show that wages rose only +0.1 % which is a renewed slow down from the +0.3 - 0.4 % gains over the previous 2 - months .
So fewer hours worked and flat wages spells further set - backs !
The revisions were rather insignificant .
It was the larger than expected decline in the labor force ( - 571k ) that led to a small change in the unemployment print ( +9.8 % vs. +9.7 % ) .
Over 90 % of the job cuts were full - time employment , while part - time fell by a more modest - 90 k .
Disappointingly , the average duration of unemployment shot up to +26.2 weeks , a new record high !
Not to be outdone , US factory orders also dropped .
Both the headline and core orders were weaker than expected .
Its analystÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s belief that continued Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdisinvestmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in inventories will cause problems to the 3rd Q GDP growth .
Total factory orders plummeted - 0.8 % , m / m , after 4 - consecutive months of growth .
This has basically occurred on the back of a - 3 % decline in durable goods orders , while non-durable goods orders have advanced .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s noticeable that factories continue to try and eliminate inventories .
Economists believe that this Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdisinvestmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ will remain , as the inventory - to - shipments ratio is 1.38 ( high ) .
Perhaps Roubini is correct , both equities and commodity prices have risen Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtoo far and too fastÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and on little substance .
The pace of Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœthisÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ recovery has to be disappointing and over inflated !
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.04 % and higher against the CHF - 0.07 % , GBP - 0.07 % and JPY - 0.06 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.17 % and AUD + 0.54 % .
The loonie was dragged higher by dayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s end on Friday , not due to its own fundamentals .
They have been mixed over the last few weeks , but , because of its largest neighbors weaker than expected employment report .
Commodity prices have held their own and by default will always aid the loonie .
Global equities tethering this morning could put some pressure on the currency .
This week , we get to see the employment situation in Canada on Friday .
For now , expect dealers to be better buyers of USD on pull backs .
With the G7 stopping short from criticizing the US dollar has given higher yielding currencies like the AUD some support .
In the O/N session , the currency has managed to appreciate for the 1st time in 3 - days .
FI dealers are pricing in a 30 % chance of + 25 bps hike from the RBA this evening after hawkish remarks from various financial editors down under ( 0.8739 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 69.60 down - 30 c ) .
Not much of a surprise to most of us that crude has remained in a tight range after weaker than expected US manufacturing and employment data last week implying that the US economy could stall .
It has been prudent for investors to book some profits after reaching once again technical resistance with a $ 70 handle .
All of this has occurred despite last weeks EIA report recording a large gas drawdown .
The report revealed a - 1.6 m barrel drop in gas inventories , inline with the API print , but against analysts ’ expectations of an increase .
Over the past month , US gas demand is up +5 % and this after the end of the holiday driving season !
On the flip side , crude inventories happened to increase by +2.8 m barrels , w/w , vs. expectations of a +600 k rise .
Demand destruction remains , as the increase in distillate inventories was smaller than expected and posted monthly demand down - 9 % from this time last year .
In fact , a closer look tells us that the report remains mixed with a bias towards oil products , like heating oil and diesel , to remain weak .
With energy fundamentals remaining unconvincing , it would be a safe bet that the black stuff should be confined to its $ 10 range of $ 65 - $ 75 .
We can never rule out the political influence .
The threat of imposing greater sanction on Iran because of its nuclear program has heightened geo-political issues over the last few weeks .
Technically oil prices are inflated , they are not supported by market fundamentals , but geo-politics will always keep the black - stuffs prices artificially higher .
Gold rebounded on Friday after NFP data put pressure on the greenback .
By default , this encouraged investors to purchase the yellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s as an alternative investment .
Geo-political tensions in the Middle East continue to provide support on deeper pullbacks ( $ 1,006 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 9,674 down - 57 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,479 up +11 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,994 up + 6 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 2 bp on Friday ( 3.21 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
The US yield curve managed to close the week near their lowest yields in 5 - months .
It seems that investors are starting to become disenchanted with the employment , manufacturing and housing reports in aiding a faster recovery from the worst recession in 50 - years .
Common sense seems to be questioning the speed of the recovery .
This week we will have a refunding concern , China , the largest supporter of US treasuries is technically on holidays for 2 of the 3 auctions ( 3Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s and 7Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ) .
It will be interesting times for the dealers who may be able to cheapen up the curve more aggressively than recently .
On the flip side , the world covets yield !

A judge in the Republic of Ireland was accidentally shot in the face by a solicitor who was trying to demonstrate that an air pistol was harmless .
Judge John Neilan was hearing a family law case in Longford District Court when he was shot , it emerged yesterday .
The judge , who is never lost for words , did n't want to comment on the matter yesterday .
Ironically , the lawyer was trying to demonstrate to Judge John Neilan that the weapon was not dangerous when it accidentally discharged and fired a pellet in his direction .
It happened during a family law hearing in Longford District Court on Tuesday .
The judge was not seriously injured in the incident and it is understood that he continued hearing the case and proceedings went ahead as normal .
Yesterday , the judge had no marks on his face as he presided over Mullingar District Court in Co Westmeath .
When asked about the matter before he entered the court house yesterday afternoon , the judge said : " I do n't want to make a comment . "
Gardai said there were " absolutely no records " of the incident .
There were only a handful of witnesses when the judge was accidentally shot as all family law matters are held in camera .
In cases like this , restrictions are in place as to who can attend the court as they involve sensitive domestic issues .
No media or gardai were present for the case on Tuesday .
Normally , in criminal cases , an exhibits officer is appointed by gardai to present evidence in the courtroom .
However , on this occasion , the matter was a civil one and it would be the responsibility of the solicitor in court to ensure the evidence was secure .
Judge Neilan has never been far from the limelight over the years .
He questioned the " obscene " salaries of top bankers and attacked the sector for losing the run of themselves in July .
The outspoken judge lambasted the banks for handing out money " in fistfuls " during the boom .
He also said the people who ran the sector had less common sense than a " dog in the street " .
And last year , he caused uproar when he branded Court Service staff as " lazy " and " totally incompetent " after they complained about working after 5 pm .
He said he was " sick and tired and fed up " with the Court Service from the top down .
He described the system as a " shambles " and said those involved were " totally incompetent " as far as he was concerned .
Last December , ahead of changes to the district in which he presides , the judge apologised to " anyone and everybody " he may have " wittingly or unwittingly offended " .
He has also had words with high - ranking gardai in his courtroom .
The judge threatened to jail a senior garda inspector for one week on June 2 , 2008 , after he accused him of " laughing " in court .
He claimed he saw Inspector Paul Cuttle laughing after he branded a remand hearing for a man charged with murder as a " PR exercise " when gardai failed to produce a book of evidence .
In 2004 , he declared he would immediately jail for one week all those guilty of drink driving while considering a sufficient penalty .
After former Justice Minister Michael McDowell pointed out the constitutional right to bail , the judge said he was withdrawing from hearing drink - driving cases for six months .
Work at the judge 's court resumed but he continued to have a tense relationship with Mr McDowell .
When asked if he would join the then minister in opening the newly refurbished Longford courthouse , he said : " I would n't share the platform with him if he was opening the gates of heaven . "

Mininova , the largest torrent site on the Internet , has removed all torrents except those that were uploaded through its content distribution service .
Mininova 's founders took the drastic decision after they lost a civil dispute against Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN , and were ordered to remove all infringing torrents from the site .
Mininova ’s decision to delete all infringing torrents from its index marks the end of an era that started five years ago .
In December 2004 , the demise of the mighty Suprnova left a meteor crater in the fledgling BitTorrent landscape .
This gaping hole was soon filled by the dozens of new sites that emerged to fulfil the public ’s increasing demands for torrents .
Mininova became the most successful of all .
Mininova was founded in early 2005 by five Dutch students , just a month after Suprnova closed its doors .
The site started out as a hobby project created by tech - savvy teenagers , but in the years that followed the site ’s founders managed to turn it into a successful business that generated millions of dollars in revenue .
With increased popularity also came numerous complaints from copyright holders , who saw their intellectual property being shared by users of the site .
For years Mininova has complied with these takedown requests , but earlier this year the Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN decided to take the torrent site to court nonetheless , demanding that the operators proactively filter torrents pointing to copyrighted material .
The case went to court in June and a few weeks later the verdict was announced .
The judge ruled that Mininova is not directly responsible for any copyright infringements , but ordered it to remove all torrents linking to copyrighted material within three months , or face a penalty of up to 5 million euros .
To avoid having to pay these penalties , the Mininova team saw no other option than to disable access to all torrents except those that were uploaded to their content distribution platform .
This means that only approved uploaders can share torrents through the site for now .
During the last few months , Mininova has extensively tested several filtering techniques , but none of these proved 100 % effective .
“ It ’s very unfortunate that we ’re forced to take this action , but we saw no other option , ” Mininova co-founder Niek told TorrentFreak .
Mininova still has n’t decided yet whether they will appeal the verdict , Niek further told TorrentFreak .
They have appealed the verdict pro-forma , which gives the company more time to decide whether they will indeed continue with the appeal .
As it looks now , a successful appeal is the only option for Mininova to bring all torrents back .
In the meantime the Mininova team will focus on other projects besides Mininova , as well as growing the number of users for their content distribution platform .
The implications of Mininova ’s decision will have a huge impact on the BitTorrent community .
The millions of Mininova users and uploaders have to look for a new home , but perhaps even more importantly , Mininova had the largest collection of user - submitted torrents that were used by dozens of smaller torrent indexers .
More information on the consequences and background of Mininova ’s decision will be addressed in a follow up article .

GOP Rep : Health Care Reform Bigger Threat To US Than A Terrorist
Representative Virginia
Foxx spoke about the Democratic health care proposal , saying " we have more to fear from the potential of that bill passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country . "
The wikipedia article on operations research needs help .
Let ’s see how it begins ( as of today : it might change any moment now , given the way wikipedia works ) :
Operations research ( N America ) or Operational research ( UK / Europe ) “ is a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control . ” [ 1 ]
Other names for it include : Operational analysis ( UK Ministry of Defence from 1962 ) [ 2 ]
Quantitative management [ 3 ]
“ The historical development of Operational Research ( OR ) is traditionally seen as the succession of several phases : the “ heroic times ” of the Second World War , the “ Golden Age ” between the fifties and the sixties during which major theoretical achievements were accompanied by a widespread diffusion of OR techniques in private and public organisations , a “ crisis ” followed by a “ decline ” starting with the late sixties , a phase during which OR groups in firms progressively disappeared while academia became less and less concerned with the applicability of the techniques developed . ” [ 4 ] .
In the current phase , the increase in computing power coupled with the birth of related techniques like business intelligence ( BI ) and business analytics are leading a resurgence of OR . [ 5 ]
Oh great , we get a 1947 definition of operations research , as quoted on a 1954 dustcover .
It is synonymous with “ Quantitative Management ” based on a single South African department brochure .
It ’s main interest is historical , though it might be resurging .
By the way , it is the Canadian Operational Research Society and the Mexican Institute of Systems and Operational Research , so even the statement on where the various terms are used is incorrect .
And “ UK / Europe ” ?
Wikipedia suggests there is a certain redundancy there .
After that , it is 2/3 history and 1/3 lists .
This is not the way to introduce people to our field !
I have fought this fight before , and lost .
So I do things like the INFORMS Resources Page ( for at least a bit longer ) , this blog with its lists of other OR blogs , my twitter account , OR - Exchange ( for questions and answers , and maybe announcements in OR ) , and other things to make the successes of our field better known ( and maybe show an illustrative failure or two ) .
I ’m not willing to add wikipedia to my list .
Fortunately , others are willing to do so .
Siamak Faridani posted a question on OR - Exchange asking how to improve the wikipedia article .
OR articles on Wikipedia obviously need some attention .
My question is how can we join forces to improve these articles ?
I have made a project page on Wikipedia there is a “ To do list ” on that page in which you can insert the articles that need attention and request new articles .
If you would like to help in edits you can also add your user name to the list of contributors and we will ask for your inputs as we work on articles .
Even if you do not like to edit Wikipedia articles please consider helping with populating the to do list and I will try to work on those articles as much as possible
By its nature , the wikipedia article cannot be the responsibility of one person .
If you are looking for ways to help the field , I highly recommend ( for you , not for me ! ) spending some time improving the articles on operations research and related topics , either on your own or in conjunction with Siamak .

That ’s what Verizon are offering with the Motorola Droid , and the carrier has kicked off a major pre-launch campaign setting the iPhone firmly in its sights .
Verizon ’s teaser , DroidDoes.com , kicks off with a string of Apple - baiting statements about the iPhone , mimicking the Cupertino company ’s own ad style ( you can see them in the video below ) .
“ iDo n’t customize ” , “ iDo n’t have a real keyboard ” and “ iDo n’t allow open development ” are all mentioned , before the site kicks into a countdown page – already decoded to suggest the Motorola Droid might arrive on October 30th – which lists off some of the expected features of the Android 2.0 smartphone .
Those include , as we ’ve previously heard of the Motorola Sholes , a high - resolution display , hardware keyboard , 5 - megapixel camera , navigation , Android 2.0 as the OS and more .
The handset is also tipped to use the same TI OMAP3430 chipset as the iPhone 3GS and Palm Pre , which should make it faster than the rest of the Android competition .
Check out what ’s tipped to be a boot - up screen of the Verizon Droid in action here .

1983 : Fred Cohen , a University of Southern California graduate student , gives a prescient peek at the digital future when he demonstrates a computer virus during a security seminar at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania .
A quarter - century later , computer viruses have become a pandemic for which there 's no inoculation .
Cohen inserted his proof - of - concept code into a Unix command , and within five minutes of launching it onto a mainframe computer , had gained control of the system .
In four other demonstrations , the code managed to seize control within half an hour on average , bypassing all of the security mechanisms current at the time .
It was Cohen 's academic adviser , Len Adleman ( the A in RSA Security ) , who likened the self - replicating program to a virus , thus coining the term .
But Cohen 's malware was n't the first of its kind .
Others had theorized about self - replicating programs that could spread from computer to computer , and a couple of tinkerers had already successfully launched their own digital infections prior to Cohen 's presentation .
But his proof - of - concept program put computer scientists on notice about the potential scourge of an intentionally malicious attack .
A 15 - year - old kid from Pennsylvania was one programmer who beat Cohen to the draw .
Rich Skrenta had a penchant for playing jokes on friends by spiking Apple II gaming programs with trick code that would shut down their computers or do other annoying things .
In 1982 he wrote the Elk Cloner program – a self - replicating boot - sector virus that infected Apple II computers through a floppy disk .
Every 50th time the infected computer re-booted , a little ditty popped up :
It will get on all your disks
It will infiltrate your chips
Yes , it 's Cloner !
It will stick to you like glue
It will modify RAM too
Send in the Cloner !
Skrenta 's program was n't called a virus , since that moniker came later , nor did it spread widely outside his circle of friends .
That was left for the first virus spotted " in the wild " a couple of years later .
The " Brain " was written in 1986 by two Pakistani brothers who claimed they only intended to infect IBM PCs running bootleg copies of a heart - monitoring program they created .
The virus included a copyright notice with the brothers ' names and phone numbers so that people whose computers were infected could contact the brothers to obtain a " vaccination . "
Numerous variations of Brain followed .
Then in 1988 , Robert Tappan Morris Jr. , a Cornell University graduate student and son of a National Security Agency chief scientist , unleashed the first widely propagating worm .
Unlike viruses , which are embedded in programs and copy themselves from system to system to unleash a payload , a worm can travel on its own without a carrier program , slithering through networks , searching for any connected system to infect with clones of itself , clogging the network as it spreads .
It 's been estimated that between 5 and 10 percent of all machines connected to the internet at that time – most of them at universities or other research facilities – were hit by the worm .
Morris was the first person to be tried and convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 .
He was given three years probation and is now a professor at MIT .
The growth of viruses and worms was fairly slow after this until the mid-1990s , when the proliferation of desktop PCs and e-mail usage opened the way for large - scale infections .
Viruses that previously relied on floppy disks and the " sneakernet " to spread , could now infect millions of machines with a little clever social engineering designed to trick users into opening infected attachments .
The Melissa virus set the tone for fast - moving viruses in 1999 , reaching about 250,000 computers .
Its payload was mostly innocuous , however .
Whenever the time of day matched the date – say , 5:20 on May 20 – a quote from The Simpsons popped up on the screen .
The Love Bug struck a year later , leaving Melissa in the dust .
Also known as LoveLetter , it was crafted by a student in the Philippines , and arrived at inboxes with the subject line , " I Love You . "
When a user clicked on an e-mail attachment named LOVE - LETTER -FOR -YOU .TXT.vbs , the virus used Microsoft Outlook to send itself to everyone in the user 's address book .
It then contacted one of four web pages to download a Trojan horse designed to collect user names and passwords stored on the computer and send them to an e-mail address in the Philippines .
The virus spread more widely than any malware before it , hitting 55 million computers and infecting 2.5 to 3 million .
It was estimated to have caused $ 10 billion in damage , but the student who unleashed it escaped prosecution because the Philippines had no computer - crime law at the time .
Viruses have proliferated rapidly since then , and malware has become more sophisticated and more vicious .
The motives of malware writers have changed as well – instead of doing annoying tricks to your computer to get attention , the majority of programs sit stealthily on your computer to steal data , siphon money from online bank accounts or turn your system into a zombie for spam - spewing botnets .

( CNN ) -- Could George W. Bush or some of his top aides end up behind bars ?
George W. Bush could be investigated for the steps taken after 9/11 .
It 's extremely unlikely , but the Obama administration is taking its first steps along a path that could lead in that direction , with the investigation of Central Intelligence Agency interrogators involved in the war on terror .
" You do n't know where these things are going to end up , " former CIA agent Peter Brookes told me .
" They could go to very high levels in the government . "
The probe will focus on whether interrogators exceeded their instructions and broke the law when , for example , they choked a prisoner until he lost consciousness or threatened another one with a gun and a power drill .
There is no obvious enthusiasm in the Obama administration for second - guessing the CIA 's efforts after September 11 , 2001 to keep America safe .
President Obama has said several times he wants to " look forward , not back . "
Republicans immediately criticized the new investigation and even some Democrats said it would be unpopular .
" This is not very good politically for the administration , " said Democratic strategist James Carville .
" The public clearly does n't have much of an appetite for this . "
But Attorney General Eric
Holder said evidence of abuses was compelling enough to require it .
No one knows what other evidence will ultimately compel the administration to do .
The American Civil Liberties Union , an activist organization that campaigns against prisoner abuse , says " any investigation that truly follows the facts where they lead would inevitably lead to prosecutions of high government officials , "
Does it sound far - fetched ?
One Bush administration legal advisor , Jack Goldsmith , says his colleagues were acutely conscious that the president or his advisors could someday be investigated for the steps they took or approved after 9/11 .
And remember that Bill Clinton was impeached for just lying about sex .
Do you think George W. Bush or his top aides will end up behind bars ?
Sound off below
American politics is unpredictable , the investigation has n't even begun and it will take a long time .
My guess is that some very important people will be watching it closely .
Ah , the female form .
How lovely , how lithe , how graceful in action .
Even the most boring drudgery of boot camp PT can be made infinitely entertaining by the addition of one simple element : hot , hot women .
Is there any activity a beautiful woman ca n’t improve ?
Well , besides hemorrhoid surgery ?
We do n’t think so .
Traditionally , the term “ chick fight ” has conjured up images of yanked hair , catty fingernail attacks , and the occasional boob slippage .
Entertaining ?
Damn straight .
But exciting to watch purely for the brutality and skill ?
Christ no .
Not even a little bit .
Women have been boxing for years now , but if there ’s one thing that goes on inside a boxing ring that ’s more boring than a heavyweight boxing match , it ’s a female boxing match that does n’t involve lubricants in some way .
These days , with the skyrocketing popularity of MMA , women are starting to really come into their own in violent extreme sports .
Why has it taken so long to become popular ?
Not for lack of trying , we can tell you that much .
Dana
White still has n’t returned our calls about the lingerie vibrator death match we pitched six years ago .
3 Jennifer Howe v Tara LaRosa
If you do n’t follow what we guess is called WMMA , you probably have n’t heard of either of these fighters .
That ’s okay , neither had we until just a few days ago .
We happened to stumble across this video while searching for , um , something else .
Okay , fine , we were looking for what we like to call “ Amazon battle porn . ”
Shut up .
The fight starts out like any other lady fight , which is to say it ’s pretty goddamned boring .
Then , around the 1:40 mark , things get exponentially more interesting .
And by “ interesting ” , we obviously mean “ brutal ” .
Not , you know , “ naked ” .
The cute , french - braided and yet still undeniably frightening Jennifer Howe just starts bringing massive amounts of what experts call “ The Business ” to Tara LaRosa .
The Business , in mathematical terms , is expressed like this : ( The Pain {a} + The Noise {n} – Jibber - Jabber {x} ) * Time {t} .
To put that into perspective : one “ The Business ” is equivalent to roughly three “ I Pity the Fools ” .
The levels of The Business Howe brings to LaRosa are almost too intense to watch .
Almost .
2 Gina Carano v Laticia Persova
This fight clip is about twenty seconds long .
That ’s long enough to learn two important facts :
1 ) Gina Carano is very , very hot and 2 ) Gina Carano is an animal in the ring .
A sexy , sexy animal .
Carano ’s ground - and - pound is one of the most wicked attacks in women ’s MMA .
When she mounts poor Laticia , you can tell by her posture that things are about to reach Phillip Seymour Hoffman levels of ugly .
Also , we just noticed how refreshing it is to discuss “ mounting ” and “ ground - and - pound ” without sounding like the narrator of the most homoerotic show ever on Discovery Channel .
Oh , and a third fact that clip confirms : Steve Mazzagatti is a terrible referee .
Maybe that ’s why he refs so many women ’s MMA fights : the powers that be are hoping he ’ll try to cop a feel and end up paralyzed from the dick up .
1 Shayna Baszler v Cristiane “ Cyborg ” Santos
The first thing you ’ll notice is how fast and intense this fight is .
Cyborg Santos , who may or may not actually be a T - X prototype , goes on the attack and keeps on coming .
She comes on like a 3 am dick pill infomercial and just does n’t quit until everything is swollen and tender .
The second thing you ’ll notice is that Shayna Baszler can take a punch better than half the guys reading this article right now .
Considering the sheer force behind Cyborg ’s punches , Shayna Beszler ’s orthodontist probably now has a private jet and his own Illinois senator .
There ’s a brief interlude wherein Cyborg , in an uncharacteristic display of emotion for someone made almost entirely of titanium , knocks down Baszler and just sprints to the other side of the ring in victory .
After Mazzagatti finally calls her back down to finish the fight , things get damn near too brutal to watch .
In the final minute of round 2 , Cyborg starts dropping bombs like some kind of unmanned laser - guided … bomb … dropper ?
We ’re not good with military hardware analogies .
Anyway , it ’s bad .
Finally , almost mercifully , Shayna is backed up against the ring , just absorbing punch after punch , taking more straight , hard shots to the chin than Perez Hilton in a Vegas nightclub bathroom .
When that last right - hand hook comes in and turns out the lights , it ’s a blessing .
Shayna Baszler takes an ass - beating so hard even Ike Turner would look away in disgust .
Bonus Honorable Mention : Knobby Haired Asian Girl v Shaggy Haired Asian Girl
We do n’t know who these two fighters are .
We do n’t know where this fight takes place .
We do n’t know what the announcers are saying and , truth be told , we ’re not sure if this extremely effective maneuver was even intentional .
Was it a judo throw ?
Maybe .
Was it dumb luck ?
Probably .
Did that shaggy haired girl whip the knobby haired girl ’s face into the canvas hard enough to knock her unconscious , and then put a mean - ass arm - lock on her ?
Yes .

Chihuahua state , Mexico
Mexico 's rampant drug - related violence is making headlines , with thousands of deaths linked to the turf wars this year .
But while the focus is on urban centres like Ciudad Juarez , rural communities have also felt the effects first hand .
Abraham Peters is increasingly worried for his family 's future " They have murdered Mennonite people the drug - traffickers , " says Abraham Peters , a 66 - year - old retired rancher , who hails from the Protestant Mennonite sect in the agricultural heartland of Chihuahua state .
Their parents and grandparents came to Mexico in the 1920s from Canada after being promised religious freedom in return for resurrecting farmland devastated during the Mexican revolution .
Mr Peters ' community is one of many caught in the crossfire as the federal government cracks down on the illegal drug trade .
Despite the comfort provided by his religion , he admits feeling increasingly " unsettled " about his family 's safety .
" Years ago you never heard about executions , " he ponders and tails off .
Few members of his Church are talking about moving to Mennonite settlements in Belize and Paraguay as a result of the violence in Mexico , but the community is clearly concerned .
The strain shows momentarily as Mr Peters rubs his forehead before pointedly adjusting his tall , cream cowboy hat , part of the trademark attire of Mennonite men that is a visual sign of the community 's commitment to preserve its traditions .
His dark blue dungarees , originally inspired by the uniforms of Mexican railway workers observed on that momentous journey down from Canada , bear a large pocket at the front .
From it he pulls out a map and points to the place where drug gangs reportedly killed a Mennonite man in Cuauhtemoc and another , closer to home , in the farming corridor outside the city 's commercial hub earlier this year .
Putting down roots
Mr Peters looks wistfully upon his immaculate yet modest family home , flanked by waving cornfields .
For him , this farmhouse , within the largest cluster of Mennonite colonies in Mexico , is more than bricks and mortar .
It is the only home he has ever known , where he has worked the land and raised cattle since boyhood .
Abraham Peters ' parents moved to Mexico in the 1920s Built by his father , Isidro - a first generation Mennonite migrant from Canada 's Saskatchewan province - the house is also Mr Peters ' birthplace , where he still lives with wife , Catarina , and Maria , the youngest of their eight children .
All speak the Low German or Plautdietsch language of their forebears , and only the men learn Spanish .
Two of his sons have taken over the family farming business in Cuauhtemoc , where they are already training up the next generation .
Others have purchased agricultural land in Mennonite settlements in the north of Chihuahua .
Putting down roots is rare in Mennonite history , which has been punctuated by periodic mass migration .
Originating in the Netherlands , these followers of 16th Century Anabaptist Menno Simons , a radical Protestant reformer , relocated to Russia in the 1770s and then to Canada in the late 19th Century .
They fled persecution for their refusal to participate in military action or swap their Germanic dialect for the host language .
A 7,000 - strong community moved to Mexico between 1922 and 1927 after negotiating temporary fiscal benefits , autonomy over education in their mother tongue and exemption from military service .
Economic success
Since then their numbers have swelled to some 60,000 in Chihuahua 's 25 Mennonite colonies , while smaller settlements are found in Durango , Campeche , Zacatecas and Tamaulipas .
Unlike fellow Anabaptists the Pennsylvania Amish , Mexican Mennonites have steadily modernised agricultural techniques in response to the harsh realities of their environment , where drought is a regular threat .
Mexican Mennonites dominate local cheese production Authorities estimate Mennonite farmers account for at least 60 % of the state 's agricultural produce , supplying staples such as corn and beans .
Nicknamed " vendequesos " or " cheese - sellers , " Mennonites make 80 % of the region 's cheese and some 70 % of its dairy produce .
Since Mexico's financial crisis of 1994 , they have invested collectively in an exclusive credit union where only Mennonite shareholders are permitted .
By safeguarding access to credit , the community has managed to partially insulate itself from the global financial crisis .
Good harvests in 2008 and 2009 have also helped .
But these economic achievements have attracted the attention of organised criminal gangs , putting Mennonites at risk of armed robbery , kidnap and extortion .
Katharine Rempenning , director of the state government 's Mennonite Outreach Programme , dismissed talk of any mass exodus over fear of violent crime , but admitted some members of the community " were thinking of leaving Mexico " .
Crime prevention Chihuahua 's minority Christian groups are still reeling from the 7 July murder of Mormon anti-crime activist Benjamin LeBaron , and his neighbour Luis Widmar .
We do n't know what future awaits us - only God knows
Abraham Peters Mr LeBaron rose to prominence after his own brother was abducted in May this year .
Mennonite groups joined Mr LeBaron 's peaceful protests against a wave of kidnappings affecting both communities .
Ms Rempenning , a Mennonite of Russian extraction , is concerned that her community 's culture of being " open to others " makes members more vulnerable to becoming victims of crime .
Giving advice on crime prevention - " most importantly , kidnapping " - is a priority for her department , which has an annual budget of 500,000 pesos ( US $ 38,258 ) .
Meanwhile , Mr Peters suggests some threats to Mennonite values are coming from within .
" There are Mennonites involved in the drug [ trade ] in distribution , " he alleges .
Uncertain future While Cuauhtemoc is one of Mexico 's fastest growing urban centres , there is also sense of abandonment .
Mr Peters , who in his retirement has been taking tourists around Mennonite country , says he has hardly received any overseas visitors this year because of security fears , compounded by the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in April .
Busloads of Canadians and Americans no longer visit the city 's Mennonite Museum for the same reasons .
" We do n't know what future awaits us , " Mr Peters states with a tone of acceptance .
" Only God knows . "
But for this Mennonite at least , his future is in the land of his birth .
" We are Mexican now , " he proclaims as he clasps his hands together for emphasis .
" Mexicans and Mennonites are like this ! "
" We do n't know what God wants with Mexico but yes , we will stay , yes we are going to pray very much and come together . "
This peaceful religious community could be facing its biggest test yet .

Is it always a journalist 's duty to report the truth , even if it may damage innocents ?
I 'm a total First Amendment Jeffersonian .
It 's their job to keep it secret and my job to find it out and make it public .
But once one gets someinformation , one does n't run pell - mell into it .
You know , maybe six or seven times in 40 years I 've had a story and the president has called up and said : " If you write this story , American security will be damaged . "
In every case except one , we wrote the story .
And son of a bitch , the Russians did n't launch paratroopers into the foothills of San Francisco the next day .
Are there times when you have a scoop , or a piece of information , but let it go ?
You 're constantly not publishing everything you know .
That 's part of the game .
Do you ever worry that your phone is bugged ?
Some people I only talk to in their home or their office , but I arrange the calls here .
To bug me legally they'd have to get a warrant ; once you have something illegally you can't use it very much .
If the 9/11 attacks taught us one thing , it 's that the agencies collect lots of wonderful stuff they do n't share with anybody .
You rely a lot on unnamed sources .
Is that a dangerous technique , or an invaluable one ?
Look at the serious press in the UK , France , America : every single day there are unnamed sources .
But I believe people in my profession should be held to an extremely high standard .
I welcome the fact that people can sue me .
Do you find the libel laws in the UK chilling ?
There 's no question - D - notices are chilling .
You guys have a very tough system .
Is n't there a risk that some high - level sources might be " playing " you ?
Of course , that 's a categorical risk .
But I consider myself a full - service agency .
You can come to me with a secret and I take it to other people and learn things about what you know .
Then I write a story that includes things you did n't know .
So when the government assesses what I wrote to see who could have leaked it , you 're not ever considered , because you could not have known what was published .
It 's foolproof .
How have you managed to remain an outsider for so long ?
There 's no way they would deal with me .
The Obama White House can't abide me .
Within a month , they were going behind my back to my editor : " What 's your man Hersh doing ? "
What do you make of Barack Obama ?
Do n't get me going on Obama .
If he decided to be a one - term president , he could be marvellous , but it 's not clear he 's decided that .
Did he deserve the Nobel Peace Prize ?
Well , no , of course not .
The question is : will he stay in Afghanistan until he thinks it 's the right time to get out politically ?
Or is he going to take a chance of not getting re-elected and find a way out quickly ?
It 's not such a hard way out .
There are people to talk to there .
On Iran , are we repeating the mistakes that were made on Iraq ?
Some of the things are very disturbing .
We are getting new leadership at the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The next wave there is not going to be as rational .
It 's amazing to me , as someone who went to the Vietnam war and Iraq war , and now the Afghan war .
There 's simply no learning curve .
Post - Bush , do you think there 's still a risk of a military strike on Iran by Israel or the US ?
Yes .
Where do you place yourself on the political spectrum ?
I 'm your standard left liberal , but I vote for Republicans , I 've given money to them .
I 'm not a pacifist .
I would have been tough on Osama Bin Laden after 9/11 .
But I 'd have done it legally .
Are you disappointed Obama did n't release those " torture pictures " ?
His position is that , at a time when we have 130,000 Americans in Afghanistan , putting the pictures out would just inflame people to take action against them .
The New York Times has been editorialising against him , but when it had a reporter captured , it thought it was perfectly appropriate not to talk about it publicly for seven months , on the grounds that the paper was trying to protect his life .
What would you like to forget ?
My Lai .
How would you like people to remember you ?
I could n't care less .
I do n't believe in life after death .
Are we doomed ?
The trouble is that hope sprang anew in America last November .
And I think the dashing of that hope is going to be much more lethal than even the cynicism under Bush and Cheney .
If that hope is dashed , we 'll really be in trouble around the world .
Interview by Mehdi Hasan
Suheil Azam was sitting in a coffee shop in east London last month when one his friends began a debate on whether it was permissible under Islamic scripture for Muslims to wish their non-Muslim friends happy Christmas .
As a 23 - year - old professional who socialises widely , Mr Azam had never considered the possibility that someone in his community might frown upon him for going round to his neighbours at Christmas or partying during New Year .
But his friend , who had become increasingly devout , was adamant that such behaviour was haram ( forbidden ) .
" Personally I think he 's wrong , " explained Mr Azam .
" But it 's difficult to argue against him because all the information he gets is taken from the internet and it makes him sound very knowledgeable . "
Such a debate between two young British Muslims would have been almost unthinkable two decades ago .
But today it is frequently the internet that young Muslims turn to when looking for spiritual advice .
And what they find in cyberspace is often shockingly intolerant .
" Do not congratulate [ the unbeliever ] on their festivals in any way whatsoever , " warns one prominent site .
" That implies approval of their festival and not denouncing them . "

While the real world provides a vast array of interpretations from a variety of Islamic schools , more often than not it is the intolerant strands of Islam taught by Saudi Arabia 's fundamentalist Wahabi scholars that dominate online .
Backed by billions of petrodollars and an army of tech - savvy graduates who are more than capable of capturing the YouTube generation 's imagination , the internet has long been a stronghold for the most intolerant forms of Islam .
For those who wish to see the West's Muslim communities continue to integrate with their neighbours , the prevalence of such isolationist rhetoric is of great concern .
Armed with quotes from Saudi scholars living thousands of miles away , a small number of angry young British Muslims are forgoing the inclusive Islam their parents were once taught in favour of an interpretation that encourages them to cut themselves off from mainstream society and view all non-Muslims with contempt .
But now , as the Hajj gets under way in Mecca , one of the world 's oldest Islamic institutions has come to Britain to remind young Muslims who might be tempted by the Wahabi rhetoric that there is an alternative way to worship .
Scholars from Al - Azhar in Cairo have been touring Britain 's mosques to launch a new online book of fatwas ( Islamic judgements ) which directly challenge the Saudi way of thinking .
The second oldest university in the world , after China 's Nanking University , Al - Azhar was generally seen as the foremost centre of learning in the Sunni world until Saudi Arabia began exporting its millenarian version of Islam en masse from the late 1970s .
Critics have since accused Al - Azhar of being too close to the widely disliked Egyptian government , but it remains one of the few international schools of Islamic jurisprudence with enough historical clout to challenge Saudi Arabia 's supremacy .
The 200 - page book , entitled The Response , has been available in the Middle East in Arabic for two years but this is the first time a comprehensive list of some of the most commonly asked questions encountered by Al - Azhar 's scholars has been available in English , and equally importantly , Urdu , the national language of Pakistan .
The issues answered in the book range from whether the Earth revolves around the Sun ( Sheikh Ibn Baaz , Saudi Arabia 's Grand Mufti during the 1990s , insisted that the Sun revolved around the Earth ) to whether a Muslim is allowed to perform magic tricks ( Wahabis forbid it ) .
After each question , the book 's authors quote a fundamentalist fatwa and then offer their own , centrist alternative .
In reply to whether Muslims can greet non-believers during their festivals , for instance , Al - Azhar 's scholars write : " There is no harm in congratulating non-Muslims with whom you have a family relationship , or that are neighbours of yours . "
They then give examples from the Prophet Mohamed 's life that showed his tolerance toward other religions .
Sheikh Abdel Fattah El Bezm , the Grand Mufti of Damascus , was one of two Al - Azhar trained scholars to tour the UK this week , visiting mosques in Birmingham and Manchester .
An elderly cleric with a trimmed grey beard and warm eyes , the Islam he grew up with and went on to study was mainly concerned with creating a just world marked by kindness and lenience .
In an interview with The Independent , he was keen to avoid blaming the Saudis directly , but it was clear that Al - Azhar 's scholars want to confront the hardliners ' rhetoric .
" This is not an argument between two countries , between Saudi Arabia or Al - Azhar , " he said .
" But we do want to show that there are many different schools of thought .
A few decades ago people began to abuse Islam and abuse Muslims .
They took Islam out of context ; they used it for their own personal gain and it has come back to haunt us .
We are now paying the price for that . "
Richard Gauvain , a British - born academic and a specialist in Islam who has taught at the American University of Cairo for the past seven years , translated The Response into English and says it is time moderate scholars caught up with the online mullahs .
" To be honest this book should have been written 30 years ago , " he said .
" Its value lies in re-establishing Al - Azhar as the leading voice .
It reaches out to the average guy on the street and reminds them that nuance and ambiguity have always been very much part of the Islamic tradition . "

But will British Muslims listen to what Al - Azhar has to say ?
Earlier this year Al - Azhar launched an English language version of its famous Islamic Hotline .
Commonly referred to as " Dial - a - Sheikh " in Egypt , the hotline was launched in 2000 and allowed ordinary Muslims from across the Middle East to phone Al - Azhar 's scholars for Islamic advice .
It has since received over two million calls from around the world but has had trouble gaining a foothold in the UK .
Chérif Abdel Meguid , the phone line 's rotund and bespectacled founder , was surprisingly candid about the limited success of the hotline in Britain : " Very few of our callers come from the UK at the moment , " he admitted .
" We launched it in April but we have n't followed it up with enough advertising yet .
This week we 've taken adverts out in some of the Urdu language British press so we hope to get more callers . "
Inayat Bunglawala , the Muslim Council of Britain 's influential media secretary who recently founded his own group , Muslims4UK , believes the Egyptian institution 's reputation has suffered .
" Educated Muslims look at Al - Azhar with respect because of its history as a beacon of learning but they are also very much aware that its reputation has dwindled in recent decades , " he said .
" Many now regard it as little more than an extension of the Egyptian government whose sheikhs are called upon to make pronouncements that are favourable to the Egyptian regime . "
But Muhammad Ali Musawi from the Quilliam Foundation , which was set up by former extremists who have abandoned their hardline rhetoric , believes even extremists will take note of Al - Azhar fatwas .
" I think this is something that we should welcome , " he said .
" [ Al - Azhar ] is still a respected institution and people will listen to what it has to say .
" The big problem , as ever , is resources .
The sort of money Al - Azhar has backing it cannot even begin to compare with what Saudi Arabia puts in to funding its Wahabi clerics .
Unfortunately , young British Muslims rarely come across a scholar from Al - Azhar .
But barely a week goes by without a Saudi institution sending over one of their clerics to preach in our universities or mosques . "
Conflicting fatwas : Cairo vs Saudi Arabia
Q. Should a husband or wife stay in a marriage if their partner no longer prays ?
* Fatwa from Sheikh Ibn al - Uthaymin ( a prominent 20th - century Saudi scholar )
By abandoning his or her prayers , a person leaves Islam .
It is forbidden , therefore , for a Muslim to remain with a husband or a wife who no longer prays .
* Al - Azhar 's fatwa
With a single stroke of the pen , this fatwa declares a vast number of Muslims to be unbelievers .
In fact , it means that millions of people are now no longer Muslims .
We do not know why the authors are so keen to exclude crowds of Muslims from God 's religion .
Q. Is free thought and faith a positive attribute ?
* Sheikh Ibn al - Uthaymin
Whoever argues that a person is entitled to complete freedom of faith is an unbeliever , guilty of the major sin of disbelief .
* Al - Azhar Allowing people freedom of faith does not mean that we consent to people forsaking their religion .
However , we are dismayed by insistence on charging Muslims with acts of apostasy for the smallest of reasons .
Q. Is it wrong to say the Earth moves around the Sun ?
* Sheikh Ibn Baaz ( Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia 1993 - 99 )
" The person who maintains that the Sun does not move should be condemned to death after being called upon to repent , as his denials of the motion of the Sun constitute a denial of God 's Word .
* Al - Azhar Matters which are not explicitly indicated in texts revealed by God should be referred to experts in these fields , such as astronomers .
Such fatwas as this one sadly distorts the image of Islam worldwide .
Q. Is it allowed for a Muslim to live in a non-Muslim country ?
* Sheikh Ibn Baaz
It is illegal to live in such countries for work , trade or even for study , except when engaged in proselytising in the name of Islam .
* Al - Azhar
It is a Muslim 's duty , whether living within Muslim or non-Muslim communities , to benefit other members of those communities through teaching religion , calling for the good and opposing the bad .
Q. Are Muslims allowed to study secular law ?
* The Permanent Committee for Islamic Research ( Saudi Arabia 's most senior school of Islamic jurisprudence )
It is not permitted to teach secular law as a general course in higher education .
This subject should be limited to specialists , who are able to show how secular law deviates from the truth [ of Muslim law ] .
* Al - Azhar
There is nothing wrong with studying secular law providing that one 's study is guided by a legitimate interest , such as co-operating for the general good of society and fighting legal oppression .
A man who strangled his wife during a nightmare in the belief he was attacking an intruder walked free from court today after the case against him was withdrawn .
Brian Thomas , 59 , of Neath , South Wales , killed his wife Christine , 57 , while they were holidaying in West Wales in July 2008 .

At Swansea Crown Court today the prosecution told the jury that it was no longer seeking a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity and that there would be no purpose in sending Thomas to a psychiatric hospital .
The court erupted into shouts of " yes " as family members jubilantly greeted the outcome today .
Their reaction came after Paul Thomas QC , the prosecutor , explained the situation to the jury after yesterday 's day - long adjournment in proceedings .
" We are no longer seeking a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity , " Mr Thomas told the jury .
" We have a continuing duty to review the case and we took the opportunity yesterday to take stock of the situation .
" It is clear from the evidence that no useful purpose would be served by Mr Thomas being detained in a psychiatric hospital . "
Iwan Jenkins , Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Dyfed Powys , said : " This has been a unique case with a unique set of circumstances .
" We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review , and following expert evidence from a psychiatrist it was suggested no useful purpose would be served by Mr Thomas being detained and treated in a psychiatric hospital , which would be the consequence of a special verdict in this case .

" Once it was raised , the CPS had a duty to review the case and decided that , guided as we must be and have been throughout this case by the views of the experts , the public interest would no longer be served by continuing to seek a special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity .
" The consequences of such a finding would have meant Mr Thomas ' detention in a psychiatric hospital , but it is now clear that the psychiatrists feel that that would serve no useful purpose and the risk of reoccurrence is very , very small .
We therefore have offered no further evidence and asked the jury to return a simple verdict of not guilty . "
He added : " Our thoughts remain with the family of Brian and Christine Thomas who have remained dignified throughout this difficult time . "
High Court Judge Justice Davis KT , told Thomas that in the eyes of the law he bore no responsibility for what he had done .
He described him as a " decent man and devoted husband " .
He said that from his understanding of his character from what had come out in court he may go away with a sense of guilt about what happened but he underlined a second time : " In the eyes of the law you bear no responsibility for what happened . "
Raymond Thomas , the brother of Brian , spoke of his relief and jubilation at the outcome today as he left court .
" Family and friends are truly delighted by the outcome today .
" They were a loving couple and always like that together .
" He has always been a loving husband and a family man .
" This was a tragic , tragic episode and we are all very emotional . "
He added : " It is like one psychiatrist has said , this was a perfect storm .
My brother is a decent man . "
During the brief trial at Swansea Crown Court , there was intensive interest in details of the case across the world .
It opened on Tuesday with jurors hearing that Mr Thomas accepted that he had killed his wife of 40 years , who had also been his childhood sweetheart .
They were told that psychiatrists for the prosecution and the defence agreed that he suffered from a long - standing sleep disorder and he had been in a state of automatism at the time .
That meant that while he was asleep his mind was not in control of what his body was doing .
The tragic death of his wife happened in July last year when the couple had travelled 60 miles to Aberporth in West Wales in their Peugeot camper van .
They stopped for the night in a car park but were disturbed by boy racers doing wheel spins and handbrake turns .
As a result they moved to a pub car park for the rest of the night .
But Mr Thomas , who took medication for depression , had stopped taking his tablets some time before the holiday .
The couple , who had separate bedrooms at their home in Neath , planned to be " intimate " while on holiday .
Mr Thomas had stopped his medication because one of the side - effects was that it made him impotent .
Expert evidence during the trial , however , suggested that he would have suffered worsening dreams and nightmares as a result of the withdrawal symptoms he would be experiencing .
In a nightmare probably triggered by the earlier incident with the boy racers , Mr Thomas believed an intruder had broken into the couple 's camper van .
During the violent nightmare he attacked and fought the intruder and got him in a headlock - only to wake and find he had strangled his wife .
Due to the highly unusual nature of the case the prosecution had been seeking a " special verdict " of not guilty of murder by reason of insanity .
The alternative to that was a simple not guilty verdict .
Expert evidence from both sides previously made it clear that there was no purpose in sending Mr Thomas to a psychiatric hospital .
Therefore , today the jury was instructed by Justice Davis to bring in a formal not guilty verdict and Mr Thomas was freed after being held in custody since January .
I wrote grin to help me search directories full of source code .
The venerable GNU grep and find are great tools , but they fall just a little short for my normal use cases .
The main problem I had with GNU grep is that I had no way to exclude certain directories that I knew had nothing of interest for me , like .svn/ , CVS / and build / .
The results from those directories obscured the results I was actually interested in .
There are tools like ack , which skip these directories , but ack also only grepped files with extensions that it knew about .
Furthermore , it had not implemented the context lines feature , which I had grown accustomed to .
Recent development has added these features , but I had already released grin by the time I found out .
One can construct a GNU find command that will exclude .svn/ and the rest , but the only reliable way I am aware of runs grep on each file independently .
The startup cost of invoking many separate grep processes is relatively large .
Also , I was bored .
It seems to be catching .
Perl has ack , Ruby has rak , and now Python has grin .
I wrote grin to get exactly the features I wanted :
Recurse directories by default .
Do not go into directories with specified names .
Do not search files with specified extensions .
Be able to show context lines before and after matched lines .
Python regex syntax ( one can quibble as to whether this is a feature or my laziness for using the regex library provided with my implementation language , but as a Python programmer , this is the syntax I am most familiar with ) .
Unless suppressed via a command line option , display the filename regardless of the number of files .
Accept a file ( or stdin ) with a list of newline - separated filenames .
This allows one to use find to feed grin a list of filenames which might have embedded spaces quite easily .
Grep through gzipped text files .
Be useful as a library to build custom tools quickly .
I have also exposed the directory recursion logic as the command - line tool “ grind ” in homage to find .
It will recurse through directories matching a glob pattern to file names and printing out the matches .
It shares the directory and file extension skipping settings that grin uses .
For configuration , you can specify the environment variables GRIN_ARGS and GRIND_ARGS .
These should just contain command - line options of their respective programs .
These will be prepended to the command - line arguments actually given .
Options given later will override options given earlier , so all options explicitly in the command - line will override those in the environment variable .
For example , if I want to default to two lines of context and no skipped directories , I would have this line in my bashrc :
export GRIN_ARGS= " - C 2 -- no-skip-dirs "
Installation grin uses setuptools to find and install its dependency on argparse .
grin is easy_installable : $ easy_install grin Alternatively , download and unpack the tarball and install : $ tar zxf grin-1.2.tar.gz $ python setup.py install
On UNIX systems , use sudo for the latter command if you need to install the scripts to a directory that requires root privileges : $ sudo python setup.py install Running the unittests requires the nose framework , which can also be easy_installed : $ easy_install " nose >= 0.10 " ... $ nosetests .........................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 25 tests in 0.192s OK $ python setup.py test #
The other way to run the tests .
running test ... etc .
The development Subversion repository can be checked out anonymously : $ svn co https://svn.enthought.com/svn/sandbox/grin/trunk/
grin
There is one little tweak to the installation that you may want to consider .
By default , setuptools installs scripts indirectly ; the scripts installed to $ prefix / bin or Python2xScripts use setuptools ’ pkg_resources module to load the exact version of grin egg that installed the script , then runs the script ’s main ( ) function .
This is not usually a bad feature , but it can add substantial startup overhead for a small command - line utility like grin .
If you want the response of grin to be snappier , I recommend installing custom scripts that just import the grin module and run the appropriate main ( ) function .
See the files examples / grin and examples / grind for examples .
Using grin
To recursively search the current directory for a regex : $ grin some_regex
To search an explicit set of files : $ grin some_regex file1.txt path / to/file2.txt
To recursively search an explicit set of directories : $ grin some_regex dir1 / dir2 /
To search data piped to stdin : $ cat somefile | grin some_regex -
To make the regex case - insensitive : $ grin - i some_regex
To output 2 lines of context before , after , or both before and after the matches : $ grin - B 2 some_regex $ grin - A 2 some_regex $ grin -C 2 some_regex
To only search Python .py files : $ grin - I " *. py " some_regex
To suppress the line numbers which are printed by default : $ grin - N some_regex
To just show the names of the files that contain matches rather than the matches themselves : $ grin -l some_regex
To suppress the use of color highlighting : # Note that grin does its best to only use color when it detects that it is # outputting to a real terminal .
If the output is being piped to a file or # a pager , then no color will be used .
$ grin -- no - color some_regex
To force the use of color highlighting when piping the output to something that is capable of understanding ANSI color escapes : $ grin -- force - color some_regex | less -R
To avoid recursing into directories named either CVS or RCS : $ grin -d CVS , RCS some_regex
By default grin skips a large number of files .
To suppress all of this behavior and search everything : $ grin -sbSDE some_regex
To search for files newer than some_file .
txt : # If no subdirectory or file in the list contains whitespace : $ grin some_regex `find .
- newer some_file.txt` #
If a subdirectory or file in the list may contain whitespace : $ find .
- newer some_file.txt | grin -f - some_regex
Using grind
To find files matching the glob “ foo *. py ” in this directory or any subdirectory using same the default rules as grin : $ grind " foo * . py "
To suppress all of the default rules and not skip any files or directories while searching : $ grind - sbSDE " foo * . py "
To find all files that are not skipped by the default rules : $ grind
To start the search in a particular set of directories instead of the current one ( not the – separator ) : $ grind -- dirs thisdir that / dir -- " foo * . py "
Using grin as a Library
One of the goals I had when writing grin was to be able to use it as a library to write custom tools .
You can see one example that I quickly hacked up in examples / grinimports.py .
It reuses almost all of grin ’s infrastructure , except that it preprocesses Python files to extract and normalize just the import statements .
This lets you conveniently and robustly search for import statements .
Look at “ grinimports .py –help ” for more information .
examples / grinpython.py allows you to search through Python files and specify whether you want to search through actual Python code , comments or string literals in any combination .
For example : $ grinpython.
py - i -- strings grep grin.py grin.py : 188 : " " " Grep a single file for a regex by iterating over the lines in a file .
292 : " " " Do a full grep .
... $ grinpython.
py - i -- comments grep grin.py grin.py : 979 : # something we want to grep .
$ grinpython .
py - i -- python - code grep grin.py grin.py : 187 : class GrepText ( object ) : 291 : def do_grep ( self , fp ) : ... Similarly , it should be straightforward to write small tools like this which extract and search text metadata from binary files .
To Do Figure out the story for grepping UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 and UTF - 32 Unicode text files .

In May of 1992 , I was waiting around for Oberlin Commencement ( I had graduated officially in December of ' 91 ) and I had suddenly contracted the ME / CFS " flu - like illness " that harkens the onset of the disease , though I had experienced what is known as " prodrome " ( early , shadowy , pre-illness symptoms ) in the years before , and in fact almost dropped out of Oberlin and stayed around the Bay Area in the Fall of 1998 , when my body seemed to be saying to mebut I did n't listen .
But let me backtrack to the " prodrome " which -- if research would help us -- could become useful foreshadowing for patients and doctors : I had left Oberlin for a semester off in the Fall o…
I had the great good fortune to have screenwriter / director Shane Black visit my Writing the Character - Driven Screenplay class this past week .
The creator of the Lethal Weapon franchise , he also wrote The Last Boy Scout , The Long Kiss Goodnight , and the by - now beloved cult fave Kiss Kiss Bang Bang .
Revered by those of us who know how hard it is to write good , character - driven action fare , he also became infamous , back in the day , for having committed the crime of being one of the most highly paid scribes in Hollywood history .
Shane turned out to be an uncommonly generous , vulnerable , honest mensch of a guy .
I got to play James Lipton and ask the questions , and Shane gave us over an hour and half 's worth of enlightening answers re : creating memorable characters and crafting effective big screen stories .
A few times in our conversation we talked about digging into one 's dark places and dealing with one 's fears in the writing process .
The last question of the night came from a student who wanted to know how Shane dealt with such fears - where the fear came from and what it was about .
" For most people , fear is daring to wish for something so bad that it matters to you , and then having that taken away .
Fear is , I 'm not going to get the things I want , and I 'm gonna lose the things I have already .
That 's what fear is , to me .
The idea of getting your hopes up ?
[ When I was starting out ]
I would get my hopes up , and someone would say , What if they just smash you ?
And then you 'll feel worse than ever !
And I 'd go :
Oh , well , I know .
I 'd rather get my hopes up .
" Here 's what the fear does : it 's something called ' The Jack Story . '
Jack Story 's about a guy who 's driving and boom , his tire blows out in a rain storm .
By the side of the road , flat .
He sees a farmhouse in the distance with a light on , and he thinks , I do n't have a jack , I can't change this tire - but maybe the farmer has one .
So he starts walking through the rain and the mud and after a couple of feet he thinks ,
Well , wait a minute , what if I get to the farmhouse and the guy does n't have a jack ?
Then I gotta walk all the way back and I 'm getting rained on and it 's murder .
And he goes , Calm down , it has n't happened , see what happens , play it by ear , okay ?
" So he keeps walking and he thinks , Hmm , what if the farmer has a jack , he does , but I bring it back and it 's the wrong kind .
And then I 've made this whole trip and the expectations , and it gets ruined , and then I have to go back and I can't even drive - Ohmygod , it 's even worse .
He goes : Relax .
It has n't happened , just relax ...
Three quarters of the way there , he thinks :
What if the farmer has a jack , and it 's the right kind , but what if he just does n't want to give it to me , and he says , I do n't know you , fuck you , go out in the rain !
" So the point of the story is , by the time he gets to the farmhouse it 's like -- " Shane knocks his fist on the desk .
" The farmer goes , Hello ?
And the guy goes :
You know what , take your jack and shove it up your ass ! "
" Because you have in your head , already scripted , the conversation based on fear , and you 've let fear just run rampant ...
And I have to remind myself , Stop having conversations that do n't exist .
I 'll feel like I 've talked to someone for an hour , but it 's the future - the conversation I would be having , and inventing the things I would say , or I 'm going to say .
And then I never have that conversation .
It 's just wasted fear time , spent on all the bad things that could happen , instead of the really interesting things that might .
" Writing and getting away from your fear , is to me ...
You know , you might not sell a script .
You might not be good .
You might not this and you might not that .
What 's the point in going down that path ?
There is none .
I know it 's tough to say , ' Do n't be afraid , ' or ' Think positive , ' but ...
There really is just no other way to go .
You 're up against a wall , you 've decided you want to do something , you 're having some adversity - you can either play out your hand or quit .
And I suggest that ...
My career came down to one moment like that .
" I was working on a script called Shadow Company in 1984 , and I was on page one , and I showed it to my brother - he hated it .
I sat down and I thought , " I can't do this .
I sat down to write a screenplay - I do n't know screenplays , what am I doing , this is so stupid ...
And I thought : I do n't want to write !
I do n't want to do this , I can't .
" I'm a one - finger typist .
And I said - Just do it . "
Shane holds his one typing forefinger in the air , and jabs it an invisible keyboard .
" I went , ' The ... rain ... lashes ...
Ground ... Bla - bla - blah .
I started typing - I hate this , I hate this , I hate this , I hate this - and all of a sudden , I 'm : Huh , okay that 's a good line .
What would he say there ?
Okay , he says this ...
And three pages later , I had a scene , and it became a script - and it sold , optioned - and it got me Lethal Weapon . "
" It came down to this .
I had a piece of paper in a typewriter and my finger poised to hit one key and I could n't do it , I did n't want to do it all .
All I wanted to do was stop .
And I hit the key .
And now I have a career .
So that 's the leap of faith .
" I walked through the fear .
You can walk through anything .
That 's the fabulous truth that I 've discovered , is that fear never goes away .
But it does n't stop you from putting one foot in front of the other .
And , the most important realization of all , it can't stop you from being creative .
It can impede you , but it will not stop you from having great ideas .
Fear will do everything except shut you down , mentally .
It ca n't do that . "

When NASA announced last month the finding of water ice in several impact craters on Mars , and either water or hydroxyl widely dispersed on the moon 's surface , the solar system became a little more familiar because it seemed a tad more hospitable to life as we know it on Earth .
But is that because the rest of the cosmos has much in common with Earth or vice versa ?
Water , the unique molecule that cradles and nurtures life here , is apparently common and perhaps abundant in the solar system .
Observational evidence suggests that water as a solid , liquid or gas is present at the poles of Mercury , within the thick clouds of Venus , on Mars , inside asteroids and comets , and on Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
Scientists also have speculated that Jupiter 's moons Europa , Ganymede and Callisto have vast subsurface oceans of liquid water .
They have also detected through spectroscopy water frost on Pluto 's moon , Charon .
Of course , scientists have known that H 2 O also seems to be ubiquitous beyond the solar system .
They 've detected it in one form or another in interstellar gas and even in such unlikely places as the atmospheres of stars .
Perhaps it should n't be such a revelation .
After all , hydrogen is the most common element in the universe , followed by helium and oxygen .
" It 's not a surprise that the simple ( molecules ) would show up again and again , " says Pamela Conrad , a planetary scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena and part of the science team for the next - generation Mars Science Laboratory headed to the Red Planet in late 2011 .
" But I think its discovery on specific planets or other bodies in the solar system has a significance beyond whether or not we 're surprised that it 's there .
It gives us permission to speculate on whether or not there is other chemistry that would be relevant to the origin or the sustenance of life . "
As scientists continue their search for extraterrestrial water , it 's good to be reminded why they 're actually looking for it .
Just what is it about water , specifically liquid water , that makes it essential for life ?
The short answer is that life on Earth requires it .
Photosynthetic life snatches the hydrogen from water molecules to make sugars .
Organisms use water to add rigidity to cells and transport nutrients .
If we do n't drink it , we die .
But it 's the handful of intrinsic — and collectively unique — properties that explains why water is the elixir of life .
Sushil Atreya , who studies the formation of planets and the evolution of their atmospheres at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor 's Planetary Science Laboratory , breaks it down this way : " Liquid water acts as a solvent , as a medium and as a catalyst for certain types of proteins , and those are three main things that allow life to flourish , " he says .
Liquid water 's property as a solvent , in which salts and organic compounds such as amino acids and sugars readily dissolve , is due to its dipole molecular structure .
The oxygen atoms in water hold their electrons much more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do , so they accumulate a negative electrical charge .
Water 's hydrogen atoms , bent on the same side of the water molecule , are positively charged .
The resulting structure is the reason why water molecules can break down such a wide variety of chemical species .
" [ Water ] is just amazing at being able to make friends with some piece of a molecule , or some piece of an ion , " JPL 's Conrad says .
" And that property of water is special , because more things dissolve in it than in other kinds of solvents . "
As a result , water is a great arbiter of chemistry that allows tremendous diversity .
" When you 're trying to make life , you want conditions where you can try many things …in the hopes that something will take shape , " he says .
Although it 's a superior solvent , water also provides an ideal medium in which chemical reactions can occur and nutrients can be easily transported , Atreya says .
That includes enzymes , essential to life processes , which need water in order to do their job .
" They have to be in a certain shape in order for them to act as catalysts for biochemical reactions … and water allows them to be in a certain shape , " he says .
A few other properties make water the ideal medium for life :
Water can remain a liquid over a wide range of temperatures , from zero degree Celsius to 100 degrees C — and even wider if dissolved salts and gases , such as ammonia , are added .
( The range also varies with pressure . )
Also , ice floats .
Frozen water is less dense than its liquid form because " when you make a crystal , arranging atoms in an ordered repeating pattern , you just can't stack them very tightly , " Conrad says .
The difference in density between the solid and liquid states of water means that ice sheets can cover oceans , protecting life below .
If ice sank , water would freeze from the bottom up and we'd live in a very different world .
( Only a handful of other substances other than water become less dense when frozen .
They include silicon , acetic acid and germanium , among others . )
This particular property of water may make life viable in places like Europa , Jupiter 's ice - covered moon that scientists suspect holds a liquid water ocean below .
Scientists suspect that subsurface liquid water may exist on Mars , and water ice has been seen gushing from beneath the surface of Saturn 's moon , Enceladus .
Some scientists , meanwhile , suspect that there may be liquid water beneath the surface of Saturn ’s moon Titan .
Another property that should n't be neglected : water absorbs infrared radiation , so it can store heat and help organisms maintain temperature .
Beneath Europa 's icy shell , a key heat source may be the moon 's rocky mantle energized by tidal forces exerted by Jupiter , which could be warming the bottom of an ocean possibly 100 kilometers deep , says Bob Pappalardo , the principal scientist at JPL for the extended Cassini mission at Saturn who is also preparing for the next robotic exploration of Europa in the mid- to late - 2020s .
It is at those places of chemical disequilibrium , where water is in contact with Europa 's hot rocky mantle , where life may thrive .
Thermal vents at the bottom of Earth 's oceans , where strange life forms congregate around " black smokers " that vent nutrient - rich chemicals , may be analogues for what 's happening on the Europan ocean floor .
Observations of the satellite 's fractured sheath of ice and magnetometer readings from the Galileo spacecraft both suggest a salty water ocean hidden from view .
" We 're pretty sure that the interior of Europa is warm and wet today , " Pappalardo says .
" I certainly think , when you look at those ingredients for life , that Europa rises right to the top of the places to explore . "

On some level , all stories of successful brands resemble one another : the competitors in some category of good or service seem interchangeable until one of them , often a newcomer , dreams up some way of standing out from the crowd .
O.K. , maybe it ’s not always that simple , but differentiating one choice partly by way of advertising , packaging and other image - enhancing strategies has long been a way of persuading shoppers to reconsider what they had previously seen as a mere commodity .
Even , it turns out , bullet shoppers .
The ammunition business appears quite healthy these days ; there are even reports of shortages attributed to ammo-hoarding by Americans who believe draconian gun restrictions are in the offing .
Of course there is more to the bullet market than fear - driven stockpiling .
Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) , a defense contractor , is a leading maker and seller of bullets — to the military mostly , but increasingly to hunters and other civilian gun owners .
( In fact , a Business Week article last year suggested that the company is putting even more focus on the latter market in anticipation of slackening military demand . )
ATK has been in the consumer - ammunition market for only a few years , but the commercial - products group of its armament - systems division now manages a portfolio of about 20 consumer - ammunition brands .
That ’s a fair amount of differentiation .
Some of the reasons are obvious : the ammunition needs of duck hunters and of pistol - range enthusiasts are quite distinct from each other .
But some of ATK ’s ammo-brand differentiation sounds more akin to the sort of image making many people associate with , say , energy drinks or deodorants .
ATK bought the ammunition - maker Federal Cartridge Company in 2001 .
That firm ’s pricier Federal Premium line had been aimed ( as it were ) at those willing to pay more for , say , their bonded or all - copper construction ; the line had been around since the 1970s and was advertised in hunting magazines and the like with pitches that emphasized function and performance .
But outside this high end of the market , “ ammunition tended to be a last - minute decision ” for most hunters , explains Jason Nash , an ATK communications and events manager .
Soon after acquiring Federal , ATK introduced a new bullet line called Fusion , with what Nash calls an “ aggressive ” box design , including a foil label .
Advertising for the brand was intended for 25 - to 35 - year - old deer hunters — a younger and more mass crowd , in other words .
Recently , Fusion signed on Brock Lesnar , a mixed - martial - arts star ( and hunting enthusiast ) as a celebrity endorser .

This experience guided the more recent introduction of the Black Cloud brand of shotgun ammunition , used by duck hunters .
Waterfowl hunting laws mandate the use of nontoxic shot , most of which is made from steel , so there ’s not much room for differentiation in materials , but Black Cloud does brag about elements of its shell design ( notably the “ unique and patented ” Flitecontrol Wad ) and the construction of the shot inside it ( Flitestopper Steel , to “ devastate waterfowl on impact ” ) .
Still , technology by itself is not a marketing strategy .

As international pressure mounts on Iran to halt its nuclear program , Americans and Europeans generally express serious concerns about the potential threat from a nuclear - armed Iran .
However , these fears are somewhat muted in Russia — a nation that will be crucial to any effort to impose new sanctions on Iran .
A 14 -nation survey by the Pew Research Center ’s Global Attitudes Project , conducted Aug. 27 through Sept. 24 , finds worries about Iran developing nuclear weapons most common among Americans : 82 % say that this would be a major threat to the well - being of the U.S. Similarly , concerns are widespread in Western Europe — large majorities in Spain ( 81 % ) , Germany ( 79 % ) , Italy ( 78 % ) and France ( 74 % ) view Iran ’s emergent nuclear capabilities as a major threat .
This view is less common among Eastern Europeans .
Still , 69 % of Czechs view Iran ’s potential nuclear capabilities as a threat , as do more than six - in - ten in Poland ( 65 % ) , Bulgaria ( 63 % ) and Lithuania ( 62 % ) .
Roughly half in Slovakia ( 52 % ) and Hungary ( 46 % ) express worry about Iran developing a nuclear capacity .
By contrast , there is less concern about this issue in Russia , which , as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , has veto power over any UN effort to impose sanctions on Iran .
Just over four - in - ten Russians ( 41 % ) say Iran ’s potential nuclear status poses a major threat to their country , while 48 % deem it only a minor threat or not a threat at all .
Ukrainians are even less worried — only 27 % say Iran ’s emergent nuclear status is a major threat to their country , while nearly half ( 48 % ) say it is a minor danger or no danger at all .
Many in Ukraine say they do n’t know ( 26 % ) .
More Concern About a Nuclear Iran than Extremists Taking Over Afghanistan or Pakistan
In each of the nations surveyed , more people consider a nuclear armed Iran a major threat than say this about two other potential dangers : the Taliban regaining control of Afghanistan and extremists taking control of Pakistan .
Majorities in 11 of the 14 countries say that a nuclear Iran poses a major threat to their own country ; across the 14 nations , the median percentage rating a nuclear Iran a major threat is 66 % .
Majorities in only six of the countries surveyed consider extremists taking over Afghanistan or Pakistan to be a major danger to their country .
The median percentage rating extremists taking over Afghanistan a major threat is 48 % .
Similarly , the median percentage saying extremists taking over Pakistan is 44 % .

The scenes I saw outside the court which convicted Lubna Hussein were even more dramatic than those during the last quickly adjourned trial .
Security forces and female protestors clashed again , but a third party introduced itself into the fray – Islamist men who proceeded to abuse the women and rip up their banners while the police joined in the name - calling .
It seems the whole case has flushed out the nastier elements in Khartoum society as female supporters of Hussein were branded " prostitutes " , that being the most polite word into which I can translate the insults .
According to Najlaa Al Maahi , one of Hussein 's legal team , with whom I spoke after the trial , the proceedings were hastily conducted and the defence was not allowed to make its case .
The general sentiment was that the guilty verdict and the sentence , a fine of £ 130 , had been decided in advance and the trial was merely a formality .
The goal apparently was to tar Hussein as indecent but not resort to lashing .
This would leave the case against her intact , but not enact a brutal punishment while the world watched .
Government supporters were hailing her conviction as a victory while their opponents saw the fine as a climb - down from the initial penalty of flogging , one which Hussein would have endured had she not challenged those who detained her .
The nominal fine and an admission of culpability – in effect a plea bargain – was rejected by Hussein for whatever residual admission of wrongdoing it suggested .
The sentence for refusing to pay , a month 's imprisonment , was threatened in order to put pressure on her to pay , but the judge may have underestimated her defiance .
Sending her away for a month not only allows the court to flex the muscles it had been unable to flex through flogging , but also hide her away from scrutiny by the world 's media , dampening any spirit of victory or jubilation .
More disturbingly , the end of the case has flushed out hardline elements allied with the government who appear to be relishing the opportunity to villify the women who have been protesting .
The irony is that on the way back from court I witnessed several women in trousers freely walking the streets of Khartoum proving that it was never about modesty but about Hussein 's refusal to capitulate to the authorities ' temperamental and arbitrary invocation of public order laws .
The court may believe that it has struck a face - saving balance by refusing to rescind the charges against Hussein while also avoiding flogging her .
However , her supporters are regrouping , an appeal is already being planned and the case had crystallised a hitherto unaddressed conflict over the public face of Khartoum .
A regime keen to encourage foreign investment and prosperity after forging peace in the South has relaxed its grip over the city with sporadic reversions to its earlier , more Islamic incarnation .
The aftermath of the case may determine whether this chaotic and inconsistent approach will be tolerated for much longer .
By banning private insurers in the public exchange from covering " abortion services , " the Stupak Amendment will affect women with incomplete miscarriages .
Like the one I faced last month .
This weekend , a group of male pro-life Democrats gambled with women ’s health , and women lost .
By broadly writing in that insurers can chose whether or not to cover " abortion services , " pro-life amendments do n’t just affect their intended victims — women seeking a way out of an unwanted or medically harmful pregnancy .
They also affect another group of victims — women whose pregnancies have already ended but have not yet miscarried .
I ’m one of those women , and this past Halloween I had what the hospital officially termed an " abortion . "
Hospitals and doctors in general do not have terminology to classify a difference between the termination of a live pregnancy and one in which the fetus has already died .
To them , a D&C is a D&C , regardless of the state of the " conception materials " removed .
Regardless of how many times I made sure to mention to the staff , either for the sake of my sanity or to spare me some sort of imagined shame , that I was ridding myself of my " dead fetus , " to them , it was all the same .
I had learned the day before that the baby I thought was nearly 12 weeks old had no heartbeat , and had actually died at 8 weeks .
I was given three options : wait for a miscarriage to occur on its own , something I was told my body had no intention of doing anytime soon , take medication that would expel the fetus , passing it in my own home ( classified a " chemical abortion " ) or come in for a D&C to remove the fetal materials .

As much as I struggled with the sudden realization that the pregnancy was over , I also found myself trying to decide financially what I was willing to do .
A chemical abortion would cost $ 40 , but I would be alone , bleeding , and it could still be incomplete and I would require a D&C anyway , since my pregnancy was so advanced .
Surgery would be quick , total , and under controlled circumstances , but would likely be our full maxed insurance amount of $ 1500 .
And of course , there was the free option of waiting for my body to finally realize I was n’t pregnant , but after 4 weeks the risk of infection was steadily climbing , increasing my chances of future miscarriage , infertility , or even death .
With a toddler at home , and still nursing hopes for extending our family some day , this was not an option .
I chose the quick and total route of the D&C , despite the costs , prioritizing my health and the health of possible future children .
I was lucky , and could afford to make that choice , because currently , my insurance cannot chose to refuse to cover what the hospital as termed an abortion .
Thanks to the Stupak amendment , that can now change .
Abortion is a very broad term .
The pro-life contingent would like you to think it only applies to selfish , irresponsible women , murdering babies out of fear of inconvenience .
That ’s a caricature they have invented to push their own agenda .
Many of the women who seek out abortions are women who have been raped , who have learned that their child could not survive , have learned that giving birth could physically and permanently harm them .
Or , thanks to newer and vaguer language , women who have already lost the life they were carrying , and need intervention to save their own .
I was one of the latter .
I hope I will be lucky enough to never be again .
But if I am , I hope the insurers do n’t force me to carry that fetus until I medically harm myself , all for the sake of saying that they do not cover abortion services .
Leanne Shepherd and Lucy Jarrett , both 32 , are close friends .
They work as police officers , but on different shifts .
For a long time , they babysat for each other , an arrangement that suited them perfectly and enabled them to continue their careers .
The authorities recently told them , however , that their arrangement was illegal .
If they did not desist , they would face prosecution .
Why ?
Because they exceeded the permitted time to babysit without having received professional training in such matters as resuscitation and child psychology .
Moreover , the state considers their mutual babysitting a potentially taxable economic benefit .
It does not matter that the arrangement was entirely reciprocal and voluntary .
British citizens may no longer make such private agreements among themselves .
One of the nastiest aspects of this little story is that the authorities were alerted to the two women ’s terrible crime by one of their neighbors .
An increasingly intrusive state engenders an increasingly nasty population of secret informers .

In the photo here , Obama is spotted with a book penned by Fareed Zakaria , The Post - American World .
Zakaria ’s book argues that a world order is emerging led by the authoritarian slave state China and India .
“ Criticism of the book focused on certain assertions made by Zakaria , as well as the focus of the book mirroring back a ruling narrative to meet the needs of the global elite , ” a Wikipedia write - up notes .
It makes sense Zakaria is talking to the elite .
He is one of their trusted minions .
In addition to working as the editor of Newsweek International , Zakaria is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group , where he hangs out with insiders such as Brent Scowcroft , CFR president Richard Haass , and CFR member and former Clinton college roomate Strobe Talbott .
Zakaria is a Bilderberg attendee , a senior staff member of the Council on Foreign Relations , and is a member of the Trilateral Commission .
He was the editor of the CFR ’s house organ , Foreign Affairs .
It makes sense Obama is reading Zakaria .
He is one of the leading intellectuals of the New World Order .

The Obama administration , under fire for inflating job growth from the $ 787 billion stimulus plan , slashed over 60,000 jobs from its most recent report on the program because the reporting outlets had submitted " unrealistic data , " according to a document obtained by ABC News .
The Office of Management and Budget document shows that before an Oct. 30 progress report on the program the administration asked the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to remove information from 12 stimulus recipients that contained " unrealistic data , " including " unrealistic job data . "
( Read the document here . )
One recipient – Talladega County of Alabama – claimed that 5,000 jobs had been saved or created from only $ 42,000 in stimulus funds .
" The administration committed from the start to be upfront with the American people about the impact of the Recovery Act .
Overall , the recipients provided good information on the impact of the Recovery Act across the country , " Rob Nabors , deputy director at OMB , told ABC News Monday .
" The test that we used when examining the data for accuracy was , ' Is that reasonable ? '
When the answer was no , we acted accordingly . "
" For instance , " Nabors noted , " there is little chance that a $ 42,000 grant actually created 5,000 jobs , and we did not want that count to be part of the final jobs report .
We are continuing to examine data for inconsistencies or errors , whether small or large .
Given the unprecedented nature of this reporting effort , these are cautious , responsible steps to ensure that the information provided to the American people is accurate and reliable . "
Some of the other recipients whose data was omitted included Belmont Metropolitan Housing Authority in Ohio that reported 16,120 jobs saved or created after receiving $ 1.3 million in stimulus funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Shelton State Community College in Alabama reported 14,500 jobs saved or created after receiving $ 27,000 from the General Accounting Office .
And Alkan Builders of Alaska reported 3,000 jobs saved or created after receiving $ 11 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers .
Lawmaker Calls for OMB Testimony on Stimulus Jobs
All told , the omitted data from the 12 outlets reflected 60,803 jobs saved or created from over $ 20 million in stimulus funds .
If the administration had included the data in its report last month , the total job growth from the stimulus would have exceeded 700,000 , rather than the 640,000 ultimately reported .
However , OMB 's role in filtering the jobs numbers led a senior Republican lawmaker to call for the agency to come to Capitol Hill to testify on its involvement .
On Thursday the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing on how stimulus recipients account for their use of funds .
The hearing will feature Earl Devaney , chair of the Recovery Act board , officials from the Department of Education and the Department of Transportation , and a representative from the Government Accountability Office , but no witnesses from OMB .
In light of the OMB document , the panel 's ranking Republican called for an agency representative to be added to the witness list for Thursday 's hearing .
" The more we learn about the administration 's ' jobs created or saved ' methodology , the more questions we have regarding its accuracy and validity , " Rep. Darrell Issa told ABC News Sunday night .
" Now we learn that OMB is playing an active role in trying to filter information .
Given this hands - on role that the administration is playing , it would be appropriate to have OMB represented at Thursday 's hearing . "
Last month the administration claimed that 640,329 jobs had been saved or created because of the $ 159 billion in stimulus money allocated as of the end of September .
When the numbers were released October 30 , the White House acknowledged that they were not exact , while touting the work they had done to make the report as accurate as possible .
Ed DeSeve , senior advisor to the President for Recovery Act Implementation , said he had been " scrubbing " the job estimates so much that he now had " dishpan hands and my fingers are worn to the nub . "
As ABCNews.com reported last week , Issa has sent a letter to Devaney challenging the stimulus jobs numbers .
Since the latest stimulus report , there have been numerous media reports that the jobs numbers were inflated .
The Associated Press said the report " significantly overstates the number of jobs spared with money from programs serving families and children , mostly the Head Start preschool program . "
The Denver Post also cited overstated federal figures with the Colorado Head Start program , noting that the government reported 269 jobs saved or created by the program , but only three were actually saved or created .
The Chicago Tribune noted that the administration said $ 4.7 million in stimulus money for schools in north Chicago had saved the jobs of 473 teachers , but the school district only employed 290 teachers .
The statistics – claiming that stimulus money had helped save or create 14,330 school jobs in Illinois – were " riddled with anomalies that raise questions about their validity . "
The Boston Globe also reported that Massachusetts recipients of stimulus funds claimed that 12,000 jobs had been saved or created , " that number has been inflated by miscounts , erroneous figures , or claiming jobs for work not yet started . "
NEW YORK — The Ferraris , Lamborghinis , Porsches and other conventional sports cars were bumped from the showroom of the Manhattan Classic Car Club today in favor of a motley array of alternative vehicles — many of which could likely out - accelerate the world - renowned sports cars .
From high - schoolers modifying a Ford Focus hybrid to run on biofuel to would - be manufacturers of three - wheeled electric vehicles , the X PRIZE 's seven automotive expert judges have winnowed a field of 135 vehicles down to 53 , powered by six different fuel sources and coming from 18 states and 10 countries .
And five of them were on display today in lower Manhattan .
" Forty - three teams have made this cut in the difficult design judging stage , " said Peter Diamandis , founder and chairman of the X PRIZE Foundation , at today 's event announcing the " thoroughly vetted " winners .
" The point is you do n't have to choose between beautiful , safe , affordable " or something that " oh by the way , gets 100 miles per gallon of fuel equivalent . "
The entrants — who ultimately must build a vehicle that gets the equivalent of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline and that could be mass - produced — were judged on both their technical specifications and their business plans , according to Eric Cahill , foundation senior director .
" We 're revisiting a century ago , all over again , " he says , referring to the time before gasoline became the fuel of choice and alternative fuel vehicles — from electric to biofuel — abounded .
" We 're in a competition globally , you could say , trying to keep these jobs in the U.S. "
The event featured five of the surviving designs , from both the " mainstream " and " alternative " tiers of the contest : a modified Ford Focus hybrid from the West Philly Hybrid EVX high school team ; the OptaMotive Surge three - wheeled electric car with a motorcycle engine ; ZAP !'s three - wheeled electric Alias ; the two - seater Tango electric car , intended for commuters ; and AMP's ( Advanced Mechanical Products ) retrofitted Saturn Sky electric sports car .
" We cheated , " says AMP co-founder and software chief Mick Kowitz .
" We have a road - ready vehicle out of the box . "
Of course , the decision by General Motors to shut down Saturn will have an impact on AMP 's chances , although the company can retrofit used Sky 's equally well .
AMP simply swaps out the engine , drivetrain and gas tank of the existing vehicle and plops in their electric version , which relies on repurposed Chinese lithium phosphate batteries to deliver 33 kilowatt - hours of electricity .
It costs $ 25,000 for the retrofit .
" We can go 100 miles on one charge , " Kowitz says .
And therein lies the challenge of the X PRIZE :
With six different power sources — including 22 battery - powered electric vehicles , two cars running on biodiesel , one car running on compressed natural gas , two running on conventional diesel , six capable of burning 85 percent ethanol , and 16 improving the efficiency of burning conventional gasoline — how do you compare efficiency ?
The contest 's " happy medium " of a solution , according to Cahill , is so - called miles - per - gallon equivalent .
In essence , the judges convert any fuel source to its British thermal unit ( Btu ) equivalent and then assess that against how far the vehicle traveled versus how much fuel it consumed .
The equation is miles driven divided by the product of the total energy of all fuels consumed ( in Btus ) divided by the ( energy of one gallon of gasoline in Btus ) .
And to negate some of the advantage this approach automatically gives to electric cars ( whose greenhouse emissions include those generated by electric utilities ) , the award also incorporates other measures in its criteria , including a cap on greenhouse gas emissions of no more than 200 grams per mile .
" We do n't profess for that to be perfect or ideal , " Cahill adds .
But it attempts to be as " close to [ an ] apples - to - apples comparison as possible . "
Outside of Progressive Insurance 's sponsorship of the prize — for which it has promised the overall $ 10 - million purse as well as operating costs — the mainstream of the American auto industry has not opted in to the contest , despite a multiplicity of announcements ranging from GM's Volt to the battery - electric Ford Focus .
But the goal of the X PRIZE , according to Diamandis and Cahill , is to spur innovation — and it may already be having an effect on the existing automakers , weakened by the current recession and changing consumer preferences .
" We may not have them in the competition , but we have them in the competition , if you know what I mean , " Cahill says .
Next up for the remaining contestants in summer 2010 are actual road races — actually more test track demonstrations than NASCAR .
Even so , there will be certain head - to - head competitions staged more as time trials , Cahill says .
" We 're not competing based on driving .
We 're competing based on technology , and there 's nothing standard about it , " he adds .
" We 're not trying to hurt people out there . "
To wit , what the X PRIZE Foundation is trying to do is change the future of the automobile .
A winner will be announced in September 2010 .
" We 're going to do this , vehicles are going to change , " says Glenn Renwick , CEO of Progressive Insurance .
" This is about providing consumers with more choice for fuel - efficient vehicles . "

When was the last time you were on the internet ?
Perhaps you ’re reading this online now .
If not , the chances are you ’ll have recently been browsing some kind of social networking site or news feed – and as lead programmer at Reddit.com , it ’s Christopher Slowe ’s task to make this easier for you .
“ My job is basically to help people waste time , ” he says .
Reddit is a user - generated website where people post funny blogs , interesting news and photos .
Other users then vote the posts up and down the homepage , resulting in a rolling list of the best stuff on the net .
Past gems include the Reddit community helping a fellow user track down his birth mum , and forcing Greenpeace to name its whale “ Mr Splashy Pants ” rather than the more sedate “ Neptune ” in their name - a- whale competition .
Christopher maintains the site , which involves writing anti-spam programmes that detect when someone is trying to use the site to promote their own interests .

These skills were honed far away from the glamour of a dot - com start - up , when Christopher was working in a physics lab at Harvard University , playing with atoms cooled to a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero .
“ I started working at Reddit during the last year of my PhD , when I was a bit disgruntled with it all , ” he says .
At this point , Reddit was still the pipe dream of a few guys throwing around ideas in their student flat .
“ I would work 10 hours a day in the lab and then spend the night doing Reddit stuff .
I do n’t know how I did it , but it was good to switch gears from fiddling around with lab equipment to fiddling around with HTML . ”
His career path may have veered away from his original degree but that ’s the nice thing about start - ups – they ’re usually built around an idea that nobody has previously thought of .
In these situations , past experience may not help , says Christopher .
“ What is needed most is insane determination to see something through when failure is a more likely result than success . ”

How " Soccer Dads " Can Save America 's Daughters
by phil on Friday Nov 13 , 2009 11:58 AM
mainfeed , off - front
For some reason , I procrastinated in watching the Showtime series Californication .
When it first came out , there was a lot of buzz over its treatment of sexual addiction , and so I immediately assumed the show would be filled with gratuitous scenes involving infidelity .
Naturally , a sex addict 's victims must include innocent , committed women , otherwise he'd have trouble getting his fix .
And I realized I was sick of seeing scenes and imagery of infidelity on television .
Maybe it 's because both my parents are conservative immigrants ( dad from India , mom from Philippines — countries where divorce rates are in the single digits ) , that somehow I have a natural revulsion to the casual way in which American television handles cheating .
For a while now , movies and TV shows that involve cheating would repulse me in the same way a bloody car wreck would .
It 's like I 'd have to cover my eyes .
For the longest time , I stayed away from watching Woody Allen 's Vicky Cristina Barcelona , which was marketed as a story about committed women who " get in touch with their inner soul " through flings with European dudes , simply because that gets under my skin .
But , alas , in watching Californication , I discovered something more disturbing than the infidelity .
Surprisingly , it was n't the sexual sin that bothered me the most .
That was actually reasonable , as the main character Hank ( played by David Duchovny ) , is a washed - out sex junkie , and his sexual adventures seem like sordid affairs , rather than wondrous escapades .
* Phew * .
Instead , what bothered me the most is the depiction of his twelve - year - old daughter Becca .
Becca was born out - of - wedlock to Hank 's ex-domestic partner , who Hank is still courting ( even after twelve years ! ) .
In the pilot episode , Hank and his ex-domestic partner are called into school and told that their little angel is getting fondled by boys .
That 's not disturbing to either parent , but then the teacher says that Becca , when scolded , replies , " How else am I supposed to get boys to like me ? "
Fast - forward ten minutes into the episode , and we find Hank rescuing Becca from a house party in Hollywood where threesomes and cocaine are behind random doors .
When Hank reaches Becca poolside , she 's just about ready to take a hit from the marijuana pipe .
And that 's what got under my skin .
That 's the new car wreck for me .
Because when I see that situation , I think of the most frustrating problem imaginable :
How do you deal with a child who is over - eager to lose his or her innocence ?
Most solutions do not work .
Let 's consider the options .
Okay , you can discipline the kid , right ?
Nope , that does n't work .
That just backfires and makes them resent you .
Okay , you could move to Whitopia somewhere , maybe some Mormon community in Utah ?
Nope , that does n't work , as study after study shows that they sin as much in Utah as anywhere else .
Plus , kids have an amazing sense of skepticism toward the meticulous sheltering that their parents construct .
It just inspires a backlash .
Think of all the depressed cutters in stultifying suburbs ( " But honey , I thought we were moving our family to paradise .
What happened to my little angels ? " ) .
You do n't understand how much this frustrates me .
In those brief moments , seeing Becca willfully defy adult expectations , I had this harrowing sense of impending doom .
Little voices entered my head , " Your daughter 's gonna grow up and become the town bike , " or " Your son 's going to be a baggy pants - wearing gang - banger . "
My friend — who is aptly named " Guru " — consoled me , " You should seek out professional help tomorrow and tell them ' I 'm concerned my unborn , un- conceived , no - mother - assigned yet , daughter will smoke pot and have sex at ten years of age . '
Bet your average town psychotherapist has n't seen that one yet . "
But I think I have the answer , and I think it 's full - proof .
This comes not only from my personal experience , but mainly based on how my aunt and her husband have been raising their three daughters in Palos Verdes , a wealthy neighborhood in Los Angeles .
The eldest is seventeen , and the youngest is ten , and somehow these kids have grown up well - adjusted and remained oblivious to the temptations that assault LA 's youth .
By observing them , I 've developed a unifying theory for parenting .
The first thing you 'll notice is that all of them have excellent relationships with their father .
This is backed by studies showing that the date when women lose their virginity is correlated to how good of a relationship they have with their dads .
If the relationship is good , the daughter is more likely to postpone wooing boys in High School , and instead focus on getting into a good college .
Only then , will she grow up sexually toward the end of college or shortly thereafter .
Okay , fine , but how are my cousin 's father - daughter relationships so good ?
Well , for one , the dad works at home as a computer programmer .
So he 's always there .
He 's also interested in doing activities with his daughters .
He 's the dad with the fanny pack and the camcorder , taking his kids to Disneyland and music lessons .
He 's a soccer dad .
He 's dedicated .
You 'll never see him drinking with buddies , blowing off his family .
In addition , both parents are still together .
That 's key , as that maximizes the total time spent in parent - child interaction .
The parents do n't have to trade visitation dates with each other , and instead they have family dinners with their kids , night - after - night .
No parent comes home so late from work that they have to slip their kids some bills to fend for themselves at the local McDonald's .
So what you see as the recurring theme in this picture is " time . "
The number one thing you can do to raise your children well is to spend time with them .
Lots of time .
Talk to them .
Do n't put Baby Einstein on the TV .
Do n't delegate parenting to someone else .
As Chris Rock said , " You know your daughter 's going to become a stripper if she calls her grandma ' Mom ' " .
Be in front of them , all the time .
Be their TV .
Pour constant stimulation and inherent wisdom .
Do n't worry too much about teaching lessons or active parenting .
My parents rarely scolded me .
Instead they smothered me with conversation .
I could n't escape !
They talked to me like an adult , and they talked all the time .
There were barely any " timeouts , " as that would separate me from them .
Even as I got busy with the Internet in the late 90s , locked in my room surfing for hours , I still had every meal with my parents , and often with my grandma , and we'd talk about everything , from politics to business .
To this day , even though I live a thousand plus miles away from home , there is no distance between me and my parents .
The worst case scenario , if you follow this plan , is that your kids become so occupied with their homework and the time spent with you , that they 'll have no time to wander into mischief .
So thank you Californication .
In spite of all of the show 's raunchy titillation , there 's a treasure trove of moral lessons .

After a certain age a parent 's influence over their progeny is minimal while the child 's peer group and environment become increasingly important .
The old truism with an ancient source declares " Give me the child and by age seven ( the stated age varies ) I will give you the adult . "
It IS a truism thus exceptions are not rare but the truism IS a generality .
The parent must avoid being over - bearing or , as the child matures , a backlash may be created wherein the child behaves opposite of what the parent desires as a method of lashing out in anger .
At a certain level of mental development nature prepares the child to " leave the nest . "
And do not even attempt to compare or contrast the cultural norms between India , the Philippines and the USA .
The predominant culture a child is raised within has immense influence upon that child .
Another adage comes to mind ...
" The world needs ditch diggers also . "
Extend that to " The world needs trollops and hussies also . "
Even sluts serve a purpose though it may not be readily evident .
So , stand tall , be proud as you place your arm around your daughter and introduce to others ; " This is my daughter the slut . "

I stumbled onto your blog and read a few post .
I like your style of writing .
Yet there is a second consideration .
Some quangos are necessary .
We may not need Dame Suzi Leather , but we certainly need a Charity Commission .
We also need to have the BBC regulated ( preferably effectively ) until such times as the Tories privatise it .
It will be awfully tempting for the Tories to emulate Labour and replace one lot of cronies with another .
Given the contempt in which the electorate now holds those in public life , this is a temptation to be manfully resisted .
There is no point in Mr Cameron replacing one of Mr Brown 's useless mates with one of his own .
Those jobs that have to be filled should be filled with people who can do them well , irrespective of political allegiance .
The select committee hearing system is valuable in this respect and should be continued and beefed up .
It has to have teeth , to see off any latter - day Ballses .
Similarly , Mr Cameron should try not to put piles of his chums straight into the House of Lords , which would only further devalue that institution .
He will find that cross - bench peers there will enable him to get most of his legislation through , and should allow natural wastage to reduce the size of the upper house just as he plans to reduce the lower .
The cost of residential land has risen for the second consecutive quarter , new data shows , adding to homebuyers ' burden as houses become increasingly unaffordable .
The weighted median price of raw land rose by 1.1 per cent in the June quarter to $ 174,490 , the report from the Housing Industry Association and rpdata.com shows , up from about $ 172,000 in the March quarter , following a year of slight declines .
However , the price of residential land in cities edged down slightly .
HIA chief economist Harley Dale said there was no chance of a new home building recovery gathering the momentum required in coming years if adequate and affordable land supply was not available .
Sydney was the most expensive market with a median price of $ 255,000 , while the Mallee in Victoria was the most affordable at $ 70,000 .
HIA said that of the 40 non -metro areas around Australia , reported on for the first time , more than half - or 25 - saw an increase in median land value over the June 2009 quarter .
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) called on protesters Wednesday to ' scare ' members of Congress into killing the health care reform bill .

Bachmann calls for ' scare ' tactics
In a conference call Wednesday night with bloggers and activists for the advocacy group Americans for Prosperity , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) called on protesters to “ scare ” members of Congress into killing the proposed health care reform bill .
If the protesters succeed in scaring lawmakers , Bachmann said that it could cripple efforts to restructure health care for a decade .

“ Nothing scares members of Congress more than freedom - loving Americans , ” Bachmann said .
She said that members were frightened by the August town hall meetings , but “ then they came back to Washington , and they got back in the bubble and Speaker Pelosi put the hammer down on the Democrats . ”
Bachmann said that last week , as it appeared a House bill could pass , “ I was near despair . ”
Last Thursday , she said that in desperation at the prospect of health care legislation passing , she happened upon the idea of a spontaneous meet - up of opponents of the bill on the steps of the Capitol .
Republican organizers are planning for activists to go into the House office buildings and the U.S. Capitol and confront members directly after a press conference at noon .
“ Do n’t bring your pitchforks , ” Bachmann said , “ bring your video cameras . ”
Bachmann expressed confidence that such efforts would stultify the Democrats ’ efforts .
“ I think that will absolutely scare these members of Congress so much that Pelosi will not get the votes and it will kill the bill .
I think it could be dead for 10 years .
Why wo n’t we ?
Why wo n’t we go for broke ? ”
Last Thursday , Bachmann said she appealed to Republicans but “ the conference did n’t pick it up . ”
The following day , she decided to take matters in her own hands and made her plea directly to Fox News viewers on Sean Hannity ’s program .
On Saturday , Bachmann said she received a call from actor Jon Voight who offered to join her in Washington , followed by a similar call from conservative talk - show host Mark Levin .
Backmann reasserted a claim that Pelosi was considering tightening security in preparation for the activists , which she warned " would be a huge mistake . "
" What 's scary is that Rep. Bachmann will go to any length to protect the profits and abusive tactics of the insurance industry by working against meaningful health reform , " said Kristie Greco , communications director for House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) .
“ You can turn the anger on her , ” Bachmann said .
“ It is not Michele Bachmann ’s fault ” if the activists are angry tomorrow – “ it is Speaker Pelosi’s . ”
Bachmann declined to answer a question on the conference call about the news that her chief of staff , Michelle Marston , was resigning .
Being sad makes people less gullible , improves their ability to judge others and also boosts memory , according to an Australian study .
The study , authored by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales , shows that people in a negative mood were more critical of , and paid more attention to , their surroundings than happier people , who were more likely to believe anything they were told .
" Whereas positive mood seems to promote creativity , flexibility , cooperation , and reliance on mental shortcuts , negative moods trigger more attentive , careful thinking paying greater attention to the external world , " writes Forgas in the November / December edition of Australasian Science .
" Our research suggests that sadness ... promotes information processing strategies best suited to dealing with more demanding situations . "
Urban myths
For the study , Forgas and his team conducted several experiments that started with inducing happy or sad moods in their subjects through watching films and recalling positive or negative events .
In one of the experiments , happy and sad participants were asked to judge the truth of urban myths and rumours and found that people in a negative mood were less likely to believe these statements .
People in a bad mood were also less likely to make snap decisions based on racial or religious prejudices , and they were less likely to make mistakes when asked to recall an event that they witnessed .
The study also found that sad people were better at stating their case through written arguments , which according to Forgas shows that a " mildly negative mood may actually promote a more concrete , accommodative and ultimately more successful communication style . "
" Positive mood is not universally desirable : people in negative mood are less prone to judgmental errors , are more resistant to eyewitness distortions and are better at producing high - quality , effective persuasive messages , " he says .

Three men were killed in the helicopter crash near Catterick An RAF helicopter pilot swore as he flew his aircraft just 5ft above a taxi before a fatal crash in North Yorkshire , an inquest has heard .
Pilot Dave
Sale was heard to say " let 's scare the shit out of this taxi " , two hours before the Puma crashed near Catterick Garrison on 8 August 2007 .
The inquest also heard that the Johnny Cash hit Ring Of Fire was being played over the cockpit speaker .
Flt Lt Sale , 28 , and two other people on board died as a result of the crash .
Co-pilot Flt Lt Robert Hamilton , who survived but was left paraplegic , admitted at the inquest the manoeuvre close to the taxi had been " unprofessional " .
Coroner Geoff
Fell described the taxi incident as the " most compelling piece of evidence " of the inquest .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Flt Lt Sale , from Norton on Teesside , and Sgt Phillip Burfoot , 27 , from Cardiff , were killed in the accident .
Both airmen served with 33 Squadron based at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire .
Pte Sean Tait , 17 , from Glasgow , died two days later in hospital .
The inquest in Harrogate heard how a taxi driver stopped in the road as the helicopter flew low overhead .
The Puma came from an RAF base in Oxfordshire Mr Fell said : " He stopped the car .
He was eyeballing the pilot and described the helicopter 5 ft above his car . "
The coroner played extracts of the last two hours of the cockpit voice recording of the doomed aircraft .
Flt Lt Hamilton , who was the non-handling pilot when the Puma crashed , described the crew 's behaviour as " unprofessional " .
The Puma crashed while taking part in low - level manoeuvres with a total of 12 military personnel on board .
Flt Lt Hamilton described how he enjoyed fish and chips with his crew members before having a cigarette and phoning his girlfriend shortly before the final flight of the day took off .
' Agricultural flying '
He phoned his future wife to say : " It was the best day 's flying I 'd had . "
He told the inquest : " I was given the chance - at 25 years old with a couple of friends on a helicopter - of learning to fly and doing some live trooping without having an instructor looking over me .
A bit more freedom really . "
He admitted he was not as experienced a pilot as his good friend Flt Lt Sale , who was at the controls of the Puma when it crashed at 2050 GMT .
Flt Lt Hamilton described some of his own flying as " agricultural " rather than smooth , but described his friend as a confident and self - assured pilot , but not domineering in the cockpit . "
The inquest continues .

WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama met Monday evening with his national security team to finalize a plan to dispatch some 34,000 additional U.S. troops over the next year to what he 's called " a war of necessity " in Afghanistan , U.S. officials told McClatchy .
Obama is expected to announce his long - awaited decision on Dec. 1 , followed by meetings on Capitol Hill aimed at winning congressional support amid opposition by some Democrats who are worried about the strain on the U.S. Treasury and whether Afghanistan has become a quagmire , the officials said .
The U.S. officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss the issue publicly and because , one official said , the White House is incensed by leaks on its Afghanistan policy that did n't originate in the White House .
They said the commander of the U.S. - led international force in Afghanistan , Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal , could arrive in Washington as early as Sunday to participate in the rollout of the new plan , including testifying before Congress toward the end of next week .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry also are expected to appear before congressional committees .
As it now stands , the plan calls for the deployment over a nine - month period beginning in March of three Army brigades from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell , Ky. , and the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum , N.Y. , and a Marine brigade from Camp Lejeune , N.C. , for as many as 23,000 additional combat and support troops .
In addition , a 7,000 - strong division headquarters would be sent to take command of U.S. - led NATO forces in southern Afghanistan - to which the U.S. has long been committed - and 4,000 U.S. military trainers would be dispatched to help accelerate an expansion of the Afghan army and police .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to brief America 's NATO allies after next week 's announcement , and the allies are to meet again on Dec. 7 in Belgium to discuss whether some other nations might contribute additional troops .
The Monday evening meeting was the ninth that Obama has held on the crisis in Afghanistan , where the worsening war entered its ninth year last month .
This year has seen violence reach unprecedented levels as the Taliban and allied groups have gained strength and expanded their reach .
A U.S. military official used the term " decisional " to describe Monday evening 's meeting among Obama , Vice President Joe Biden , Gates , Clinton , National Security Adviser Jim Jones , Eikenberry and senior U.S. military commanders .
The administration 's plan contains " off-ramps , " points starting next June at which Obama could decide to continue the flow of troops , halt the deployments and adopt a more limited strategy or " begin looking very quickly at exiting " the country , depending on political and military progress , one defense official said .
" We have to start showing progress within six months on the political side or military side or that 's it , " the U.S. defense official said .
It 's " not just how we get people there , but what 's the strategy for getting them out , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday .

The approach is driven in part by concerns that Afghan President Hamid Karzai wo n't keep his promises to root out corruption and support political reforms , and in part by growing domestic opposition to the war , the U.S. officials said .
As McClatchy reported last month , the Obama administration has been quietly working with U.S. allies and Afghan officials on an " Afghanistan Compact , " a package of political reforms and anti-corruption measures that it hopes will boost popular support for Karzai and erase the doubts about his legitimacy raised by his fraud - tainted re-election .
The British government is offering to host a conference early next year to win international support for the compact .
Last week , Clinton suddenly adopted a more conciliatory tone toward Karzai , whom she and other administration officials had been pressing to clean up the rampant corruption and cut his ties to local warlords , some of whom traffic in opium .
In an interview with Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty , she said that Karzai had demonstrated " good faith " and added : " Well , there are warlords and there are warlords . "
As part of its new plan , the administration , which remains skeptical of Karzai , will " work around him " by working directly with provincial and district leaders , a senior U.S. defense official told McClatchy .
The plan adopted by Obama would fall well short of the 80,000 troops McChrystal suggested in August as a " low - risk option " that would offer the best chance to contain the Taliban - led insurgency and stabilize Afghanistan .
It splits the difference between two other McChrystal options : a " high - risk " approach that called for 20,000 additional troops and a " medium - risk " option that would add 40,000 to 45,000 troops .
There are 68,000 U.S. troops and 42,000 from other countries in Afghanistan .
The U.S. Army 's recently revised counterinsurgency manual estimates that an all - out counterinsurgency campaign in a country with Afghanistan 's population would require about 600,000 troops .
The administration 's plan is expected to encounter opposition on Capitol Hill , where some senior Democrats have suggested that the administration may need to raise taxes in order to pay for the additional troops .
Obama campaigned saying that he'd fund the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from the defense budget , but Mullen has said that the Afghan war - which some administration officials privately concede could cost $ 700 billion to $ 1 trillion over 10 years - might require a supplemental funding bill next year .
The administration 's protracted deliberations have escalated into open warfare between McChrystal and his supporters and advocates of a more limited strategy led by Biden and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel that often played out in dueling leaks to news organizations .
It ’s amazing , the standards of “ newsworthiness ” exhibited by some outlets .
When Rep. Alan Grayson called a female lobbyist a “ K - Street whore , ” Fox News went into overdrive , smelling blood in the water .
But when one of their own drops a prostitution analogy in reference to a female lawmaker , not a word of criticism eeks out .
Take , for example , Glenn Beck , who said recently of Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) , “ So we know you ’re hookin ’ but you ’re just not cheap . ”

Regarding Grayson ’s “ K - Street ” quip , right - wing blogger Michell Malkin suggested to Republican opinion - maker Sean Hannity that had a conservative said something similar , “ we ’d be strung up by our toes . ”
During a Sunday appearance on CNN , Bill Press , a radio talk show host , took exception to the clear hypocrisy .
“ Look , I ’m a talk show host , ” he said .
“ I ’m for talk show hosts almost getting away with almost anything they say , on the radio particularly .
But , I ’m amazed at how much Fox lets Glenn Beck get away with .
I think he is a ticking time bomb and one day he is going to explode in the face of Roger Ailes and they ’re going to be sorry they gave him that television show . ”

In Arkansas and Oklahoma , men and women marry young — half of first - time brides in these states were age 24 or younger on their wedding day .
These states also have above - average shares of women who divorced in 2007 - 2008.1
It ’s the opposite state of affairs in Massachusetts and New York .
Their residents marry late — half of ever - married New York men were older than age 30 when they first wed .
These states also have below - average shares of men and women who divorced in 2007 - 2008 .
Remember the classic country song : “ All My Ex’s Live in Texas ” ?
Well , George Strait was on to something .
Looking at numbers ,
Texas is indeed home to more thrice - married adults than any other state , about 428,000 women and 373,000 men .
But that ’s partly because it ’s home to so many people , period .
Looking at rates , about 6 % of Texans who ever have been married have wed three times or more .
That is similar to the national average ( 5 % ) , but well below the leaders in this category — the neighboring states of Arkansas and Oklahoma — where about 10 % of all ever - married adults have had at least three spouses .
Meantime , back in New York and Massachusetts , just 2 % of ever - married adults have been married at least three times , placing them at the bottom on this measure among the 50 states .
These findings are drawn from the recently released 2008 American Community Survey , which offers the most detailed portrait yet from the U.S. Census Bureau of marriage and divorce statistics at the state level .
This is the first time the survey has included estimates of marriage and divorces within the previous 12 months , duration of marriages and Americans married multiple times .
National Picture
On the national level , the Census Bureau survey showed that a shrinking share of Americans are married2 — 52 % of males ages 15 and older and 48 % of females ages 15 and older .
The proportion of Americans who are currently married has been diminishing for decades and is lower than it has been in at least half a century .
The age range used in standard Census tabulations dates back to the days when more people married as young teenagers .
Among Americans 18 and older , the proportion currently married , but not separated , is 55 % for men and 50 % for women .
Nationally , the median age at first marriage has been climbing for decades :
It now stands at 28 for men and 26 for women , meaning that half are younger and half are older when they wed .
Among married Americans , the median duration of their married life in 2008 was 18 years .
Among men , 9 % are divorced ; among women , 12 % are .
About 2.3 million men reported that they wed within the previous year , and 1.2 million said they divorced .
About 2.2 million women said they wed and 1.3 million said they divorced .
About one - in - twenty Americans who ever have been married said they had been married three or more times .
That comes to 4 million men and 4.5 million women .
State Highs and Lows
When states are ranked on a variety of estimates , most are clustered closely near the median or average .
But the range of values can vary widely , and some of the same states stand out as high or low in more than one category .
Several states in the Midwest and Mountain regions have among the highest shares of men and women who are currently married .
In Idaho , 58 % of men and 56 % of women live with a spouse .
In Iowa , 56 % of men and 53 % of women do .
In Utah , 56 % of both men and women are currently married .
At the opposite end , only 47 % of men in Alaska are currently married , as are 48 % of women in that state .
Among men in Rhode Island and New Mexico , 48 % are married .
Among women in Rhode Island and New York , 43 % are .
The District of Columbia ranks well below all states in its share of men and women currently married — 28 % and 23 % .
Washington , D.C. , is more like a city than a state in its characteristics , so it may not be appropriate to compare it with the 50 states .
Looking at divorced adults , 13 % of Nevada ’s men and 16 % of its women fit in that category , as do 12 % of Maine ’s men and 15 % of its women .
They are among the states with the largest shares of currently divorced residents , a distinction they share with Oklahoma .
States with larger shares of the thrice - married tend to be states where people marry young , such as Arkansas and Oklahoma .
However , one exception is Utah , which does not rank high for three - plus marriages , but whose residents have among the youngest median ages at first marriage : 24 for women and 26 for men .
Half the men in the District of Columbia , New York and Rhode Island are 30 years of age or older when they first marry .
Half the women in Connecticut , Massachusetts and the District are 28 or older .
These states rank low in the proportion of people who are married and also in the proportion of married adults who are on at least their third marriage .
States where people marry young also often have high rates of recent marriage , which is expressed as the number of marriages per 1,000 men or women within the previous 12 months .
States with high rates of recent marriage include Utah ( 28 marriages per 1,000 women and nearly the same for men ) , Idaho and Arkansas .
Alaska also ranks high on this measure .
A similar measure — number of divorces within the previous 12 months per 1,000 women — tends to be high in states where women marry young , such as Oklahoma and Idaho .
But the same link is not as strong for men : Alaska and Wyoming , for example , are among the top states for recently divorced men , but they are not states where men marry especially young .
Correlations in Marriage Patterns
Some state - level patterns of marriage and divorce correlate3 with the overall socioeconomic characteristics and political behavior in those states .
This does not mean that one pattern causes the other to happen , only that both tend to be true in the same place .
A state ’s education levels , for example , tend to be associated with the median age at marriage and the multiple - marriage patterns of its residents .
In states with high shares of college - educated adults , men and women marry at older ages , a finding supported by other research indicating that highly educated individuals marry later in life .
In states with low shares of college - educated adults , adults are more likely than average to marry three or more times .
In states with low income levels , men are more likely than average to have been married three or more times .
For this analysis , correlation also was tested between a state ’s marriage or divorce statistics and the share of its 2008 presidential election vote that went Democratic .
States with high shares of Democratic votes tended to have lower shares of currently married residents , lower shares of adults married at least three times and low rates of marriages within the previous year .
Residents of states with high shares of Democratic votes tend to marry at older ages than residents of states with low shares of Democratic votes .
This analysis did not find a strong correlation between divorce statistics — either a state ’s share of divorced adults or its rate of divorce within the previous year — and socioeconomic indicators ( income and education ) or 2008 presidential election patterns .
There was a strong correlation , however , between young age at first marriage for women and a high divorce rate for women within the previous 12 months .
Correlation also was tested to see whether a state ’s religiosity was associated with marriage and divorce patterns .
Religiosity was expressed as the proportion of a state ’s residents who said in response to a survey that religion was “ very important ” in their life .

However , this analysis did not find a strong association between a state ’s religiosity and its marriage or divorce patterns .

Since starting its slide in 2000 , the world - wide production of gold has finally hit “ terminal decline , ” according to reports citing Barrick Gold , the largest gold miner in the world .
In an interview with The Daily Telegraph during a London gold conference , Barrick President Aaron Regent said that one could argue that Earth has reached “ peak gold , ” as new supplies of the ore are increasingly difficult to find .

“ The supply crunch has helped push gold to an all - time high , reaching $ 1,118 an ounce at one stage yesterday , ” the paper noted .
“ The key driver over recent days has been the move by India ’s central bank to soak up half of the gold being sold by the International Monetary Fund .
It is the latest sign that the rising powers of Asia and the commodity bloc are growing wary of Western paper money and debt . ”
The report continued : “ China has quietly doubled holdings to 1,054 tonnes and is thought to be adding gradually on price dips , creating a market floor .
Gold remains a tiny fraction of its $ 2.3 trillion in foreign reserves . ”
However , in an interview with The Financial Times , Regent cautioned that gold is still susceptible to sell - offs .
“ Mr Regent said he expected the gold price to generally trend upward , supported by weakening currencies , rising investment demand , and tightening supply , ” according to the Times .
“ But he said the price could be highly volatile . ”
Reuters added : “ ‘ There is no reason why we should expect gold not to sell off , ’ the paper quoted Aaron Regent as saying .
‘ It is a commodity like any other . ’
Gold XAU= shot up to another record at $ 1,121.60 an ounce on Thursday as a weaker U.S. dollar lifted the metal ’s appeal as an alternative investment to currencies .
Bullion has now renewed record highs for six out of the past eight sessions .
But Regent said forecasts of the long - term gold price falling below $ 900 an ounce were ‘ on the light side ’ , adding that bullion remained susceptible to sell - offs despite its bullish outlook . ”

Barrick is currently in the process of closing its hedge book , generally considered to mean the company is betting on the price of gold to rise .
Hedging is a method gold traders use to protect profits from price volatility .
Saying Goodbye to the Borrow and Spend Economy
Let ’s get this straight .
Household credit is shrinking …
Profits are shrinking …
Employment is shrinking …
Housing values are shrinking …
The wage base is shrinking …
But the recession is over !
Whoa…how is that possible ?
This weekend ’s news brought no surprises .
For example , the housing picture is still depressing – unless you ’re a buyer .
There ’s “ no bottom in sight ” to Florida condo prices , says Barron’s .
And Reuters warns that option ARM mortgages “ are about to explode . ”
At least , that ’s what the attorney general of the sovereign state of Iowa says .
The option gives the homeowner the right to pay only the interest ( or in some cases less than the interest ) for the first few years .
They ’re sometimes called IO mortgages ( interest only ) .
And now these mortgages , written at the height of the bubble , are beginning to reset to more normal terms .
According to Reuters , 128,000 people in Arizona alone will face reset IO mortgages next year .
How much more will these people have to pay ?
Between 5 and 10 times what they ’re paying now .
Almost all these homeowners are underwater .
They bought at the bubbliest period .
How many of them can afford a 400 % increase in their mortgage payments ?
How many of them will be willing to pay ?
Not many .
That ’s why a new wave of foreclosures is coming .
And that ’s why house prices are likely to keep going down ; the supply is going to increase , while the demand ( willing and able buyers ) will probably stay steady .
Meanwhile , the California jobless rate has risen above 12 % .
But let ’s go back to the first item – shrinking consumer credit .
This is the key thing .
The expansion of the US economy – broadly speaking – from 1945 to 2007 depended on consumers ’ willingness to go further into debt .
Wages rose during the first half of that period – supporting consumption .
But as the great boom continued , more and more of it was based on credit , not on wages .
At the end , it was almost all credit expansion .
Consumers were n’t earning more money … nevertheless , they kept spending more and more money .
How did they do it ?
By borrowing .
Without this borrowing the economy would not have grown .
And now what ’s happening ?
Well , consumers are n’t borrowing anymore .
Consumer credit is going the other way , shrinking rather than growing .
The feds are trying to counteract this major trend .
This year , they ’re borrowing $ 1.7 trillion .
Consumers wo n’t borrow ; no problem , the feds will borrow for them !
So far , the feds have put at risk about $ 13 trillion in order to counteract the downturn .
This is about equal to the amount that Americans had lost in the crash .
But while the crash wiped out $ 13 trillion in housing and stock market wealth , the feds have no obvious way to put the money back .
Banks were easy to reflate .
Bankers and federales are tight with each other ; they ’re happy to share out the taxpayers ’ money .
But getting money to the consumer is a different matter .
The banks do n’t lend and the consumers do n’t borrow .
Of the $ 13 trillion the feds have put at risk…very little has actually made its way to the consumer economy .
Result : no new boom in consumer spending … no new boom in hiring … no new boom in production or profits .
Pity the poor investors who are counting on a bull market .
Profits are n’t increasing .
So the increase in stock prices is based on an increase in the multiple .
As stocks rise , investors pay more for each dollar of earnings .
Unless there is a big boom coming , this will turn out to be a mistake .
The Dow rose 36 points on Friday .
Gold ended the day at $ 1008 .
And the dollar keeps sinking ; on Friday , American visitors to Europe found that it cost $ .147 per euro .
“ Things have changed so much , ” said a colleague yesterday .
“ We ’ve been telling readers that they could live so much more cheaply overseas .
But now , about the cheapest place in the world to live is the US … ”
We spent Sunday with the publisher of International Living magazine .
“ Prices have fallen so much in Florida that you really get more for your money there than practically anywhere else , ” she continued .
“ I think Florida may be cheaper than Buenos Aires , ” added son Will , who ’s been living in Argentina for the last three years .
Housing is cheap in the United States .
In Texas and Arkansas , housing is probably the best bargain on the planet .
Food prices are going up ; still food in the US is much cheaper than it is in Europe .
And cars ?
We have a friend in Paris who goes back to the US to buy his Mercedes .
Even with the cost of shipping the car back to France … and the cost of refitting the car to European standards …he still saves about $ 10,000 .
“ I was just in Paris , ” Will continued .
“ You pay $ 10 for a cup of coffee and a croissant .
In Florida , I can get the ‘ Breakfast Special ’ for $ 5.95 … and it has everything .
Pancakes .
Bacon… Everything . ”
“ But what is amazing , ” continued our International Living colleague , “ is that interest in moving overseas is going up .
It ’s not about money .
Apparently , a lot of Americans are just fed up …or afraid .
They want to get out .
They see taxes going up or they see the society going down the tubes .
I do n’t know .
But many say they just do n’t like the way things are going .
“ One thing I hear is that they think American society has become meaner … ruder …less civil .
You ca n’t have a polite discussion of politics anymore .
People get really upset and nasty .
I mean , someone yelled out and called Obama a liar in the middle of a joint session of Congress .
And a substantial part of the US population regards the guy – the guy who called him a liar – as a hero .
They think Obama is a traitor …
“ I think this is really a result of the financial downturn .
People feel betrayed .
Let down .
They think something is very wrong .
That the nation is in decline .
So they look for someone to blame .
And they tend to blame each other .
Conservatives blame liberals .
Liberals blame conservatives .
They blame the bankers .
They blame the capitalists .
They blame the government .
“ I guess that ’s what happens when you get a major correction or a big financial crisis . ”
We recalled what happened in Germany in the ’ 20s and ’30s :
“ Germany was probably the most civilized country in the world – before WWI .
Artists , philosophers , scientists , mathematicians , musicians …
Germany had the best in the world .
The war shook the public ’s faith in its leaders .
But then , according to people who lived through the period , the financial crises of the ’ 20s and ’30s were worse .
Hyperinflation … depression … strikes …a decade of financial chaos and disruptions led to a breakdown in social order .
By the early thirties , groups of communists and fascists were battling in the streets .
People seemed to leave the center and move to extreme positions .
Soon , the Nazis had the upper hand and Hitler was voted into the government . ”
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Environmentalists hope the push in Congress for climate change legislation is not overwhelmed by the debate dominating Capitol Hill over changing the U.S. healthcare system .
But it might be .

Already two months behind schedule and unsure whether enough Democrats will play along , Senate leaders still aim to pass a bill by December when a United Nations summit convenes in Copenhagen to set worldwide goals for reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants .
But as the debate over healthcare legislation rages and with President Barack Obama due to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to try to rescue the faltering plan , it was unclear whether rattled lawmakers will have the time -- or the inclination -- to take on climate change .
“ It ’s not an impossibility , but it ’s certainly not a slam - dunk and never has been , ” said Frank O’Donnell , president of the activist group Clean Air Watch .
The healthcare debate , O’Donnell added , “ has basically sucked all the oxygen out of the room . ”
With many moderate Democrats facing a tough vote on healthcare , O’Donnell wondered whether they also would be willing to do so on an environmental bill that could increase consumers ’ energy costs .
“ How many salvos in one year can they take ? ” O’Donnell asked .
Staffers at the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have been working behind the scenes on language intended to reel in enough of those moderates .
Senator Barbara Boxer , who heads the committee , has been working off of a bill passed by the House of Representatives intended to cut utility and factory emissions of greenhouse gases by 17 percent by 2020 , from 2005 levels .
It could be late September or beyond before Boxer is ready to unveil her bill .
Beyond healthcare , the climate bill might have to compete for time with some other major debates , such as new financial industry controls , annual spending bills , U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan and some must - do tax measures .
AVERTING THE “ ABYSS ”
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday said the world was “ heading toward an abyss ” without swift action to reduce carbon emissions .
Without it , he told a 155 - nation climate conference in Geneva , melting polar ice and rising sea levels will threaten cities from Tokyo to New Orleans .
Environmentalists hope that such high - profile attention will help jolt Congress toward action .
While public support for healthcare legislation has eroded in recent weeks , environmentalists are heartened by polls indicating that voters want Congress to fix global warming by expanding alternative energy sources such as biofuels and solar and wind power .
“ Support for energy and climate legislation held firm and ticked up a bit ” lately , said Joseph Mendelson , the National Wildlife Federation ’s director of global warming policy .
But if the legislation sputters in the Senate , that would not halt Obama ’s drive to reduce carbon dioxide pollution .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering regulations that would force large polluters -- those spewing at least 25,000 tons annually -- to reduce their emissions .
“ EPA can do some important things to start to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in our country , ” EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said .
Interviewed on Thursday on National Public Radio , Jackson noted that her agency has authority under the existing Clean Air Act , but like Obama , she prefers Congress pass comprehensive legislation .

( CNN ) -- Tracy Rodriguez of Houston , Texas , is not a trained private investigator or police officer .
But with a gentle tap on her iPhone screen , the mother of three can access information revealing the sex offenders who live within a 10 - mile radius of where her children practice sports or watch movies .
Tracy Rodriguez , who is holding the iPhone , uses the device to locate sex offenders .
The information , provided by an iPhone app called Offender Locator , helps Rodriguez make more informed choices , she says .
When the app pops open on her phone , there is an eerie sketch of a man 's face .
Then , the app asks for an address .
" I am constantly worrying about the well - being of my family , " says Rodriguez , who uses the app several times daily .
" You ca n't be too careful . "
Since the iPhone launched more than two years ago , a handful of crime - fighting tools have emerged among the thousands of innovative apps .
They give ordinary citizens the capability to sleuth and guard themselves against crime .
Users can conduct a background check during a dinner date or avoid walking through a high - crime area .
The Offender Locator app has been downloaded more than a million times , breaking into the top 10 most popular apps list on iTunes when it made its debut in June .
Some BlackBerry models and Google 's Android also offer crime - fighting apps .
And the app industry is bound to grow , which probably means more inventive tools to fight crime .
The Yankee Group Research Inc. , a company with expertise in global connectivity , estimates U.S. smartphone app downloads will reel in $ 4.2 billion in revenue by 2013 .
For the past decade , law enforcement agencies have relied on e-mail and texting to interact with the public .
Now , iPhone apps are expanding their reach by allowing people to access information wherever they are , as long as they have cell phone service .
" I think mostly it will be used by users who want to do their own little reporting , " says MG Siegler , a writer at TechCrunch.com , a blog about technology start - ups .
" These apps are definitely very popular . "
In February , the FBI worked with NIC Inc. , a contractor that develops Web pages for the government , to construct an app that provides updates of the 10 most wanted fugitives and terrorists .
So far , there have been more 541,000 downloads in 170 countries since the app was released in February .
This month , Intelius Inc. , a company that provides public records online , is launching an iPhone app called Date Check , which is " like having a private investigator in your purse , " company officials say .
During a blind date , the Date Check user can snoop right away by punching in the stranger 's name .
Within seconds , users can read records showing whether their date is a convicted rapist or owns a million - dollar property .
" It gives you peace of mind of who you might be interacting with , " said John Arnold , executive vice president of Intelius .
But Lillie Coney , associate director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a public interest research group , warns that the crime - fighting apps can spread inaccurate and misleading information .
Public records can have errors , and sometimes , court records may be expunged or sex offenders are removed from registries .
Some apps carry disclosures that say the information may not be accurate or up - to - date .
" It 's turning everyone into a police officer , " she says .
" Is that the way society 's resources should be used ? "
Most of the information available on these iPhone apps is already accessible online .
For example , states require sex offenders to register and distribute their personal information on Web sites and in community notifications .
App makers say their features protect the public 's safety by keeping individuals informed .
The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children created the AMBER Alert app this year , which provides a real - time feed with details about the victim , abductor and vehicle .
The app is programmed to let the user automatically send tips to the center .
Crime Spot , an iPhone app made by Excelltech Inc. , generates maps of where crimes have occurred .
This can help users , particularly travelers unfamiliar with a city , avoid particular routes or neighborhoods .
Users can also report a crime .
Another app , Citixen Me , created by JasonWeiner LLC , lets users police their communities by reporting drunk drivers and nuisances .
" They work for the agencies that are proactive and believe in crime prevention , " says Mike Lopilato , head of Crime Watch USA , a nonprofit that provides emergency notifications through texts and e-mails for law enforcement agencies .
" For those agencies into crime solving , they can send alerts and notify the public that something has happened . "
But just how effective can the iPhone be in fighting crime ?
Lopilato says the apps like Crime Spot , designed to guard the public from crime , instead could help criminals .
They could use the information to avoid high - crime areas where police may be waiting .
Michael McCauley , founder of Iphoneappreviews.net , says people may give false crime reports , which would undermine the goal of the app .
" The thing is there needs to be some way to rate the credibility of the reports being submitted , " McCauley says .
In Montgomery County , Maryland , police are worried about PhantomALERT , an iPhone app expected to be released in the next few months that warns drivers about DUI checkpoints .
To use this app , invented by Joe Scott , the user downloads information from the company 's
Web site that specifies where checkpoints , red - light cameras and speeding traps are .
For about $ 10 a month , the phone will send out an audio alert to the driver to help dodge tickets .
" That is a risk to public safety , allowing a potentially impaired driver to avoid detection and possibly harm him or herself or someone else on the roadway , " says Lucille Baur , a spokeswoman for the police department .
But Baur admits the app's ability to warn drivers about red lights or speeding zones could help drivers slow down .
A few weeks ago in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , an iPhone helped a robbery victim retaliate .
Robbers snatched the victim's wallet , credit cards and iPhone , which was equipped with a global positioning function .
Using a computer , the victim was able to trace his phone to a nearby Walmart , and then to a restaurant .
It was n't long before police detained the suspects at a gas station and recovered the stolen items .

Obama : ' Sometimes Democrats can be their own worst enemies '
Christina Bellantoni has the details :
" There are going to be some disagreements and details to work out ... but I want to say to you Democrats , let 's make sure that we keep our eye on the prize , " Obama said during a Webcast for the thousands of Organizing for America volunteers who were gathered for call parties across the country .
" Sometimes Democrats can be their own worst enemies , Democrats are an opinionated bunch ... y'all are thinking for yourselves , " he said .
" I like that in you , but it 's time for us to make sure that we finish the job here .
We are this close and we 've got to be unified . "
Obama said " the bill you least like in Congress right now , of the five that are out there , " would give 29 million uninsured Americans health care , would ban preexisting conditions and would create an exchange that would encourage competition among ensurers .
Interestingly , the " worst enemies " line was n't in Obama 's prepared remarks .
That was an ad lib , or a late addition .
I 've copied Obama 's full speech beneath the fold .
THE PRESIDENT : Hello , everybody !
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
Please , everybody have a seat .
Back to your salads -- ( laughter ) -- or whatever they 're serving .
It is good to be back in New York .
( Applause . )
Always great to be in New York .
I -- for those Yankee fans out there , you 're still up 2 to 1 . ( Applause . )
You should be all right .
I love this town , and I -- want to know how much I appreciate everything that so many of the people in this room have done , not just for me , but for the country as a whole .
There are a lot of folks here who were on the frontlines of our campaign , and people who devoted their time and their energy and their reputations to backing some guy nobody had ever heard of .
( Laughter . )
And I will never forget that .
And not a day goes by that I do n't think about the obligations that I have as a consequence of this extraordinary honor that 's been bestowed on me -- the obligation I 've got to every American and everybody who put their hopes into a cause that was n't just about winning an election , but was about changing the country .
Now , it 's been nine months since the Obama family packed up and moved to Washington .
And I want to report that Malia and Sasha are doing very well .
I got more requests for Malia and Sasha meetings during the photo line than -- ( laughter ) -- you can't afford a fundraiser involving Malia and Sasha .
( Laughter . )
I just want you to know .
I 'm cheap .
You guys can't afford that .
They are doing great .
Michelle is obviously an extraordinary first lady .
( Applause . )
And we 've got Bo , my dog , who -- I now rank fourth in influence in the house -- ( laughter ) -- behind Michelle , Malia , and Sasha .
I 'm slightly ahead of Bo. ( Laughter . )
But he 's coming on fast .
( Laughter . )
It 's important for all of us to remember , I think , what was happening less than a year ago when we walked into the Oval Office , because I notice that there 's been a little bit of selective memory going on , some collective amnesia on the part of some folks about what we were facing .
We were seeing an economic crisis unlike any that we had seen in generations .
We were losing 700,000 jobs per month .
Our financial system was on the brinks -- brink of collapse .
Economists of every stripe were suggesting that we might slip into a Great Depression .
That was just nine months ago .
And think about what we 've done since that time .
We acted boldly and swiftly to pass a Recovery Act that 's made a difference in the lives of families across America .
As promised , we put a tax cut in the pockets of 95 percent of working families in America -- the most progressive tax cut in history , benefiting 7 million families right here in New York .
( Applause . )
We extended and increased unemployment insurance to help 12 million people get by during tough times .
That 's helped more than a million folks here in New York .
We made COBRA 65 percent cheaper so that if people were out there looking for jobs , they could actually still keep health care for themselves and their families .
( Applause . )
We provided relief to states , including New York , to make sure that teachers and firefighters and police officers were n't laid off .
According to initial reports , this has saved some 250,000 jobs in our schools all across America -- 250,000 jobs ; teachers that would have been laid off had it not been for the Recovery Act .
We supported more than 30,000 loans to small businesses , including nearly 2,000 in this state , helping to create thousands of private sector jobs .
But the Recovery Act was n't just about tax cuts ; it was n't just about providing emergency relief for middle - class families and working families who bore the brunt of this recession .
It was also the largest investment in education in American history .
Think about that .
The largest investment in education in American history -- and one that is promoting reform in states all across the country .
It was the largest investment in clean energy in American history .
( Applause . )
It was the largest boost to medical research and basic research in American history .
( Applause . )
And it was the single largest investment in our nation 's infrastructure since Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s , an investment that 's putting people to work all across this country rebuilding not just our roads and our bridges and crumbling schools , but also creating a whole new infrastructure , a smart grid to help clean energy travel from where it 's produced to where it 's needed -- broadband lines extending into communities that do n't have it .
So that was pretty good for the first month .
( Applause . )
And then we kept on going , and we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , because I think women should get paid the same as men for doing the same work .
( Applause . )
We lifted the ban on stem cell research to begin restoring science to its rightful place in America .
( Applause . )
We extended health insurance to 11 million children in America -- ( applause ) -- 4 million of whom previously had no insurance at all .
We passed a service bill named for Ted Kennedy , which is encouraging folks to give back to their communities all across the country , expanding Peace Corps and AmeriCorps .
We passed legislation to protect consumers from unfair rate hikes , and the most comprehensive credit card reform legislation in a generation .
We passed laws to make sure that our children were n't being targeted by big tobacco companies , housing fraud legislation .
These were all things that we had been fighting for for years , that we signed into law in the first nine months .
And for the first time in history , we 've begun to put in place a new national policy aimed at both increasing fuel economy and reducing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States .
( Applause . )
And while I was in line , I was talking to a few folks who are involved in the environmental movement , and they will affirm -- we 're not doing this with a lot of fanfare -- that we have been as productive in cleaning our environment and focusing on the big challenges having to do with our air and our water as any administration that 's been around in a very long time .
For decades .
If we stop now , if we did n't do anything else for the next three months , we would have had one of the most productive legislative sessions in decades -- already .
( Applause . )
Now , that 's what we 've been able to do at home .
I 've got a few things going on abroad .
( Laughter . )
We 've begun a new era of engagement .
We 're working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , to seek the long - term goal of a safer , more secure world that is free of nuclear weapons .
( Applause . )
We are -- we 're working in concert with nations on just about every continent to stem our global economic downturn and to confront climate change .
We banned torture .
We 're rebuilding our military .
We 're reaffirming our alliances .
We 've begun to leave Iraq to its own people .
We 've made progress in taking the fight to al - Qaeda , from Pakistan to Somalia to Indonesia .
We 're making progress there , too .
But the reason you 're here tonight , the reason I 'm here tonight , the reason Tim Kaine is doing such an extraordinary job as our DNC chair , even though he 's got another job as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia , is because we all know our work is far from over .
There 's still far too many Americans who are out of work right now ; they 're seeing their hours and their wages reduced .
There are too many Americans who are subject to the whims of the insurance companies when it comes to their health care , being dropped or discriminated against because they 've got a preexisting condition .
Too many millions can't afford insurance in the first place .
We know that we still face enormous challenges in this country , and that 's not news to you .
Lately there had been some discussion -- you know , what 's taking him so long ?
Health care seems to -- it 's been nine months , we have n't solved world hunger yet .
( Laughter and applause . )
And I try to explain to people , part of what was remarkable about the campaign that we ran , was it was n't easy .
That 's how we knew it was worth it .
We knew we were fighting against the status quo and fighting against inertia .
And it took a lot of hard work and a lot of effort and a lot of defying the odds .
That was part of what made it special .
And I know you guys did n't sign up for this election because I was a sure thing .
And you did n't sign up because you thought that somehow all the fun stuff of the election would just keep on continuing into governing .
You know , the poster was nice , and we had " Yes we can , " nice slogans -- ( laughter ) -- but that 's not why you did this .
You did this because you understood that we were at a crossroads in our history ; that the future of our children , our grandchildren , our great - grandchildren was going to be at stake , and that we were going to have to completely rethink how we were dealing with key sectors of our economy and key aspects of our national security .
So you understood that now is the time to build a clean energy economy that will free our nation from the grip of foreign oil and generate new green jobs in the process , jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced .
You understood that now is the time to transform our education system so that every child is prepared to compete in this new global economy , that now was the time to make sure that we put new rules of the road in our financial sector to prevent the kinds of abuse and excess on Wall Street that led us to this crisis .
You understood that .
And you also understood that the insurance companies and the banks and the oil companies might not be crazy about some of these changes ; that they were doing just fine under the status quo .
So nobody thought this was going to be easy .
We talked about this during the campaign .
While I 'm in New York , I want to stress something about this financial reform effort .
The financial industry is essential to a healthy economy and to the well - being of our economy .
That 's why we stepped in to prevent a collapse that would have had far - reaching and devastating consequences for the American people -- steps , by the way , that were not wildly popular and still are n't among the American people .
But it was the right thing to do .
But we also know we should never again have to face potential calamity because of reckless speculation and deceptive practices and short - sightedness and self - interestedness from a few .
So if there are members of the financial industry in the audience today , I would ask that you join us in passing what are necessary reforms .
Do n't fight them , join us on them .
( Applause . )
This is important for our country .
And in the long run it will be good for the financial industry to have a level playing field in which everybody knows the rules and everybody knows that the rules will be enforced , and people are competing not by how confusing you can make things and how you can avoid rules , but competing because you 're offering innovative good products that are helping grow the American economy and putting people to work out on Main Street .
When I hear some folks who had just been taking taxpayer bailout money suddenly say , " What do you want from me ? " -- when I hear stories about small businesses and medium - sized businesses not being able to get loans despite Wall Street being back , very profitable , that tells me that people are n't thinking about their obligations , our mutual obligations to each other , the fact that we 're in this together .
So what 's true for financial reform , what 's true for energy reform , is also true for health insurance reform .
You know why this is so important .
You know if you 're an employer , you 've seen what 's happening to the premiums that you 're paying on behalf of your employees ; and if you 're an employee , you 've how your employer is passing on some of those costs to you .
Premiums have doubled over the past decade .
They could double again in the next decade .
Millions of people in this country have been discriminated against because of preexisting conditions .
More and more companies are dropping their coverage ; more and more families struggling to pay health care even as insurance out - of - pocket costs rise year after year .
Now , here 's the good news .
We are closer than we have ever been to passing health insurance reform that will make quality , affordable -- ( applause ) -- that will make quality care affordable for people who do n't have insurance , and it will bring stability and security to people who do have insurance , and that will slow the skyrocketing costs of health insurance for our families and our businesses , our state and federal budgets .
Nothing could be more important in terms of getting our fiscal house in order than finishing the job on health reform .
There 's still details to be ironed out , still disagreements that we 've got to work out , but for the first time we 've passed bills through every committee .
They are now starting to be narrowed .
There are negotiations taking place .
And we 've got people who are engaging even if they do n't want to engage because they 're starting to realize it's not a matter of whether , it 's a matter of when .
All the bills that have been passed , despite the various differences , all of them would provide help to millions of people who do n't have coverage .
Understand , 29 million -- under the Baucus bill -- 29 million people who do n't have health insurance would now have health insurance , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
All the bills would prevent insurance companies from barring you because of preexisting conditions .
All of them would set up an exchange , a framework so that businesses , self - employed individuals , could buy in and leverage the fact that there are millions of people as part of a pool so that they can get a better deal .
So we are nearing the finish line .
With your help , we are going to cross it .
And there are going to be some fierce arguments in the days ahead .
That 's how it should be .
That 's how our democracy works .
But I want all the Democrats who are in the house -- ( laughter ) -- to understand what a profound potential achievement this is , and stay focused on the goal line .
Sometimes we like to have our little intramural battles ; that 's fine .
The American people need this .
I want all non-Democrats who may be here , or may be watching to know that I believe in a strong and loyal opposition .
I believe in a two - party system where ideas are tested and assumptions are challenged .
That 's how we strengthen our proposals .
That 's how our democracy works .
( Applause . )
But what I reject , what I do n't have a lot of sympathy for is folks who are just sitting on the sidelines and rooting for failure , whether it's on health care , or energy , or the economy .
( Applause . )
What I reject is when some folks suggest that we go back to the policies that got us in the mess in the first place -- as if we did n’t just go through what we 've been going through .
I said this before , last week at a fundraiser .
I do n't mind cleaning up the mess that some other folks made .
That 's what I signed up to do .
But while I 'm there mopping the floor I do n't want somebody standing there saying , " You 're not mopping fast enough . "
Or , " You 're not holding the mop the right way . " ( Laughter . )
Grab a mop !
( Applause . )
Why do n't you help clean up ?
( Applause . )
Everybody in Washington -- Democrat , Republican -- we all have a responsibility to rise to this occasion ; to look past our differences ; to recognize that we have to move beyond the failed policies and broken politics that allowed our toughest problems to go unsolved for decades .
When you look at the health care debate , and you 've got a whole bunch of Republicans who are saying , yeah , we should do this -- except those are all retired Republicans -- Bob Dole and Bill Frist and -- last time I checked they 're not socialist .
And they think it 's important for us to get this done .
That 's a model for what everybody needs to be thinking .
Roll up our sleeves and help to make this country the kind of country it should be .
In the end , the people I meet across this country , they are n't looking for a lot .
They 're not looking for government to solve all their problems .
They just want a chance to succeed .
They are modest hopes -- they want a job ; they want to be able to get an education .
If they 've got a good idea , they want to be able to get some financing to start a business .
They want to retire with some dignity and respect .
They want to be able to send their kids to college .
They 're asking for the opportunity to make the most of their own lives .
That 's it .
It 's the chance every American deserves .
That 's the American Dream .
That 's the promise I 'm working to fulfill every day .
And at this rare moment in history , I want you all to know that without your help I can't do it .
Like I said before , what we 're trying to do is big , and it 's hard .
If it was easy , somebody else would have done it .
And it now falls to us .
And I hope that everybody here is willing to recapture that sense of excitement that comes from a big , but achievable challenge .
Not the superficial excitement that comes from Election Day , but the excitement that comes from knowing we took on something that had to be taken on ; we did n’t kick the can down the road , and we did n’t push it off on somebody else , but instead we decided we were going to be the generation that puts things on better footing for those coming behind us .
That 's what tonight is about .
That is what our efforts are about .
And if you 're willing to stand with me and work with me and occasionally march with me , I 'm absolutely confident we 're going to get it accomplished .
Thank you very much , everybody .
God bless you .
God bless the United States of America .
( Applause . )

A smoker holding a cigarette in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A Florida jury on Thursday ordered cigarette maker Philip Morris USA to pay $ 300 million in damages to a 61 - year - old ex-smoker named Cindy Naugle who is wheelchair - bound by emphysema .
The Broward Circuit Court jury assessed $ 56.6 million in past and future medical expenses against the company , part of Altria Group Inc , as well as $ 244 million in punitive damages .
The verdict is the largest of the so - called Engle progeny cases that have been tried so far , both sides said .
Philip Morris will seek further review of the verdict because of “ numerous erroneous rulings by the trial judge , ” Philip Morris spokesman Murray Garnick said in a statement .
“ We believe that the punitive damages award is grossly excessive and a clear violation of constitutional and state law , ” Garnick said .
Naugle ’s lawsuit was among about 8,000 cases filed in the wake of a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that tossed out a massive class action against the tobacco companies .
The case , known as Engle v. RJ Reynolds , resulted in the largest verdict in U.S. history at trial -- $ 145 billion .
The Florida high court ruling , which decertified the class of about 700,000 smokers , allowed some to file individual complaints .
The case is Naugle v. Philip Morris USA .
Oh ... my ... God ...
Please forgive me for taking the Lord 's name in vain , but if you 're yet to see this , you will most likely blaspheme along with me .
This video is currently doing the rounds , and really , it has to be seen to be believed .
Whether it 's staged or genuine , you can't fake some of the things this kid does , so he 's either suffered gravely for his art , or he 's in need of dire psychiatric help .
Most likely both .
On one level , watching this kid cause damage to himself over Modern Warfare 2 is funny .
On another level , however , I found this footage quite terrifying .
Seriously ,
It 's like ten Blair Witches .
Oh , and he has the PS3 version of the game ... obviously .

Signs of infection

Scientists have unravelled the mechanism by which the fungal disease chytridiomycosis kills its victims .
The fungus is steadily spreading through populations of frogs and other amphibians worldwide , and has sent some species extinct in just a few years .
Researchers now report in the journal Science that the fungus kills by changing the animals ' electrolyte balance , resulting in cardiac arrest .
The finding is described as a " key step " in understanding the epidemic .
Karen Lips , one of the world authorities on the spread of chytridiomycosis , said the research was " compelling " .
This is lethal across a broad range of hosts , so it 's really important to look at what 's happening in other amphibians
Jamie Voyles , James Cook University
" They 've done an incredible amount of work , been very thorough , and I do n't think anybody will have problems with this .
" We suspected something like this all along , but it 's great to know this is in fact what is happening , " the University of Maryland professor told BBC News .
Skin deep Amphibian skin plays several roles in the animals ' life .
Most species can breathe through it , and it is also used as a membrane through which electrolytes such as sodium and potassium are exchanged with the outside world .
A world of amphibians
In pictures
The mainly Australian research group took skin samples from healthy and diseased green tree frogs , and found that these compounds passed through the skin much less readily when chytrid was present .
Samples of blood and urine from infected frogs showed much lower sodium and potassium concentrations than in healthy animals - potassium was down by half .
In other animals including humans , this kind of disturbance is known to be capable of causing cardiac arrest .
The scientists also took electrocardiogram recordings of the frogs ' hearts in the hours before death ; and found changes to the rhythm culminating in arrest .
Drugs that restore electrolyte balance brought the animals a few hours or days of better health , some showing enough vigour to climb out of their bowls of water ; but all died in the end .
Grail quest Lead scientist Jamie Voyles , from James Cook University in Townsville , said the next step was to look for the same phenomenon in other species .
" This is lethal across a broad range of hosts , whether terrestrial or aquatic , so it 's really important to look at what 's happening in other susceptible amphibians , " she said .
Ways to stop chytrid in the wild are the " holy grail " for researchers
Another step will be to examine how the chytrid fungus ( Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis - Bd ) impairs electrolyte transfer .
" What this work does n't tell us is the mechanism by which chytrid causes this problem with sodium , " said Matthew Fisher from Imperial College London .
" It could be that Bd is excreting a toxin , or it could be causing cell damage .
This causative action is actually the ' holy grail ' - so that 's another obvious next step . "
The finding is unlikely to plot an immediate route to ways of preventing or treating or curing the disease in the wild .
Curing infected amphibians in captivity is straightforward using antifungal chemicals ; but currently there is no way to tackle it outside .
Various research teams are exploring the potential of bacteria that occur naturally on the skin of some amphibians , and may play a protective role .
Understanding the genetics of how Bd disrupts electrolyte balance might lead to more precise identification of protective bacteria , suggested Professor Lips , and so eventually play a role in curbing the epidemic .

When Kenneth Schustereit was 18 years old , he tried to swipe a pile of what he thought was scrap metal from a machine shop 's parking lot and ended up spending part of his summer vacation in jail for misdemeanor theft .
That was in 1974 .
Thirty years later , Schustereit is still paying for his crime .
That 's because a background check of his criminal record sold to employers by ChoicePoint data brokers erroneously reported that his misdemeanor was a felony .
It also stated that he spent seven years in prison when he spent 51 days in county jail .
Schustereit discovered the mistake only after Home Depot turned him down for a job last year and mentioned the report .
He thinks the report cost him half a dozen other jobs as well , although he does n't know for sure , since most employers do n't tell job applicants why they 've been rejected .
" I have a stellar work record , " said Schustereit , who was laid off nine months ago as a quality - assurance inspector at a Texas plant .
" But the problem is that I write down a 30 - year - old misdemeanor on the application , and when they look it up , it comes up as a felony .
It makes me look like a lying convict . "
Recent security breaches at ChoicePoint and Seisint have raised awareness about data brokering and the role that these companies play in identity theft .
But the breaches have brought little attention to another problem with data brokering that can cause just as much harm as identity theft – inaccurate data .
In addition to selling personal information about millions of people to marketers and government agencies , data brokers collect information from public records and sell it to employers conducting background checks on prospective workers .
Employers facing problems with violent workers , falsified credentials and workplace theft have legitimate reasons for seeking background checks .
And obtaining such reports has become increasingly easy and cheap when masses of information can be collected electronically and sold online .
But there are no standards for assuring the accuracy of data .
And incorrect or misleading information can lead to lost jobs and public embarrassment .
Legislation is currently going through Congress that would establish oversight of data brokers to help prevent identity theft , but it does n't address problems with data accuracy .
The onus for finding errors and correcting them will still be on members of the public .
A 2004 report by the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups found that 79 percent of credit reports may contain some type of error .
There 's no reason to believe that criminal records are any more accurate .
The Fair Credit Reporting
Act , which covers background checks for issues related to employment , requires that employers get written permission from subjects to perform a check on them .
But workers seldom have a choice in the matter if they want a job .
If applicants or employees lose a job or promotion because of information in a background check , workers are entitled to receive a copy of the report from the data broker that provided it .
" But what 's to prevent a company from doing a check and saying they 're not going to hire you for another reason ? " said Ronald Peterson , who believes he lost jobs because of his reports .
" You and I do n't have a right to look at who has asked for our records . "
Getting misinformation in a file corrected or removed is another battle .
Misinformation can occur for a number of reasons – clerks mis-key information , criminal charges get dropped but not updated in files , or arrested suspects provide authorities with the name and Social Security number of someone else .
If data does get corrected in one database , there is no way to ensure that it 's corrected in other databases .
Easy access to masses of digital data that never goes away also means that people are less able to make a clean start in life even after they 've served their time or been cleared of charges .
After the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly ran criminal background checks on more than 7,000 employees working for its outside vendors and barred hundreds of workers from the company , including a man who lost his position because of a 6 - 1/ 2 - year - old dismissed misdemeanor battery charge that should have been expunged from his record .
" We 're becoming a nation where there is no social forgiveness , " said Beth Givens , founder and director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse .
" We 've got to have wiggle room in our society to accept mistakes we 've made in the past .
But you can't do that anymore because of records being permanently in these databases . "
Schustereit is a case in point .
After being laid off from his job , he applied for work in Home Depot 's electrical department .
He 'd passed a drug test and psychological review and had even discussed salary and working hours with the company .
But then Home Depot told him his background did n't check out .
It took several calls to ChoicePoint and Home Depot 's headquarters before Schustereit discovered that ChoicePoint had listed him as a felon .
The company 's report also listed his middle name as Dale instead of Don , which suggested that the company might have confused him with someone else .
Ron Peterson 's problem was even more pronounced than Schustereit's .
A report from backgroundchecks.com attributed him with an array of serious criminal offenses he never committed .
" In Florida I 'm a female prostitute ( named Ronnie ) ; in Texas I 'm currently incarcerated for manslaughter , " Peterson , a California resident , said .
" In New Mexico I 'm a dealer of stolen goods .
Oregon has me as a witness tamperer .
And in Nevada – this is my favorite – I 'm a registered sex offender . "
Back in 1974 , Schustereit was originally charged with third - degree felony theft .
But in a deal with authorities , he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor instead and was sentenced to 60 days in jail .
He was released early for good behavior .
But the ChoicePoint report failed to note either of these significant details .
ChoicePoint blamed the Texas Department of Public Safety , where it said the incorrect felony information originated .
The Texas DPS did admit to misidentifying Schustereit 's offense , but not for turning his 60 - day sentence into seven years .
The department said ChoicePoint was responsible for that error .
Schustereit thinks the mistake is indicative of the sloppy work that data brokers do .
" It was incumbent on both the Texas DPS and ChoicePoint to find out if Kenneth Dale was different from Kenneth Don before ruining someone 's life , " he said .
Texas DPS spokeswoman Tena Mange said her department has quality - control procedures for information that it creates but has little control over the accuracy of electronic data that comes from courts and arresting authorities .
And after information leaves the DPS office , the department has no control over how data brokers manipulate it .
Mange said her department always recommends that people counting on criminal background checks for hiring decisions conduct fingerprint matches instead of name matches , even though they 're more expensive and take more time .
ChoicePoint declined to comment for this story and Home Depot did not return calls for comment .
After numerous phone calls and e-mails , ChoicePoint and the Texas DPS did fix Schustereit 's record , although the damage was already done .
And Schustereit has no idea how many other data brokers still list him as a felon .
Peterson had to work hard to get his record cleaned up .
He bought reports from ChoicePoint and backgroundchecks.com after State Farm denied him insurance last year .
ChoicePoint got his middle name wrong and reported that there was a bench warrant for his arrest in Arizona .
Backgroundchecks.com – which claims to have 4,000 customers worldwide , including Fortune 500 companies – included information about all Ronald or Ronnie Petersons in its database , apparently making no attempt to distinguish relevant records from irrelevant ones , even when Peterson inserted different birth dates to see if the information would change .
It did n't .
Backgroundchecks.com
President Craig Kessler said there was little data brokers could do to distinguish the records of individuals sharing the same name .
" We 're not in the business of authenticating the identity of individuals .
All we do is report the data that 's supplied to us from the courts , " said Kessler .
He said the problem stems from the fact that courts are doing away with using Social Security numbers that could help distinguish people with similar names .
" Sex - offender registries do not have anything other than a name in many cases , " Kessler said .
" We encourage companies to ask additional questions to help them confirm that this is the same person . "
But Peterson , who believes that background reports contributed to his inability to get a good job offer for the last two years , said it 's easier for employers to pass on candidates who have bad information associated with their name than to do the work to determine if the information is correct .
It took Peterson 40 hours and numerous phone calls to clear his identity in Arizona – the bench warrant was for a different Ron Peterson – and he was able to do so only after submitting his fingerprints .
" The victim is victimized by the system , " Peterson said .

WHAT'S ON TV TONIGHT ?
Viewers with DVRs are catching up with series in record numbers , brightening the picture for TV networks by easing yearly declines .
In new Nielsen data for the season 's premiere week , many shows scored substantial gains from viewing delayed one to seven days after they aired .
NIELSENS THIS WEEK : A wedding and a football win RATINGS CHARTS :
See how all your favorite shows fared
The lift , bigger than ever , blunts early fears several top returning series had plummeted .
Grey 's Anatomy added 3 million viewers , climbing 17 % from its initial total , and two others — CBS '
The Mentalist and Fox 's House — added nearly as many .
In all , 36 shows added 1 million or more viewers , and ratings for 14 programs shot up 20 % or more .
And it shows how DVRs — now in one in three homes , up from 27 % last fall — not only shift viewing but also increase it ; owners watch far more TV than those without .
Yet because viewers can skip commercials , networks can't charge advertisers for many of those extra viewers .
( Ad buyers do pay for commercial viewing up to three days later . )
Popular programs in competitive time slots continue to be the most heavily recorded .
Grey 's , CSI , The Office and Fringe , all airing at 9 ET / PT Thursday , are among the biggest gainers .
ABC 's FlashForward was the most heavily recorded new - series premiere , adding 2 million late viewers ( 16 % ) ; NCIS : LA gained 1.8 million ( 10 % ) .
On a percentage basis , Fox 's low - rated sci-fi Dollhouse was top gainer .
It added 37 % , which translated to just 914,000 extra viewers .
Fringe , up 34 % , was next , followed by four CW series up 30 % or more .
NBC's Heroes got a 27 % lift but still ranked below last year 's opener .
Shari Anne Brill , analyst at ad firm Carat USA , says delayed viewing also spiked because , in contrast to last fall 's strike - hobbled start , " there are a lot more new shows bumping up against each other in competitive time periods , " and more of them won recorded tryouts from viewers .
The data " does n't radically change perceptions " about borderline series , says Fox scheduling chief Preston Beckman .
But " on a night when there 's so much good programming , you want to see if you 're the second choice or the third choice .
It helps us to feel comfortable that if we 're patient , we can start to see growth " from same - day viewing .
News and sports programming continues to rank among the least - recorded .
So were weak new series such as Fox 's Brothers and CW 's already - canceled The Beautiful Life .
And while NBC touted its new Jay Leno Show as " TiVo - proof , " the flip side is that the show gained less than 5 % in its second week from delayed viewing .

Kop out : Liverpool , Manchester United and Bolton refuse to wear poppies for weekend matches
Poppycock : Liverpool FC players including star striker Fernando Torres will not be wearing poppies on their shirts for Monday 's game against Birmingham
Football 's top two clubs stubbornly refused today to mark Remembrance Day by wearing poppies on their shirts .
Most of the Barclays Premier League teams will embroider the British Legion emblem on to their match day kit .
But Manchester United and Liverpool will play their weekend fixtures without the poppy that symbolises respect for the nation 's heroes .
At the start of this week only 12 clubs in football 's top flight had informed the Premier League that they intended to have a poppy on their kit to mark the Remembrance period .
After the Mail 's sports columnist Charles Sale named the 12 - Arsenal , Birmingham City , Burnley , Chelsea , Everton , Hull City , Manchester City , Sunderland , Spurs , West Ham , Wigan and Wolves - Portsmouth , Fulham and Aston Villa immediately followed suit and ordered their poppy embroidery .
Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers quickly followed suit , admitting the ' Poppygate ' campaign launched in Sportsmail was a key factor in their decision to join the majority of the Premiership clubs in honouring Britain 's war dead and injured .
But Manchester United and Liverpool , along with Bolton , have defied public opinion and their players will not wear poppies for the fixtures that coincide with the solemn tribute to the nation 's fallen .
The England team will pay their respects at 11 am on Armistice Day next Wednesday in their hotel in Doha while they prepare for their friendly match against Brazil the following Saturday .
At this weekend 's games Arsenal intend to auction their team shirts to raise money for the Poppy Appeal , as will Manchester City - where two soldiers will lead out the City and Burnley sides and 100 complimentary tickets have been donated to serving armed forces personnel .
Manchester United 's decision not to put poppies on their shirts will be underlined during their live TV match on Sunday against Chelsea , a club that highlights their connection with the famous Chelsea Pensioners on Remembrance Sunday weekend .
Snub : Liverpool , Bolton and Manchester United are the only Premier League clubs whose players ' shirts will not be embroidered with poppy badges this weekend
The top two clubs ' excuse that the red flower does n't show up on the United and Liverpool shirts have been undermined by the emblem being proudly displayed on the red shirts of Arsenal - and Premiership title contenders West Bromwich Albion are sowing a poppy on their red away kit for their match against Leicester .
A Manchester United spokesman said : '
We are very proud of the work we do with the armed forces and we do not feel a poppy on the shirt would add to our contribution .
' Our staff and officials will be wearing them as usual and we are confident we are doing the right thing . '
A statement from Anfield said : ' Liverpool Football Club has worked with the Royal British Legion to help publicise and support the Poppy Appeal .
' A minute 's silence will be held before Monday 's live televised game against Birmingham City at Anfield and this will be preceded by two service personnel and a Royal British Legion standard bearer placing a ceremonial poppy on the centre circle .
' In addition , a ground collection will be held and advertising made available within both the matchday programme and on electronic LED pitchside boards to further raise awareness of the appeal . '
Liverpool said the team shirts from the game will also be given to the Royal British Legion to auction to raise money for the Poppy Appeal .
Bolton Wanderers made no comment .
A small angry mob abused a teenager charged with the pack rape of a woman at a holiday house on Phillip Island as he left the Melbourne Magistrates Court with his parents this afternoon .
Trent Cantwell , of Lower Plenty , appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court today charged over the alleged October 10 rape .
It is alleged he was one of 16 men from suburban football club Montmorency who imprisoned and sexually assaulted two women .
Cantwell 's lawyer , Paul Lawrie , told the court there was " a small scale media siege " outside his home .
" What goes around comes around , " screamed one woman .
" You filthy maggot , " screamed another man who pursued Cantwell down the pavement , verbally abusing him all the way .
Another screamed : " You f---ing parasite . "

( Natural News ) Contrary to the impression promoted by the psychiatric and drug industries , psychiatric drugs do not work by correcting a chemical imbalance in the brain , Joanna Moncrieff of University College London wrote recently in an opinion piece for the BBC .
Instead , such drugs merely put people into " drug - induced states " that make it harder for them to experience the symptoms of their illness .
" Magazines , newspapers , patients ' organizations and Internet sites have all publicized the idea that conditions like depression , anxiety , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be treated by drugs that help to rectify an underlying brain problem ... just like a diabetic needs to take insulin , " Moncrieff writes .
" The trouble is , there is little justification for this view .
" Moncrieff notes that prior to the 1950s , mental health workers largely saw antidepressants as psychoactive drugs , primarily sedatives , that eased the symptoms of depression without addressing the underlying cause  much as over - the - counter cold drugs may stop a runny nose without affecting the cold virus .
This view was eventually replaced by the idea that depression , schizophrenia , anxiety and other mental health conditions result from chemical imbalances in the brain , imbalances that can be corrected by the right " magic bullet . "
" However , this transformation was not based on any compelling evidence , " she says .
Moncrieff holds to the older view , that " drugs used in psychiatry are psychoactive drugs , like alcohol and cannabis .
They affect everyone , regardless of whether they have a mental disorder or not .
" Antipsychotics , she notes , mute people 's emotions and thoughts , which can reduce the effects of psychosis as a side effect .
Anti-anxiety drugs are central - nervous system depressants , like alcohol .
"
If you told people that we have no idea what is going on in their brain , but that they could take a drug that would make them feel different and might help to suppress their thoughts and feelings , then many people might choose to avoid taking drugs if they could , " she writes .
" People need to make up their own minds .

The Modern Method of Marriage , a Reprise
The following is taken from my own experiences and things people have told me ( outside of confession , you ’ll be glad to know . )
Here goes .
A young man and a young woman meet and have a few dates .
They go for a weekend at a bed and breakfast where they bed one another , and then have breakfast .
If he is n’t too much of a jerk and she is n’t too picky , they are then an item .
She goes to the doctor gets a prescription and goes on to a more permanent form of birth control .
At some time during this stage , the uncomfortable meeting with the parents happens .
Everyone is polite and “ supportive . ”
Secretly the father of the young woman who knows exactly what ’s going on , contemplates buying a gun and the mother of the young man begins gossiping with whomever will listen about how her little boy could do better .
After a while , if things hold up , they begin to have the conversation about taking their relationship to the “ next level ” by which they mean shacking up ,
as we used to call it .
Now , I think it ’s called moving in together .
Mom and Dad buy housewarming gifts in an attempt to , once again , be supportive .
They do n’t want their little dears to hate them and besides , it ’s what everyone is doing these days , so it ca n’t be wrong .
They have vague thoughts about getting married at that point and mom explains to grandma and to friends at church that they are just doing it to save money for the wedding .
At this stage an engagement ring may appear .
At some point , when they think about getting the house and the kids , because that ’s what you do , they decide to have the wedding .
They rent the hall and then go see the priest .
He tells them there are four other weddings that day and they respond , “ but we ’ve rented the hall already . ”
Someone suggests a garden wedding if the church is occupied .
The priest says we ca n’t do garden weddings .
The young couple begins to complain about how narrow minded the Church is with all these rules and regulations .
They eventually pick a date .
Then the bottom drops out .
It seems the groom is not Catholic .
He was baptized in the First Reformed Church of the Druids , though he never practiced .
This means there must be a dispensation for the marriage , another irritating Catholic invention , and the wedding date cannot be confirmed until the dispensation is received .
The bride goes back to her doctor , this time for a prescription for Valium .
Her mother joins her on this visit .
Finally the dispensation is granted ,
The groom ’s druid will do one of the readings at the wedding , the loans are taken out , the banns are published .
Then there is the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner .
The best man comes to the rehearsal drunk out of his mind , the groom only slightly tipsy .
The bride is furious at everyone for some reason known to her alone .
Probably because the groom is far more interested in drinking and watching the football game on his hand held computer thing than he is in gazing lovingly into her eyes in anticipation of the great day .
In fact they have n’t been , well ... friendly in weeks .
It is , after all , football season .
The special day comes , the best man is still drunk , the groom is hung over , no one knew about that interesting tattoo that the maid of honor had way low on her back , now revealed by the plunging back of her dress that is held up only by wishful thinking .
Grandma , upon reading the logo of the maid of honor ’s tattoo , has fainted .
Somewhere in all this the vows are exchanged , and quite a few of the wedding party receive their first Holy Communion that day , however one of the ushers puts the host in his suit pocket not having a clue what it is .
( This actually has happened to me twice . )
The pictures have been taken .
The noise level in the church reaches that of an English soccer match after the riot has broken out .
The children are jumping off the altar and the priest is scowling at everyone .
Now on to the pictures in the forest preserve , a “ must ” at every wedding .
There the wedding party is attacked by mosquitoes , one of the children falls into the lagoon and the bride is having a hard time smiling for the photos .
The best man passes out .
On to the reception .
The bride loses it because the shade of fuchsia in the floral center pieces clashes with the shade of fuchsia in the wedding party ’s outfit .
The groom adjourns to the bar where the game is on the television .
The wedding dinner is served as music is played at a mind numbing volume .
Grandma is better now .
She has turned off her hearing aid .
The priest is seated with the pious relatives in plaid suit coats and leaves shortly after the grace before meals .
The best man makes the toast which drones on about how he loves the groom and one begins to wonder .
The college roommate / maid of honor does the same for the bride , going on for fifteen minutes about how she knew the bride would find eternal marital bliss the moment she met her in the third grade and they have been like sisters ever since .
Then at some point , there is a video presentation of embarrassing photos not unlike the ones that are now shown at wakes .
The bar opens up again .
The music reaches levels that cause blood to drip from some peoples ’ nose and ears .
The joyous event ends with the bride and groom being the last to leave the hall .
They are slow to go up to the room they have rented in the hotel because nothing new or beautiful awaits them there .
The groom promptly falls asleep , being heavily sedated already , and , as he snores away , with his shoes still on , our blushing bride , having shed her dress of virginal white , thinks back on this day , her special day , the most important day in her life , the day she has dreamt of since she was a little girl .
They will stay an extra day at the hotel , but cannot afford the time or money to go on a honeymoon because on Monday they will both be back at work in order to pay off the colossal bill that their special day has incurred .
For some reason , the bride is depressed .
Perhaps she is realizing that the high point of her life is now past and the rest of it will be spent with the lump that is now snoring beside her with whom she has never really had a serious conversation , except about the proper shade of fuchsia for the floral centerpieces .
So it is that we celebrate the marriage of Christ and His Church in these enlightened and tolerant times .

Hilarious / weep : I have not laughed this hard in a while , but it 's vinegar laughter : our modern condition obliterates all that is holy and replaces it with a crass pragmatism that seems empowering but backfires on us constantly .
WASHINGTON -- While President Barack Obama still faces stiff headwinds on a range of major legislation on his agenda , he has been signing into law a slew of smaller initiatives that had gathered dust on the Democratic wish list for years .
Many of the bills had been blocked by Republicans who considered the measures unnecessary expansions of government or too costly .
But facing Democratic majorities in Congress , conservatives are picking their battles and in many cases letting the legislation roll through .

Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years , and are currently the most popular pet in the world .
Cat owners know both how sweet and how mean they can be , but the cat world is more than squealing over kittens .
Genetics and selective breeding have created some distinctive and unique cats , and here are what the list author believes to be the 10 strangest cat breeds .
10 Devon Rex
The Devon Rex breed of cat has only been around since the 1960’s .
They have been genetically proven not to be related to the Cornish or German Rex breeds .
The strange thing about the Devon Rex is the fact that they have very little “ guard hair ” , the stiff , coarse , waterproof hairs present on most furred mammals .
They have mostly “ down hair ” , or soft , fine undercoat fur .
The Devon Rex is especially unique in that their down hair is curly .
They also have rather large eyes , and large , low - set ears .
Devon Rex cats are active , playful , and friendly , and enjoy being perched on peoples ’ shoulders , like parrots .
They are also very intelligent , and can be taught tricks , such as fetching and walking on a leash .
9 Scottish Fold
The Scottish Fold ( or Coupari in Canada ) , has a dominant genetic mutation that causes the cartilage in their ears to have a fold , sometimes even up to two or three folds !
This makes their ears flop forward , giving them their distinctive appearance .
The more folds the cat ’s ears have , the closer to the head the ears will lie .
The Fold ’s ears look straight and normal at birth , but will begin to fold after about 21 days .
Scottish Folds are generally friendly , cuddly cats , and do n’t mind other pets .
They also like to sleep in the “ Buddha position ” : sitting with their legs straight out and their back straight up from the hip , like a human .
8 Japanese Bobtail
Japanese bobtails are born with a rabbit - like puff tail , and some will even hop like rabbits , rather than running !
In the year 1602 , the Japanese government demanded that all cats be set free , to help protect the valuable silkworm fields from rodents .
Buying and selling cats was illegal at the time , so Japanese bobtails were street cats .
Bobtails come in many colors , but the most popular is the calico , or “ mike ” in Japanese .
Most people have seen at least a version of the bobtail .
The famous “ Maneki Neko ” or “ beckoning cat ” is a good - luck charm , consisting of a Japanese bobtail sitting on its haunches with one forepaw raised .
Tying into the next breed on the list , odd - eyed bobtails are now quite popular in Japan .
Having “ silver and gold ” eyes ( actually blue and amber - yellow ) , the heterochromatic kittens are much more expensive , but do n’t have the same legends surrounding them as the Khao Manee .
7 Khao Manee
I actually own a Khao Manee , which is what prompted me to write this list .
Siamese cats , with blue eyes and point coloration , are what everyone in the States considers a Siamese .
In Thailand and the surrounding areas , however , the khao manee is the one and only Siamese cat .
The Khao Manee ( or “ White Jewel ” ) was the royal cat breed of Old Siam .
It is said that the penalty for a commoner stealing a Khao Manee was death .
Khao Manee are pure snow white , with the “ silver and gold ” eyes stated in # 8 , though the “ gold ” eye is most often actually an amber - green color , rather than straight amber - gold .
This breed is unique in that many Indonesian cultures find the Khao Manee to be extremely lucky .
No true Khao Manee were found outside of Thailand until 1999 , when breeder Colleen Freymuth received two Khao Manee , and became the first person outside of Thailand to breed them .
The earliest mention of the Khao Manee was in the Tamra Maew , or “ Cat Book of Poems ” in 1350 .
This means that , until 1999 , Khao Manee had been bred only in Thailand for nearly 650 years !
Because of the luck associated with them , Khao Manee are very expensive .
In the UK alone , kittens go for eight to ten thousand dollars .
6 Savannah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m81IU3A18k&hl=en_US&fs=1&
Savannahs are incredibly interesting cats .
They are the result of breeding a standard domestic cat with the serval , an African wild cat .
The first Savannah had a Siamese mother , but Savannahs simply need to have a serval ancestor to be considered for the breed .
Savannahs have wild - looking spots , stripes , and markings , but the patterns will differ , depending on the domestic cat breed used .
Generations are marked by “ filial numbers ” , showing how far removed from the serval ancestor they are .
An “ F1 ” Savannah had a domestic cat parent and a serval parent .
An “ F2 ” Savannah had a serval grandparent , and so on .
Savannahs who had a serval father and a domestic cat mother are 50 % serval .
Those cats can be bred back to servals to the point where resulting kittens are 75 % serval … sometimes even up to 87.5 % !
Savannahs are generally incredibly large cats .
F1 cats can get up to 30 lbs.
in weight , but later litters of smaller filial numbers will be smaller .
They are often compared to dogs in their loyalty , and will follow owners around the house , play fetch , and can be trained to walk on a leash .
Savannahs greet people by head - butting them , though some may pounce .
Savannahs tend to love water as well , and will even jump into the shower and join their owners .
Water bowls around a Savannah will prove messy , as they like to bat the water out of the bowl until empty .
They are also known for their jumping ability .
From a sitting position , Savannahs can jump 8 feet straight into the air .
Savannahs are also interesting vocalists , and will chirp , meow , and hiss .
Their hiss is a throwback to their serval ancestor , and sounds more like an angry snake than a cat .
[ JFrater : I have added a youtube clip because you really do have to see this cat jump !
If you ca n’t view youtube ( at work for example ) , here is a photo instead .
Here is another video of a cat jumping 7 feet ! ]
5 Teacup Persians
Teacup Persians are a breed that has become quite popular recently .
Many people have moved into smaller houses and apartments , and because of the space restrictions , the demand for teacup Persians has exploded .
Teacups are not a strange genetic mutation , but rather the result of selective breeding of smaller - sized Persians .
These cats are unique , as they look exactly like normal Persian cats , with long fur and their distinctive flat faces , but will never grow more than 6lbs. for females and 7lbs. for males .
Full grown , they are about 8 inches tall while sitting .
Standard Persians range from 10 lbs. to 13lbs. in weight .
Despite their small size , Teacup Persians are still Persians , and are susceptible to the myriad health problems that normal - sized Persians are , such as urinary tract disorders , lupus , eyelid cysts , and various cancers .
4 Munchkin
Munchkin cats do n’t have a specific coloration .
Rather , they have a genetic mutation that causes their legs to grow incredibly short , or “ achondroplasia ” .
The condition does not affect their running or jumping abilities .
The main problem with Munchkin cats lies in the genetics .
Kittens who end up with two copies of the Munchkin gene will not survive .
Because of this , the Munchkin breed is not recognized by cat fancying societies , as the trait is a “ genetic disease ” .
Because of the genetics , Munchkins are predisposed to have sunken chests and spinal deformities .
Munchkins are considered a breed , but can have the characteristics of another breed of cat , such as a Devon Rex or a Burmese .
They essentially will look like the main breed , but with the characteristic short legs and larger heads .
3 Pixie -Bob
Pixie - Bobs are a breed of cat that are relatively large .
They are fully domestic , but appear to look exactly like a small bobcat .
The Pixie - Bob was bred from exotic - looking stray and wild cats , rather than actual bobcat hybrids , as the original breeder previously claimed .
There is no distinct personality for the breed , but what is interesting is that the cats meow rarely , or never meow at all .
Instead , they communicate by chirping .
They will also follow their owners around the house .
Pixie - Bobs are incredibly intelligent , and enjoy being walked on leashes and playing fetch .
They are even capable of understanding some human words and commands .
2 Minskin
Minskins are one of a set of breeds known as “ dwarf breeds ” .
They are created by breeding a Munchkin ( # 4 ) with other cat breeds .
Minskins are the result of a Devon Rex Munchkin being bred with a Sphynx cat .
They appear simply to be incredibly small Sphynx cats , and require the same grooming .
The Minskin is an incredibly new breed , and has only been around since 1998 .
The first standard Minskin was born in 2000 , and by 2005 , there were fifty of them in existence .
Minskins are not to be confused with the “ Bambino ” , which is a Sphynx cat bred with any Munchkin breed .
Minskins need to have a Munchkin parent with the fur of a Devon Rex .
1 Sphynx
The Sphynx , or Canadian Hairless , is a breed of cat that is born without fur .
Dating back to 1966 , the cat was incredibly rare due to the delay in breeding it .
The first cat , Prune , died without throwing a litter .
In 1967 , a mother Sphynx and her kittens were saved .
After a second litter , two kittens were transported to London , and from there , the Sphynx breed was truly born .
Sphynx , contrary to popular belief , are n’t actually hairless .
They are covered in an incredibly short , soft fur that has the feel of peach fuzz .
It is also possible for Sphynx cats to grow whiskers and eyebrows .
Sphynx cats need regular bathing , about one bath a week , as the natural oils from their skin ca n’t be absorbed by their fur , and can build up on the skin and become quite fragrant .
Despite not having fur , the breed is NOT hypoallergenic .
They still produce the protein in their skin oil and saliva that triggers allergic reactions in those susceptible .
Food Stamp Usage Across the Country
The number of food stamp recipients has climbed by about 10 million over the past two years , resulting in a program that now feeds 1 in 8 Americans and nearly 1 in 4 children .
In the long - foundering , ever - festering war on drugs , there 's just about zero truth to the idea of zero tolerance .
As anyone who 's studied the prison population can figure out , certain groups dealing in illegal drugs can be targeted for harsh punishment , while other groups trafficking in the same drugs are all but ignored .
And the safest place to be a dope pusher ?
Your local college dormitory , of course .
Even if you 're not very good at it .
A new study by two California researchers concludes that campus drug dealers -- mostly white , affluent , and clueless -- continue to thrive despite shifting social mores and the sometimes heavy - handed enforcement efforts elsewhere .
" We were ... taken aback by the lack of criminal justice and university administration attention paid these dealers , despite the brazenness , incompetence , and general dearth of street smarts that tended to characterize the dealers ' daily practices , " write A. Rafik Mohamed and Erik Fritsovold , authors of Dorm Room Dealers : Drugs and the Privileges of Race and Class .
Just released by Boulder - based Lynne Rienner Publishers -- the folks who brought you Guns , Violence & Criminal Behavior -- Dorm Room Dealers is a sober but intriguing look at dealing on several campuses in southern California .
Not surprisingly , many of the badass connections interviewed by the authors turn out to be surfer - dude business majors who fell into the trade because they liked getting their own smoke wholesale , then found additional profits in cocaine , ecstasy and black - market " study drugs " such as Ritalin and Adderall .
This informal network deals openly , rakes in thousands of dollars a month ( mostly on beaucoup weed , though cocaine has higher profit margins ) -- and blows most of it on nice cars , gear and dinners .
None of the kingpins profiled here seem to worry much about being busted , figuring their dads ' lawyers or their own sense of entitlement immunizes them from serious consequences .
And they are probably right .
Mohamed and Fritsvold puzzle over why these children of privilege get into the business so heavily .
For the most part , they do n't need the money .
The authors postulate a combination of psychological motives , from seeking thrills and gangsta status to " warding off the emasculating force of privilege . "
One dealer admits , " I am almost as addicted to selling as I am to getting faded . "
Oh , and do n't call them drug dealers .
Campus provenders prefer to think of themselves as " brokers . "
And it 's just a passing thing .
Once they 're off campus , they 'll settle into more socially acceptable forms of capitalism .
But in the meantime , the ease of the campus drug trade -- the authors call the dealers " anti-targets , " since campus police and local cops try so hard to look the other way -- raises big questions about the real aims of the drug war .
When was the last time you heard of a major drug enforcement action on the Boulder campus of the University of Colorado ( and no , we 're not talking about those rinky - dink 4 - 20 arrests ) ?
Mohamed and Fritsvold claim they 're not trying to sic the cops on campus dealers .
Rather , they want to " spark a conversation about a more reasonable , equitable , and balanced set of domestic drug policies . "
But will that ever happen while the sons and daughters of the policymakers are thoroughly protected from the policy 's nightmare effects ?
Algae : is there anything it ca n’t do ?
The slimy photosynthetic organism is already in the prototype stages as a biofuel , and now sustainable plastic manufacturer Cereplast has announced that it can turn algae into a sustainable bioplastic .
The company , which already makes plastic from corn , potatoes , tapioca , and wheat , says that its algae - based plastic could replace up to 50 % of the petroleum content in traditional plastic resin .
Cereplast plans to source its algae from companies that use the organism to minimize CO2 coming from polluting smokestacks .
Algae from these photo - bioreactors is harvested daily , and can either be used for biofuel or for Cereplast ’s purposes as a biopolymer .
So the same algae that eats greenhouse gases from industrial processes can go back into the same factories and turned into plastic - based products .
Got that ?
This is all speculative –Cereplast ’s algae plastic is still in the development phases .
But the company is apparently fast - tracking the product , and commercial algae bioplastic resin is expected to be available by the end of next year .
Cereplast could already have a potential customer in Coca - Cola , which recently unveiled the PlantBottle , a recyclable water bottle made from 30 % plant - based materials .

? Contrary to what many people think , camels cannot store water in their humps .
The humps are a dense fat reserve which serves as food .
When the fat is used it does actually release water which makes the stories about camel ’s humps holding water very near the truth .
The problem for the camel is that when it utilizes the fat deposits in its humps , oxygen is released and this oxygen sets off an additional loss of water via the lungs .
So this gets rid of any extra water gained from the fat breakdown .
The reason why a camel has a hump , or two , is that because storing all its body fat in one place allows it to lose excess heat more easily from the rest of its body .
The dromedary , or Arabian camel as it is also known , has only one hump , but the Bactrian has two .
Dromedaries do actually have one fully developed hump and one behind which is not developed .
These camels grow to a height of about seven feet at the shoulder and have a body length of about ten feet .
The two - humped Bactrian is slightly taller and has a thicker and woollier coat .
Camels can also save water by retaining the urea that most other mammals excrete as part of their urine .
In the camel , the urea is built into proteins in the stomach .
The other strange thing is that camels avoid sweating because their body temperature can vary over a much larger range of temperatures that any other mammal .
They do not start to sweat until they reach a temperature of forty six degrees centigrade .
When a camel has had to go for a long period of time without drinking any water , it can drink as much as a hundred and eighty liters , or forty gallons of water at time .
Apparently it is possible to watch them swell up as they drink this huge amount of water .
All that water actually dilutes their blood and the fluids around their tissues in a way that would certainly kill other animals .
It is thought that this ability to drink such vast quantities of water has something to do with the strange shape of the camel ’s blood cells .
They tend to be slightly elliptical in shape , instead of the more normal round shape which is found in other mammals .
What actually happens is that these oddly shaped corpuscles absorb so much water that they change shape and become small spheres full of water and diluted blood , and are elastic enough not to burst .
Star Trek 's second pilot — a longer version of " Where No Man Has Gone Before , " introducing Captain Kirk — has never appeared anywhere , but it 'll be on a new Blu - Ray set .
Meanwhile , the next Trek movie is delayed one year .
According to TrekWeb , the Star Trek Season 3 Blu - Ray set will include the longer cut of " Where No Man Has Gone Before , " which has never aired or appeared on DVD or VHS .
( The Youtube video above includes all the sections that are different . )
The original cut started with a view of our galaxy , while Captain Kirk talks poetically ( in an " Enterprise Log , " about Earth and its sun being specks of dust as the Enterprise ventures out of the galaxy .
There 's also a long scene of the crew stalking down a hallway as the ship goes on full alert , and a bit more Kirk / Spock banter .
Not only that , but the opening and closing credits are totally different , with the televised " whoooo - ooooo " music being replaced by some music that sounds more like the show 's other incidental tunes .

Given that the season three box set also includes season three , it 's good that there 's some incentive for fans to buy this thing .
Separately , Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman told the Screenwriters Expo in L.A. that they think the next Star Trek movie is coming out in 2012 , not 2011 as we 've been told previously .
Orci and Kurtzman had planned to have the screenplay done by Christmas , but with the new timeframe , they 're going to take longer with it .
As for what happens in Trek 2 , says Kurtzman :
They 're established now in the second movie and they 're finally a crew so it will resemble what you see in terms of they are already who they are .

Which sounds very zen , somehow .

Brisbane 's Clem 7 tunnel will be fitted with no less than eight fixed speed cameras when it opens early next year .
The cameras - to be placed in pairs at four points along the 6.8 kilometre tunnel - will constitute the highest concentration of fixed speed detection devices in Queensland .
There are currently only nine other fixed speed cameras spread across the state , only six of them operational .
Police Minister Neil Roberts has defended the camera plan as a means of reducing potentially disastrous high speed tunnel crashes , such as that seen in Melbourne 's Burnely tunnel which killed three people in a fireball in March 2007 .
" Crashes in tunnels have the potential to be particularly hazardous due to the enclosed nature of the environment , " Mr Roberts said .
This cover has come in for repeated criticism in recent years as many consumers have complained that insurers rely on complex medical definitions to decide who does and does not get a payout .
To be fair to insurers , most have clearly listed the exact nature of the conditions covered in the policy terms and conditions .
But to the average healthy consumer , terms such as " in situ carcinoma " or " pre-malignant or non-invasive cancer " are nearly meaningless .
Most simply assume that if they have bought a policy it will pay out if they have cancer .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The Conservative party plans to allow police to name criminals if it comes to power , saying the Labour government had kept the public in the dark about dangerous offenders living in their area .
The Conservatives , frontrunners to win next year ’s general election , attacked the government ’s record on law and order saying that the privacy of convicted criminals and dangerous fugitives , had been given priority over public protection .
“ A Conservative government will free the police , probation and prison services to name offenders where necessary in order to protect the public and prevent crime , ” Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic Grieve said in a statement Tuesday .
The Conservatives , in the middle of their annual party conference where they have so far focussed on cutting public spending , said they would repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights to rebalance laws in favour of protecting the public .
Justice Minister Jack Straw defended the Human Rights
Act , saying the names and addresses of offenders were already on the public record and police regularly named wanted criminals .
He said he aimed to put information about offenders on neighbourhood policing websites this autumn .
“ Nothing in the Human Rights Act prevents publishing the details of an offender if he or she presents a danger to the public , ” he said .
“ In fact , the Act explicitly allows public authorities to interfere with an individual ’s right to privacy in the interests of public safety or for the prevention or detection of crime . ”
Straw said scrapping the Human Rights
Act would not remove Britain ’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights , and replacing it with a Bill of Rights would restrict the flexibility of British courts .

It seems a long time ago , that I first spotted a thread about ASCIIpOrtal , and broke the news .
A few months later , an early video triggerred an internet stampede , and now , we ’re less than 90 minutes from the release of ASCIIpOrtal .
( EDITORS NOTE :
It ’s now available to download .
The link is at the end of Part 2 )
Welcome , to JOMG ’s ASCIIpOrtal launch - day interview , with its creator , Joe Larson .
Joe , we ’re just hours away from the release of ASCIIpOrtal .
But I ’d like to spend a few minutes getting to know the guy who created it .
You started programming in the late 70 ’s / early 80’s .
What was it like back then ?
Oh , man , those were the days of great computers .
The PET came in a big box that included the monitor , the keyboard , and hid the CPU in there .
The C64 hid everything in just the keyboard unit and you hooked it up to a TV , which was brilliant marketing .
If anything went wrong with your C64 , the manual told you to “ remove the keyboard unit from all its wires , hold the unit 10 to 14 inches above a soft surface like a bed or pillow , and release ” .
Seriously !
That was C64 tech support !
I used the Apple IIe at school and it was okay – but the C64 seemed much more colorful .
* C64 pic by Bill Bertram .
You talk about typing in programs from magazines .
Can you recall a program you typed in , or wrote yourself , from those days ?
Oh goodness , yes .
I remember pouring over lines and lines of indecipherable data blocks trying to find that one zero I mistyped as an “ O ” .
I also remember a couple where I actually deduced that there was a typo and fixing them .
One game I made was on the Apple IIe .
It was based on the old “ Doctor Who ” game .
You used two paddles , one for X and one for Y to navigate the screen .
If you flicked the paddle fast enough , your guy could jump over the blocks that were trying to kill you .
The game lives on , as “ Robot Escape ” on my site , Cymon ’s Games .
You ’re a former teacher , who ’s now doing IT work for an educational software company .
Cymon ’s Games is also an “ educational ” website , is n’t it ?
It is .
It absolutely is .
And I ’m not trying to shy away from that .
Funny , the word “ educational ” was never used around “ type-ins ” back in the 80’s .
Instead , they were promoted as “ free games ” and consequently abandoned , when disks and then CDs became throw - away cheap .
I ’ve read that you use the name “ Cymon ” , as “ Joe Larson ” is too common .
Where ’d the name come from ?
Cymon is the character with the monitor for a head .
[ He ’s like the site mascot – JOMG ]
It ’s a doodle I did ; starting with the idea of a desktop machine reconfigured as a robot .
I named him “ Cyber - mon ” , which was shortened to “ Cy- mon ” .
When I made the site I decided to drop the hyphen , and because it sounds like Simon , I just went with it .
You started programming using BASIC , but your website teaches C/ C ++.
What led you to this choice ?
Well , BASIC , as I used it , is pretty much dead at this point .
So I had to choose something else I was doing C at the time .
I like C . It ’s been around for a while and it ’ll likely be around for a while more so Cymon ’s Games can perhaps remain relevant for years to come .
C/C++ has a huge stock library of programs already written for it that I can draw from when I find them .
You publish a program a week .
Are there any in particular that you ’ve been particularly proud of ?
Or ones that got more feedback than others ?
Which ones am I proud of ?
Oh , I start at “ Hello ” and tell you why I love each one !
I do n’t know if you want to open that particular can of worms .
For the most part I do n’t get many public comments on the site .
Sometimes I feel like I ’m doing this thing in a vacuum , that I do n’t have any fans , but then something ….
happens and I realize that there are people checking out the site , they ’re just doing so quietly .
You ’re working on a book , with programs from the site , illustrated with your cartoons .
And you ’re raising funds for a “ graphics tablet ” to speed up the process .
How ’s that going ?
Slowly .. about half way now to the point that I want to get it .
Any donations and T - Shirt sales are probably going to go towards the tablet fund first .
OK Joe , the internet is a restless beast .
So let ’s talk ASCIIpOrtal .
You ’ve attributed your inspiration to a few other titles , including Portal : The Flash Version , Portile & Super Serif Bros .
Do you remember the moment when you thought “ Hey , I might have a go at this ” ?
It was Increpare Portile that really got me going .
I think because it was incomplete … which is what got my juices flowing .
The look - through mechanic on ASCIIpOrtal was my solution to Portile ’s mirroring mechanic on inside surfaces .
The use of text … was because text is also tile based , but allows for characters instead of just colored blocks .
Did you have any idea at that point … what would be involved ?
At the time I wanted to kinda make Portile in text to add it to the site , so “ small and simple ” was it .
But I wanted to fix the “ look ” mechanic and add pushable boxes , which is the point at which Super Serif Bros enters the equation .
I thought , “ I could just make SSB with this portal look through ” , and “ how hard could that be , the original was a javascript game ? ”
Implementing the look through turned out being much more difficult than I thought .. and soon ASCIIpOrtal ballooned out of the proportion for a simple type - in for the site .
By then , it had nested in my brain … and I had to see it through .
What were the first things you got working in the game ?
Fortunately , I wrote this down !
After experimenting with the rotation mechanic I started with trying to make a game like SSB : loading from text files , walking around , pushing boxes , advancing when you hit the exit , and something to kill you .
What was the most difficult thing to get right ?
I ’ve never made a game like this , so every step had its own challenges .
I spent so long thinking about things before I even wrote 1 line of code .. that the “ getting it right ” was done before I started .
I think the hardest part , was making a whole framework … so I could add a new thing to the game without having to rewrite everything .
I had to rewrite the main movement algorithms twice and I still do n’t think I have it ’s right .
Were there any entertaining bugs that caused weird things to happen ?
No , no .
No bugs .
Just unexpected features .
There were a couple of times when things did n’t quite work the way I thought they should and I just left it that way .
Like text triggers holding down switches .
At first I had meant for them to be intangible to everything but the player , but I discovered accidentally that I forgot to implement that and a text trigger could be used to hold down a switch until it ’s triggered , at which point it ’s removed from the map .
I realized this had some cool possibilities and ended up using it in level 1 in combination with a boulder off screen to time the dropping of a box .
Steve Fenton has created the sounds for ASCIIpOrtal .
Can you tell us about the “ trumpet voice ” that is being used for ASCIIpOrtal sarcastic computer ?
It ’s brilliant .
I have no idea how he did it , but I love it .
Did you write the lines for it ?
Or someone else ?
I wrote 95 % of the dialog in the original 50 levels that will be in version 1.0 .
Some was written by beta folks who submitted levels , and some were written by Europe ( spoiler ) .
How important is story / humour vs. level design / challenge in your game ?
I did n’t think very much about the story .
The game is kinda abstract in visuals , so I did n’t want to be anything but abstract in the story .
I think it was more important that I made a game that held your hands for a few levels , got you started , challenged you slowly , then every once in a while threw a stumper your way .
I think the game has some serious challenge potential , but I do n’t consider myself an excellent level designer or , for that matter , story writer .
So I stuck with my strengths , which is working out how to make something happen , and I look forward to what others will come up with .

Yesterday , it was reported that analysts at SocGen had sent out a guide on what to do if the world goes completely to hell .
Well , the full report has surfaced , via ZeroHedge , and it 's very , very fun if you like doom and gloom .
Basically , they 're extremely concerned about public debt , and the effect that will have on developed economies , and they draw extensive parallels to Japan .
One in six men will become a victim of domestic violence A support service to help male victims of domestic violence is being piloted in Hampshire .
Honour based violence and forced marriage will also be targeted by the team in the one year project across Fareham and Gosport .
The service is a joint initiative between Hampshire County Council and Stonham , which provides housing for vulnerable people .
If successful it could be rolled out across the country .
' Pervasive problem ' Jude Ruddock - Atcherley , from Hampshire County Council , said more men were coming forward as victims of domestic violence .
" I think a lot of men do n't come forward because of the stigma attached to being a victim who is male who may be thought of as being able to protect themselves , " she said .
Domestic abuse is a pervasive problem that occurs regardless of background or age
Councillor Roy Perry
" The more people that we are aware of , the more priority there will be attached to providing funding and services for men specifically . "
A £ 29,770 grant will go towards recruiting a worker to help set up the service .
Hampshire police recorded a total of 24,000 reported incidences of domestic violence in 2008 / 2009 .
Councillor Roy Perry , chairman of Hampshire 's Domestic Abuse Steering Group , said : " Domestic abuse is a pervasive problem that occurs regardless of background or age and combating it requires co-operation from all sectors .
" The police do a great job in tackling this problem and they need all the assistance they can get from the other agencies . "
National statistics show that one in six men and one in four women will become a victim of domestic violence in their life .

Tech researchers have developed a system that uses dye - sensitized ( Grätzel ) solar cells wrapped around optical fibers to increase their overall efficiency , since it ’s known Grätzel cells are not very efficient .
The fiber solar cells they obtained are 6 times more efficient than zinc - oxide solar cells having the same area .
Inside a fiber optic solar cell the light bounces inside the fiber as it travels along , and gives much more opportunities to the surrounding solar cells to harvest it .
“ For a given real estate , the total area of the cell is higher , and increased surface area means improved light harvesting and more energy , ” says Max Shtein , an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan ( not involved with the research ) .
So how did the GaTech scientists do it ?
First , they removed the cladding from conventional optical fibers and grew zinc - oxide nanowires along their surface , so it resembles tiny , nanoscale hair .
The fiber thus obtained were treated with dye molecules that were absorbed by the zinc - oxide hair - like structures .
Of course , this had a huge advantage over impregnating the dye on a smooth surface : the total area that the wires provide altogether is larger than the same planar surface area .
“ The more dye molecules there are over a given area of such a cell , the more light it can absorb ” , says Zhong Lin Wang , GaTech professor of materials science and engineering .
Then , the dye - coated fibers are surrounded by an electrolyte and a metal film carrying the electrons off the device .
Yi Cui , assistant professor of materials at Stanford , says “ The question is , can you absorb all the light using a small amount of materials ? ” Building a nanostructured cell on an optical fiber provides a way to do this by increasing both the surface area covered by the dye and the effective path length of the light , he says .
The longer a photon travels through a solar cell , the more opportunities it has to interact and generate an electron .
Because Wang ’s optical fibers only collect light at their tips , relying on its reflection inside the fiber for reaching the solar cells , for trapping more light inside the fibers , there would be need to have smaller fibers bundled together .
Those light - capturing smaller fibers could be made of materials that are very efficient at directing light into the “ solar ” fiber .
This is one of the approaches .
The other one would be to make the devices capable of capturing light also on their entire length , rather than only their ends , but it would require the cells being coated with a material that is both electrically conductive and transparent , which is very tricky to obtain .
Fiber - optic solar cells could have unusual uses : they could be embedded into walls on a very large surface , and have the light - capturing opening on the roof , so there would be a much larger area the solar cell could theoretically occupy using very little practical space .
Added to that , dye - sensitized solar cells are very cheap , which could make fiber - optic solar cells a very interesting option for everyone .
The only price issue that has to be overcome are the fibers themselves which have to be made from inexpensive polymers .

Theoretical physics has brought us the notion that our single universe is not necessarily the only game in town .
Satellite data from WMAP , along with string theory and its 11 - dimensional hyperspace idea has produced the concept of the multiverse , where the Big Bang could have produced many different universes instead of a single uniform universe .
The idea has gained popularity recently , so it was only a matter of time until someone asked the question of how many multiverses could possibly exist .
The number , according to two physicists , could be “ humongous . ”
Andrei Linde and Vitaly Vanchurin at Stanford University in California , did a few back - of - the- envelope calculations , starting with the idea that the Big Bang was essentially a quantum process which generated quantum fluctuations in the state of the early universe .
The universe then underwent a period of rapid growth called inflation during which these perturbations were “ frozen , ” creating different initial classical conditions in different parts of the cosmos .
Since each of these regions would have a different set of laws of low energy physics , they can be thought of as different universes .
Linde and Vanchurin then estimated how many different universes could have appeared as a result of this effect .
Their answer is that this number must be proportional to the effect that caused the perturbations in the first place , a process called slow roll inflation , — the solution Linde came up with previously to answer the problem of the bubbles of universes colliding in the early inflation period .
In this model , inflation occurred from a scalar field rolling down a potential energy hill .
When the field rolls very slowly compared to the expansion of the universe , inflation occurs and collisions end up being rare .
Using all of this ( and more – see their paper here ) Linde and Vanchurin calculate that the number of universes in the multiverse and could be at least 10 ^10 ^10^7 , a number which is definitely “ humungous , ” as they described it .
The next question , then , is how many universes could we actually see ?
Linde and Vanchurin say they had to invoke the Bekenstein limit , where the properties of the observer become an important factor because of a limit to the amount of information that can be contained within any given volume of space , and by the limits of the human brain .
The total amount of information that can be absorbed by one individual during a lifetime is about 10 ^ 16 bits .
So a typical human brain can have 10 ^10 ^16 configurations and so could never distinguish more than that number of different universes .
“ So , the total number of possibilities accessible to any given observer is limited not only by the entropy of perturbations of metric produced by inflation and by the size of the cosmological horizon , but also by the number of degrees of freedom of an observer , ” the physicists write .
“ We have found that the strongest limit on the number of different locally distinguishable geometries is determined mostly by our abilities to distinguish between different universes and to remember our results , ” wrote Linde and Vanchurin .
“ Potentially it may become very important that when we analyze the probability of existencse of a universe of a given type , we should be talking about a consistent pair : the universe and an observer who makes the rest of the universe “ alive ” and the wave function of the rest of the universe time - dependant . ”
So their conclusion is that the limit does not depend on the properties of the multiverse itself , but on the properties of the observer .
They hope to further study this concept to see if this probability if proportional to the observable entropy of inflation .

When in the Third World or at NASA , do n’t drink the water .
After recently reading the article on the MIT students that sent a camera into space for $ 150 , I had to comment on NASA .
I ’ve recently taken a new job with an engineering firm .
This small but growing firm has contracts with many organizations both public and private .
The particular project I ’ve been farmed out to is in fact located at NASA .
Having worked at NASA now for only 2 days , I ’ve gotten a first hand look at the wonders of government inefficiency , irresponsibility , waste and unprofessionalism .
My first impression of NASA was when I entered the campus and saw communist - era looking cinder - block buildings , overgrown shrubs and unsightly , unfinished construction .
That turned out to be nothing though compared to when I finally actually entered one of these buildings : barren , sterile old hallways — some even with an odor of urine like one might expect in a county jail .
Paper designs scathe taped to the hallway walls .
Erratic air - conditioning working in some offices but not in most .
The carpeting , in the offices that even had any , was badly stained and filthy .
The office spaces were cramped and unorganized .
In any case I sat down at my new desk with no computer , no network credentials , no email account not even a permanent security badge .
Every morning I have to call a colleague to come meet me at the gate and escort me around all day .
When working for private engineering firms the past 3 years , I had all these things by the end of the first day of business .
The Privatization of S... Solomon , Lewis D. Best Price : $ 25.00 Buy New $ 118.19 ( as of 02:10 EST - Details )
So throughout the course of the day , I go about doing a whole lot of nothing because no one has any sort of orientation planned for new employees and I have no computer .
Oh I heard and saw a lot of gossiping , sitting around talking about who did n’t do what and what others were going to do about it etc …
Typical government tax feeder - type conversations , but I did n’t see a whole lot of work being done .
Unfortunately , I did make the mistake of drinking a lot of water since my office was one of the ones with no air conditioning in August .
After my first day then at the venerable space agency I went home , ate dinner , and spent most of the rest of the evening on the john .
I had no idea why , but I had a very bad case of diarrhea .
The Bumper Book of Gov ... Rotherham , Lee Best Price : $ 0.38 Buy New null ( as of 07:25 EST - Details )
I started thinking through my day and what I ate : cereal for breakfast , pizza for lunch and a frozen dinner .
That was it .
Again , in the middle of the night , my stomach woke me twice to go pray to the porcelain god .
My second day at NASA found me still in squalor in the same office , still with no air , no computer , no nothing .
In passing I mentioned to my office mates that I had bad diarrhea , to which they immediately responded : did you drink the water ?
Of course , I responded : yes .
I was then informed that the water coming out of the water fountains was not filtered and could make you sick .
In fact , my colleagues were part of a self - organized water consortium that provided either bottled or filtered water to its members on a daily basis .
What a wonderful example of how people with similar wants can so easily organize themselves and solve a problem at a local level when the government does n’t intervene .
In fact it ’s an example of how markets can organize to solve social problems that the government creates .
It ’s also clear that as interesting as space exploration is , it too should be left to the private sector .
Do n’t get me wrong , I think , given their incredible goals , that NASA has done a great job .
But it has cost trillions of dollars simply because they have no deadlines and an almost endless supply of money to fund their activities .
They do n’t behave the same as a private firm would , which was competing with others for market share .
If they are over budget , so be it .
They get more budget from you and me .
If they are over their time deadlines , they just take longer .
Burt Rutan and his group proved how quickly and efficiently private sector space exploration can be by buildng a space vehicle that was able to go into space and return twice within a five - day period .
Something that to this day , NASA still ca n’t do .

The late ' 70s , when punk exploded and disco imploded , were tumultuous years for the music industry .
A time bomb embedded in legislation from that era , the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 , could bring another round of tumult to the business , due to provisions that allow authors or their heirs to terminate copyright grants — or at the very least renegotiate much sweeter deals by threatening to do so .
At a time when record labels and , to a lesser extent , music publishers , find themselves in the midst of an unprecedented contraction , the last thing they need is to start losing valuable copyrights to ' 50s , '60s , '70s and ' 80s music , much of which still sells as well or better than more recently released fare .
Nonetheless , the wheels are already in motion .
" The termination that 's going to be coming up is going to be a big problem for the record companies and publishers , " said attorney Greg Eveline of Eveline Davis & Phillips Entertainment Law .
" It 's written into the statute , " said entertainment lawyer Robert Bernstein .
" It 's just a matter of time . "
The Copyright Act includes two sets of rules for how this works .
If an artist or author sold a copyright before 1978 ( Section 304 ) , they or their heirs can take it back 56 years later .
If the artist or author sold the copyright during or after 1978 ( Section 203 ) , they can terminate that grant after 35 years .
Assuming all the proper paperwork gets done in time , record labels could lose sound recording copyrights they bought in 1978 starting in 2013 , 1979 in 2014 , and so on .
For 1953 - and - earlier music , grants can already be terminated .
The Eagles plan to file grant termination notices by the end of the year , according to Law.com .
" It 's going to happen , " said Eveline .
" Just think of what the Eagles are doing when they get back their whole catalog .
They do n't need a record company now ....
You 'll be able to go to Eaglesband.com ( updated ) and get all their songs .
They 're going to do it ; it 's coming up . "
Other artists are also filing notices ( there 's a five - year window ) , according to Bernstein .
But in some cases , they 're choosing to leave the copyright grant where it is — albeit with much more favorable terms .
" There are all different kinds of ways people approach it , " said Bernstein .
" If they have a publishing company that 's making money for them , and collecting it and paying them well , they may just want a higher royalty .
Or if they 're unhappy , they get it back . "
This is n't just about music .
" It 's every type of copyright , " said Bernstein .
" It does n't distinguish between the types of copyright . "
The only exceptions , he said , are derivative works such as movies based on novels that include certain music in their soundtracks , because Congress decided it was unfair to ask publishers to give those licenses back to artists and authors .
The record labels tried to defuse this bomb in 1999 by sneaking an amendment to the Copyright Act through the House of Representatives that would add sound recordings to the Act 's list of copyrights that were considered " works for hire , " which would make them exceptions to the grant termination clause .
According to one source close to the situation , the labels told Congress that the Copyright Act already covered sound recordings as exceptions because albums of music are " compilations " — but that " just to be absolutely clear , [ the labels ] wanted to put it in so nobody can debate it . "
After musicians , including Carly Simon , reacted negatively , the amendment was withdrawn amid public outcry leaving record labels with precisely two options for fending off notices of termination , neither of which looks promising .
The first is to continue to claim that albums are compilations , which does n't pass the common - sense test ( compilations include songs from different artists ) , and probably wo n't pass legal muster either .
" Everybody kind of snickers at that [ strategy ] , " said Eveline .
The second option is to re-record sound recordings in order to create new sound recording copyrights , which would reset the countdown clock at 35 years for copyright grant termination .
Eveline characterized the labels ' conversations with creators going something like , " Okay , you have the old mono masters if you want — but these digital remasters are ours . "
Labels already file new copyrights for remasters .
For example , Sony Music filed a new copyright for the remastered version of Ben Folds Five 's Whatever and Ever Amen album , and when Omega Record Group remastered a 1991 Christmas recording , the basis of its new copyright claim was " New Matter : sound recording remixed and remastered to fully utilize the sonic potential of the compact disc medium . "
This might sound familiar , because BlueBeat.com employed similar logic in creating new copyrights to Beatles songs – right before it was sued by EMI and a judge barred them from continuing to sell the songs .
If the labels ' best strategy to avoid losing copyright grants or renegotiating them at an extreme disadvantage is the same one they 're suing other companies for using , they 're in for quite a bumpy — or , rather , an even bumpier — ride .

One of Russia 's most powerful tycoons -- barred entry to the U.S. for years due to U.S. government concerns about possible ties to organized crime -- visited the country twice this year under secret arrangements made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska met with FBI agents in August and earlier this month as part of a continuing criminal probe , according to two administration officials .
The focus of that probe could n't be learned .
Mr. Deripaska used the opportunity of his recent U.S. visits to meet with top executives of U.S. investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
The aluminum giant he controls , UC Rusal , is preparing for an initial public offering , a vital part of Mr. Deripaska 's efforts to save his debt - burdened business .
The U.S. trips came at an opportune moment to help reassure bankers his visa difficulties may be easing .
Mr. Deripaska 's visa troubles are a potentially sensitive issue for investors , bankers say .
Mr. Deripaska also stopped in Detroit to meet with top executives at General Motors Co. to discuss the sale of a stake in its Adam Opel AG unit to a Russian - backed consortium that includes Mr. Deripaska 's AO GAZ auto maker , people familiar with the visit said .
To the many excellent reasons to abolish the death penalty  it ’s immoral , does not deter murder and affects minorities disproportionately  we can add one more .
It ’s an economic drain on governments with already badly depleted budgets .
It is far from a national trend , but some legislators have begun to have second thoughts about the high cost of death row .
Others would do well to consider evidence gathered by the Death Penalty Information Center , a research organization that opposes capital punishment .
States waste millions of dollars on winning death penalty verdicts , which require an expensive second trial , new witnesses and long jury selections .
Death rows require extra security and maintenance costs .
There is also a 15 - to - 20 - year appeals process , but simply getting rid of it would be undemocratic and would increase the number of innocent people put to death .
Besides , the majority of costs are in the pretrial and trial .
Extreme weather conditions have killed tens of thousands of starfish and left them strewn across a sheltered beach .
A carpet of pink and mauve echinoderms , a family of marine animals , appeared yesterday morning on Lissadell Beach in north Co Sligo .
The adult starfish , measuring between 7 cm and 20cm in diameter and estimated to be up to 50,000 in number , stretched along 150 metres of the strand .
Marine biologist and lecturer at Sligo Institute of Technology Bill Crowe speculated that they had been lifted up by a storm while feeding on mussel beds off shore .
" The most likely explanation is that they were feeding on mussels but it is a little strange that none of them were attached to mussels when they were washed in , " he said .
He added that if they had died as a result of a so - called ' red tide ' or algal bloom , other sealife would have been washed ashore with them .
" These were almost all adult size and the typical starfish variety that is found in the North Atlantic but there was nothing else mixed in with them , " he said .
Surveying the unusual scene , he placed some in a bucket of seawater to test whether they were alive , but while this prompted a slight response from one or two of the creatures , the vast majority were dead .
Tim Roderick , District Conservation Officer with the National Parks and Wildlife Service , agreed the phenomenon was most likely caused by recent bad weather .
" They turned up almost certainly as a result of an exceptional storm event .
" A storm hit the seabed where these sub-tidal animals were and lifted them up and washed them ashore , " he said .
A spokesperson for the Department of the Environment , Heritage and Local Government said that investigations were continuing into how they came to be washed ashore but initial indications pointed to the stormy weather , which has been a feature in the north - west in recent days .
In a similar episode earlier this year , thousands of dead starfish washed ashore on Youghal Beach in Co Cork .
Scientists speculated that they , too , had been thrown on to the beach by an underflow , which was probably caused by a storm at sea .

Subject : Gucci Mane Show Pittsburgh
Good Morning ,
Please be advised that i spoke to Johnnie Cabbell regarding the Gucci Show in Pittsburgh and Gucci ’s non-appearance and breach of contract on our two previous dates …
Johnnie believes So Icey Ent. ( Gucci or Ms. Debbie ) WILL NOT reimburse us for lost promote expenses nor defer the back payment of this show to compensate for non-appearance and breach of contract …
My attorney advise that Gucci , Debbie & Johnnies conspiracy to defraud clients by booking shows while Gucci is on house - arrest or in rehab , failing to advise their clients of his confinement or status and knowing that Gucci would be unable to make any shows is a federal and state crime …

Technology has become a crucial part of every business .
A lot of companies are looking for ways to use it for their good .
And if you are n’t using technology in your business yet , then it ’s time to begin .
Nothin ’ tastier in the morning then to slip on a nice pair of bacon shoes and go about your day .
As someone who loves the meaty stuff , this is the perfect way to avoid all that grease and and keep your feet looking crisp and scrumptious all day .
I have bacon bandages , bacon scarves , designer bacon everything , but the printing is so cheap on most of it it just looks like pink and red wavy stripes .
But on these Keds it actually looks like the real thing .
Roger Ebert , famous film reviewer and also a cancer patient , thinks we should enact universal health care because it is morally right .
Bill Moyers , 75 , is devoting his acclaimed Journal to examining health care reform .
And I , in the shadow of giants , have spent the summer immersed in advocacy for health care reform .
Ebert , Moyers , and I have one thing in common : we are all on Medicare .
Our health care is assured .
There is truly a generational divide on the issue of health care reform .
Those of us who , through advancing age have been forced to connect with the health care system , are agitating for reform .
Is it for ourselves ?
No way .
We are already on the public plan .
We have no reason to fight .
But we ’re doing it because we have children and grandchildren , relatives and friends , and we are all part of America .
On my Facebook wall , people keep writing that they do n’t want the government running health care , that they do n’t think they need health insurance , that they can go it on their own .
All I can say is , they ’ve never been ill — which is wonderful .
But bound to come to an end .
And it ’s not until you , or a family member , are sick , that you understand why this is such an important issue .
Who understands ?
Veterans .
Elderly people .
People with disabilities and chronic conditions .
People with sick children , or with HIV .
People forced to contact the system .
The rest of you , Obama ’s liberal children and conservatives who fear government intervention can sit out this fight , because we are going to get health care reform for you .
Not so much for ourselves , because we are on , or nearly on , Medicare .
We will be okay .
It ’s you who may suffer .
Fortunately , there are a lot of us .
It ’s very difficult to be a Boomer or older and be against health care reform , because you may have ten years until you can limp over the finish line to Medicare , and those will be ten years of very expensive insurance– even if you work for a large corporation .
Unfortunately , the sheer demographic impact of an aging population will drive up premiums as well as costs .
And during that time , you may find yourself uninsurable if things go on the way they are now .
And then if you get sick , you will be bankrupt .
We will be forced to use the system more as we age , because we will need those inhalers , stents , radiation treatments , mammograms , hip replacements , and glycometers .
We already know this , because we are either there , or have already been there .
I spent ten years paying for my entire health care .
I arrived at Medicare nearly unable to walk .
Luckily , I had always taken care of myself and did n’t have any internal problems , just orthopedic decrepitude from running and lifting weights .
Still , I was damned glad to get on the public plan and get my hip replacement .
Could I have waited another six months if I had been in Canada ?
Sure .
What I wanted was to be free of pain and not have to pay $ 50,000 for that privilege .
We are not afraid anyone will pull the plug on us .
In fact , the closer we get to that time , the more we pray we can get someone to stop treating us when our conditions are hopeless and let us go quietly without pain and suffering , without toxic chemo that wo n’t help or surgeries that are unproven and just weaken us further .

There are a thousand ghost towns spread across the western United States -- a whole constellation of loss and ruin -- but most are little more than foundations , or at best a few tumbledown shacks , or if the people who lived and died there did anything of note , and if they 're lucky , a sun-faded commemorative plaque mounted on a squat stone pillar .
The ghost town of Bodie , however , is another story altogether .
A mining boomtown , it was the third most populous city in the state of California in 1880 .
By the 1940s sickness , wars , bad weather and exhausted mines had led to the town 's desertion , and its isolated , inhospitable location made certain that it stayed that way ; no one eyed this high desert waste , 8,000 feet above sea level between Yosemite and the lonely Nevada border , and imagined a shopping mall in its place .
Count us all lucky .
Only five percent of Bodie 's structures are still standing , but considering how large Bodie was , that 's still a lot for a ghost town -- more than two hundred .
And unlike Tombstone , Calico or any number of other " preserved " ghost towns in the West , it 's not a tourist trap where you can buy cotton candy from gunfight - staging actors playing oldey - timey cowboys ; the town is kept in a state of " arrested decay , " which means the park rangers that patrol its dusty streets focus on making sure what 's left of Bodie does n't fall down , but they could care less about painting , weatherizing or cleaning up the decades - old trash that 's heaped everywhere .
I bought a little self - guided tourbook at the gate when I visited .
It 's full of fascinating tidbits , which I 'll be quoting below :
By 1879 Bodie boasted a population of 10,000 and was second to none for wickedness , badmen and " the worst climate out of doors . "
One little girl , whose family was taking her to the remote and infamous town , wrote in her diary : " Goodbye God , I 'm going to Bodie . "
The phrase came to be known throughout the West .
The old general store has been turned into a small museum .
Other than that , the buildings remain untouched .
Sitting creepily in the back of that museum was this vintage hearse , which once plied the streets of Bodie with its morbid cargo .
( Awesome band name : " Morbid Cargo . " )
Killings occurred with monotonous regularity , sometimes becoming almost daily events .
The fire bell , which tolled the ages of the deceased when they were buried , rang often and long .
Below : a hollow grave in the Bodie cemetery , used for hiding bottles of liquor during Prohibition .
Robberies , stage holdups and street fights provided variety , and the town 's 65 saloons offered many opportunities for relaxation after hard days of work in the mines .
The Reverend F.M. Warrington saw it in 1881 as " a sea of sin , lashed by the tempests of lust and passion . "
Above : the Methodist church , erected in 1882 and abandoned in 1932 .
" Since then , the interior has been badly vandalized , and the Ten Commandments painted on oilcloth which once hung behind the pulpit ( ' Thou shall not steal ' ) has been stolen . "
Below : a saloon , as seen through a hole in the door .
I 'm not sure if this sign is original , but it leads to the approximate location of Bodie 's red light district , where ladies of the night " lived and worked in a row of one - room cabins called ' cribs . ' "
Rosa May was the town 's most famous prostitute .
Born in Pennsylvania , she ran away at age 16 and drifted west , where she worked as a prostitute in mining camps to survive .
She moved to Bodie in 1890 , where in 1911 she died after caring for sick miners during a pneumonia outbreak .
( Yep , a hooker with a heart of gold . )
Considered a hero by the miners , she was nonetheless buried beyond the gates of the town cemetery because of her profession , alongside murderers and other Bodians of ill repute .
Her sad wooden headstone , split from age and temperature fluctuations , reads
Rosa Elizabeth
White
" Rosa May "
Born Jan. 1855
Died in Bodie , in the winter of 1911 - 1912 .
Sacrificed herself for Bodie miners .
In the 60s , a descendant of one of the miners she saved erected a new tombstone for her a few yards away :
They might not have been able to save Rosa May , but they did save her red light , which hangs in the town 's small museum .
Lots of fascinating junk still sits rusting around Bodie .
Old cars especially :
Inside this house , you can still see -- if you squint -- wire hangars in the closet .
All that 's left of the old bank is the vault .
The rest of it burned in the fire of 1932 , which devastated much of the town .
There are n't many houses in Bodie you can actually go inside , with a few super dangerous exceptions , like this place .
Through the window you can see the old Standard Mine and Mill , the massive success of which took the town from a population of 20 in 1878 to 10,000 just two years later .
Between 1860 and 1941 , it produced nearly $ 100 million in gold and silver .
The drive to Bodie is a beautiful one .
I had to stop and take a picture of this pasturing herd of sheep .
Most houses in Bodie are filled with the same things that houses in ghost towns everywhere are filled with : broken old crap .
See what I mean :
I kept thinking how lonely this place must be at night .
Believe it or not , Bodie is open year - round -- even in the dead of winter , when snow piles up five feet high and they stop plowing the roads .
There 's always a park ranger or two on the property to ensure that vandals do n't wreak havoc or start fires , so if you decide that 20 miles on a snowmobile is doable , they 'll happily collect your five dollars and let you wander around ( in snowshoes ) .
I think that 's kinda cool .
I found this postcard in an antique store a few weeks ago .
It represents all that Bodie is not :

Chemicals used in plastics feminise the brains of little boys ' so that they avoid rough and tumble games '
Study : Chemicals used in plastics can affect babies in the womb
Chemicals used in plastics are ' feminising ' the brains of baby boys , a disturbing study shows .
Those exposed to high doses in the womb are less likely to play with ' male ' toys such as cars .
They are also less willing to join ' rough and tumble ' games .
The research adds to growing evidence that hormone - disrupting chemicals in thousands of household - products are interfering with the development of children .
Environmental campaigners called the study ' extremely worrying ' and called for a crackdown .
The study looked at phthalates , chemicals which can mimic the female sex hormone oestrogen .
Some experts believe they are partly to blame for the increase in genital defects in boys and lower sperm counts in men over recent decades .
But the new research is the first to link hormone - mimicking chemicals to behaviour .
There are fears of further effects as the young children in the study grow up .
Although the plastics industry insists phthalates are safe , the EU has banned many of them from cosmetics , teething rings and children 's toys .
But pregnant women are still exposed to phthalates , which are used to soften plastics in household items such as plastic furniture , shoes , PVC flooring and shower curtains .
They can also be transferred to food and drink from plastic packaging .
The new study , published in the International Journal of Andrology , was led by Dr Shanna Swan , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Rochester in New York State .
Her team tested urine samples from mothers in the 28th week of pregnancy for traces of phthalates .
The women , who gave birth to 74 boys and 71 girls , were contacted again when their children were aged four to seven and asked about the toys the youngsters played with , the activities they liked and their personalities .
The researchers found that higher concentrations of two types of common phthalate - DEHP and DBP - were strongly linked with more feminine play in the boys but had no impact on girls .
The higher - phthalate boys were less likely than other boys to play with cars , trains and guns or engage in rough - and - tumble games such as playfighting .
They preferred ' gender - neutral ' activities such as sports .
Professor Swan believes the chemicals reduce levels of the male sex hormone testosterone in unborn babies during a critical window of development between the eighth and 24th week of pregnancy .
This alters the development of the brain as well as male genitals .
She said last night : ' If replicated , these findings would be of serious concern because they indicate that these common chemicals can significantly alter the development of the male brain . '
A previous study by Dr Swan found that boys whose mothers had the highest phthalate levels were more likely to have undescended testicles and smaller genitals than other baby boys .
In animal studies , males with similar genital changes had lower sperm counts .
Elizabeth Salter - Green , director of the chemicals campaign group CHEM Trust , said last night : ' These results are extremely worrying .
We now know that phthalates , to which we are all constantly exposed , are extremely worrying from a health perspective , leading to disruption - of male reproduction health and , it appears , male behaviour too .
' This feminising capacity of phthalates makes them true " gender benders " .
Clearly the boys who have been studied are still young , but reduced masculine play at this age may lead to other " feminised development " in later life .
' This can not be good news for their long term health and development , or that of our society in general . '
But Tim Edgar of the European Council for Plasticisers and Intermediates said : ' We need to get some scientific experts to look at this study in more detail before we can make a proper judgment .
' However , given the simple approach of the research and the relatively small sample of children , I think these results need to be treated with extreme caution .
I do n't think anyone should jump to such conclusions without some much more sophisticated research being carried out . '
Nov. 25 , 2009  --
For the first time , Pakistan has acknowledged connections between its military and two Chicago men accused of planning a terrorist attack in Denmark .
Maj . Gen. Athar Abbas , chief spokesman for Pakistan 's military , confirmed that a retired major had been arrested for connections with David Headley and Tahawwur Rana .
Last month , the FBI arrested and charged the men with planning a terror attack on the Danish newspaper that published cartoons of Prophet Mohammed in 2005 .
Abbas denied reports that active members of the Pakistani military have been arrested in connection with the case .
Court documents link Headley and Rana to Lashkar - e - Taiba , the Pakistan - based terrorist organization blamed for the 2008 attacks on Mumbai , India and the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament .
Pakistan banned the terror group Lashkar - e - Taiba , but security officials acknowledge it still exists and over the past few months , members of the organization have told reporters that they are still recruiting for and plotting attacks in India .
The terror group was created in part by Pakistan 's spy agency , the ISI , in the late 1980s to attack Afghanistan and India .
Abbas denied reports that any current or former ISI agents had been arrested in connection with Headly or Rana .
Had Headley and Rana carried out their alleged attack against the Danish newspaper , Morgenavisen Jyllands - Posten , it would have been one of the first assaults outside of South Asia with Lashkar -e - Taiba connections , U.S. officials said .
Prosecutors told ABC News.com that the men were in direct contact with the leaders of militant groups connected to al - Qaeda in Pakistan and those behind the Mumbai attacks .
Headley , 49 , was arrested on Oct. 3 and has been held without public notice since then , according to prosecutors in Chicago .
Headley , a U.S. citizen of half - Pakistani heritage who was born Daood Gilani , had an initial appearance in court on Oct. 11 .

Connections to al - Oaeda
Rana was arrested on Oct. 18 and had his initial court appearance that day .
CLICK HERE TO READ THE COMPLAINT AGAINST RANA .
Authorities say Headley " waived his rights " and has made statements to the FBI about his connection to the Pakistan terror groups .
The FBI arrested him at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport as he was about to board a flight to Philadelphia for an onward trip to Denmark .
FBI agents said he was carrying a copy of the newspaper , a street guide for Copenhagen , a list of phone numbers and a computer memory stick with ten short videos of the newspaper 's offices and the entrance to a military barracks in Copenhagen .
Authorities said the plot against the paper was referred to as the " Mickey Mouse Project " in communications between Headley and his contact in Pakistan .
Headley had already traveled to Copenhagen in January and visited two different offices of the newspaper , the FBI said .
Rana had reservations to fly to Copenhagen on Oct. 29 , the FBI said .
From Denmark , Headley then flew to Pakistan and met with his contact there , according to the complaint .
Authorities identified the contact as Ilyas Kashmiri , a commander of the Lashkar - 4 - Taiba group , which claimed responsibility for the Mumbai attacks .
The U.S. thought it had killed Kashmiri in a recent drone strike .
Someone claiming to be Kashmiri recently gave an interview to a Pakistani newspaper , in which he said he supported al - Qaeda and that attacks such as the ones in Mumbai will be " nothing compared to what has already been planned . "
Headley , according to prosecutors , posted a message on an internet site in October , stating , " I feel disposed towards violence for the offending parties " for " making fun of Islam . "
According to authorities , other target code words include ' investments , ' ' projects , ' ' business ' and ' action . '
Headley is set to appear in court again Dec. 4 .

Study : Obama foes are n't race - driven
Racism is not a factor driving conservative opposition to President Barack Obama , according to the results of focus groups conducted by Democracy Corps , a Democratic organization , released on Friday .
Nevertheless , members of the conservative base of the GOP said they believe the president is pursuing a “ secret agenda ” designed to push the country toward socialism .

“ This is a pretty dominant view in the Republican Party , ” said Democratic strategist James Carville , who worked on the report .
Rather than attributing their dislike of Obama to race , participants in the focus groups , which were a project of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research , said that their disaffection was borne out of a sense that the president was orchestrating an effort to steer the country away from its “ founding principles . ”
“ They want him to fail , ” said pollster Stan Greenberg .
“ It ’s not just a political motivation , it ’s an ethical imperative given what they think Obama ’s goals are . ”
The research team held focus groups from Sept. 29-30 with conservative voters in suburban Atlanta and another set of meetings with conservative - leaning independents in the Cleveland area .
The Atlanta groups consisted of older white , self - identified conservatives who voted for both John McCain and a Republican Congressional candidate .
The Cleveland groups included older white swing voters — half of whom voted for Obama and half of whom supported McCain in 2008 .
In the two places , researchers found vastly different results .
Whether or not they voted for Obama , the independent voters said they wanted to see the president succeed and were not concerned that he was championing so - called socialist policies .
“ On virtually every point of discussion around President Obama and the major issues facing our country , these two audiences simply saw the world in fundamentally different ways — underscoring the extreme disconnect of the conservative Republican base voters , ” the report ’s authors wrote .
Democracy Corps senior adviser , Karl Agne , who participated in a conference call with reporters on Friday to announce the findings , also said conservatives were deeply skeptical of Obama ’s political rise .
In the Atlanta sessions , Agne said , participants routinely asked : “ Who got him here ?
He could n’t possibly have done it on his own .
There has to be money , there has to be power behind him . ”
“ That ’s one of the things they desperately want to uncover about him , ” he said .
Agne said conservatives “ truly identify themselves as a minority and feel under attack in a lot of ways . ”
He added that members of this voting bloc also explicitly rejected the mainstream media and labeled conservative commentators on talk radio and on Fox News as “ truth tellers . ”
Despite their vehement opposition to Obama and the Democratic agenda , Carville noted that conservatives were also unhappy with their own party primarily because they believed Republican leaders are abandoning core party principles .
“ When Republicans try to be like Democrat - lite , ” one conservative focus group participant said , “ they ’re not going to convert any Democrats to them and they ’re just going to lose conservatives . ”

A COUNCIL has become the first in Wales to impose a blanket ban on smokers adopting or fostering children .
Anti-smoking campaigners last night welcomed the move by Merthyr Tydfil council , but critics have pointed out there are already not enough foster parents in Wales .
They fear the changes might discourage potential carers from coming forward and could jeopardise the future of children already in the care of smokers .
Increasing numbers of local authorities , including Cardiff and Pembrokeshire , have banned smokers from fostering children under five but this is the nation ’s first blanket no -smoking rule for foster carers and adopters .
Roslyn Rees , head of operational children ’s services at Merthyr Tydfil council , said : “ The health , safety and well - being of children and young people are at the heart of policies and practice related to children .
“ We acknowledge that expecting all foster carers who currently smoke to give up immediately is not realistic and that it would be detrimental to remove children from stable foster homes because their carer smokes . ”
Anti-smoking campaign group Ash Wales said the move was a step in the right direction .
A spokesman said : “ Children who are exposed to second - hand smoke are at serious risk of pneumonia , bronchitis , headaches and ear infections .
Exposure to second - hand smoke has also been linked to the development and worsening of asthma in children .
“ Young children are particularly susceptible to the effects of second - hand smoke because their lungs and airways are small and their immune systems immature .
Being exposed to second - hand smoke during childhood may also increase the chance of developing chronic constructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and cancer as adults .
“ It is however vital that in addition to protecting children from exposure to tobacco smoke , that smokers themselves are supported to quit .
In introducing this measure we would urge the local authority to ensure that foster careers are given help and advice on how to quit smoking and how to take the necessary steps to make their home smoke free . ”
But others have branded the move discriminatory .
Ex-smoker Pam Brown , 62 , of Merthyr , is the adoptive mother of Independent councillor Adam Brown , who has distance himself from his council ’s political group over the ban .
Mrs Brown said : “ Would they rather a child stay in care than put them with a smoker ?
What about drinkers and recreational drug users ?
They can hide that , smokers can’t – it ’s a very visible habit .
“ I think it ’s absolutely disgusting ; our freedom on smoking was taken away when we were told we ca n’t smoke in pubs , but to be told we are not allowed to smoke in our own homes is ridiculous . ”
Former Talksport presenter Jon Gaunt – who also spent time in care as a child – was famously sacked after branding a councillor who imposed a similar ban in England “ a health Nazi ” .
He told the Western Mail ’s sister paper the Merthyr Express : “ I was in care and the bottom line is the person who saved my life was my aunty Rosemary ; she was a hospital matron and smoked like a trooper . ”
The ban was condemning children to a life in care , he said .
“ Most kids who are in a care home , if they have the choice of passive smoking or the very real danger of abuse in a care home , they would choose a smoker every time . ”

The central question for me in designing software is always
What does it mean ?
With functional programming , this question is especially crisp .
For each data type I define , I want to have a precise and simple mathematical model .
( For instance , my model for behavior is function - of - time , and my model of images is function - of - 2D - space . )
Every operation on the type is also given a meaning in terms of that semantic model .
This specification process , which is denotational semantics applied to data types , provides a basis for
correctness of the implementation ,
user documentation free of implementation detail ,
generating and proving properties , which can then be used in automated testing , and
evaluating and comparing the elegance and expressive power of design decisions .
For an example ( 2D images ) , some motivation of this process , and discussion , see Luke Palmer ’s post Semantic Design .
See also my posts on the idea and use of type class morphisms , which provide additional structure to denotational design .
In spring of 2008 , I started working on a functional 3D library , FieldTrip .
I ’ve designed functional 3D libraries before as part of TBAG , ActiveVRML , and Fran .
This time I wanted a semantics - based design , for all of the reasons given above .
As always , I want a model that is
simple ,
elegant , and
general .
For 3D , I also want the model to be GPU - friendly , i.e. , to execute well on ( modern ) GPUs and to give access to their abilities .
I had n’t thought of or heard a model that I was happy with , and so I did n’t have the sort of firm ground I like to stand on in working on FieldTrip .
Last February , such a model occurred to me .
I ’ve had this blog post mostly written since then .
Recently , I ’ve been focused on functional 3D again for GPU - based rendering , and then Sean McDirmid posed a similar question , which got me thinking again .
Geometry
3D graphics involves a variety of concepts .
Let ’s start with 3D geometry , using a surface ( rather than a solid ) model .
Examples of 3D ( surface ) geometry include
the boundary ( surface ) of a solid box , sphere , or torus ,
a filled triangle , rectangle , or circle ,
a collection of geometry , and
a spatial transformation of geometry .
First model : set of geometric primitives
One model of geometry is a set of geometric primitives .
In this model , union means set union , and spatial transformation means transforming all of the 3D points in all of the primitives in the set .
Primitives contain infinitely ( even uncountably ) many points , so that ’s a lot of transforming .
Fortunately , we ’re talking about what ( semantics ) , and not how ( implementation ) .
What is a geometric primitive ?
We could say it ’s a triangle , specified by three coordinates .
After all , computer graphics reduces everything to sets of triangles .
Oops — we ’re confusing semantics and implementation .
Tessellation approximates curved surfaces by sets of triangles but loses information in the process .
I want a story that includes this approximation process but keeps it clearly distinct from semantically ideal curved surfaces .
Then users can work with the ideal , simple semantics and rely on the implementation to perform intelligent , dynamic , view - dependent tessellation that adapts to available hardware resources .
Another model of geometric primitive is a function from 2D space to 3D space , i.e. , the “ parametric ” representation of surfaces .
Along with the function , we ’ll probably want some means of describing the subset of 2D over which the surface is defined , so as to trim our surfaces .
A simple formalization would be
type Surf = R2 -> Maybe R3
where
type R -- real numbers type R2 = ( R , R ) type R3 = ( R, R , R )
For shading , we ’ll also need normals , and possibly tangents & bitangents ,
We can get these features and more by including derivatives , either just first derivatives or all of them .
See my posts on derivatives and paper Beautiful differentiation .
In addition to position and derivatives , each point on a primitive also has material properties , which determines how light is reflected by and transmitted through the surface at the point .
type Surf = R2 -> Maybe ( R2 :> R3 , Material )
where a :> b contains all derivatives ( including zeroth ) at a point of a function of type a->b .
See Higher - dimensional , higher - order derivatives , functionally .
We could perhaps also include derivatives of material properties :
type Surf = R2 :~>
Maybe ( R3 , Material )
where a :~> b is the type of infinitely differentiable functions .
Combining geometry values
The union function gives one way to combine two geometry values .
Another is morphing ( interpolation ) of positions and of material properties .
What can the semantics of morphing be ?
Morphing betwen two surfaces is easier to define .
A surface is a function , so we can interpolate point - wise : given surfaces r and s , for each point p in parameter space , interpolate between ( a ) r at p and ( b ) s at p , which is what lift A2 ( on functions ) would suggest .
This definition works if we have a way to interpolate between Maybe values .
If we use lift A2 again , now on Maybe values , then the Just / Nothing ( and Nothing / Just ) cases will yield Nothing .
Is this semantics desirable ?
As an example , consider a flat square surface with hole in the middle .
One square has a small hole , and the other has a big hole .
If the size of the hole corresponds to size of the portion of parameter space mapped to Nothing , then point - wise interpolation will always yield the larger hole , rather than interpolating between hole sizes .
On the other hand , the two surfaces with holes might be Just over exactly the same set of parameters , with the function determining how much the Just space gets stretched .
One way to characterize this awkwardness of morphing is that the two functions ( surfaces ) might have different domains .
This interpretation comes from seeing a ->
Maybe b as encoding a function from a subset of a ( i.e. , a partial function on a ) .
Even if we had a satisfactory way to combine surfaces ( point - wise ) , how could we extend it to combining full geometry values , which can contain any number of surfaces ?
One idea is to model geometry as an structured collection of surfaces , e.g. , a list .
Then we could combine the collections element - wise .
Again , we ’d have to deal with the possibility that the collections do not match up .
Surface tuples
Let ’s briefly return to a simpler model of surfaces :
type Surf = R2 -> R3
We could represent a collection of such surfaces as a structured collection , e.g. , a list :
type Geometry = [ Surf ]
But then the type does n’t capture the number of surfaces , leading to mismatches when combining geometry values point - wise .
Alternatively , we could make the number of surfaces explicit in the type , via tuples , possibly nested .
For instance , two surfaces would have type ( Surf , Surf ) .
Interpolation in this model becomes very simple .
A general interpolator works on vector spaces :
lerp :: VectorSpace v => v -> v -> Scalar v -> v lerp a b t = a ^+^ t*^( b ^-^ a )
or on affine spaces :
alerp :: ( AffineSpace p , VectorSpace ( Diff p ) ) => p -> p -> Scalar ( Diff p ) -> p alerp p p' s = p .+^ s*^( p ' .-. p )
Both definitions are in the vector - space package .
That package also includes VectorSpace and AffineSpace instances for both functions and tuples .
These instances , together with instances for real values suffice to make ( possibly nested ) tuples of surfaces be vector spaces and affine spaces .
From products to sums
Function pairing admits some useful isomorphisms .
One replaces a product with a product :
( a → b ) × ( a → c ) ≅ a → ( b × c )
Using this product / product isomorphism , we could replace tuples of surfaces with a single function from R2 to tuples of R3 .
There is also a handy isomorphism that relates products to sums , in the context of functions :
( b → a ) × ( c → a ) ≅ ( b + c ) → a
This second isomorphism lets us replace tuples of surfaces with a single “ surface ” , if we generalize the notion of surface to include domains more complex than R2 .
In fact , these two isomorphisms are uncurried forms of the general and useful Haskell functions ( &&& ) and ( ||| ) , defined on arrows :
( &&& ) :: Arrow ( ~ > ) => ( a ~> b ) -> ( a ~> c ) -> ( a ~> ( b , c ) ) ( | | | ) :: ArrowChoice ( ~ > ) => ( a ~> c ) -> ( b ~> c ) -> ( Either a b ~ > c )
Restricted to the function arrow , ( | || ) == either .
The second isomorphism , uncurry ( ||| ) , has another benefit .
Relaxing the domain type to allow sums opens the way to other domain variations as well .
For instance , we can have types for triangular domains , shapes with holes , and other flavors of bounded and unbounded parameter spaces .
All of these domains are two - dimensional , although they may result from several patches .
Our Geometry type now becomes parameterized :
type Geometry a = a -> ( R3 , Material )
The first isomorphism , uncurry ( &&& ) , is also useful in a geometric setting .
Think of each component of the range type ( here R3 and Material ) as a surface “ attribute ” .
Then ( &&& ) merges two compatible geometries , including attributes from each .
Attributes could include position ( and derivatives ) and shading - related material , as well as non-visual properties like temperature , elasticity , stickiness , etc .
With this flexibility in mind , Geometry gets a second type parameter , which is the range type .
Now there ’s nothing left of the Geometry type but general functions :
type Geometry = (->)
Recall that we ’re looking for a semantics for 3D geometry .
The type for Geometry might be abstract , with ( -> ) being its semantic model .
In that case , the model suggests that Geometry have all of the same type class instances that ( -> ) ( and its full or partial applications ) has , including Monoid , Functor , Applicative , Monad , and Arrow .
The semantics of these instances would be given by the corresponding instances for ( -> ) .
( See posts on type class morphisms and the paper Denotational design with type class morphisms . )
Or drop the notion of Geometry altogether and use functions directly .
Domains
I ’m happy with the simplicity of geometry as functions .
Functions fit the flexibility of programmable GPUs , and they provide simple , powerful & familiar notions of attribute merging ( ( &&& ) ) and union ( ( | || ) / either ) .
The main question I ’m left with : what are the domains ?
One simple domain is a one - dimensional interval , say [ - 1,1 ] .
Two useful domain building blocks are sum and product .
I mentioned sum above , in connection with geometric union ( ( | || ) / either ) Product combines domains into higher - dimensional domains .
For instance , the product of two 1D intervals is a 2D interval ( axis - aligned filled rectangle ) , which is handy for some parametric surfaces .
What about other domains , e.g. , triangular , or having one more holes ?
Or multi-way branching surfaces ?
Or unbounded ?
One idea is to stitch together simple domains using sum .
We do n’t have to build any particular spatial shapes or sizes , since the “ geometry ” functions themselves yield the shape and size .
For instance , a square region can be mapped to a triangular or even circular region .
An infinite domain can be stitched together from infinitely many finite domains .
Or it can be mapped to from a single finite domain .
For instance , the function x -> x / abs ( 1 - x ) maps [ - 1,1 ] to [ - ∞ , ∞ ] .
Alternatively , we could represent domains as typed predicates ( characteristic functions ) .
For instance , the closed interval [ - 1,1 ] would be x -> abs x <= 1 .
Replacing abs with magnitude ( for inner product spaces ) , generalizes this formulation to encompass [ - 1,1 ] ( 1D ) , a unit disk ( 2D ) , and a unit ball ( 3D ) .
I like the simple generality of the predicate approach , while I like how the pure type approach supports interpolation and other pointwise operations ( via lift A2 etc ) .
Tessellation
I ’ve intentionally formulated the graphics semantics over continuous space , which makes it resolution - independent and easy to compose .
( This formulation is typical for 3D geometry and 2D vector graphics .
The benefits of continuity apply to generally imagery and to animation / behavior . )
Graphics hardware specializes in finite collections of triangles .
For rendering , curved surfaces have to be tessellated , i.e. , approximated as collections of triangles .
Desirable choice of tessellation depends on characteristics of the surface and of the view , as well as scene complexity and available CPU and GPU resources .
Formulating geometry in its ideal curved form allows for automated analysis and choice of tessellation .
For instance , since triangles are linear , the error of a triangle relative to the surface it approximates depends on how non-linear the surface is over the subset of its domain corresponding to the triangle .
Using interval analysis and derivatives , non-linearity can be measured as a size bound on the second derivative or a range of first derivative .
Error could also be analyzed in terms of the resulting image rather than the surface .
For a GPU - based implementation , one could tessellate dynamically , in a “ geometry shader ” or ( I presume ) in a more general framework like CUDA or OpenCL .
Abstractness
A denotational model is “ fully abstract ” when it equates observationally equivalent terms .
The parametric model of surfaces is not fully abstract in that reparameterizing a surface yields a different function that looks the same as a surface .
( Surface reparametrization alters the relationship between domain and range , while covering exactly the same surface , geometrically . )
Properties that are independent of particular parametrization are called “ geometric ” , which I think corresponds to full abstraction ( considering those properties as semantic functions ) .
What might a fully abstract ( geometric ) model for geometry be ?
The central question for me in designing software is always
What does it mean ?
With functional programming , this question is especially crisp .
For each data type I define , I want ...
Climate change is already wreaking havoc on the livelihoods of small - scale tea and coffee farmers in some of the world 's poorest countries , according to a three - year research project by Fairtrade drinks producer Cafédirect .
Research across four countries – Kenya , Mexico , Peru and Nicaragua – carried out with the state - funded German Technical Corporation , showed that growers are already being forced uphill to higher altitudes , at a rate of three to four metres a year on average , as temperatures rise .
" A huge number of growers are now experiencing increased instances of pestilence and disease from rises in temperature .
They are also facing prolonged drought and changing weather patterns , " said Cafédirect chief executive , Anne MacCaig .
She argued that the priority for developed countries should be helping the world 's poor to protect themselves against climate change .
" What 's crucial is that there 's an option of sustainable adaptation to safeguard the supply chain .
Climate change is affecting those least able to deal with it .
We ca n't underestimate that . "
Smaller producers , who are reliant on a single crop and often cannot afford to install costly irrigation equipment as temperatures rise , are worst affected , the project , known as AdapCC , found .
Some farmers could see their incomes fall by up to 90 % in the next fifteen years , the researchers say .
They argue that worldwide 30 million farmers will be affected .
Small - scale growers in Peru have seen yields fall by 40 % since last year , compared to 30 % across the country as a whole ; small producers in Mexico have seen yields halve , against a national decline of 7 % , Cafédirect says .
Tea and coffee are on the climate change front line because they only grow in a relatively narrow temperature range .
Research suggested that all four of the countries involved would see the quantity and quality of their crops decline sharply over the coming years .
Cafédirect worked on different ways of helping farmers adapt .
In Kenya , it helped growers diversify into new crops such as passion fruits ; in Peru , farmers were able to use their land to sell carbon credits ; and elsewhere they planted native tree species to help bind the soil and prevent mudslides .
The report came as the government said that it will donate £ 12 m to the Fairtrade Foundation , with the hope of doubling the number of developing country farmers who are awarded the Fairtrade mark .
Fairtrade products pay a premium to relatively small - scale growers , helping to protect them from the vicissitudes of global commodity markets and the buying power of vast multinationals .
The Fairtrade mark is celebrating its 15th birthday , and now covers a wide range of products , from bananas to chocolate .
Sales of Fairtrade products were up by 43 % in 2008 .
Addressing a conference of Fairtrade supporters yesterday , development minister Douglas Alexander said : " Fairtrade products are already a big part of life in the UK , with new products appearing on our shelves every day .
Our £ 12 m funding will help improve this even further . "
The Fairtrade market as a whole is expected to treble , to £ 9bn , by 2013 .
Harriet Lamb , executive director of the Fairtrade Foundation , said : " In the current economic climate , it 's the poorest communities who are hit the hardest , and so positive business models like Fairtrade , which deliver increased development benefits from trade , are more important than ever . "
Deaf children are able to develop a language - like gesture system by making up hand signs and using homemade systems to increase their communication as they grow , just as children with conventional spoken language , research at the University of Chicago shows .
" Other studies on this ' homesigning ' have usually stopped at the point the children go to school , but I have been able to follow children in Nicaragua who are not near a special education school and accordingly continue developing their homesigns independently , " said Marie Coppola , a Research Associate at the University of Chicago , who presented her findings Sunday , Feb. 15 at a news briefing , " Languages without Ancestors , " at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Coppola 's research is the first to show that homesigning forms a foundation leading to more sophisticated , complicated communication .
The capacity of homesigners to adapt and improve their communication based on language learning underlies the growth of a new sign language , Nicaraguan Sign Language , which a community of deaf children developed independently at a school for the deaf in the country 's capital of Managua , Coppola said .
Homesigning is common throughout cultures , but Nicaraguan Sign Language is one of the few established sign languages that a deaf community invented and scholars have studied .
" Since 1996 , I have been working with deaf adolescents and adults in Nicaragua who have not learned Nicaraguan Sign Language , but who have invented their own sign languages that they use with their families , friends and neighbors .
I have learned that these small languages have many characteristics of languages that are signed and spoken around the world , " said Coppola , who has videotaped and studied the interactions with colleagues .
Coppola observed Nicaraguans using gestures frequently when they spoke , and she noticed many , such as those used to describe eating , were consistent in their form .
Deaf children are able to pick up on these gestures and their meanings , as well as invent others to communicate , she said .
In order to serve deaf children , Nicaraguan leaders created a special education school in Managua , but staffed it with teachers who did not use sign language .
They tried to get the children to speak and read people 's lips so they could better adjust to the speaking world .
The children developed their own sign language as a way of communicating with each other .
" When children and adolescents first came together at the school ( the Melania Morales School for Special Education ) in the late 1970s , they brought with them their homesign systems .
These signs and ways of combining signs into sentences that children used at home served as the seeds for the new sign language that developed as they began interacting with each other regularly .
" We do not have videotape of the earliest years of Nicaraguan Sign Language from 1978 to 1986 .
Therefore , studying homesign systems can give us an idea of what Nicaraguan Sign Language looked like at its very beginning . "
Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story
By Joanne Laurier and David Walsh
6 October 2009
Veteran documentary filmmaker Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story sets out to examine the recent financial collapse .
His aim , he suggests , is a critique of the existing economic set - up .
Michael Moore in Capitalism : A Love Story
“ This time the culprit is much bigger than General Motors , and the crime scene is wider than Flint , Michigan , ” observe the film ’s production notes , a reference to Moore ’s first documentary , Roger & Me , made twenty years ago .
The new film is Moore ’s fifth major documentary , three of which , Bowling for Columbine , Fahrenheit 9/11 , and Sicko , are among the largest - grossing non-fiction films .
Moore has developed a following as a result of the concern he demonstrates for working people and their difficulties .
There will no doubt be a popular response to Capitalism .
That a film offering a criticism of the profit system opens in nearly one thousand movie theaters in the United States is obviously an unusual and noteworthy occurrence .
There is certainly a connection between this and a growing popular radicalization under conditions of economic devastation .
But what is the precise connection ?
Moore and his greatest admirers see him as the vanguard of some oppositional movement ( whose character , however , is left remarkably vague ) .
Is this the reality ?
The filmmaker maintains a certain independence from the mass media where lies and misinformation dominate .
He has shown backbone on a number of occasions .
Capitalism is concerned with nothing less than “ the disastrous impact of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans ( and by default , the rest of the world ) , ” according to the film ’s press notes .
In other words , Moore comes before his audience as a political individual with something to say , and we will judge him and his film primarily in that light .
A number of elements in the film are to his credit .
First , as noted above , genuine sympathy for a suffering population .
The documentary , for instance , counters the claims of the media pundits and the Obama administration that the victims of predatory lending by the banks are in part to blame for the economic collapse .
Instead , Moore demonstrates how the wages , pensions and healthcare of the working class have been decimated in the last quarter century as a huge transfer of wealth to the financial elite has taken place .
Capitalism begins by facetiously comparing ancient Rome to present - day America — vast social inequality , slave labor , and a regime that employs torture ( an image of former Vice President Dick Cheney appears onscreen ) .
The film ’s overall format is familiar , perhaps too familiar .
Moore does the narrating , as well as the interviewing and provoking .
Through the sometimes clever use of television and movie clips he makes his points and those of his talking heads .
He focuses on some of the crimes of the system .
Early on in film , a family in Lexington , North Carolina , is shown videoing their own eviction by a police force that descends upon them in excessive numbers .
The next scene takes place in Detroit .
A carpenter is boarding up the residence of an angry and distraught family — their home of 41 years .
“ This is capitalism — a system of giving and taking — mostly taking , ” says Moore in a voice - over .
“ In a country run like a corporation , ” other incidents are highlighted in the film :
* A disabled railway worker ’s family in Peoria , Illinois , lose their home of 20 years .
In a further humiliation , the bank hires the family to empty and clean the foreclosed property for $ 1,000 .
* In December 2008 , workers occupy Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago over monies owed them by a company shuttering its doors .
They eventually win an average of $ 6,000 per person , although the plant closes .
* Airline pilots for regional and commuter airlines make so little that they have to be warned by employers not to apply for food stamps while in uniform .
The co-pilot on Continental Connection Flight 3407 , which crashed in February 2009 , earned a little over $ 16,000 the previous year .
* Banks and corporations take out so - called “ dead peasant ” life insurance policies on rank - and - file employees , whose payoffs are to the companies , not the employees ’ surviving family members .
* Thousands of young people were unjustly incarcerated in a privatized juvenile detention center in Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania , on the order of two judges who were receiving millions in kickbacks from the facility ’s owners .
The footage of these events and the moving comments of those involved are by far the Capitalism ’s strongest features .
Moore makes the legitimate point that much of the country now resembles the wretched conditions in Flint , Michigan , he documented in Roger & Me .
Without being unduly harsh to Moore , one must say that his films stand out in large measure by default : because the fairly elementary truths he points out are systematically and disgracefully concealed by the news media — and Hollywood , for that matter .
But what does Moore make of these basic facts of American ( and global ) life ?
Here his severe limitations as a thinker , and an artist , present themselves .
The confusion and eclecticism , of course , are not simply his , but one must say what is — that it is impossible to see one ’s way out of the present crisis on the basis of his analysis .
Little is added to an understanding of the present situation by more of the usual Moore antics : putting crime scene tape around AIG ’s headquarters ; driving a truck up to Citibank demanding the return of public money disbursed under the federal government ’s TARP plan ; trying to gain entrance to the GM headquarters in Detroit — once again .
The gimmick of attempting a “ citizen ’s arrest ” of a corporate looter has worn very thin .
A few of the gags , his or other people ’s , are still amusing .
A mock musical appeal to tourists to visit Cleveland makes its point : “ See our river that catches on fire … .
It ’s so polluted that all our fish have AIDS … .
See the sun almost three times a year … .
Buy a house for the price of a VCR ....
Our main export is crippling depression ....
But at least we ’re not Detroit ! ”
The film is disjointed and jumbled .
Moore has great difficulty separating the essential from the inessential .
There is no shortage of social atrocities in America .
The filmmaker indignantly introduces us to the “ condo vultures ” and “ bottom feeders ” who for 25 cents on the dollar grab up foreclosed properties .
What does the filmmaker expect ?
Too much moralizing , sentimentality , and even manipulation go on .
Moore has an unpleasant tendency of letting his camera linger on the distressed faces of his social victims .
The most serious weaknesses , however , involve his continued support for the Democratic Party , and Obama , and his inability to advance any serious alternative to the capitalist system .
His film is dominated by an internal contradiction : between the harsh social facts he presents and the paltriness of his political solution .
Capitalism : A Love Story absurdly advocates the “ elimination ” of the profit system at the same time as it praises one of the parties , and that party ’s leading figure , who preside over that system .
While he excoriates the obviously corrupt individual Democrat ( Christopher Dodd , Richard Holbrooke ) , he gives a platform to other of its spokespeople , especially those who posture as “ populists . ”
For example , Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio is given wide coverage in the film .
Kaptur , like a Dennis Kucinich , is capable of any amount of demagogy about Wall Street and Goldman Sachs , but she is staunchly pro-military , a protectionist , a ferocious anti-communist , and an opponent of abortion .
As for Obama , Moore is obliged to mention in passing that Goldman Sachs was the largest private contributor to his 2008 presidential campaign .
Robert Rubin , Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner , the brain trust of Obama ’s “ Government Goldman , ” come under fire — but without any mention of the president himself .
Capitalism refers to events that occurred in the spring of 2009 , by which time the right - wing character of the Obama administration had shown itself , both on the domestic and foreign fronts , and Moore is entirely silent on that .
He is one of those who invariably invoke Franklin D. Roosevelt as the ultimate reformer .
Roosevelt , a canny representative of the American bourgeoisie , lived in another era .
What remains of the Democratic Party ’s legacy of social reform , particularly in the form of healthcare “ reform , ” is under attack today by a president whom Moore refers to as — potentially — the 21st Century Roosevelt !
The filmmaker presents himself as a kind of “ Christian socialist . ”
He offers a forum to various bishops and priests in ravaged areas like Detroit and Chicago , where the Church plays on the misery and illusions of the some of the poorest of the poor , to pontificate about social ills .
The bishop of Chicago is filmed sermonizing and giving communion to the Republic workers during their occupation .
His argument , repeated a number of times , that capitalism is “ evil , ” is false .
It is a socio- economic system that arose under certain objective conditions and was thoroughly revolutionary and progressive in its day .
The parasitic character of contemporary capitalism is bound with its historical decay , and not , in the first place , the moral depravity of its leading figures .
At the film ’s climactic moment , Moore calls for the replacement of capitalism …by “ democracy . ”
What does that mean ?
It means more than anything else that he has n’t the political courage to mention socialism .
To the extent that Moore believes the ahistorical , eclectic views he espouses in Capitalism : A Love Story , he is deluding himself .
To the extent that he attempts to sell them to a broad audience , he is deluding others .
It may be too early for Halloween , but it ’s never too early to turn into a skeleton for your family and friends to find .

NATIONAL STRIKE FOR
THE AMERICAN MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASSES !!!
TELL OUR GOVERNMENT , THE MEDIA , THE CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE OVER OUR COUNTRY THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE HAD IT !
Bank CEOS and other executives have bankrupted their companies — and then come running to us for help .
Insurance and pharmaceutical corporations play games with our health and the well - being of our loved ones and focus only on their bottom line .
OUR treasury is run by former Goldman Sachs executives with an open door to Wall St which is allowed to write their own regulation and STEAL billions of our money — - after depleting our pensions .
They are not required to account for the money — and are continuing to pay HUGE bonuses to the THIEVES who broke our economy .
And no one is prosecuted .
This is economic treason .
Lobbyists and corporations buy our congress and senators to vote for THEIR interests , not OURS .
Our new administration is , sadly , allowing lobbyists and corporations to dictate our legislation and our future .
The top income bracket as recently as 1980 used to pay 70 % income tax — and NOW pay LESS than the middle and working classes who have borne the brunt of carrying this economy too long .
THERE ARE NO JOBS .
WAGES HAVE STAGNATED FOR OVER TWO DECADES , and with a too - small job market , wages have fallen even further and employers are taking advantage and exploiting the situation .
ENOUGH !
WE NEED A NATIONAL STRIKE !!
Because of our current Depression and in remembrance of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 , the date is :
*** THURSDAY , OCTOBER 29th FOR THIS STRIKE .
***
– NO WORK .
– NO SPENDING .
– DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT DAY .
– DO NOT SHOW UP FOR WORK .
The people in other countries take to the streets when their government and societies are corrupt .
We must do this , too .
It ’s time for another revolution that will remind us of our power AND remind these criminals why they need to FEAR US .
WE are the economy .
WE are the government .
This country belongs TO US .
*** THURSDAY , OCT 29th .***
NATIONAL STRIKE OF THE AMERICAN
MIDDLE & WORKING CLASSES
ENOUGH !!
PASS THIS ON …

Dead Space Sequel to Pack Online Multiplayer ?
The listing on industry networking site Linked In seeks an " Senior Online Level Designer for the Dead Space franchise on Xbox360 and PS3 . "
While it is not stated whether the online play will be competitive or cooperative , separate multiplayer levels are indicated .
Though only Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are mentioned -- Dead Space also hit PC - - theoretically this could simply indicate that consoles are the sequel 's main focus .
Dead Space 2 has still yet to be formally announced , though its existence has been previously revealed by other job listings and statements by various EA figures .
Visceral Games -- formerly EA Redwood Shores -- recently released the Wii on - rails shooter prequel Dead Space Extraction to a poor sales reception and is currently developing the action allegory Dante 's Inferno , due out on February 9 .
After eight years of arduous state and federal environmental reviews , the promoters of Cape Wind , a wind energy project off the Massachusetts coast , had every reason to believe that they were home free .
Then the Wampanoag tribes asked the Interior Department to declare all of Nantucket Sound , where the 130 wind turbines would be built , a “ traditional cultural property ” and , they hoped , block construction .
Tribal officials say their culture requires them to greet the sunrise each day and that this ritual requires unobstructed views .
Their claim should be rejected by the responsible federal and state officials .
Another round of bureaucratic reviews would drag out an approval process that has gone on much too long and give opponents time to find some other way to derail the effort .
The tribes ’ claim seems unsupportable .
“ Traditional cultural properties ” tend to be defined areas  a ceremonial burial ground , for instance  not a huge , unenclosed portion of the ocean .
Awarding Nantucket
Bay such status could cast a legal shadow over a host of other activities , including shipping and commercial fishing .
There is also evidence that the tribes have been working hand - in - glove with the project ’s main opposition group , the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound .
The alliance includes many local people but has been largely underwritten by wealthy homeowners from Nantucket , Martha ’s Vineyard and Cape Cod who hate the idea of having 440 - foot windmills on the horizon .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - European scientists and health authorities are facing angry questions about why H1N1 flu has not caused death and destruction on the scale first feared , and they need to respond deftly to ensure public support .

Accusations are flying in British and French media that the pandemic has been “ hyped ” by medical researchers to further their own cause , boost research grants and line the pockets of drug companies .
Britain ’s Independent newspaper this week asked “ Pandemic ?
What Pandemic ?. ”
In their response , scientists are walking a fine line .
They say that although the virus is mild , it can still kill , and that the relatively low fatalities in Europe are in part the result of official response to their advice .
On suggestions of “ hyping ” the threat to boost research funding , they point out that while we know enough to start to protect the vulnerable , we need to know a lot more to conquer the virus , and funding for new research and drugs is vital to be equipped for future pandemics .
H1N1 is hitting a younger population -- adults in their 20s and 30s and children -- and the global death count so far is more than 6,000 , according to the WHO .
While seasonal flu attacks about 20 percent of the population in an average year , experts estimate that even in Britain -- the worst - hit country in Europe so far -- fewer than 10 percent of people have had H1N1 swine flu .
Fred Hayden , influenza research co-ordinator at the Wellcome Trust and a former World Health Organization ( WHO ) expert , said early planning is paying off , but added :
“ I would n’t characterize this as a “ mild ” pandemic at all .
We are seeing some very unfortunate loss of life .
I think it a bit early to make that judgment . ”
Yet the word “ mild ” is used so often to describe H1N1 ’s impact in most people that it is prompting skeptical publics to ask what all the fuss is about .
Why they should care ?
And why take a vaccine ?
France ’s Le Parisien newspaper ran the headline : “ Swine flu : why the French distrust the vaccine ” and noted a gap between the predicted impact of H1N1 and the less dramatic reality .
“ Although some 30 - odd people have died .... the disease is not really frightening , ” it said .
“ Dangerous liaisons between certain experts , the labs and the government , the obscurity of the contracts between the state and the pharma firms have added to the doubt . ”
SCENARIO REVISED DOWN
In Britain , health authorities ’ original worst - case scenario -- which said as many as 65,000 could die from H1N1 -- has twice been revised down and the prediction is now for around 1,000 deaths , way below the average annual toll of 4,000 to 8,000 deaths from seasonal winter flu .
A group of eminent scientists who called a media briefing in London this week to announce 7.5 million pounds ( $ 12.4 million ) of new funding for British research into H1N1 found their plans hijacked by reporters asking why the pandemic was so weak .
Scientists say the truth is they ca n’t win .
The WHO has been urging countries to prepare for a flu pandemic since 1997 , when H5N1 avian flu infected 18 people in Hong Kong and was stopped only after a mass slaughter of birds .
The re-emergence of H5N1 in China and South Korea in 2003 fueled the urgency to get ready .
Now that it has arrived , the apparently low impact of the H1N1 pandemic so far may show that the planning is paying off , the Wellcome Trust ’s Hayden said .
British officials repeatedly said the nation was well - prepared for a flu pandemic .
It had high stocks of antivirals and orders for enough vaccines to cover its population in place very early .
Hayden said comparisons with earlier flu pandemics like the one in 1918 , which killed an estimated 230,000 people in Britain and up to 50 million worldwide , were skewed by the fact that there were so few effective treatments at that time .
“ We did n’t have antivirals then , and we did n’t have antibiotics for the high frequency of bacterial complications , ” he said .
“ We have these kinds of interventions now and they are making a difference . ”
At the funding briefing , Peter Openshaw , director of the center for respiratory infection at Imperial College London , dismissed suggestions that scientists were enjoying the fruits of a pandemic in the form of big grants to keep them in work .
“ This is not something that we are licking our lips and welcoming , ” he said .
“ But there is certainly an enormous outbreak of scientific information that has greatly enriched our understanding of flu . ”

Softphones are basically software apps installed onto your computer or mobile device so they can be used like a hard phone .
In essence , they are virtual phones that are not tied to any physical location .
You can connect a USB phone to your computer so you can leverage the softphone ’s functionality and features and communicate as you would using a regular phone .
Often , softphones running on a computer and coupled with a headset deliver better call quality than VoIP apps on smartphones .
But generally , aside from the computer or mobile device , there is no need for other devices or physical phones that require a power adapter or an ac adapter .
Wow .
Matthew Yglesias catches David Ignatius worrying that the Fed may not have enough political support in its efforts to raise interest rates and fight inflation .
As Matt correctly notes , this is a remote issue — unemployment is high , inflation is low , and the Fed has no business raising rates any time soon .
This really ca n’t be overemphasized .
I like to use Glenn Rudebusch ’s estimate of the Taylor Rule — a rule relating interest rates to unemployment and inflation — that appears to track past Fed behavior .
The chart below shows the rate predicted by the rule versus the actual rate on 3 - month T - bills ( I ’m using that rather than the target Fed funds rate for trivial computational convenience ) . :
Federal Reserve of San Franciso , Federal Reserve of St. Louis
The Fed has been up against the zero lower bound since the beginning of 2009 , roughly when unemployment rose above 11 percent ; right now the Taylor rule says that the Fed funds rate should be minus 6.7 % .
So why should the Fed even be thinking about raising rates any time soon ?
We ’re not likely to see 7 % unemployment for years — and by the time we do , inflation will probably be even lower than it is now .
I ’d add that the Fed really should be raising its inflation target , meaning an even longer pause before it raises rates .
Monetary tightening should n’t be on the agenda for a long , long time .
Pläne des Verkehrsministers Regierung prüft Pkw - Maut
Der Verkehrsminister prescht vor : CSU - Politiker Ramsauer erwägt die Einführung einer Pkw - Maut , um Autofahrer stärker an der Finanzierung des Straßenbaus zu beteiligen .
Baden - Württembergs designierter Ministerpräsident Mappus springt ihm bei - er will dafür die Kfz - Steuer streichen und die Mineralölsteuer senken .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford ( R ) was the first major figure to speak out when he wrote last Nov. 15 in The Wall Street Journal , “ I find myself in a lonely position .
While many states and local governments are lining up for a bailout from Congress , I went to Washington recently to oppose such bailouts .
I may be the only governor to do so . ”
Texas Gov. Rick Perry ( R ) joined him shortly after .
But it cannot be denied that Palin is the dynamic force awakening the heartland to this new perspective .
The victory of the Conservative Party over the Republican Party in NY - 23 is the first step out of the abstract and into the concrete .
Maybe Perry should change his brand to Conservative Party in his race in Texas and leave Kay Bailey Hutchison to the Republican nostalgicos .
Dick Cheney is campaigning for Hutchison , and they seem a fairly good match .
Palin is stumping for Perry .
In our times there has not been such a critical division in substance and outlook .
The critical turning in NY - 23 came when Tim Pawlenty , the governor of Minnesota who expects to run for president in 2012 , followed Palin ’s initiative and threw his support to the Conservative Party candidate , Doug Hoffman .
By the time Scozzafava dropped out , Palin , Pawlenty , Perry , former New York Gov. George Pataki , Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannEvangelicals should n't be defending Trump in tiff over editorial Mellman :
The ' lane theory ' is the wrong lane to be in White House backs Stephen Miller amid white nationalist allegations MORE , former Tennessee Sen.
Fred Thompson and other prominent Republicans had lined up with them .
Newt Gingrich led the traditionalists in support of Scozzafava .
Cheney might be considered in the Gingrich column as well .
Haley Barbour , governor of Mississippi and head of the Republican Governors Association , supports Perry in Texas and might be considered among the Conservatives .
With 43 percent of the voters in a poll not long ago claiming to be independent , it is fully possible today to see a third - party challenge in 2012 .
Palin would be the perfect candidate .
Two issues need a fundamental new approach :
The war and the bailouts .
In my opinion the Republicans are dead wrong on the war and the Democrats are dead wrong on the bailouts .
And there are two people on these fronts today who present better ideas : Ron Paul and Marine Capt .
Matthew Hoh .
The Wall Street Journal reports that in a recent online poll at ronpaul.com , 93 percent of Texans said they think Ron Paul should run for president in 2012 .
Paul independents and conservatives could well find a place of convergence in the rising Conservative Party .
As Daniel McCarthy , senior editor at The American Conservative wrote recently , Republicans have yet to comprehend the magnitude of their loss in recent years among young people .
“ If Republicans are to have any hope of turning back that tide , they must heed the man who excited more students and young people than any other candidate for the GOP nomination — Ron Paul . ”
Political parties are exclusively about packaging .
New ideas and ideals need new packages or they will be beaten back by senior generations demanding the old hat , the old calcified forms and the old orthodoxies .
This is still fantasy football , but a Palin / Perry ticket representing the Conservative Party in 2012 would really wake things up .

Her talk show regularly draws seven million viewers , nearly twice as many as the next biggest talk show , “ Dr. Phil . ”
Her endorsement of Barack Obama is widely credited with helping elect him president in 2008 .
She even claims to own the trademark on the phrase “ Aha moment . ”
Ms. Winfrey , 55 , told the staff of her Chicago - based show about her decision late on Thursday afternoon , according to people who were told but who insisted on anonymity because they agreed to wait until Ms. Winfrey makes the official announcement .
Then she informed her business partners at the networks and instructed Harpo employees to start calling her affiliate stations .
The stations were told they could report her decision on local newscasts , apparently to increase audiences for her formal announcement on Friday .
It remains unclear what on - camera role Ms. Winfrey will have at OWN , which is a 50 - 50 joint venture with Discovery .
The management team at OWN has been busy creating a programming plan but has remained mostly silent about the lineup in deference to Ms. Winfrey and her decision - making process .
Discovery executives declined to comment on Thursday evening .
The OWN channel will have its premiere in January 2011 , according to a person with knowledge of Ms. Winfrey ’s decision who insisted on anonymity .
Ms. Winfrey made clear to her staff members that she will not transfer the show to cable .
She is expected to produce new programs for OWN , and will appear occasionally on some of them .
Ms. Winfrey was believed to be in renewal talks this fall with CBS Television Distribution and another syndicator , Sony , which distributes her most recent spinoff , “ Dr. Oz . ”
At the same time , she considered ending her talk show altogether .
In recent days television executives said they sensed that Ms. Winfrey was leaning toward an exit .
CBS seemed eager to keep its door propped open for Ms. Winfrey , saying in a statement that , “ We look forward to working with her for the next several years , and hopefully afterwards as well . ”
Acknowledging OWN , they added , “ We know that anything she turns her hand to will be a great success . ”

OWN is expected to replace the Discovery Health Channel , which is currently available in more than 70 million homes .
Her cable plans , however , have been fraught with delays .
OWN was announced in January 2008 and was originally expected to make its debut this winter , but those plans were scuttled because of management turnover and a turbulent advertising climate .
Lawmaker Butana Komphela , chair of South Africa 's sports committee , was quoted as saying : " She is like a raped person .
She is afraid of herself and does not want anyone near her .
If she commits suicide , it will be on all our heads .
The best we can do is protect her and look out for her during this trying time .
" South African athletics officials confirmed Semenya is now receiving trauma counselling at the University of Pretoria .
Caster has not competed since the World Athletics Championships last month when the IAAF ordered gender tests on her amid claims she might be male .

I can also track the movies I have seen and keep a list of those I want to see .
Open Home – ( Full & Paid )
One of the best features of any Android Powered device is the ability to customize not only your “ wallpaper ” but also your icons , widgets and overall layout of your device .

Even though I happen to have satellite radio in my car I still find myself forgetting that new catchy songs title when it comes time to download it .
Shazam not only will keep a list of all the songs I tag it definitely is a “ wow factor ” application when you can use it with your friends at a store , mall , club when the music is playing and there is no way to get the title or the artist .
This is an app you may not use every day , but I am happy every time I use it .n’t ?
Well now you can fix both of these issues with Visual Voicemail .
The application is a bit boring looking , but ti is straight forward and it works as described .

The three long thrillers that make up the trilogy ( American Tabloid , 1995 ; The Cold Six Thousand , 2001 ; Blood ’s a Rover , 2009 ) present a brutal counterhistory of America in the 1960s and 1970s — the assassinations , the social convulsions , the power - elite plotting — through the lives of invented second - and third - echelon operatives in the great political crimes of the era .
The trilogy is biblical in scale , catholic in its borrowing from conspiracy theories , absorbing to read , often awe - inspiring in the liberties taken with standard fictional presentation , and , in its imperfections and lapses , disconcerting .
Ellroy , who is in his early sixties , is the celebrated , prolific , and popular author of a body of genre crime fiction , crime journalism , and a forensic memoir dealing with his own dark family history .
His work has been made into movies and television shows , and widely translated .
There are Web sites devoted to Ellroy , and he connects with his fans through Facebook .
The Underworld USA Trilogy is generally regarded as Ellroy ’s magnum opus .
It is unique in its ambitions , and proceeds at a level of art distinctly above that attained in his famously lurid and violent but more conventional books .
It is a fiction unlike any other .
The Underworld USA Trilogy gives a literary answer to the question of what it was that so deformed the history Americans traversed in the 1960s and 1970s .
As Ellroy presents it , a constellation of independent but collaborating power centers , pursuing sometimes identical and sometimes antagonistic objectives , was responsible .
They include the secretive tycoon Howard Hughes , the Mafia , J. Edgar Hoover and his FBI , Jimmy Hoffa and his corrupt associates , and a disorganized but still potent consortium of KKK and other white supremacist groups , as well as international narcotics producers .
Hoover is the sole unmoved mover .
Howard Hughes is insane , Hoover is getting there , and it is his strategies that dominate all .
Hoover , like the KKK , is phobic about blacks and Communists .
The objectives of the other players are largely pecuniary .
The forces in opposition to this network of villains include Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement , the antiwar movement , an inchoate pro-Castro left afflicted by divisions over the question of violence , and , later , a Black Power movement in which violence has become accepted policy .
Also in the opposition but compromised by their family ’s power intrigues in the past , and by their own personal weaknesses , are the Kennedy brothers .
Agents provocateurs abound , ancillary murders occur , people switch sides , ghastly errors are made .
This chaos of mismated plotting yields the great assassinations of the period : John Fitzgerald Kennedy , Robert Francis Kennedy , Martin Luther King Jr. ( Cases have been made for expanding this marquee death list to take in Malcolm X and Walter Reuther . ) …
Deacdes of studies have produced visions of Mars expeditions like this one , but have gotten us little closer to actually carrying out such missions .

Why is human Mars exploration so surprisingly hard ?
As space policy experts mull over alternative strategies for astronaut exploration of the solar system , possibly including human flight to Mars , the recently - concluded fortieth anniversary celebrations of the Apollo 11 moon landing inspire one specific question : what ’s taken so long ?
In the heady days of the Apollo triumphs , even the “ pessimistic ” forecasts imagined it might take as long as twenty years to get astronauts to Mars .
Optimistic schedules put the first footsteps on the Red Planet — another “ giant leap for mankind ” — as early as 1982 .
When it did n’t happen in fifteen or twenty years , or even in twice that period , or even by current plans by twice again that period , the question naturally arose : why not ?
Had the national will failed ?
Had our adventurous culture lost its nerve ?
In the heady days of the Apollo triumphs , even the “ pessimistic ” forecasts imagined it might take as long as twenty years to get astronauts to Mars .
In recent years a better perspective has become possible , and it is far less disrespectful to the successors of Apollo .
Furthermore , it suggests that even with an immediate post - Apollo national decision ( and a reasonable budget ) to send astronauts to Mars , it would not have proven possible by 1982 , or 1989 , or even perhaps anytime in the century if the task proved too politically damaging in the face of setbacks .
Here ’s the way I ’ve come to see it .
It should have been no surprise that “ On - To - Mars ” never happened .
The reasons directly affect today ’s chances of tackling the task in the near future .
First , since Apollo had gloriously succeeded in its major purpose — restoring American status as the leading high - tech nation in the world — the political support for further spending evaporated in the face of new , more urgent challenges .
Apollo had “ worked ” .
Making the point again on a different stage would have added little if any value .
Apollo had worked so well , some argue , that its validation of American aerospace competence was the central factor in giving credibility to Reagan ’s Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s .
Moscow was unable to dismiss it as empty bluster of the sort Khrushchev used to throw around about Soviet missiles , and thus risk losing the threat - effect of their nuclear attack systems .
Experts who pooh - poohed the project ’s feasibility , in the USSR and overseas , had a major credibility problem since many of them were , or were associated with , experts who also had decreed that Apollo was n’t going to work either .
Second , the earth - to - orbit transportation infrastructure had been deliberately overbuilt , but this was designed from the start to be a short - term surge .
With the post - success downturn of Apollo , critical capabilities such as heavy lift were no longer required : there were n’t any near - term payloads justifying the infrastructure maintenance .
The Saturn 5 production facilities were already shutting down by the time the first landing succeeded ( extra vehicles had been ordered in case attaining a successful landing took a lot more test flights ) .
Third , major components of the Apollo team — the experienced engineers , technicians , and managers — had by 1969 chosen to return to “ normal ” life .
Gathered from a hundred separate industries with engineering experience in a thousand projects , these men and women had consciously and intentionally chosen to put their personal lives on hold and devote 60 - plus - hour workweeks to the “ project of the century ” — for a limited period of time .
And that period was over .
Talented and dedicated people remained , but the breadth of experience that had made the Moon program feasible shrank markedly .
Fourth , in terms of the science harvest of the lunar missions , Apollo had reaped enough raw data to require decades of study to digest it , formulate new theories , and define the new questions that needed answers through on - site exploration .
The “ cover story ” that curiosity had been the driver for Apollo ( and would be for its successors ) lost validity when the next set of scientific questions would take an academic generation or two to crystallize .
The engineering challenges of much , much longer space flights far from Earth ( with no chance of resupply or rescue ) had been grossly underestimated .
Fifth , there were things we discovered about the hazards of spaceflight that demanded new assessments and the development of new capabilities .
For example , extending Apollo - class lunar operations was n’t merely a matter of carrying more batteries and more sandwiches .
The hardware had proven just barely capable of the minimum mission during limited thermal environments and on limited geographical subsets of the Moon .
Extending the range in time and space demanded an entirely new generation of space vehicles .
For example , the unexpectedly abrasive lunar dust just ate up the Apollo spacesuits , corroding their air seals and jamming their mechanical joints .
On the last missions , the suits showed signs of breakdown after only three days of use .
Sixth , the engineering challenges of much , much longer space flights far from Earth ( with no chance of resupply or rescue ) had been grossly underestimated .
Even today aboard the International Space Station less than 500 kilometers from home , proving out truly long - term reliable regenerative life support hardware is only now showing signs of success .
This Apollo - era shortcoming has become clear only in recent years .
More rigorous techniques of quantitative risk assessment ’ developed in response to Apollo ’s preliminary analytical procedures , showed in hindsight that Apollo had indeed been “ safe enough ” to fly : calculations indicated that crew survival chances were better than 98 % and mission success chances were in the 75 % range for the early missions .
But when applied to the then - popular Mars astronaut mission profiles , the same techniques generated horrifying results : mission success chances were less than 10 % , and crew survival chances were less than 50 % .
Clearly , a long period of getting a lot smarter would have been needed before serious human interplanetary missions could have been contemplated with 1970s - era technology .
Whether that process could have been done without repeated delays , or repeated disasters , is highly questionable .
Which came first ?
The ability or the desire ?
If NASA was n’t smart enough in the 1970 ’s to build a human interplanetary vehicle — while being intuitively aware enough to realize that they probably did n’t know how — then how do get that smart now , and recognize when we are that smart ?
When will human interplanetary flight become even marginally attainable , and how do we get there ?
Answering these questions may be central to evaluation by national leaders of the strategy options now being formulated by the Augustine team .
Rather than an originator and innovator , the national space program was then ( and may still be now ) more an end -user of existing technological capabilities .
A good get - well step is to stop misunderstanding the nature of the national technology capabilities base available for application to spaceflight .
NASA has long been touted as a generator of advanced technologies that later entered the national industrial repertory .
Most of these “ spinoffs ” are anecdotal , even mythical .
It looks truer that where NASA has benefited US industrial capabilities it has usually been as an accelerator or concatenator of existing technologies rather than as an originator .
In case after case , and even in patent after patent , NASA ’s Apollo team not the originators of radical new breakthrough capabilities .
More often they were — and properly so — the harvesters of existing experience and the application to enhanced versions of that know - how to a specific engineering challenge .
They learned from the experience of others , most often not merely by reading reports of these technologies but by bringing those experienced people directly into the development teams .
So the opposite of the conventional wisdom may be more accurate — and more useful to realize .
Rather than an originator and innovator , the national space program was then ( and may still be now ) more an end -user of existing technological capabilities .
It is a nurturer of promising ideas and prototypes , an exploiter and enhancer of the existing technology base .
And under wise leadership it is also a serious dabbler in innovation , identifying missing ingredients in the capabilities spectrum and taking risks to learn new tricks .
This is a useful , worthwhile function , but it ’s not the common view of “ rocket science ” .
Realizing this reality helps us understand when the repertoire of national technological , scientific , and medical capabilities approaches a point where focused investigation and acceleration can produce workable hardware for support of a credible strategy to venture beyond low Earth orbit for extended expeditions .
This is where a whole bag of new tricks , from NASA labs and think tanks , and from outside NASA ( the so - called “ spin-ins ” ) , from US society and from other nations , from military and scientific and commercial projects and others , will come in .
Cataloguing the contents of such a bag , and identifying remediable gaps in it , is a task yet to be properly done .
But that task must precede any decision - making on what new spaceflight challenges the US is may be realistically capable of attempting .
Mars will always be hard .
It only recently has become sufficiently less hard that we can , at last , just barely realistically dream of getting there .
And if the technology base is found to be available , even in incomplete form , the final question is how NASA , as an institution , will be able to acquire it , especially under foreseeable budget conditions when the actual non-NASA innovators can’t physically move into NASA offices .
NASA ’s track record in willingly adopting outside ideas is spotty , to be generous .
But the little - appreciated engineering development of genuinely long - lived life support hardware , now bedeviling engineers , operators , and astronauts aboard the International Space Station , is testimony that it can be done , that the unknowns and gaps can be made clear , and that this generation of the space team has what it takes to meet these challenges .
It ’s been important to relearn this , and for that ( and many other reasons ) , a lot of initial space - station - skeptics ( like me ) have become grateful to the ISS .
Mars will always be hard .
It only recently has become sufficiently less hard that we can , at last , just barely realistically dream of getting there .
Home
At the end of an international gathering that was jolted by a crack of lightning right in the middle , the French story finished with an apparently happy ending .
Raymond Domenech and Thierry Henry , the coach and captain whose spectacular fallout has been the talk of the town , fell into each other 's arms at the end of France 's spirited draw in Serbia .
It was an embrace that reeked of Hollywood schmaltz .
A cynic might point to the fact that Domenech has always been fond of amateur dramatics and wince .
A romantic might just believe that out of the storm has emerged new sweetness and light .
The truth is somewhere in between .
There is some happiness over the horizon in that France performed so creditably , with massive heart , despite playing with 10 men for most of the game in an intimidating environment .
Even though they only drew 1 - 1 in Belgrade and look odds - on to finish in a play - off position , out of the depths they pulled out their best performance since the 2006 World Cup .
The travelling fans who twirled Irresistibles Français scarves were not too far off the mark .
France were much better than the result .
The front line was excellent , with Nicolas Anelka particularly powerful .
But is Domenech back in favour ?
Does anybody really believe that the kiss - and - make - up scene was for real ?
Is there sufficient trust in the coach whose decision making and public relations are persistently weird enough to make you wonder if he actually likes being unpopular ?
The answer to that is a resounding no .
All the credit has gone to the team .
The response in the French media to this week 's shenanigans was to effectively congratulate Henry for saying what they all thought .
Although the France skipper came out publicly to play down reports he had annihilated Domenech by telling him in front of the entire squad that his methods were boring and disorganised , there appears to have been a successful coup .
Henry is running the show and Domenech remains in situ as a figurehead , not much more than a puppet leader .
This is history repeating itself .
The record books tell you that France under Domenech reached the 2006 World Cup final and were a Zinedine Zidane implosion and a penalty shoot - out away from winning the trophy for the second time in a decade .
But the sub - plot reveals how half - way through the campaign Zidane seized power from Domenech and called the shots to inspire a team who started badly but evolved into a formidable force .
It feels like a miracle that Domenech is still in the job at all .
He is a man who specialises not just in personality clashes , but personality car crashes .
The cast of important players he has , at one stage or another , declined to favour is extraordinary : Karim Benzema , Robert Pires , Ludovic Giuly , Patrick Vieira , Philippe Mexès , Grégory Coupet , Florent Malouda .
Domenech is a strange cat , but he does seem to have the knack of escaping trouble with his lives intact .
This is partly due to the remarkable loyalty of the French Football Federation .
It takes something truly cataclysmic for them to actually go through the process of sacking a manager .
Gérard Houllier and Michel Platini resigned because of an elimination .
Roger Lemerre was offered the chance to leave via a resignation to save some face .
Jacques Santini was contracted to join Tottenham before his tournament hit the wall against Greece .
Aimé Jacquet , the guide of the 1998 World Cup winners , had already decided to step down before the finals and would not change his mind .
Talking of the 1998 World Cup winners , the head honcho of Bordeaux came out this week and stated he would not stand in the way of Laurent Blanc if the national team required the urgent services of the man fondly known as " Président " during his outstanding career .
If that appeared to pile even more pressure on Domenech , his players rescued him in Serbia .
He said he was proud and he was right to be so .
It is almost impossible to imagine Domenech will be ousted before World Cup qualification is concluded .
And if France make it – and they look like being the strongest team of the likely play - off contenders – the Federation will not change things before South Africa even though that is the dream scenario for fans .
The mood is frustratingly mixed : they distrust Domenech , but love the team .
It remains a subject for hot discussion in France .
Despite having the attacking prowess of Henry , Anelka , Franck Ribéry and Yoann Gourcuff at their disposal , Les Bleus are not scoring enough goals .
Of the top two teams in the nine European qualifying groups , only Sweden and Norway – with nine goals – have scored fewer than France 's 10 .
So , it is over to Henry to see what can be done .
" The team has soul , " he said after scoring his 50th international goal in Belgrade .
" We had a group of warriors . "
It is also a group with a new leader .
So let 's see if he can take his country into another World Cup .
Riding Shotgun With a Bowhunter : An Anti-hunting Odyssey .
" Today 's wildlife management philosophy is based on propagating game animal populations for the sole purpose of increasing hunter recreation .
Prescribed burning or clearcutting of forests to promote more game animals necessarily results in the ... deterioration of biological diversity . "
Luke A. Dommer ; late President and founder of the Committee to Abolish Sport Hunting .
" Sport hunting is an evil that has no redeeming virtues .
Regrettably , most people ( including many members of environmental organizations ) consider public hunting to be a minor ecological issue , or no issue at all .
But modern sport hunting , and the system that helps to perpetuate it , is a significant factor , and in some areas the primary factor , that has destroyed the balance of nature . "
Ron Baker ; naturalist and author of The American Hunting Myth .
" If I had my crossbow right now I could drop that deer faster than a heartbeat " , blustered Johnny the tow truck - driver when spotting a deer grazing peacefully along the roadside .
The hunter was in the process of hauling me and my broken - down Ford the 90 miles from a psychotically congested DC Inner Loop back to my refuge in the foothills of Blue Ridge .
I was , in a very real sense , being held captive ( at least as a helpless audience ) by a self proclaimed " Deer Slayer " .
This is a title reserved only for the most evangelical type bowhunter , a zealous trophy hunter of the worst kind .
I prefer to call them Bowbarians .
Here was this macho , burly hunter guy attempting to pump his image by boasting to me about his many hunting skills , and kills .
Unfortunately for me , and especially for all the fallen animal victims of killers like him , I did n't , and felt I could n't , respond in an appropriately challenging manner .
You see , I am a dedicated anti-hunting activist , a vehement opponent of all forms of hunting and the institutionalized management ( read manipulation ) of wildlife for that purpose .
I have made it my personal business , my mission , for twenty years now to bring the whole bloody hunting affair to an abrupt end .
I also served as Vice President of the infamous national organization , the Committee to Abolish Sport Hunting ( CASH ) , and I am ally to many local , national , and international animal rights and environmental protection groups .
So I knew from over two decades of intense activism , featuring many an explosive encounter with a zealous trophy hunter , like my Bowbarian driver for instance , that by revealing my " anti " position early it would have pitched me into a highly vulnerable position with Johnny .
" You 've certainly been a busy hunter have n't you " ? , I said , tight - lipped and growing increasingly pissed off .
What this brazen man behind the wheel did not know , however , and what I decided he was n't going to know , at least until he had towed me the entire distance home , was he was actively transporting his enemy .
For those who may still be reading and may be interested in learning more about this controversial issue , perhaps because you never ever get to see any coverage about organized opposition to hunting in America , I suggest searching CASH 's website , and the many other anti-hunting sites , to gain information , history , and valuable perspective on the American anti-hunting movement .
Back to my odyssey .
I should expand on what anti-hunters like myself are after .
We demand top - down reform of all government wildlife mismanagement agencies of the nation .
They 're all bureaucracies corrupted by powerful organized hunters that brazenly exploit wildlife ( " game " ) and our natural environment for the interests and benefits of the hunting establishment .
We want nothing less than an immediate ban of all hunting ( and trapping which is equally as unnecessary and evil ) on all public lands , millions of acres of state and national parks , military lands , and especially our National Wildlife Refuge System , which has been systematically pried open on over 300 of these supposedly inviolate sanctuaries to sport and trophy hunters and trappers .
For some people , Johnny 's type of morbid boasting would n't present a problem .
For reasons only a psychologically trained person should posit - I think primarily it 's callous insensitivity to animal suffering and cruelty - these folks possess no particular feelings or opinions on the topic of sport hunting .
The systemic manipulation and exploitation of wildlife for the sole purpose of killing for sport and trophies , IE. , " game " management and hunting , is of no particular concern to them .
The largely ignored fact here is that there are far too many of these indifferent individuals , yes even your family , friends , and neighbors , who are living amongst us during the most critically threatening period in the history of life of Earth .
Ours is an omnicidal and dystopic epoch , an era marked by gross human overpopulation , suffering , and starvation , environmental destruction , ecosystem collapse , mass extinction of species , escalations of violence and killing , sectarian and religious fanaticism , maniacal militarism ( the Bush , now Obama years ) , multiple wars , and predicaments ad infinitum .
Yet , in the face of all these critical ills , and in spite of them , they manage to carry on their lives apparently without thought , concern , or attention to our plight .
I 've come to suspect they must be brain dead , and perhaps dead in the heart and spirit .
Maybe they 're just plain ignorant and stupid .
But thoughtlessly condoning the abuse and killing of hundreds of millions of sentient wild animals , every year , killing only for recreational kicks and male validation , well , I marvel at their sheer inhumanity .
For the record , I want to make an important admission .
It really must be important because when I publicly challenge any hunter , or the hunting hierarchy at large , somebody always brings it up Bambi the Disney deer .
Yes , I love do Bambi .
Yes , I am a sentimental person and a Bambi lover .
Personally , I would have written the classic Disney script differently .
You remember that great stag , Bambi 's genetically superior Buck father , who was shot by the anonymous hunter ?
In my script he would have been spared death by the intervention of a radical hunt saboteur ( the hero ! ) , who only a millisecond before the murdering hunter pulled his trigger , blew his airhorn and frightened Bambi 's father off to safety .
Surely a happier ending for all .

The coffin was carried by boat and through the streets Venetians have been taking part in a mock funeral procession to highlight the city 's dwindling population .
Organisers of Saturday 's event say the population has dipped below 60,000 , with many native Venetians choosing to live in more affordable areas .
Scientists are using the event to take DNA samples from Venetians to discover more about their origins .
City officials have refuted the claims that Venice is simply a " ghost town " , filled only with tourists .
Residents carried an empty coffin in a procession of boats to the mayor 's office .
The city 's population has dropped by two - thirds since the 1950s and much of the blame has been put on tourism .
Premature
It has driven up food and property prices , forcing many people to move to the mainland .
Organiser Matteo Secchi told the BBC that Venice had changed for the worse .
" We promised two years ago when we got less than 60,000 inhabitants we would plan a funeral [ for ] the city because we think the city with less than 60,000 inhabitants is not a city any more , it 's more a village , " he said .
But officials say reports of the city 's death are " premature " .
DNA swabs will help scientists find out where Venetians originate from The Venetian architect and historian , Francisco da Mosta , told the BBC that the government needed to step in to make the city habitable for its residents .
He said Venice is not being run " with intelligence or dignity " .
Although the population of Venice 's historic centre - including the piazzas and alleyways near the Grand Canal - dropped to 59,992 recently , on Thursday officials said it stood at 60,025 .
Before the procession , official Mara Rumiz , who is in charge of the city 's demographics , said the numbers ignored the 120,000 who lived on Venice 's islands , such as Murano and Lido Beach , AP news agency reported .
Referring to the procession , she said : " They will have the funeral in a living village , not yet dead .
And it wo n't die , even if it goes to 59,999 . "
She said Venice did need to do more to encourage people to live there and prevent it from solely turning into a tourist destination .
Meanwhile , scientists from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts hope to take up to 5,000 DNA swabs to find out where the families of Venetian residents originally came from .

Scheme - Brained Hare
Simply Scheme : Introducing Computer Science ch 1 : Showing Off Scheme
Simply Scheme :
Introducing Computer Science
Chapter 1
Showing Off Scheme
We are going to use the programming language Scheme to teach you some big ideas in computer science .
The ideas are mostly about control of complexity — that is , about how to develop a large computer program without being swamped in details .
For example , once you 've solved part of the large problem , you can give that partial solution a name and then you can use the named subprogram as if it were an indivisible operation , just like the ones that are built into the computer .
Thereafter , you can forget about the details of that subprogram .
This is the beginning of the idea of abstraction , which we 'll discuss in more depth throughout the book .
The big ideas are what this book is about , but first we 're going to introduce you to Scheme .
( Scheme is a dialect of Lisp , a family of computer programming languages invented for computing with words , sentences , and ideas instead of just numbers . )
Talking to Scheme
The incantations to get Scheme running will be different for each model of computer .
Appendix A talks about these details ; you can look up the particular version of Scheme that you 're using .
That appendix will also tell you how to load the file simply.scm , which you need to make the examples in this book work .
When Scheme has started up and is ready for you to interact with it , you 'll see a message on the screen , something like this :
Welcome to XYZ Brand Scheme . >
The > is a prompt , Scheme 's way of telling you that it 's ready for you to type something .
Scheme is an interactive programming language .
In other words , you type a request to Scheme , then Scheme prints the answer , and then you get another prompt .
Try it out :
> 6 6
We just asked Scheme , " What is 6 ? " and Scheme told us that 6 is 6 .
Most of the time we ask harder questions :
> (+ 4 7 ) 11 > (- 23 5 ) 18 > (+ 5 6 7 8 ) 26
Whenever something you type to Scheme is enclosed in parentheses , it indicates a request to carry out a procedure .
( We 'll define " procedure " more formally later , but for now it means something that Scheme knows how to do .
A procedure tells Scheme how to compute a particular function . )
The first thing inside the parentheses indicates what procedure to use ; the others are arguments , i.e. , values that are used as data by the procedure .
Scheme has non-numeric procedures , too :
> ( word ' comp ' uter ) COMPUTER
( If this last example gives an error message saying that Scheme does n't understand the name word , it means that you did n't load the file simply.scm .
Consult Appendix A. )
In these first examples , we 've shown what you type in boldface and what the computer responds in lightface .
Hereafter , we will rely on the prompt characters to help you figure out who 's talking on which line .
For the most part , Scheme does n't care about whether you type in UPPER CASE or lower case .
For the examples in this book , we 'll assume that you always type in lower case and that the computer prints in upper case .
Your Scheme might print in lower case ; it does n't matter .
Recovering from Typing Errors
Do n't worry if you make a mistake typing these examples in ; you can just try again .
One of the great things about interactive programming languages is that you can experiment in them .
The parentheses and single quote marks are important ; do n't leave them out .
If Scheme seems to be ignoring you , try typing a bunch of right parentheses , ) ) ) ) ) ) , and hitting the return or enter key .
( That 's because Scheme does n't do anything until you 've closed all the parentheses you 've opened , so if you have an extra left parenthesis , you can keep typing forever with no response . )
Another problem you might encounter is seeing a long message that you do n't understand and then finding yourself with something other than a Scheme prompt .
This happens when Scheme considers what you typed as an error .
Here 's an example ; for now , never mind exactly why this is an error .
We just want to talk about the result :
> (+ 2 a ) Unbound variable a ; Package : ( user ) 2 Error ->
The exact form of the message you get will depend on the version of Scheme that you 're using .
For now , the important point is that some versions deal with errors by leaving you talking to a debugger instead of to Scheme itself .
The debugger may have a completely different language .
It 's meant to help you figure out what 's wrong in a large program you 've written .
For a beginner , though , it 's more likely to get in the way .
Read the documentation for your particular Scheme dialect to learn how to escape from the debugger .
( In some versions you do n't get trapped in a debugger when you make an error , so this problem may not arise . )
Exiting Scheme
Although there 's no official standard way to exit Scheme , most versions use the notation
for this purpose .
If you type in some of the examples that follow and then exit from Scheme , what you type wo n't be remembered the next time you use Scheme .
( Appendix A talks about how to use a text editor along with Scheme to make a permanent record of your work . )
More Examples
We 're about to show you a few examples of ( we hope ) interesting programs in Scheme .
Play with them !
Type them into your computer and try invoking them with different data .
Again , do n't worry too much if something does n't work — it probably just means that you left out a parenthesis , or some such thing .
While you 're going through these examples , see how much you can figure out for yourself about how they work .
In particular , try guessing what the names of procedures , such as first and keep , mean .
Some of them will probably be obvious , some of them harder .
The point is n't to see how smart you are , but to get you thinking about the kinds of things you want to be able to do in a computer program .
Later on we 'll go through these examples in excruciating detail and tell you the official meanings of all the pieces .
Besides learning the vocabulary of Scheme , another point of this activity is to give you a feeling for the ways in which we put these names together in a program .
Every programming language has its own flavor .
For example , if you 've programmed before in other languages , you may be surprised not to find anything that says print in these examples .
On the other hand , some of these examples are programs that we wo n't expect you to understand fully until most of the way through this book .
So do n't worry if something does n't make sense ; just try to get some of the flavor of Scheme programming .
Example : Acronyms
Here 's our first new program .
So far we have just been using procedures built into Scheme : + , - , and word .
When you first start up Scheme , it knows 100 - 200 procedures .
These are called primitive procedures .
Programming in Scheme means defining new procedures , called compound procedures .
Right now we 're going to invent one that finds the acronym for a title :
( define ( acronym phrase ) ( accumulate word ( every first phrase ) ) ) > ( acronym '( american civil liberties union ) ) ACLU > ( acronym '( reduced instruction set computer ) ) RISC > ( acronym '( quod erat demonstrandum ) ) QED
Did you have trouble figuring out what all the pieces do in the acronym procedure ?
Try these examples :
> ( first ' american ) A > ( every first '( american civil liberties union ) ) ( A C L U ) > ( accumulate word ' ( a c l u ) ) ACLU
Notice that this simple acronym program does n't always do exactly what you might expect :
> ( acronym '( united states of america ) ) USOA
We can rewrite the program to leave out certain words :
( define ( acronym phrase ) ( accumulate word ( every first ( keep real - word ? phrase ) ) ) ) ( define ( real - word ? wd ) ( not ( member ? wd ' ( a the an in of and for to with ) ) ) ) > ( acronym '( united states of america ) ) USA > ( acronym '( structure and interpretation of computer programs ) )
SICP > ( acronym '( association for computing machinery ) ) ACM > ( real - word ? ' structure ) # T > ( real - word ? ' of ) # F [ 1 ] > ( keep real - word ? '( united network command for law and enforcement ) ) ( UNITED NETWORK COMMAND LAW ENFORCEMENT )
Example : Pig Latin
Our next example translates a word into Pig Latin . [ 2 ]
( define ( pigl wd ) ( if ( member ? ( first wd ) ' aeiou ) ( word wd 'ay ) ( pigl ( word ( butfirst wd ) ( first wd ) ) ) ) ) > ( pigl ' spaghetti ) AGHETTISPAY > ( pigl ' ok ) OKAY
pigl
pigl
The procedure follows one of two possible paths , depending on whether the first letter of the given word is a vowel .
If so , pigl just adds the letters ay at the end :
> ( pigl ' elephant ) ELEPHANTAY
The following examples might make it a little more clear how the starting - consonant case works :
> ( first ' spaghetti ) S > ( butfirst ' spaghetti ) PAGHETTI > ( word ' paghetti 's ) PAGHETTIS > ( define ( rotate wd ) ( word ( butfirst wd ) ( first wd ) ) ) > ( rotate ' spaghetti ) PAGHETTIS > ( rotate ' paghettis ) AGHETTISP > ( pigl ' aghettisp ) AGHETTISPAY
You 've seen every before , in the acronym example , but we have n't told you what it does .
Try to guess what Scheme will respond when you type this :
( every pigl '( the ballad of john and yoko ) )
Example : Ice Cream Choices
Here 's a somewhat more complicated program , but still pretty short considering what it accomplishes :
( define ( choices menu ) ( if ( null ? menu ) '( ( ) ) ( let ( ( smaller ( choices ( cdr menu ) ) ) ) ( reduce append ( map ( lambda ( item ) ( prepend - every item smaller ) ) ( car menu ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( prepend - every item lst ) ( map ( lambda ( choice ) ( se item choice ) ) lst ) ) > ( choices '( ( small medium large ) ( vanilla ( ultra chocolate ) ( rum raisin ) ginger ) ( cone cup ) ) ) ( ( SMALL VANILLA CONE ) ( SMALL VANILLA CUP ) ( SMALL ULTRA CHOCOLATE CONE ) ( SMALL ULTRA CHOCOLATE CUP ) ( SMALL RUM RAISIN CONE ) ( SMALL RUM RAISIN CUP ) ( SMALL GINGER CONE ) ( SMALL GINGER CUP ) ( MEDIUM VANILLA CONE ) ( MEDIUM VANILLA CUP ) ( MEDIUM ULTRA CHOCOLATE CONE ) ( MEDIUM ULTRA CHOCOLATE CUP ) ( MEDIUM RUM RAISIN CONE ) ( MEDIUM RUM RAISIN CUP ) ( MEDIUM GINGER CONE ) ( MEDIUM GINGER CUP ) ( LARGE VANILLA CONE ) ( LARGE VANILLA CUP ) ( LARGE ULTRA CHOCOLATE CONE ) ( LARGE ULTRA CHOCOLATE CUP ) ( LARGE RUM RAISIN CONE ) ( LARGE RUM RAISIN CUP ) ( LARGE GINGER CONE ) ( LARGE GINGER CUP ) )
Notice that in writing the program we did n't have to say how many menu categories there are , or how many choices in each category .
This one program will work with any menu — try it out yourself .
Example : Combinations from a Set
Here 's a more mathematical example .
We want to know all the possible combinations of , let 's say , three things from a list of five possibilities .
For example , we want to know all the teams of three people that can be chosen from a group of five people .
" Dozy , Beaky , and Tich " counts as the same team as " Beaky , Tich , and Dozy " ; the order within a team does n't matter .
Although this will be a pretty short program , it 's more complicated than it looks .
We do n't expect you to be able to figure out the algorithm yet . [ 3 ]
Instead , we just want you to marvel at Scheme 's ability to express difficult techniques succinctly .
( define ( combinations size set ) ( cond ( ( = size 0 ) '( ( ) ) ) ( ( empty ? set ) '( ) ) ( else ( append ( prepend - every ( first set ) ( combinations (- size 1 ) ( butfirst set ) ) ) ( combinations size ( butfirst set ) ) ) ) ) ) > ( combinations 3 '( a b c d e ) ) ( ( A B C ) ( A B D ) ( A B E ) ( A C D ) ( A C E ) ( A D E ) ( B C D ) ( B C E ) ( B D E ) ( C D E ) ) > ( combinations 2 '( john paul george ringo ) ) ( ( JOHN PAUL ) ( JOHN GEORGE ) ( JOHN RINGO ) ( PAUL GEORGE ) ( PAUL RINGO ) ( GEORGE RINGO ) )
( If you 're trying to figure out the algorithm despite our warning , here 's a hint :
All the combinations of three letters shown above can be divided into two groups .
The first group consists of the ones that start with the letter A and contain two more letters ; the second group has three letters not including A .
The procedure finds these two groups separately and combines them into one .
If you want to try to understand all the pieces , try playing with them separately , as we encouraged you to do with the pigl and acronym procedures . )
If you 've taken a probability course , you know that there is a formula for the number of possible combinations .
The most traditional use of computers is to work through such formulas and compute numbers .
However , not all problems are numeric .
Lisp , the programming language family of which Scheme is a member , is unusual in its emphasis on symbolic computing .
In this example , listing the actual combinations instead of just counting them is part of the flavor of symbolic computing , along with our earlier examples about manipulating words and phrases .
We 'll try to avoid numeric problems when possible , because symbolic computing is more fun for most people .
Example : Factorial
Scheme can handle numbers , too .
The factorial of n ( usually written in mathematical notation as n! ) is the product of all the numbers from 1 to n :
( define ( factorial n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) > ( factorial 4 ) 24 > ( factorial 1000 ) 4023872600770937735437024339230039857193748642107146325437999104299385 1239862902059204420848696940480047998861019719605863166687299480855890 1323829669944590997424504087073759918823627727188732519779505950995276 1208749754624970436014182780946464962910563938874378864873371191810458 2578364784997701247663288983595573543251318532395846307555740911426241 7474349347553428646576611667797396668820291207379143853719588249808126 8678383745597317461360853795345242215865932019280908782973084313928444 0328123155861103697680135730421616874760967587134831202547858932076716

If this does n't work because your computer is too small , try a more reasonably sized example , such as the factorial of 200 .
Play with the Procedures
This chapter has introduced a lot of new ideas at once , leaving out all the details .
Our hope has been to convey the flavor of Scheme programming , before we get into Chapter 2 , which is full of those missing details .
But you can't absorb the flavor just by reading ; take some time out to play with these examples before you go on .
Exercises
1.1 Do 20 push -ups .
1.2 Calculate 1000 factorial by hand and see if the computer got the right answer .
1.3 Create a file called acronym.scm containing our acronym program , using the text editor provided for use with your version of Scheme .
Load the file into Scheme and run the program .
Produce a transcript file called acronym.log , showing your interaction with Scheme as you test the program several times , and print it .

[ 2 ] Pig Latin is a not -very - secret secret language that many little kids learn .
Each word is translated by moving all the initial consonants to the end of the word , and adding " ay " at the end .
It 's usually spoken rather than written , but that 's a little harder to do on a computer .
[ 3 ]
What 's an algorithm ?
It 's a method for solving a problem .
The usual analogy is to a recipe in cooking , although you 'll see throughout this book that we want to get away from the aspect of that analogy that emphasizes the sequential nature of a recipe — first do this , then do that , etc .
There can be more than one algorithm to solve the same problem .

The US Supreme Court Monday vacated a federal appeals court ruling requiring disclosure of a cache of photos allegedly depicting abuse of US - held detainees overseas during the Bush administration .
The high court action removed a legal precedent that made it harder for the government to withhold certain documents from the public .
The Obama administration had asked the court to take that action .
Citing a new law that allows the secretary of defense to exempt the photos from disclosure , the Supreme Court remanded the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) case back to the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
The justices instructed the appeals court to reconsider the case in light of the new law and recent actions by the Defense Secretary that have apparently rendered the photo disclosure case moot .
The action is a setback for lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) who had filed the FOIA lawsuit seeking to force the government to disclose the images to the American public .
Alleged detainee abuse
At issue in the case was a group of 44 photographs taken by military officials investigating allegations of detainee abuse at seven locations in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In addition , the government had identified a " substantial number " of similar photos that would likely also be subject to public disclosure under the appeals court ruling .
President Obama initially did not object to the public release of the photos .
But his administration subsequently reversed course and argued in court that public release of the photos would inflame anti-American sentiments and endanger US military personnel , diplomats , and citizens around the world .
Government lawyers claimed the photos were exempt from FOIA release under a provision protecting law - enforcement documents that might threaten the life or safety of someone .
Lawyers with the ACLU argued that there was no legitimate reason not to release the photos .
The pictures were reportedly part of files assembled by military investigators looking into allegations of detainee abuses .
The Second Circuit agreed with the ACLU and ordered the government to release the photos .
After losing at the Second Circuit , the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to take up the issue and overturn the appeals court decision .
At the same time , Congress effectively ended the battle by passing a measure on Oct. 28 empowering the secretary of defense to bypass any FOIA - required release if he certified that public disclosure of the photos would endanger citizens of the US , members of the US armed forces , or government officials overseas .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates made a formal declaration on Nov. 13 that the disputed photos were exempt from mandatory disclosure under FOIA .
Recognizing that action , the Supreme Court on Monday vacated the Second Circuit 's decision requiring release of the photos and sent the case back to the appeals court .
An important precedent gone
The action effectively wipes away the legal precedent created by the earlier Second Circuit ruling .
US Solicitor General Elena Kagan had urged the justices to summarily vacate the appeals court 's decision , and then remand the case back to the lower courts for further action in light of the new law .
Jameel Jaffer , a lawyer with the ACLU , had asked the court in his own brief to simply dismiss the government 's appeal and leave undisturbed the " unanimous and well - reasoned decision of the appeals court . "
Mr. Jaffer said the new statute was unrelated to the legal basis of the Second Circuit 's decision in the earlier FOIA case .
In its decision , the Second Circuit had rejected a broad reading of the FOIA exemption allowing the government to keep secret documents that might endanger someone .
The appeals court said the government must be able to show that disclosure would endanger a particular person not just any undefined person .
The Second Circuit decision created an important legal precedent , making it more difficult for the government to keep certain documents secret under FOIA .
In contrast , the Oct. 28 law was specifically written to prevent release of detainee photos .
It does not undercut the potential court - ordered release of other documents in instances where the government was claiming broad law enforcement authority to keep the information secret .
Nonetheless , the Supreme Court 's order vacating the Second Circuit decision eliminates the possibility of the precedent being cited in future cases .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor , who recently joined the high court from the Second Circuit , took no part in the case .

The Reversal of Reality : Publicizing H1N1 Vaccine Facts as Myths and Myths as Facts
How deflating it must be , for conventional medicine and public health officials to feel the noose tightening around their unscientific balloon of unfounded vaccine principles .
Dovetailing media reports which attempt to counter H1N1 vaccine opposition are exploding across the mainstream media in a frantic effort to stabilize criticism .
In the past few months , it has been difficult to come across any H1N1 vaccine " facts list " or FAQs that does not attempt to dispel supposed myths and conspiracy theories about the vaccine .
Ironically , the majority of myths and theories they attempt to dispel are usually facts and scientific truths which public health officials refuse to acknowledge .
In addition , they ensure that their version of " facts " are filled with blatant lies and disinformation .
For example , after a quick review of flu.gov myths , we find they do n't waste any time in stating facts as myths and vice - versa .
" It is safe for children and pregnant women to receive a flu vaccine that contains thimerosal , " they claim .
Thimerosal has damaging effects on cells of the nervous and immune systems .
The flu.gov website also states that " there is no convincing evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines , except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site . "
Micromolar and even nanomolar concentrations have been found to cause significant damage .
Is a nanomolar dose low enough for flu.gov ?
Perhaps all 76 of these studies which document the adverse effects of thimerosal would also be myths according to government officials .
Notice flu.gov provides no links to any scientific evidence to justify their claims .
In a interview below on " The Doctors " show , Assistant Surgeon General , Anne Schuchat 's fails to properly address the reality of H1N1 vaccinations and instead focuses on supposed " myths " .
Other media outlets such as the Toronto Star are trying to parrot the same articles over and over again .
A recent post on " Vaccine Phobias " was spotted one day after the other on Oct 30th and Oct 31st , both by the same reporter , Lynda Hurst .
The article even attempts to discredit one blogger " whose normal subject matter is UFOs " she stated .
Other facts they attempt to smear are the evidence that establishes that toxicity of mercury , formaldehyde and aluminum , and dismissing the reality of vaccines being responsible for an abundance of diseases such as asthma , autism , allergies and auto - immune disorders .
The head of Canada 's Public Health Agency also had the audacity to state in the article that " people make up facts " and " I guess what frustrates me is the amount of mythology out there , " in another article about vaccine myths .
Medconnect recently posted an article titled Health Professionals Not Immune to Influenza Vaccine Myths , quoting a survey that suggests " Health care workers in the United States harbor significant fears and misconceptions about influenza vaccination . " which again twists facts as myths to misrepresent the truth .
The New York Times is doing its part to join the myth debunking bandwagon by actually promoting lesson plans with actual handouts which allow the student to distort nine of the most common facts based on the instructions they receive .
The Auzzie portal theage.com.au posted a flurry of myths in an article titled " Swine flu vaccine myths ' busted ' by experts " .
Among other reversals of fact and myth , the irresponsible report states that Guillian - Barre Syndrome " was a one - off " .
This directly contradicts dozens of reputable experts such as Dr. Russell Blaylock who has indicated that the neurotoxins and immunotoxins in the H1N1 vaccine will create thousands of new cases of Guillian - Barre Syndrome .
Dr. Russell Blaylock discusses the real myths on his website russellblaylockmd.com in a section which entails " Swine Flu Data " where he provides scientific references and evidence to support his claims .
Dr. Leonard Horowitz has recently released a report which outlines how Obama 's recent national emergency declaration is advancing media hype , deadly vaccinations and depopulations agendas .
In addition he released a youtube video which outlines the key components of the report and details why government establishments are creating artificial scarcity myths via " shortage marketing " techniques to promote their agenda .
There are literally hundreds of mainline reports on a weekly basis which are reversing the reality of facts and myths on the pandemic .
So called H1N1 vaccine experts and advocates are losing their credibility at lightning speed and they know it .
They must resort to such tactics to maintain their weakening grip on the strengthening minds of the public who are awakening to the reality of vaccines .
They are being defeated by real science and information that only exposes one thing .... the truth !
* A full list of h1n1 vaccine ingredients , alerts and warnings .
The self - taught photographer added : " I take them on holiday , I take them everywhere .
I could be anywhere and see stuff around me and the inspiration just comes naturally .
I am like a child !
It is really spontaneous and natural and based on humour "

The suspected gunman in the Fort Hood shooting has been identified as Major Malik Nadal Hasan .
He was killed and two other suspects have been apprehended , according to Army Spokesman Lt. General Robert W. Cone .
Do n't miss : Tweets from Fort Hood >
A defense official speaking on condition of anonymity to the AP says Hasan was a mental health professional — an Army psychologist or psychiatrist .
He recently trained at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C.
There are unconfirmed reports that Major Hasan was a convert to Islam and originally from Virginia .
He was reportedly scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan and was unhappy about it .
It goes without saying that the fact that the shooter was a Muslim will turn this into a gigantic story .
Picture via Twitter user Misstearah , a member of the army , who Tweeted : " The poor guy that got shot in the balls .
Gen Cone is reporting right now .
I 've been standing next to h... "
In the spirit of Halloween , we at Gunaxin decided to give you a list of the Ten Best Ghosts of all time .
This top ten list is so good , there are eleven ghosts ( or maybe we learned to count at a Big 10 school ) .
So we ’ll get right to it ….
11 . Blinky –
The red ghost that pursues Pac - Man , he gets the nod over Inky , Pinky , and Clyde because he speeds up after a certain number of dots are eaten .
There ’s no escaping the accelerated super Blinky , which is sometimes dubbed Cruise Elroy .
Plus , who here does n’t have Pac - Man fever from time to time ?
10 . McBoo – Alright , maybe this stretches the definition of ghost , but who did n’t get one of these things from McDonald ’s as a kid ?
The question is , did you ever use it ?
I mean you ca n’t fit that much candy into these things .
And they ’re kind of bulky .
Still , for nostalgia purposes , I ’ll give a spot on my list to McBoo and his plastic container body .
9 . King of the Dead – The cursed leader of the Dead Men at Dunharrow , he controls the Army of the Dead from the Lord of the Rings trilogy .
Basically an unstoppable and invulnerable force ( since they ’re already dead ) , the man has a lot of power at his fingertips .
And they even made an action figure of him that glows in the dark .
So that ’s enough to crack my top 10 .
8. Casper – Yes , the friendly Ghost .
I always thought he was a bit lame as a kid , but he managed to star in a cartoon series and an eventual live action movie .
And you probably know his name .
So that all counts for something , right ?
And unlike many ghosts , he is quite personable .
So that makes him a bit unique .
But if you want to make him a little creepier , he appears to be a dead boy and his origins are always a bit hazy .
So create your own back story for Casper and run with .
A bit of trivia , according to the 1995 Casper film , his full name is Casper McFadden .
7. Nearly Headless Nick – Officially Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington , but often referred to as Nearly Headless Nick .
He hails from the Harry Potter series as the Gryffindor house ghost .
In life Nick was sentenced to death by beheading , but the executioner only managed to partially decapitate him after 45 hacks .
He makes this list off the goodwill of Harry Potter , his partially severed head , because he took 45 chops to the head , and because he is played by Monty Python alum John Cleese in the films .
Monty Python mixed with severed heads and Harry Potter ?
That ’s gold Jerry !
6. Yoda – Everyone loves the backwards talking Jedi Master from the Star Wars franchise .
So you can love him again in ghost form .
One of the few Star Wars characters that appear on screen in ghost form , he also gets bonus points for being from a “ mysterious species . ”
And yes , his battle from Attack of the Clones is one of the highlights of that movie .
Bad ass ghost , this guy is .
Hmmmmmm .
5. King Boo – The Boo sport beady eyes , long tongues , vampiric teeth , and nubs for arms .
Unless you ’ve never played a video game before , you ’ll recognize them from the Super Mario World .
First appearing in Super Mario Brothers 3 , one might argue they helped launch the use of ghosts in video games .
The Boo use the Ostrich technique of fighting , being what you ca n’t see ca n’t hurt you .
If you looked at them , they cover their faces with their arms , cower , and become translucent .
But if you look away , these guys would try and sneak up on you , ninja - style .
King
Boo is simply larger than the average Boo and dons a crown .
He first appeared as the final boss in Luigi ’s Mansion .
4. Lloyd , the Bartender from the Shining – Hopefully , you ’ve seen ( or read ) the Shining .
Starring Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance , it features an aspiring writer who takes a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the winter months .
The hotel becomes isolated during the winter due to ice and snow .
Alone with his family , Nicholson ’s character slowly goes insane aided by various ghosts , including Lloyd , played by Joe Turkel .
Turkel helps convince Jack to try and kill his family .
Due to his calm , yet effective style , Lloyd garners a spot on this Top 10 list .
Redrum !
3. Boo Berry –
He ’s less successful than his friends Count Chocula and Franken Berry .
However , he ’s more successful than Yummy Mummy or Fruit Brute ( did you even know these existed ? ) .
So he ’s doing all right .
Not always easy to find except for the Halloween season , Boo Berry is one of General Mills ’ monster themed cereals .
Sporting a red bow tie and a red and yellow hat , Boo Berry hocks his blueberry flavored marshmallows and corn cereal bits on people of all ages .
And as a bonus , his voice was made to sound like Peter Lorre .
That ’s a nice touch .
2. Slimer – He ’s in Ghostbusters I and II .
That ’s cool .
He was in the cartoon spinoff .
That ’s pretty cool .
And he even got his own flavor of Hi-C , Ecto Cooler .
I loved that neon green Ecto Cooler drink as a kid , so here ’s to Slimer ’s spot at number 2 .
Fun Fact : a green blob , with two skinny arms , no feet , and several chins , he was never called by any name during the films .
In fact the creature ’s original moniker was simply The Onionhead Ghost .
Slimer has a better ring to it .
1. Space Ghost –
So why ’s he number one ?
A 1960s cartoon series that saw a brief revival in the 1980s , Space Ghost , or Tad Eustice Ghostal , re-invented himself as a talk show host in the 1990s in Space Ghost Coast 2 Coast .
To top if off , he invited his former arch enemies Zorak and Moltar to work on the show with him .
Spanning five decades , he ’s provided entertainment both from a comedy and action standpoint .
And if you ask nicely , he ’ll probably zap you ( but not in a gay way ) .

The list of candidates to win the 2009 Ballon d'Or award has been reduced to 10 men , with Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard the highest profile casualties from the original group of 30 players .
Barcelona and Argentina forward Lionel Messi is the overwhelming favourite for the award , with last year 's winner Cristiano Ronaldo also featuring prominently , award organisers France Football magazine said on their website .
Didier Drogba , Samuel Eto'o , Steven Gerrard , Zlatan Ibrahimovic , Andrés Iniesta , Kaká , Wayne Rooney and Xavi are the other players still in contention .
Torres , Lampard and Cesc Fábregas all failed to make the short list .
There were no Italian or German players on the original 30 - man list .
Now there is no French player remaining with Karim Benzema , Yoann Gourcuff and Franck Ribéry all dropped .
The result of the vote by soccer journalists to name the winner of the award formerly known as the European Footballer of the Year will be announced on Tuesday .

Penny - pinching Citibank will put the squeeze on small - fry customers , charging them up to $ 90 a year by demanding a fee every time their average monthly checking account balance sinks below $ 1,500 .
Starting in February , Citibank will no longer automatically waive its $ 7.50 monthly fee for its “ EZ ” and “ Access ” checking - account holders who make either a direct deposit , or two bill payments online monthly .
“ Yes , we ’re changing certain terms and conditions for our EZ and Access checking - account packages , ” a spokeswoman said .
“ Regarding what prompted us to make these changes , we did so to make them more simple and straightforward , by recognizing and rewarding customers for maintaining their balances with Citibank . ”
But one Citi manager admitted the extra fees will be a tough sell , and likely will send many of his less - well - off customers to rival banks .
“ Some are regular working folk who are trying hard to make ends meet and to pay their bills , ” said the manager .
“ Fifteen hundred dollars is a lot of money .
Many do n’t have that kind of balance in their accounts . ”
Fees are lucrative to banks .
Pulling an extra $ 90 a year from its customers ’ pockets may not seem like a lot of money to a bank , but multiply it by thousands of accounts and the dollars quickly add up .
“ When this is aggregated , it can be highly significant , ” said James McNulty , a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton .
And if Citi finds that customers do n’t flee , other banks might be tempted to copy it , said Peter Cohan , a management consultant .
“ If it turns out that this bank makes a lot more money from the move , other banks will start to do the same . ”
But some of the more “ customer - oriented ” of the nation ’s 8,500 banks may be tempted to attract new business simply by advertising the fact they do not charge maintenance fees , Cohan said .
He also warned that the Obama White House would not look too kindly on banks “ trying to squeeze pennies out of the poor . ”
With the rise of “ free checking ” offers , most bank customers pay very little in bank fees .
About 70 percent of consumers spend $ 3 or less in monthly fees for checking account maintenance and ATM access , the American Bankers Association says .
And 56 percent pay nothing .
That ’s up from 52 percent in 2008 , the ABA ’s survey found .
Citibank ’s move to boost fees comes as two of its main rivals , Bank of America and Chase , are taking an opposite tack , by curbing charges for overdrawn accounts .
Bank of America recently announced it would simply stop imposing fees on customers who overdraw their accounts by less than $ 10 .
It ’s also limiting the number of fees for individual overdrafts to four per day .
Chase is eliminating overdraft fees on debit cards unless customers opt in .
Customers who agree to the fees will be allowed to overdraw their accounts ; those who do not agree to the fees will be declined if they try to overdraw their accounts .
Chase will also stop charging fees when accounts are overdrawn by less than $ 5 .
The changes come as Washington lawmakers push proposals to eliminate what critics say are unfair bank charges and fees .
Today I created something very interesting .
Here it is .
Fairly standard fair for YouTube , right ?
Nope .
The bit that makes this video interesting is the text at the end .
This video was shot , edited and published entirely on my iPhone 3GS .
The new iPhone app ReelDirector from Nexvio is the app I wished for in an earlier post .
The iPhone 3GS is now a miniature video production studio .
What this means for the future is quite profound , but first let me talk about the app it self .
The ReelDirector timeline ReelDirector is no Final Cut Pro or even iMovie .
It is as simple as a video editor can get .
You select and trim videos with the same method that is built into the 3GS , but then you bring those clips into a timeline where you can cut it together with other clips .
That is the basic functionality .
That alone is a big deal .
With those tools you have all you need to tell a story with video .
However , ReelDirector has done a little more than that .
The app has 27 different transitions that can be used between clips and you can also add reasonably customized titles at the beginning and end of the video .
What is missing ?
The main thing is audio .
Sound is linked to the video and you cannot separate them which is pretty obvious in the video .
This means you cannot have the audio from one clip continue underneath another .
You also cannot add other sound such as music or voice over -- though Nexvio says they are working to add this .
Another feature I would like to see is effects and color correction .
It would be nice to optimize the look of the videos while editing them .
While they are at it Nexvio could bundle in the functionality of their SlowMo iPhone app , so you can change the speed of video .
Ok , the future .
The ability to edit video on the same device as it is shot with is unprecedented ( as far as I know ) .
More than that , since the iPhone has 3G , you can upload theses videos straight to a distribution source -- practically in real - time .
I shot My Morning Commute this morning .
It was uploading to YouTube by the time I was sitting at my desk .
The workflow was great .
I shot some video , then switched over to ReelDirector and cut the shots in .
When I stepped out of the train I just had to shoot the last two shots , cut them in and I was done .
I edited the story together as it was happening !
The iPhone now represents the convergence of the entire video workflow into one device .
Welcome to the world of tomorrow !!
Ok , the iPhone is not going to put Hollywood out of business .
The video quality is good for a phone but that is about it and it gets worse when you upload it to YouTube with the built - in photos app ( here is a full quality version for comparison ) .
Where I think we will see this convergence utilized first will be in journalism and documentary .
A journalist can file completed video reports from the field with a single inconspicuous device .
This can be done while on the move and as the story is taking place .
The revolution may not be televised , but the story may be told by someone armed only with iPhone .
I think ReelDirector is a must - have app for all 3GS owners .

The two Americas
19 October 2009
Two reports last week , just over one year since the onset of the financial crisis , shed light on the nature of American and world capitalism .
According to an article in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday ( “ Wall Street on Track to Award Record Pay ” ) , the top 23 Wall Street banks and financial firms are expected to hand out a record $ 140 billion in compensation this year — $ 10 billion more than the previous record year , 2007 .
The rapid recovery in bank pay has been “ boosted by a stronger stock market , thawing credit market , a resurgence in deal making and the continuing effects of various government aid programs , ” the Journal noted .
The Journal article came as the largest banks posted their third - quarter earnings .
Banks most heavily involved in trading and other forms of speculative activity fared the best , with Goldman Sachs reporting $ 3.2 billion and JPMorgan Chase $ 3.6 billion in profits .
On Friday , USA Today published a front - page article ( “ Wages Head to 20 - Year Tumble ” ) reporting that average weekly wages for non-management workers in the US have fallen by 1.4 percent so far this year .
If wages continue to fall at this rate , it will be the sharpest decline since 1991 .
" Wages are usually the last thing to deteriorate in a recession , " economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute told USA Today .
" But it 's happening now , and wages are probably going to be held down for a long time . "
This report only hints at the social crisis facing millions of people .
Official unemployment is close to 10 percent , and real unemployment is much higher .
Employers are seizing on the weak labor market to cut benefits and reduce hours across the board .
Initiating a trend that could well catch on , Colorado last week became the first state to lower its minimum wage since the federal law was introduced in 1938 .
The coming together of record Wall Street profits and the soaring stock market , on the one hand , and increasing unemployment , falling wages and growing social misery , on the other , has prompted some liberal supporters of the Obama administration to express concern about the social and political implications of these trends .
Several commentators have warned that unless Wall Street develops a social conscience and Obama shows more “ backbone , ” the divergence in the “ two Americas ” could have explosive results .
Such appeals ignore the real character of the American and world capitalist economy and the role of the Obama administration as the representative of the US financial aristocracy .
The economy of the entire planet is subordinated to the interests of a tiny layer of the population .
The interests of this parasitical financial elite can be guaranteed only at the expense of the productive sections of society , principally the working class .
As the financial crisis erupted last year , it became clear to the American ruling class that nothing short of a massive diversion of public resources to the banks could stave off a collapse .
The decision to let Lehman Brothers fall was bound up with a deliberate campaign , led by the Bush administration and backed by then - presidential candidate Obama , to create a climate of panic .
The aim was to create the political conditions for Congress to sanction a series of bailout measures .
The Treasury was placed at the disposal of Wall Street and trillions of dollars were handed over to the financial institutions .
The big banks have used government money to return to profitability and the stock market has risen more than 50 percent since last March .
The market has been pushed up by investors awash in cash who have no productive outlet for their money .
But its extraordinary rise is also a vote of confidence in the Obama administration by bankers and big investors who have been reassured that it is fully committed to protecting their interests .
And no wonder .
Obama has opposed all caps on executive compensation and rejected any serious reform of financial regulations or restraints on the banks , including those bailed out by the government .
The Obama administration has blocked bills in Congress to stop AIG and other companies from paying hundreds of millions in bonuses to its traders and executives .
At the same time , the administration continued and expanded the government bailout programs , pledging up to $ 23 trillion .
In doing so , it has extended an implicit guarantee that the largest financial institutions are “ too big to fail , ” and that their bad debts will be covered once again in the event of a new crisis .
These resources will be paid for , in one way or another , by the working class .
Obama pushed through the forced bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler , demanding that workers accept sharp cuts in wages and benefits , along with the elimination of tens of thousands of jobs .
This was a signal for corporate America as a whole to use mass unemployment to carry through similar measures .
The administration has refused to give any aid to the states , forcing them to balance their budgets by cutting their workforces and slashing spending on education and health care .
At the federal level , the government is determined to reduce spending on social programs , including a health care overhaul principally aimed at eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner stressed this point on Friday , when he said that the US must " live within its means . ”
In response to a record $ 1.4 trillion deficit — due in no small part to the bank bailouts — and in order to preserve global confidence in the dollar , Geithner said , “ The president is committed to working with Congress to bring [ deficits ] down to a sustainable level … ”
This can only mean cuts in social programs upon which millions of people rely .
A solution to the crisis facing working people must be based on : 1 ) A political break with and struggle against the Obama administration and the two - party system ; and 2 ) a program that directly attacks the financial elite and the capitalist system on which it is based .
This requires the confiscation of the wealth of the financial aristocracy , accumulated by fraud and parasitism , through a massive increase in taxes on the wealthy .
Control over the main economic levers of society must be taken out of private hands and placed under the democratic control of the working class , so that they can be directed to meeting social needs , rather than generating corporate profits and ever greater wealth for the rich .
If there is one lesson that must be drawn from the experience of this crisis , it is that the interests of the working class — in the US and around the world — cannot be advanced within the framework of the present economic and political system .
It is necessary to fight for the only alternative to capitalism — that is , for socialism .

Several days after a number of House Democrats voiced their concern with upcoming net neutrality rules , the chief executives of 24 major tech companies , including Twitter and Facebook , penned a letter to the Federal Communications Commission in support of the initiative .
Several days after a number of House Democrats with upcoming net neutrality rules , the chief executives of 24 major tech companies , including Twitter and Facebook , penned a letter to the Federal Communications Commission in support of the initiative .
" We believe a process that results in common sense baseline rules is critical to ensuring that the Internet remains a key engine of economic growth , innovation , and global competitiveness , " the chief executives wrote to Chairman Julius Genachowski under the auspices of the Open Internet Coalition .
Executives who signed the letter include : Evan Williams , co-founder of Twitter ; Mark Zuckerberg , founder and CEO of Facebook ; John Donahoe , CEO of eBay ; and Steve Chan , founder of YouTube .
Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google  which has long supported net neutrality  also signed the letter .
" An open Internet fuels a competitive and efficient marketplace , where consumers make the ultimate choices about which products succeed and which fail , " the executives wrote .
" This allows businesses of all sizes , from the smallest startup to the larger corporations , to compete , yielding maximum economic growth and opportunity . "
The FCC is expected to introduce formal rules regarding net neutrality at its Thursday October meeting .
Net neutrality is the theory that everyone should have equal access to the Internet .
In September , Genachowski to its Internet Policy Principles .
The first would prevent ISPs from discriminating against particular Internet content or applications , while allowing for reasonable network management .
The second would ensure that ISPs are transparent about network management .
The executives argued that the openness of the Internet has " fueled an unprecedented era of economic growth and creativity " and that the FCC 's rules will help protect that .
Detractors like certain telecom companies and the make a similar argument , but they say that an FCC rulemaking might actually stifle innovation .
Other companies that signed the letter include Amazon.com , Digg , LinkedIn , OpenDNS , Zynga , Vuze , Skype , Flickr , Cbeyond , Craigslist , EchoStar Corporation , Mozilla Corporation , Sony Electronics , XO Communications , Expedia , IAC , One Communications , and TiVo .
The Open Internet Coalition is a D.C. - based interest group that focuses on the protection of the open Internet .

Korean - Style Short Ribs
Korean short ribs have an irresistible combination of sweet , salty and spicy flavors .
Traditionally , the sweetness comes from sugar or corn syrup , usually half a cup or more .
Thanks to Christian Chun , who submitted a fruit - based marinade for Korean - style short ribs to the Primal Blueprint Cookbook Contest , you can lose the processed sugar without losing a bit of flavor .
Fruit provides all the sweetness the ribs need .
Christian ’s recipe combines apple , Asian pear and kiwi .
For a slightly different but equally delicious marinade , try using antioxidant - rich blackberries instead .
The sweetness of the fruit , contrasted with tamari , garlic and rice vinegar , hits all the right notes .
The result is intensely flavored and truly addictive ribs .
Wrapped in a cooling leaf of romaine lettuce and served with a feisty scallion salad , Primal Korean Short Ribs will add new dimensions of flavor to your table .
Ingredients :
2 pounds beef short ribs .
For Korean short ribs , “ flanken - style ” is the preferred cut .
Flanken - style ribs about 1/2 - inch thick and contain three rib bones .
This marinade can also be used with other types of beef , such as 1/2 - inch thick sirloin steaks .
Marinade :
1/2 apple , skin on
1 kiwi , peeled
1/2 Asian pear , skin on ( optional )
OR use 2 cups blackberries instead of other fruit
1/2 cup wheat - free tamari
1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
4 stalks of scallions , chopped
1/2 onion , chopped
2 - 4 garlic cloves
Directions :
Chop the fruit up into chunks and put all marinade ingredients into a blender until smooth .
Pour the marinade over meat into a Ziploc bag , an air - tight container or a bowl wrapped tightly with plastic wrap .
Make sure the meat is completely covered with the marinade .
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight .
Grill ribs four minutes on each side for rare and a minute or two longer for medium rare .
The ribs can also be cooked under a broiler , but might take 3 - 5 minutes longer to cook .
Serve with Romaine lettuce leaves and an optional garnish of thinly sliced garlic , thinly sliced Korean hot pepper or jalapeno , and scallion salad .
Scallion Salad Ingredients :
1 bunch of scallions ( about 12 scallions )
1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon wheat - free tamari
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon wasabi ( optional )
Directions :
Chop most of the white part off the scallions and trim the top so the onion is about four inches long .
Using the tip of a knife , cut the green stalks into very thin strips .
A pair of scissors will also work well for this .
Submerge the sliced scallions in a bowl of ice water to make them curl .
If the green stalks are n’t sliced thinly enough , they wo n’t curl .
Remove scallions and dry .
Toss with remaining ingredients .

Hello Kitty may be a little bit of a trend in America , but in Asia , it 's a lifestyle .
There have been Hello Kitty weddings and hotels before , but did you know kitty - obsessed mothers can even give birth in Taiwan 's Hello Kitty maternity hospital ?
The three million dollar venture has been officially sanctioned by the character 's parent company .
Each bed sheet is branded with Hello Kitty , as are the nurses uniforms .
In the lobby , a giant Kitty statue waits to greet guests .
Twice a year people in character costumes come around and entertain guests .
The makers of the hospital are hoping the character will help reduce the stress of labor and bring in clientele .
" I wish that everyone who comes here , mothers who suffer while giving birth and children who suffer from an illness , can get medical care while seeing these kitties and that we can bring a smile to their faces , helping forget about discomfort and recover faster , "  said Tsai Tsung - chi , the director of the hospital .
Do you know of any other theme hospitals ?

Japan has gone through two lost decades , in and out of deflation , with nothing to show for it but increasing debt to GDP and a stock market still 70 % below its peak .
Now , Richard Koo of Nomura Research Institute Ltd. says U.S. Risks Japan - Like ‘ Lost Decade ’ on Stimulus Exit .
U.S. officials contemplating an exit from record fiscal stimulus are in danger of repeating mistakes that plunged Japan into its lost decade of stagnant growth , according to Richard Koo of Nomura Research Institute Ltd .
“ This is n’t a cold , its more like pneumonia , ” said Koo , author of “ Balance Sheet Recession , ” a 2003 book about the malaise that hit Japan after its stock and real - estate markets crashed in 1990 .
“ We still need more government spending , ” he said , adding it could take “ three to five years to get out of this mess , even under the best of circumstances . ”
Koo ’s comments echo the view of economists including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman , who warn that the U.S. ’s likely return to growth in the second half of 2009 does n’t mean a sustained recovery is assured .
The Obama administration aims to rein in a record $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit as growth returns , seeking to safeguard the value of a declining dollar .
“ If you learn your lesson from the Japanese experience , you do n’t remove your fiscal stimulus until private sector de- leveraging is over , ” Koo , 55 , chief economist at the research arm of Japan ’s biggest brokerage , said in an interview at his Tokyo office last week .
“ When we see the private sector coming to borrow again , I ’ll be the loudest person on earth arguing for fiscal reform .
That ’s the exit . ”
Koo calculates that the bursting of Japan ’s asset bubble in 1990 erased 1,500 trillion yen ( $ 16 trillion ) in wealth , equivalent to three times the size of the economy .
Companies focused on repaying debt rather than undertaking new projects , causing demand to plummet and triggering a cycle in which cash flows fell , asset prices dropped and balance sheets deteriorated .
This time it ’s the U.S. consumer that ’s inundated with debt .
Household debt soared more than 10 percent each year from 2002 to 2005 , when the economy expanded an average of 2.75 percent .
“ We have zero interest rates and still nothing ’s happening , ” Koo said .
Businesses and households do n’t want to borrow money even at zero rates ; they ’re too busy rebuilding savings and paying off debt , he said .
“ We had these false starts , ” Koo said .
“ The economy would begin to improve and then we ’d say ‘oh my god , the budget deficit is too large . ’
Then we ’d cut fiscal stimulus and collapse again .
We went through this zigzag for 15 years . ”
Real Lesson of Japan's Lost Decades
zero interest rates and still nothing ’s happening .
Creative Destruction
Two Lost Decades
The Japanese Stock Market is about 25 % of what it was close to 20 years ago !
Yes , I know , the US is not Japan , that deflation can't happen here , etc , etc .
Of course deflation did happen here , so the question now is how long it lasts .
The five month , 50 % rebound in the S&P 500 was certainly spectacular .
However , the more important question is where to from here ?
Take a look at Japan 's " Two Lost Decades " for clues .
Creative destruction in conjunction with global wage arbitrage , changing demographics , downsizing boomers fearing retirement , changing social attitudes towards debt in every economic age group , and massive debt leverage is an extremely powerful set of forces .
Bear in mind , that set of forces will not play out over days , weeks , or months .
A Schumpeterian Depression will take years , perhaps even decades to play out .
Christina Romer on Impact of Stimulus on GDP
How " Something For Nothing " Ideas Become Policy
Illusions of Stimulus
I know Romer best for her misinterpretation of what happened in 1937 - 38 .
She believes that the fallback into full - scale depression from ' depression light ' ( as evidenced by unemployment in 1938 almost returning to the highest levels of the depression trough 32/33 ) is proof that it was a mistake to tighten policy ( fiscal and monetary ) too early .
In other words , according to her , if the Fed had continued pumping as furiously as possible , then everything would have been alright .
In reality , the entire inflationary mini - boomlet - within - the - depression was simply an illusion .
' GDP growth ' that is bought with monetary pumping and feckless fiscal spending only misdirects and ultimately consumes even more scarce capital .
Fiscal stimulus may temporarily give the impression of a recovery , but it is not a genuine recovery .
It makes things worse .
The moment the pumping is abandoned , the true state of affairs is simply unmasked .
That is what happened in 37/38 - a slight tightening of monetary policy revealed the fact that the mini- boomlet was as unsound as its predecessor boom in the years prior to the ' 29 crash .
It would not have been possible to hide this reality forever .
There is nothing , absolutely nothing , that government intervention can achieve in terms of ' fixing ' the economy .
The choice was in either abandoning the unsound policy and the unsound investments it produced , or careen toward a complete destruction of the currency system .
Once again , I stand amazed at how people can look at this , and look at Japan , and look at the housing bubble / bust sequence , and still believe that monetary pumping and deficit spending are viable tools of economic policy when a bust occurs .
It really boggles the mind , reminding me of Einstein 's definition of insanity , ' doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result ' .
Japan's Public Debt Nightmare
accomplished
Death of Muddle Through
Japanese Disease
John Mauldin : Some readers wrote this week telling me I am far too worried about a rising government deficit .
Right now we are at roughly 42 % of debt to GDP .
In 1989 , at the start of the lost decades , Japan had a debt - to - GDP ratio of 51 % .
Now it is at 178 % , and the world has not come to an end for them .
In fact , they are running massive government deficits today and plan to do so for a long time .
Why , I am asked , ca n’t we be like Japan ?
In 1989 , private Japanese debt ( businesses and consumers ) was at a debt - to - GDP ratio of 212 % .
Now it is at 110 % .
And the total of both government and private debt is roughly the same ( within 5 % ) of where it was 20 years ago .
Along with running large trade surpluses , private debt has been exchanged for government debt .
Savings have fallen from the mid-teens to about 2 % today , as the country is rapidly aging and now using its savings to live on .
And how much has all that government spending helped the country ?
John Mauldin Quoting Hoisington :
For all intents and purposes , Japan has had no growth for almost two decades .
Their nominal GDP is where it was 17 years ago , and the number of employed people is at 20 - years - ago levels .
An aging population has masked their unemployment problems , as older citizens retire .
Their savings went to government debt .
Taxes were raised numerous times .
Since government deficit spending has no long - term multiplier effect , growth has been nonexistent .
( By the way , that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer , the chairman of the current President ’s Council of Economic Advisors , and further explored by European economists .
There is general agreement on these facts . )
Japan Rethinks A Dam
The clatter of construction machinery still fills this forested mountain gorge , where legions of men in hard hats busily pour concrete , clear hillsides and erect a huge , unfinished bridge whose concrete supports tower over the valley floor like crucifixes in an immense graveyard .
It seems an apt analogy .
Japan ’s new government has suspended the $ 5.2 billion Yamba Dam being built here and turned this valley four hours north of Tokyo into a symbolic final resting place for the nation ’s postwar order , which relied on colossal public works spending .
The Democratic Party government of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has chosen this dam as the first of 48 national government - financed dams that it wants to scrap , worth tens of billions of dollars .
Japan had around 60 large dams under construction in 2005 , making it the world ’s fourth largest dam - building nation , according to The International Journal on Hydropower and Dams , despite having a land area smaller than California’s .
Decades of pouring concrete have been widely blamed in Japan for cluttering rural areas with needless dams and roads to nowhere .
They have also saddled the country with the developed world ’s largest national debt — nearly twice its $ 5 trillion economy .
Mr. Hatoyama ’s party has vowed to replace Japan ’s postwar “ construction state ” and the jobs it created with something closer to a European - style social welfare system .
Yen Poised To Blow Up

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Canadian man who was detained at a New York airport and then moved to Syria , where he says he was tortured , cannot sue the United States , a federal appeals court ruled on Monday .

Maher Arar , a Syrian - born software engineer , was arrested by U.S. officials during a 2002 stopover in New York while on his way home to Canada and then deported to Syria because of suspected links to al Qaeda .
Arar says he was imprisoned in Syria for a year and tortured and has sued top U.S. government officials , claiming his civil liberties were violated .
In a 7 - 4 decision , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with a lower court that Arar could not sue U.S. officials .
The court found that he did not have legal standing to sue and that legal protection and redress in cases such as this should be determined by Congress and not the courts .
“ Once Congress has performed this task , then the courts in a proper case will be able to review the statute and provide judicial oversight , ” the ruling said .
In a dissenting opinion , Judge Guido Calabresi wrote : “ I believe that when the history of this distinguished court is written , today ’s majority decision will be viewed with dismay . ”
The Center for Constitutional Rights , which represented Arar , did not say whether it would appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court .
In a statement , Arar said the ruling proves “ the court system in the United States has become more or less a tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear - mongering . ”
Arar filed the lawsuit in 2004 .
It was the first lawsuit to challenge the U.S. government ’s policy of “ extraordinary rendition , ” which involves transferring suspects to a third country where there is no prohibition on the use of torture during interrogation .
Arar has said that , while in Syria , he was beaten , whipped with electrical cables and held for almost a year in a tiny underground cell .
“ It ’s the court ’s role to uphold the law and the law prohibits torture and provides for redress , ” said Center for Constitutional Rights attorney Maria LaHood .
“ Torture is universally agreed to be illegal and unconstitutional .
The Canadian government formally apologized to Arar in 2007 and paid him a C$ 10.5 million ( $ 9.8 million ) settlement .
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said the United States mishandled Arar ’s case , but stopped short of an apology .

A crack in the Earth ’s crust – which could be the forerunner to a new ocean – ripped open in just days in 2005 , a new study suggests .
The opening , located in the Afar region of Ethiopia , presents a unique opportunity for geologists to study how mid-ocean ridges form .
The crack is the surface component of a continental rift forming as the Arabian and African plates drift away from one another .
It began to open up in September 2005 , when a volcano at the northern end of the rift , called Dabbahu , erupted .
The magma inside the volcano did not reach the surface and erupt as a fountain of lava – instead , it was diverted into the continental rift underground .
The magma cooled into a wedge - shaped “ dike ” that was then uplifted , rupturing the surface and creating a 500 - metre - long , 60 - metre - deep crack .

Using sensor data collected by universities in the region , researchers led by Atalay Ayele of Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia reconstructed the sequence of seismic events that led to the crack ’s formation .
They found that a 60 - kilometre - long , 8 - metre - wide dike of solidified magma formed in the rift , causing the crack , in a matter of days .
‘ Stunning ’ ferocity
Similar dikes in Iceland are typically around 10 kilometres long and 1 metre wide and can take years to form .
The new study shows the formation of dikes can occur in larger segments – and over much shorter periods of time – than previously thought .
“ The ferocity of what we saw during this episode stunned everyone , ” says Cynthia Ebinger , a team member at the University of Rochester in New York .
While the Mount Dabbahu rift is still hundreds of kilometres inland , Ebinger says it could continue to widen and lengthen .
“ As the plates keep spreading apart , it will end up looking like the Red Sea , ” she says .
New ocean
Eventually it could reach the east coast of Ethiopia and fill up with seawater .
“ At some point , if that spreading and rifting continues , then that area will be flooded , ” says Ken Macdonald , a marine geophysicist at the University of California , Santa Barbara , who was not involved with the study .
Ebinger says this wo n’t happen any time soon – it would take around 4 million years for the crack to reach the size of the Red Sea .
Other areas in the Afar region are below sea level , however , and could see flooding before that if similar rifting occurs near the coastal volcanoes to the north and east that form a natural levee against the sea .
Macdonald says the process of continental plates spreading apart and filling in with magma is analogous to what happens on the deep seafloor at mid-ocean ridges , which are difficult to study because they lie a few kilometres under water .
“ This is very exciting in terms of its implications for the deep ocean and how mid-ocean ridges work , ” he told New Scientist .

weekend satanists for jesus
Today , if you want to get famous and turn being you into a career you join a reality TV show .
But back in the day , you had to pretend to be a blood - drinking , virgin - sacrificing Satanist ...
Illustration by Coke Navarro
Let ’s face it , if you want a career in religious studies , not all religions will give you the same earning potential and the more obscure your field of research , the worse off you are .
Back at the turn of the last century , esoteric manuscripts about the Occult were a hit with celebrities and the wealthy , but today , they ’re old hat , seen either as a bunch of people having fun rather than a “ serious ” exploration of the supernatural , or as communes with demonic evil in fundamentalist circles .
So what ’s a budding theologian to do when he finds that his dabbling in something he calls Satanism holds no money in it ?
Why , turn his gothic fun into scary tales for Christians terrified by the shows put on by the Church of Satan and milk their popularity for all he can , of course !
That was a strategy employed by Mike Warnke who claimed to be a former Satanic High Priest presiding over ritual orgies , kidnapping and rape , and even sacrifice to the Devil himself .
Then , he stopped doing drugs and found Jesus who saved his soul and lead him into the life of a minister and Christian comedian .
Yes , it ’s not exactly anything new and exciting for us today but in 1973 it was a pretty original piece of work , coming on the heels of Anton LaVey ’s gimmick to scare and confuse Christians with grossly over - exaggerated rituals he tied to Satan .
Warnke ’s timing was impeccable and his story was just juicy , lurid and scary enough to capture the minds of the faithful who have a fascination for anything dark and evil .
His book , The Satan Seller , was like a b - level horror flick .
Graphic , reveling in sex , drugs and violence , and clearly fake from beginning to end .
But since it was released to a crowd ready and eagerly willing to believe him , doubts did n’t really bubble to the public surface for decades .
In the meantime , Warnke performed hundreds of sold out shows per year , was a feature on daytime talk shows , religious programs , and even advised police departments on cult behavior in a role where he surely impeded or derailed many an investigation .
Spurned by the popularity of his book , other authors started writing about Satanists hiding in people ’s back yards or recollections of “ Satanic ritual abuse , ” the most famous of which was Michelle Remembers , widely credited for inciting full blown witch hunts in a ye old ye style that would n’t be out of place in Salem , circa 1600s .
Dozens of people were put on trial for abusing children or running Satanic cults , all of them acquitted after the judges got bored listening to paranoia and a panel of so - called experts who did n’t seem to know anything about human memory , or behavior .
It took until 1992 for Cornerstone ’s investigative journalists to tackle Warnke ’s story and prove that pretty much all of his claims were either downright impossible , or very inconsistent .
For example , for Warnke and Charles Manson to attend the same Satanic ritual together would ’ve required Manson ’s release from federal prison .
At the same time , for Warnke to have converted in the Navy after being drafted to fight in Vietnam , would raise the question of why he was actively involved with The Campus Crusade for Christ , a fundamentalist evangelical group which seeks to proselytize college students , well before he had anything to do with the military .
There was also a disturbing history of spousal abuse to consider .
In short , Cornerstone concluded , Warnke was as truthful as an average politician , playing fast and lose with the facts to cash in on a collection of lurid tales with heavy religious overtones .
Though Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott certainly do deserve a pat on the back for their thorough investigation and objectivity in the face of the subject matter involved , writing for a Christian magazine did mean that another very important thing was missed in their article .
One fundamental reason why Warnke ’s claims should have been dismissed as ridiculous in the first place were his descriptions of Satanism and Satanic rituals .
Rather than sacrifice humans or hold ritual orgies , Satanists tend put on a scary , dramatic show or play out some of their fantasies about the dark side of Occult traditions .
Other occultists who call themselves Satanists really follow the old , monotheistic tradition of Hermeticism with a Cabbalistic twist thrown in for good measure .
The Illuminati sitting at the top of some Satanic hierarchy kidnapping women for ritual orgies ?
Smells like the Taxil Hoax with a dash of David Icke on the side …
Warnke ’s story was so popular because it played on ardent Christians ’ lurid fears and lust for graphic tales of sordid ritual abuse and conspiracies by Satanic agents , and despite being exposed as a liar and a fraud , his stories and performances are still sought after and well compensated for the same reasons .
And this raises a question of why the people who still take him , and the many “ recovering Satanists ” he inspired seriously , are so passionate about this kind of stuff , even if their sources are just crassly exploiting their religious devotion and sheer gullibility when it comes to the Occult ?
With most Americans outraged over the behavior of the Federal Reserve and the part it has played in the bailouts of huge institutions in the financial and automotive industries , Ron Paul introduced H.R. 1207 , which would have required a full audit of the Federal Reserve and its activities , which crosses international lines .
According to Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , the House Financial Service Committee ’s panel on domestic monetary policy , Rep. Mel Watt , D - N.C. , essentially stripped the bill of just about everything that would have required transparency , and pretty much is now worthless as to its original purpose of letting the American people and Congress see what their secretive dealings have entailed .
After Watt got hold of the bill , it no longer includes the communications reports between the reserve banks and its various workers , and also the Board .
What was especially wanted to be seen was what types of deals were made with foreign central banks and how recent bailout money was spent and what banks received it and how much .
Paul asserts those loopholes , which had been closed in the original language of the bill , are now reopened .
Citing a telephone interview with Paul , Bloomberg reported Paul said about the revised bill : “ There ’s nothing left ; it ’s been gutted .
This is not a partisan issue .
People all over the country want to know what the Fed is up to , and this legislation was supposed to help them do that . ”
Especially troubling about the gutting of the bill is the connections the Democrat Watt has with the banking industry .
Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) has its headquarters in his congressional district , which is based in Charlotte , but worse , the majority of contributions to Watt ’s campaign has come from corporations in the real estate , finance and insurance industry .
Watt ’s largest contributors included American Express ( NYSE : AXP ) , Wachovia , Bank of America and the American Bankers Association .
Altogether the financial industry donated over $ 217,109 to Watt , which was over 35 percent of the overall contributions he received .
Paul ’s bill had widespread support , with over 300 co-sponsors in the house .
Per Bloomberg , Paul says he plans on introducing an amendment to the bill which would bring it back to the original language it included at the time it comes to the floor of the House to be voted on .
From the UK Telegraph :
Lord Lawson , the former chancellor , has called for an independent inquiry into claims that leading climate change scientists manipulated data to strengthen the case for man-made global warming .
Thousands of emails and documents stolen from the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) and posted online indicate that researchers massaged figures to mask the fact that world temperatures have been declining in recent years .
This morning Lord Lawson , who has reinvented himself as a prominent climate change sceptic since leaving front line politics , demanded that the apparent deception be fully investigated .
He claimed that the credibility of the university ’s world - renowned Climatic Research Unit – and British science – were under threat .
“ They should set up a public inquiry under someone who is totally respected and get to the truth , ” he told the BBC Radio Four Today programme .
“ If there ’s an explanation for what ’s going on they can make that explanation . ”

[ This article is excerpted from chapter 17 of Human Action : The Scholar 's Edition . ]
As soon as an economic good is demanded not only by those who want to use it for consumption or production , but also by people who want to keep it as a medium of exchange and to give it away at need in a later act of exchange , the demand for it increases .
A new employment for this good has emerged and creates an additional demand for it .
As with every other economic good , such an additional demand brings about a rise in its value in exchange , i.e. , in the quantity of other goods which are offered for its acquisition .
The amount of other goods which can be obtained in giving away a medium of exchange , its " price " as expressed in terms of various goods and services , is in part determined by the demand of those who want to acquire it as a medium of exchange .
If people stop using the good in question as a medium of exchange , this additional specific demand disappears and the " price " drops concomitantly .
Thus the demand for a medium of exchange is the composite of two partial demands : the demand displayed by the intention to use it in consumption and production and that displayed by the intention to use it as a medium of exchange .
With regard to modern metallic money one speaks of the industrial demand and of the monetary demand .
The value in exchange ( purchasing power ) of a medium of exchange is the resultant of the cumulative effect of both partial demands .
Now the extent of that part of the demand for a medium of exchange which is displayed on account of its service as a medium of exchange depends on its value in exchange .
This fact raises difficulties which many economists considered insoluble so that they abstained from following farther along this line of reasoning .
It is illogical , they said , to explain the purchasing power of money by reference to the demand for money , and the demand for money by reference to its purchasing power .
The difficulty is , however , merely apparent .
The purchasing power that we explain by referring to the extent of specific demand is not the same purchasing power the height of which determines this specific demand .
The problem is to conceive the determination of the purchasing power of the immediate future , of the impending moment .
For the solution of this problem we refer to the purchasing power of the immediate past , of the moment just passed .
These are two distinct magnitudes .
It is erroneous to object to our theorem , which may be called the regression theorem , that it moves in a vicious circle .
But , say the critics , this is tantamount to merely pushing back the problem .
For now one must still explain the determination of yesterday 's purchasing power .
If one explains this in the same way by referring to the purchasing power of the day before yesterday and so on , one slips into a regressus in infinitum .
This reasoning , they assert , is certainly not a complete and logically satisfactory solution of the problem involved .
What these critics fail to see is that the regression does not go back endlessly .
It reaches a point at which the explanation is completed and no further question remains unanswered .
If we trace the purchasing power of money back step by step , we finally arrive at the point at which the service of the good concerned as a medium of exchange begins .
At this point , yesterday 's exchange value is exclusively determined by the nonmonetary — industrial — demand , which is displayed only by those who want to use this good for other employments than that of a medium of exchange .
But , the critics continue , this means explaining that part of money 's purchasing power which is due to its service as a medium of exchange by its employment for industrial purposes .
The very problem , the explanation of the specific monetary component of its exchange value , remains unsolved .
Here too , the critics are mistaken .
That component of money 's value which is an outcome of the services it renders as a medium of exchange is entirely explained by reference to these specific monetary services and the demand they create .
Two facts are not to be denied and are not denied by anybody .
First , that the demand for a medium of exchange is determined by considerations of its exchange value which is an outcome both of the monetary and the industrial services it renders .
Second , that the exchange value of a good which has not yet been demanded for service as a medium of exchange is determined solelyby a demand on the part of people eager to use it for industrial purposes , i.e. , either for consumption or for production .
Now , the regression theorem aims at interpreting the first emergence of a monetary demand for a good which previously had been demanded exclusively for industrial purposes as influenced by the exchange value that was ascribed to it at this moment on account of its nonmonetary services only .
This certainly does not involve explaining the specific monetary exchange value of a medium of exchange on the ground of its industrial exchange value .
Finally it was objected to the regression theorem that its approach is historical , not theoretical .
This objection is no less mistaken .
To explain an event historically means to show how it was produced by forces and factors operating at a definite date and a definite place .
These individual forces and factors are the ultimate elements of the interpretation .
They are ultimate data and as such not open to any further analysis and reduction .
To explain a phenomenon theoretically means to trace back its appearance to the operation of general rules which are already comprised in the theoretical system .
The regression theorem complies with this requirement .
It traces the specific exchange value of a medium of exchange back to its function as such a medium and to the theorems concerning the process of valuing and pricing as developed by the general catallactic theory .
It deduces a more special case from the rules of a more universal theory .
It shows how the special phenomenon necessarily emerges out of the operation of the rules generally valid for all phenomena .
It does not say , " This happened at that time and at that place . "
It says , " This always happens when the conditions appear ; whenever a good which has not been demanded previously for the employment as a medium of exchange , begins to be demanded for this employment , the same effects must appear again ; no good can be employed for the function of a medium of exchange which at the very beginning of its use for this purpose did not have exchange value on account of other employments . "
And all these statements implied in the regression theorem are enounced apodictically as implied in the apriorism of praxeology .
It must happen this way .
Nobody can ever succeed in constructing a hypothetical case in which things were to occur in a different way .
The purchasing power of money is determined by demand and supply , as is the case with the prices of all vendible goods and services .
As action always aims at a more satisfactory arrangement of future conditions , he who considers acquiring or giving away money is , of course , first of all interested in its future purchasing power and the future structure of prices .
But he cannot form a judgment about the future purchasing power of money otherwise than by looking at its configuration in the immediate past .
It is this fact that radically distinguishes the determination of the purchasing power of money from the determination of the mutual exchange ratios between the various vendible goods and services .
With regard to these latter the actors have nothing else to consider than their importance for future want satisfaction .
If a new commodity unheard of before is offered for sale , as was , for instance , the case with radio sets a few decades ago , the only question that matters for the individual is whether or not the satisfaction that the new gadget will provide is greater than that expected from those goods he would have to renounce in order to buy the new thing .
Knowledge about past prices is for the buyer merely a means to reap a consumer 's surplus .
If he were not intent upon this goal , he could , if need be , arrange his purchases without any familiarity with the market prices of the immediate past , which are popularly called present prices .
He could make value judgments without appraisement .
As has been mentioned already , the obliteration of the memory of all prices of the past would not prevent the formation of new exchange ratios between the various vendible things .
But if knowledge about money 's purchasing power were to fade away , the process of developing indirect exchange and media of exchange would have to start anew .
It would become necessary to begin again with employing some goods , more marketable than the rest , as media of exchange .
The demand for these goods would increase and would add to the amount of exchange value derived from their industrial ( nonmonetary ) employment a specific component due to their new use as a medium of exchange .
A value judgment is , with reference to money , only possible if it can be based on appraisement .
The acceptance of a new kind of money presupposes that the thing in question already has previous exchange value on account of the services it can render directly to consumption or production .
Neither a buyer nor a seller could judge the value of a monetary unit if he had no information about its exchange value — its purchasing power — in the immediate past .
The relation between the demand for money and the supply of money , which may be called the money relation , determines the height of purchasing power .
Today 's money relation , as it is shaped on the ground of yesterday 's purchasing power , determines today 's purchasing power .
He who wants to increase his cash holding restricts his purchases and increases his sales and thus brings about a tendency toward falling prices .
He who wants to reduce his cash holding increases his purchases — either for consumption or for production and investment — and restricts his sales ; thus he brings about a tendency toward rising prices .
Changes in the supply of money must necessarily alter the disposition of vendible goods as owned by various individuals and firms .
The quantity of money available in the whole market system cannot increase or decrease otherwise than by first increasing or decreasing the cash holdings of certain individual members .
We may , if we like , assume that every member gets a share of the additional money right at the moment of its inflow into the system , or shares in the reduction of the quantity of money .
But whether we assume this or not , the final result of our demonstration will remain the same .
This result will be that changes in the structure of prices brought about by changes in the supply of money available in the economic system never affect the prices of the various commodities and services to the same extent and at the same date .
Let us assume that the government issues an additional quantity of paper money .
The government plans either to buy commodities and services or to repay debts incurred or to pay interest on such debts .
However this may be , the treasury enters the market with an additional demand for goods and services ; it is now in a position to buy more goods than it could buy before .
The prices of the commodities it buys rise .
If the government had expended in its purchases money collected by taxation , the taxpayers would have restricted their purchases and , while the prices of the goods bought by the government would have risen , those of other goods would have dropped .
But this fall in the prices of the goods the taxpayers used to buy does not occur if the government increases the quantity of money at its disposal without reducing the quantity of money in the hands of the public .
The prices of some commodities — viz. , of those the government buys — rise immediately , while those of the other commodities remain unaltered for the time being .
But the process goes on .
Those selling the commodities asked for by the government are now themselves in a position to buy more than they used previously .
The prices of the things these people are buying in larger quantities therefore rise too .
Thus the boom spreads from one group of commodities and services to other groups until all prices and wage rates have risen .
The rise in prices is thus not synchronous with the various commodities and services .
When eventually , in the further course of the increase in the quantity of money , all prices have risen , the rise does not affect the various commodities and services to the same extent .
For the process has affected the material position of various individuals to different degrees .
While the process is under way , some people enjoy the benefit of higher prices for the goods or services they sell , while the prices of the things they buy have not yet risen or have not risen to the same extent .
On the other hand , there are people who are in the unhappy situation of selling commodities and services whose prices have not yet risen or not in the same degree as the prices of the goods they must buy for their daily consumption .
For the former the progressive rise in prices is a boon , for the latter a calamity .
Besides , the debtors are favored at the expense of the creditors .
When the process once comes to an end , the wealth of various individuals has been affected in different ways and to different degrees .
Some are enriched , some impoverished .
Conditions are no longer what they were before .
The new order of things results in changes in the intensity of demand for various goods .
The mutual ratio of the money prices of the vendible goods and services is no longer the same as before .
The price structure has changed apart from the fact that all prices in terms of money have risen .
The final prices to the establishment of which the market tends after the effects of the increase in the quantity of money have been fully consummated are not equal to the previous final prices multiplied by the same multiplier .
The main fault of the old quantity theory as well as the mathematical economists ' equation of exchange is that they have ignored this fundamental issue .
Changes in the supply of money must bring about changes in other data too .
The market system before and after the inflow or outflow of a quantity of money is not merely changed in that the cash holdings of the individuals and prices have increased or decreased .
There have been effected also changes in the reciprocal exchange ratios between the various commodities and services which , if one wants to resort to metaphors , are more adequately described by the image of price revolution than by the misleading figure of an elevation or a sinking of the price level .
We may at this point disregard the effects brought about by the influence on the content of all deferred payments as stipulated by contracts .
We will deal later with them and with the operation of monetary events on consumption and production , investment in capital goods , and accumulation and consumption of capital .
But even in setting aside all these things , we must never forget that changes in the quantity of money affect prices in an uneven way .
It depends on the data of each particular case at what moment and to what extent the prices of the various commodities and services are affected .
In the course of a monetary expansion ( inflation ) the first reaction is not only that the prices of some of them rise more quickly and more steeply than others .
It may also occur that some fall at first as they are for the most part demanded by those groups whose interests are hurt .
Changes in the money relation are not only caused by governments issuing additional paper money .
An increase in the production of the precious metals employed as money has the same effects although , of course , other classes of the population may be favored or hurt by it .
Prices also rise in the same way if , without a corresponding reduction in the quantity of money available , the demand for money falls because of a general tendency toward a diminution of cash holdings .
The money expended additionally by such a " dishoarding " brings about a tendency toward higher prices in the same way as that flowing from the gold mines or from the printing press .
Conversely , prices drop when the supply of money falls ( e.g. , through a withdrawal of paper money ) or the demand for money increases ( e.g. , through a tendency toward " hoarding , " the keeping of greater cash balances ) .
The process is always uneven and by steps , disproportionate and asymmetrical .
It could be and has been objected that the normal production of the gold mines brought to the market may well entail an increase in the quantity of money , but does not increase the income , still less the wealth , of the owners of the mines .
These people earn only their " normal " income and thus their spending of it cannot disarrange market conditions and the prevailing tendencies toward the establishment of final prices and the equilibrium of the evenly rotating economy .
For them , the annual output of the mines does not mean an increase in riches and does not impel them to offer higher prices .
They will continue to live at the standard at which they used to live before .
Their spending within these limits will not revolutionize the market .
Thus the normal amount of gold production , although certainly increasing the quantity of money available , cannot put into motion the process of depreciation .
It is neutral with regard to prices .
As against this reasoning one must first of all observe that within a progressing economy in which population figures are increasing and the division of labor and its corollary , industrial specialization , are perfected , there prevails a tendency toward an increase in the demand for money .
Additional people appear on the scene and want to establish cash holdings .
The extent of economic self - sufficiency , i.e. , of production for the household 's own needs , shrinks and people become more dependent upon the market ; this will , by and large , impel them to increase their holding of cash .
Thus the price - raising tendency emanating from what is called the " normal " gold production encounters a price - cutting tendency emanating from the increased demand for cash holding .
However , these two opposite tendencies do not neutralize each other .
Both processes take their own course , both result in a disarrangement of existing social conditions , making some people richer , some people poorer .
Both affect the prices of various goods at different dates and to a different degree .
It is true that the rise in the prices of some commodities caused by one of these processes can finally be compensated by the fall caused by the other process .
It may happen that at the end some or many prices come back to their previous height .
But this final result is not the outcome of an absence of movements provoked by changes in the money relation .
It is rather the outcome of the joint effect of the coincidence of two processes independent of each other , each of which brings about alterations in the market data as well as in the material conditions of various individuals and groups of individuals .
The new structure of prices may not differ very much from the previous one .
But it is the resultant of two series of changes which have accomplished all inherent social transformations .
The fact that the owners of gold mines rely upon steady yearly proceeds from their gold production does not cancel the newly mined gold 's impression upon prices .
The owners of the mines take from the market , in exchange for the gold produced , the goods and services required for their mining and the goods needed for their consumption and their investments in other lines of production .
If they had not produced this amount of gold , prices would not have been affected by it .
It is beside the point that they have anticipated the future yield of the mines and capitalized it and that they have adjusted their standard of living to the expectation of steady proceeds from the mining operations .
The effects which the newly mined gold exercises on their expenditure and on that of those people whose cash holdings step by step it enters later begin only at the instant this gold is available in the hands of the mine owners .
If , in the expectation of future yields , they had expended money at an earlier date and the expected yield failed to appear , conditions would not differ from other cases in which consumption was financed by credit based on expectations not realized by later events .
Changes in the extent of the desired cash holding of various people neutralize one another only to the extent that they are regularly recurring and mutually connected by a causal reciprocity .
Salaried people and wage earners are not paid daily , but at certain pay days for a period of one or several weeks .
They do not plan to keep their cash holding within the period between pay days at the same level ; the amount of cash in their pockets declines with the approach of the next pay day .
On the other hand , the merchants who supply them with the necessities of life increase their cash holdings concomitantly .
The two movements condition each other ; there is a causal interdependence between them which harmonizes them both with regard to time and to quantitative amount .
Neither the dealer nor his customer lets himself be influenced by these recurrent fluctuations .
Their plans concerning cash holding as well as their business operations and their spending for consumption respectively have the whole period in view and take it into account as a whole .
It was this phenomenon that led economists to the image of a regular circulation of money and to the neglect of the changes in the individuals ' cash holdings .
However , we are faced with a concatenation which is limited to a narrow , neatly circumscribed field .
Only as far as the increase in the cash holding of one group of people is temporally and quantitatively related to the decrease in the cash holding of another group and as far as these changes are self - liquidating within the course of a period which the members of both groups consider as a whole in planning their cash holding , can the neutralization take place .
Beyond this field there is no question of such a neutralization .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Median home prices fell a record 15.6 % during the three months ended June 30 , compared to the same period in 2008 , according to an industry report .
There is good news though :
The survey from the National Association of Realtors reported the median home price rose 4 % compared to the first quarter of 2009 -- to $ 174,100 from $ 167,300 .
The increase in median price was not a surprise , representing , as it did , the traditionally strong spring selling season .
But the jump did offer the prospect that the worst of the price declines may be behind us .
" With low interest rates , lower home prices and a first - time buyer tax credit , we 've been seeing healthy increases in home sales , which are a hopeful sign for the economy , " said Lawrence Yun , NAR 's chief economist ..
In the vast majority of metro areas -- 129 out of 155 -- median prices dropped year - over - year .
Some of the decline can be traced to an increase in the percentage of foreclosures and short sales .
They accounted for 36 % of all transactions during the quarter .
These " distressed properties " are usually sold at discounts of at least 15 % compared with traditional sales .
Patrick Newport , a real estate analyst for IHS Global Insight , while admitting the year - over - year results are still awful , said recent evidence indicates that prices are stabilizing .
" The state sales data show sales picking up across the country , " he said .
Newport expects prices and sales to trend down again , especially when the impact of the first - time homebuyers tax credit starts to fade .
The credit ends December 1 .
" Afterward , sales will take a hit , " he said .
His forecast is for prices to drop another 5 % this year , driven down by added inventory as the foreclosure plague continues to worsen .
Cheapest and priciest areas
The Cape Coral metro area in Florida recorded the largest decline : 52.8 % to $ 84,000 .
Davenport , Iowa , had the biggest gain : 30.6 % to $ 113,200 .
The lowest priced market in the nation is now Saginaw , Mich. , where the median home sold for $ 55,700 during the quarter , a 30.6 % drop over last year .
The most expensive market was Honolulu , with a median price of $ 569,500 -- although that 's still a 10.5 % discount from a year ago .
San Jose , Calif . led all mainland cities at $ 500,000 but that was still down a whopping 33.8 % from a year ago .
Condo market
Condo prices have taken an even more severe beating .
They fell 19.8 % year - over - year , but rose 3.6 % quarter - over - quarter .
If you 're in the market for a condo in Las Vegas , you may never find a better time .
Prices dropped 54.1 % compared with the second quarter of 2008 and fell 11.7 % between the first and second quarters of 2009 .
The median price now stands at a bargain basement $ 66,400 .
Condo prices rose year - over - year in only four of 61 metro areas surveyed by NAR .
The biggest gain was in Virginia Beach , where prices went up 2.8 % .
Wichita , Kan. ( 2 % ) , Dallas ( 0.7 % ) and Colorado Springs ( 0.2 % ) were the only other gainers .
The most expensive condo market was San Francisco , where the median price was $ 405,700 , down 22.5 % from a year ago .
Las Vegas was the cheapest condo market by far , with Reno a distant second at $ 103,100 .
Tim Pawlenty : I Might Invoke the 10th Amendment to Stop Health Care Reform
Created : September 10 , 2009 22:24 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
On a Thursday night Republican Governors Association conference call with conservative activists , moderated by Erick Erickson of RedState , Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R - Minn . ) broached the possibility of “ asserting the 10th Amendment ” to keep Minnesota from fully participating in a health care plan passed by Congress and signed by President Obama .
The 10th Amendment reads :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
The question from the caller : “ I want to know if any of the governors are willing to invoke the 10th Amendment if the health care bill is passed . ”
Pawlenty ’s answer , below the fold :
Thank you for the question .
It ’s a great question .
I do n’t think the nation ’s had a proper federalism debate since Ronald Reagan raised the issue regularly in the 1980s .
And by federalism of course we mean the proper relationship between the federal government and the states , trained as a cornerstone around the 10th Amendment .
I believe that amendment has been discounted to the point of making me very sad .
Depending on what the federal government comes out with here , asserting the 10th Amendment might be viable option , but we do n’t know the details .
As one of the other callers said , we ca n’t really even get the president to outline what he does or does n’t support in any detail .
So we ’ll have to see .
I ’d say that ’s a possibility .
You ’re starting to see more governors , including me , and specifically Gov. Perry from Texas , and most Republican governors express concern around these issues and get more aggressive about asserting and bringing up the 10th Amendment .
So I think we could see hopefully a resurgence of those claims and maybe even lawsuits if need be .
More Pawlenty on Obama here .
Andy Barr has more on the call .

A Los Angeles medical marijuana dispensary that was raided four years ago by police could receive $ 186,416 after a panel of federal appeals judges ruled Tuesday that the government could not seize the cash .
The three judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the federal government could not prove the money was tied to illegal sales .
On March 15 , 2005 , a police officer visited the United Medical Caregivers Clinic .
Staff provided paperwork to show it was operating under the state ’s medical marijuana law .
When the department applied for a search warrant , it failed to disclose that information .
Police seized the cash in a raid , but no charges were filed .

Scott Feil , the clinic ’s chief executive , filed a motion to reclaim the money and suppress evidence from the warrant .
A federal district court found the warrant affidavit was “ misleading , ” but a forfeiture judgment was entered .
Feil appealed .
Barred from using evidence from the search , the government primarily relied on a declaration from Feil .
But the appellate panel said the declaration could not be used because it stemmed from “ illegal activity ” by Los Angeles police .

IN WHAT many commuters will see as a fitting end to its decade running Melbourne 's rail system , the last train Connex will run is to be replaced by a bus .
Connex - which began running trains in Melbourne in 1999 when Victoria 's railways were privatised - will hand over the rundown network to new operator Metro Trains in the early hours of Monday .
But due to track works around Laverton station , the final Connex service in operation will be a bus , leaving Newport station at 12.32 am .
'' The irony is apparent , '' said Connex spokesman John Rees , in his final day in the job .
'' For anyone who wants to look at the more positive aspect of it , it shows we are doing a lot of track work at the moment . ''
Just came across this highlight from the November 14th game between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics .
In it TJ Ford gets pretty acrobatic on a steal and keeps up his acrobatic ways all the way down the court for a score .
The person who posted the video even points out that he looks a lot like Spiderman while going down the court .
And you know what ?
He ’s right .
Why were only a select few people warned ?
How many lives would have been saved if everyone had received this warning ?
Were Port Authority staff told to stay in the buildings ?
If so , why ?
In all , 16 workers waited on the 64th floor and weighed escape options after a hijacked jetliner cut through the skin of the north tower about 30 stories above them .
The rest of the floor had cleared out 30 minutes earlier .
Why the 16 stayed is open to question .
Only McMillan and co-worker Pasquale Buzzelli survived .
Some say the group was instructed to stay by the Port Authority police , even though radio transcripts show the Port Authority 's commanding officer at the World Trade Center , Capt .
Anthony Whitaker , ordered a full evacuation of the complex a minute before a second hijacked jetliner struck the south tower .
On instructions from the Port Authority , McMillan declines to discuss why she stayed .

Why were firefighters in the impact zone of WTC 2 unaware that the building was going to collapse ?
They should have been the ones reporting this information , instead they reported only isolated fires immediately before the building 's collapse .
Isolated fires do not bring down steel framed buildings .
Have a listen to the radio transmissions of North Brunswick Volunteer Fire / Ladder Company # 3 on 9/11 .
Hear the shock , anguish and suffering as the WTC buildings came to ground .
Why did n't these firefighters receive notice that the buildings were going to collapse ?

" This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center .

While officials in specific municipalities have weighed in frequently about Colorado 's medical - marijuana law in light of the current dispensary boom , plenty of state officials have done their best to skirt this weed patch of an issue thus far -- creating a vacuum for Colorado Attorney General John Suthers , who has taken up the cause in a big way .
But during his appearance on KHOW 's Caplis and Silverman yesterday afternoon , he leavened his calls for new regulation with an acknowledgment that a growing number of folks may prefer fewer rules to more of them .
Suthers noted that he opposed the medical - marijuana law that passed nine years ago , warning at the time that the legislation was written so broadly that it could cause the very type of confusion about what 's allowed and what 's not that 's come to pass in recent months .
Likewise , he argued that the goal of advocates has always been the legalization of marijuana for all uses , not just the medical kind .
What he's not sure of today , though , is whether the majority of Colorado voters now back the lifting of all pot sanctions .
He certainly does n't .
He talked up crimes at dispensaries without making reference to specific incidents -- although he did say that some clients apparently do n't like to pay for their ganja .
He also used the old gateway argument , maintaining that drug abusers he 's spoken with who began smoking marijuana ( and drinking alcohol ) around age twelve or thirteen were often riding the meth pony five years down the line .
He also touched on various remedies , ranging from a tightening of dispensary guidelines by state legislators to a ballot measure that could do the reps ' job for them .
As for marijuana legalization , he pointed to the example of Alaska , which he said tightened up edicts that had previously been loosened after noticing a rise in assorted social ills .
He hopes Colorado residents wo n't have to learn the same hard lessons , but he admitted that such an outcome is possible .
Just not preferable -- at least from his point of view .
Smoke on that .
Sydney protest against the Afghanistan war , October 8 , 2009 , organised by the Stop the War Coalition .
See Malalai Joya 's message to the protesters below the interview .
Malalai Joya interviewed by Steven Littlewood
October 9 , 2009 -- Malalai Joya has been described as “ the bravest woman in Afghanistan ” .
A long - term opponent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) presence in her country , Malalai Joya first rose to prominence through a heartfelt and controversial speech in 2003 that was an indictment of the powerful positions gifted to Afghan warlords by the US - led coalition .
She was elected to the Afghan parliament in 2005 and continued her campaign against war criminals and fundamentalists there until being suspended in 2007 for criticising fellow MPs .
Activists Noam Chomsky and Naomi Klein are amongst those who have called for her reinstatement .
In spite of four attempts on her life and having to live under constant protection , Joya continues her campaign against the government of Hamid Karzai , its fundamentalist allies and its Western backers .
I spoke to her during the recent presidential election , which is still in contention and has been condemned by international observers .
* * *
You were thrown out of parliament for attacking the war criminals and religious extremists that make up a large proportion of the current Afghan MPs .
How were so many of these people elected and why do more MPs not speak out against them ?
The 2005 elections were held with the participation of the most infamous warlords and drug lords in the county .
It was a rigged election under the shadow of the guns , threats and money of these criminals and therefore many of what I call the dirty elements entered the parliament .
They are hated among the people , but because they had power and arms they threatened the people to vote for them .
There is a saying that it is not so much who votes that is important but who counts the votes , and all the ballot boxes in Afghanistan were in the criminals ' hands .
Crucially , the corrupt extremist candidates were also strongly supported by the US and other countries like Iran and Pakistan and therefore their chances of success were quite high .
So when you ask why more MPs do not speak out against these extremists , it is because the majority of the parliamentarians are fundamentalists and also because some MPs will simply collaborate with such criminals for their own benefit .
There are a handful of parliamentarians who are against the extremists but they are afraid of being killed and therefore they do not dare to speak out .
During the initial invasion , the NATO strategy was to deal with the Northern Alliance in order to oust the Taliban .
You have since attacked this as being detrimental to the development of genuine democracy in Afghanistan .
Do you think it is possible for any government in Afghanistan to oppose both the warlords and the Taliban and still maintain stability ?
Of course I believe this strategy has been detrimental to democracy because the Northern Alliance are just another set of terrorists like the Taliban and they share the same mindset .
Both are fundamentalists with a heavy criminal past .
They are harshly anti-freedom , anti-democratic and anti-women .
The Northern Alliance has a long list of crimes to its name , like raping , looting , killing and bombing during their regime in the 1990s .
They have been even worse than Taliban in wounding our people .
A stable government without the Taliban is possible only if we have a democratic , secular and independent government that is not beholden to the US or any other foreign power .
Unfortunately , since the democratic forces have been trampled and are very weak in Afghanistan , they cannot offer a strong alternative .
Stability will only be achieved if our democratic forces join hands with like - minded people around the world to raise a powerful voice and uproot every brand of fundamentalism , whether Northern Alliance or Taliban , and pave the road towards a democratic and prosperous Afghanistan .
The new NATO commander in Afghanistan , General McCousins , has said that coalition strategy will now shift its emphasis from attacking insurgents to protecting civilians .
How do you think public opinion in Afghanistan will respond to this move ?
The Afghan public has lost its trust and interest in such false words .
In the first days of the invasion US President George W. Bush also said that the war would not harm civilians and many high - ranking Afghan and foreign officials have been repeating this over the last eight years .
But on the ground we can see that civilians are being killed and injured by foreign troops .
Civilians killed by the foreign troops are entering the thousands , whereas killings by the Taliban are not even in the hundreds .
That is why people believe the US war is against them and not the Taliban , which is stronger than before while the people 's sufferings have increased with every passing day .
Our people are fed up , and such small changes in war tactics will not win the “ hearts and minds ” of our people .
In your book , Raising My Voice , you call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan .
Yet with a resurgent Taliban and an under - resourced security force how can you be sure the country will not collapse into civil war ?
The country is already in a war and things can't get any worse .
Our people are suffering from war , poverty , unemployment , lack of healthcare facilities , corruption in the state and non-existence of justice , just to name a few of the problems .
The foreign troops are fighting the Taliban but as a result of this the civilians suffer greatly .
The foreign troops can bomb and raid homes any time they want .
While this is happening the Taliban continue to carry out their attacks , mostly through suicide bombers or roadside bombs , and on top of all that people also suffer at the hands of local warlords who loot , murder and rape with no fear of prosecution .
So we have a total of three enemies attacking our people from all sides .
The withdrawal of troops simply means the removal of one enemy and this is obviously in the interest of our people .
There is a high probability of the Taliban winning power again should foreign troops withdraw it is true .
However , there is another force here that should n't be forgotten which is the democratic people in our country .
If the US and other countries like Iran , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stop backing fundamentalists then democratic forces will be able to defeat these dirty criminals and decide the fate of their country .
There is no doubt that this will be a very difficult struggle and will not be achieved in the near future .
However , democracy comes with a price and cannot be simply donated .
Our people are ready to pay this price and get out of the hell - like situation of our country .
You have cited the current unrest in Iran as an example of how a grassroots movement for change can emerge without military intervention .
How important will the success or failure of the Iranian protests be to the cause of democracy in Afghanistan ?
The success or failure of Iranian protests is very important for Afghanistan because our two countries are closely connected .
Besides being linguistically and culturally similar , the same fundamentalists rule both nations .
If you look at our history , Iran has had , and still has , a long hand in Afghanistan 's affairs .
They have always wanted to impose their influence , especially by nourishing Shiite Islam through their lackeys .
In the past eight years , Iran has been deeply involved in our government and has many stooges , one of them being Karim Khalili , vice - president of Karzai .
Every voice raised in Iran against their fundamentalist and criminal regime is supported by me , because a victory for democracy there will give an amplified voice to our own people in Afghanistan .
Finally , which , if any , of the presidential candidates in the 2009 election did you support ?
Do any of the major players offer any hope of change ?
I did not support any candidate because everyone knows in Afghanistan that the winner is already been selected by the White House and the election merely gives him legitimacy .
We know that the election is just a mockery of democracy .
Considering that the vice - presidents of Karzai are the criminals Fahim and Khalili , it is apparent that any elections will be held with corruption in full vigour .
The presidential campaigns are run with dollars , guns and threats .
Even a change in government would just mean a new puppet replacing the old one .
Our people have a famous proverb that it will be the ``same donkey but with a new saddle ' '!

Malalai Joya : ` Democracy can't be donated to a nation through occupation , cluster bombs and air raids '
Below is Malalai Joya 's message to Australian anti-war campaigners .
It was read out at the Australian protests against the Afghanistan war held on October 7 .
I would like to thank you for your solidarity with the suffering and ill - fated Afghan people and for raising your voice against the wrong and devastating policies of your government in Afghanistan .
Eight years ago , the US and its allies occupied Afghanistan under the nice slogans of “ democracy ” , “ women ’s rights ” and “ freedom ” , but today we are as far from these values as we were in 2001 .
Days after the invasion , the brutal regime of the Taliban was toppled but another bunch of terrorist warlords of the Northern Alliance , who are no different from the Taliban , were supported by the West and imposed on our people .
Democracy can't be donated to a nation through occupation , cluster bombs and air raids .
The horrible condition of Iraq and Afghanistan today proves this .
In Afghanistan every day we are mourning civilian casualties as a result of the US / NATO bombardments .
In my own hometown , more than 150 civilians , many of them women and children , were brutally killed when the US warplanes dropped 2000 - pound bombs .
The dropping of thousands of cluster bombs and the use of depleted - uranium and white phosphorus in bombs rained on Afghanistan have caused terrible environmental and health problems in my country .
The people of Australia should know that the people of Afghanistan want peace , liberation and democracy , but the current occupation is exactly against these values , and has doubled our miseries and problems .
Your government puts the lives of your soldiers in danger to protect US interests in Afghanistan .
So you should continue to put pressure on your government to pull out of Afghanistan .
Under the noses of thousands of US and NATO troops , millions of Afghans suffer from insecurity , injustice , corruption , severe poverty and unemployment .
Afghan women and children are the prime victims of this catastrophic situation .
Rape , mistreatment and other forms of violence against women are increasing rapidly , but a reign of impunity prevails across Afghanistan for the warlords and drug lords .
The “ war on terror ” is in fact a war against Afghan people .
Since 2001 , NATO and the US have changed Afghanistan into the world capital of opium .
Opium production has increased by 4500 % .
Today Afghanistan is a mafia state and drug traffickers hold the highest positions in the puppet government .
The anti-occupation sentiment is very high among our people today .
Only those nations who liberate themselves can be free and we are ready to give any sacrifices for our freedom .
We are happy that , although Western governments bomb us , the great and peace - loving people of these countries stand in solidarity with us and raise their voices against the wrong doings of their governments .
Your solidarity and support give us encouragement and determination to fight for justice and true democracy in Afghanistan until the end .

The mass loss is probably driven by processes occurring on the coast
The East Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass for the last three years , according to an analysis of data from a gravity - measuring satellite mission .
The scientists involved say they are " surprised " by the finding , because the giant East Antarctic sheet , unlike the west , has been thought to be stable .
Other scientists say ice loss could not yet be pinned on climate change , and uncertainties in the data are large .
The US - based team reports its findings in the journal Nature Geoscience .
The data comes from Nasa 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( Grace ) mission .
It energises me as a scientist , but I 'm not convinced that as yet it should energise anyone else
Professor Richard Alley Grace has previously shown that the smaller West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are losing mass .
These two bodies of ice contain enough water to raise sea levels by about six to seven metres ( 20 ft ) each if they melted completely .
Melting the East Antarctic sheet would raise sea levels by much more - about 50 - 60 m .
But scientists have generally discounted the possibility of it happening because the region is so cold .
The Grace measurements suggest there was no net ice loss between 2002 and 2006 .
But since then , East Antarctica has been losing 57 billion tonnes ( Gt ) per year .
" We felt surprised to see this change in East Antarctica , " study leader Jianli Chen from the Centre for Space Research at the University of Texas in Austin told BBC News .
The loss still looks small by contrast with West Antarctica , which is losing 132 Gt per year , and with Greenland , where a recent analysis combining Grace data with other measurements indicated an annual figure of 273 Gt .
Previous Grace analyses - and those from other satellites - had given an inconclusive picture for the giant ice body .
The twin Grace satellites fly in close formation , detecting minute changes in the Earth 's gravity through the marginal changes this causes in their relative positions .
Eastern energy Measuring Antarctic ice loss is a tricky issue because the continent itself is rising and deforming .
Its ice cover was significantly thicker during the last Ice Age ; as the ice melted , the weight pressing down on the rock abated , and the rock is " isostatically rebounding " .
Readings from satellite missions have to be adjusted to allow for this rebound - and that is one source of uncertainty when trying to assess the significance of the new research , according to Richard Alley , one of the world 's leading glaciologists .
" The first thing is that lots of this is dependent on the isostatic [ rebound ] model , and ( recent work has ) cast some doubt on the istostatic models that people are using , " commented the Penn State University researcher ( who was not involved in the paper ) .
" And then you get into the age - old question of ' is it climate or is it weather ? '
" So it energises me as a scientist , but I 'm not convinced that as yet it should energise anyone else . "
Rising potential
The Grace data gives a picture of where ice is being lost across the continent ; and these areas are mainly on the coast .
It is not clear what physical processes could be driving any loss of mass here , although it is not simply melting due to high air temperatures , because temperatures are well below zero .
One clue could lie in research published last year by Leigh Stearns and colleagues , showing that lakes under the ice sheet can periodically overflow , with the liquid water then acting as a lubricant to speed glaciers on their way towards the sea .
The Grace satellites provide a twin eye on gravity at the Earth 's surface Commenting on the new research , Dr Stearns told BBC News : " In these coastal regions the ice loss could be driven by some interaction with the oceans or some weather patterns , or it could be a sub - glacial lake that drained and caused some thinning - so it might not be climate - related .
" It 's easy to jump to the conclusion that it 's exceptional because it 's the first time we 've recorded it , but we do need a baseline of how things have been in the past so we do need to be cautious , " said the University of Kansas researcher .
" Nevertheless , it awakens us to the fact that the East Antarctic sheet is more dynamic than we thought , and we do need to pay attention to it because its potential for sea level rise is so much greater than in West Antarctica or Greenland . "
Dr Chen said that one of his team was currently conducting airborne surveys of one of the regions where mass loss had been detected , hoping to shed some light on the mechanisms involved .

Norman Rockwell , Girl At the Mirror ( 1954 )
Norman Rockwell ( 1894 -1978 ) was a famous American illustrator who enjoyed enormous popularity in the middle of the 20th Century .
His output was large , comprising some 4,000 works , the best known being illustrations produced for the Saturday Evening Post .
For many Americans he set the standard for illustration - cum - painting , providing them with a regular art exhibition in their own homes .
He developed an impressive , almost photographic technique , capable of tackling any subject matter , but particularly the human figure in its natural setting in small town America .
Had he lived in the Netherlands in the 16th Century , it is not too far fetched to imagine him representing peasant life in the manner of Pieter Bruegel the Elder .
With this comparison we can pose the question : why is Bruegel revered as one of the world ’s greatest painters while Rockwell is barely admitted into the pantheon of 20th Century American painters ?
Robert Hughes , author of American Visions : The Epic History of Art in America , says :
By 1925 Rockwell was a national name , and by the end of the Depression [ Rockwell ] was an institution .
Very few people saw his original work , only in the form of reproductions , but this is often the case today when famous works of art are readily available in art books or on computer screens .
Hughes dismisses Rockwell as “ homelier than apple pie , more American than the flag , and more affirmative than Dad . ”
It is obvious that Rockwell was almost completely unaffected by the revolutionary developments in painting that occurred during his lifetime .
Edward Hopper ( 1882 – 1967 ) was a near contemporary painter who also represented American life in a realist manner , albeit with some degree of abstraction , expressing a polar opposite in feeling to Rockwell ’s oeuvre .
Hopper ’s figures manifest coldness , alienation , separateness , and uncertainty while Rockwell ’s are cheerful , sociable and full of warmth .
Most artists in the 20th Century have found it necessary to distance themselves from mainstream society , whereas Rockwell placed himself at the very heart of middle American values , allowing himself just a few humorous digs now and then at the naivety of the young or the conservatism of the older generation .
He was , therefore , very much an insider to his large audience while being excluded from the avant - garde of American artists .
This type of criticism pertains to subject matter rather than purely aesthetic values .
It is clear that Rockwell , consciously or not , was a propagandist for the culture of small town America , and was constrained in his choice of subject matter by the editors of the Saturday Evening Post .
He had a job to do and he did it well , using a highly developed technique .
If we examine Rockwell ’s best work , it is evident that he was a master of composition , a subtle colourist and an excellent draftsman of the human figure .
In addition , he was an acute social observer whose eye for detail was obsessive and nearly pathological .
Unlike the Victorian moralist painters , such as Holman Hunt and Everett Millais , Rockwell ’s sentimentality is often muted or restrained .
Behind his work there is a second , hidden meaning that counteracts the more obvious messages of patriotism and the goodness of American folks .
Rockwell ’s people do n’t know a great deal but they want to learn and help their fellow human beings .
Clearly , Norman Rockwell had faith in the goodness of human nature and was , to that extent , an optimist .
Norman Rockwell , Saying Grace ( 1951 )
Rockwell ’s works were often complex in construction as well as very detailed .
In the painting Saying Grace ( 1951 ) , the colours are muted browns through to black , with a few dusty reds on the seats of the chairs .
The umbrellas tell us it is raining outside , confirmed by the grey of the almost invisible monochrome street seen through the restaurant window .
The inclusion of three partial figures cleverly suggests movement , as customers move about the rather homely café .
In the foreground , an older woman sits opposite two youths , head bowed in prayer ; her grandson ( we may assume ) perches beside her in a likewise manner .
The crocodile skin bag , umbrella and fedora by them and the jacket draped over the window seat suggest a departure of some sort ; perhaps they just saw Dad off to war .
There is a story here –the smoking youth looks on curiously , and we realize that saying grace is no longer practiced by the younger generation .
The other onlookers seem similarly surprised by this public act of piety .
In the messy , claustrophobic space , the chairs are put to good use defining the depth of the room , as is the table at which the nearest diner sits , with his cutlery leading the eye to the old lady .
The realism of Saying Grace is not only photographic in its rendering of the luggage , the table condiments and the food scraps but the painting achieves a naturalness of bodily and facial expression in the subjects as well .
Edward Hopper , Office By Night ( 1945 )
Edward Hopper ’s Office by Night ( 1940 ) shows a man and his secretary working late .
The large expanse of white wall and the impersonal office furnishings create a disturbing atmosphere .
As in Rockwell ’s work , objects like the typewriter are treated in realistic if rather clunky detail .
The surface meaning of the painting is clear from the voluptuous treatment of the secretary ’s body , which stands in stark contrast to the severe angularity of the filing cabinet .
She looks out at the viewer rather than the man at his desk , who appears to be studying some papers .
The office partition , with its open doorway suggests a confessional or an invitation to enter the alcove or to simply go home .
The open window into the night removes the possibility of an intimate encounter .
There is a great deal more ambiguity with Hopper than with Rockwell , but neither should be taken at face value .
Rockwell ’s world does not hide poverty or the problems of old age or youth , but provides comfort that the world shown is probably not as bad as it seems .
Hopper , on the other hand , expresses the unsatisfactoriness of modern life with no comfort for the viewer whatsoever .
Despite the sparseness of Hopper ’s “ office ” and the rather unpleasant browns and greens , the abstract arrangement of the various rectangles provides great strength to the design , leaving Rockwell ’s restaurant rather weak and cluttered by comparison .
While Rockwell demonstrates superior technical ability , Hopper displays the virtues of simplification so rigorously worked out by the discipline of abstract painting .
He provides enough subtlety to satisfy the eye : the shadow on the blind with its faint creases ; the shadows on the carpet and from the desk lamp ; and the mysterious reflection on the wall behind the figures that suggest a light source coming from behind the viewer .
Rockwell has been compared to Charles Dickens ; Hopper ’s paintings are more like Kafka .
This comparison between the two suggests that Hopper stands higher in the American pantheon of painters than Norman Rockwell because he places more emphasis on the aesthetic values he derived from Manet and Degas , and perhaps Andrew Wyeth .
Hopper ’s work also influenced later generations of American painters , whereas Rockwell less so ; Rockwell ’s influence was , and still is , on illustrators .
Norman Rockwell , The Homecoming Marine ( 1945 )
One of Rockwell ’s best - known works , entitled The Homecoming ( 1943 ) , perfectly conveys the idea of social cohesion , and togetherness , common to American culture .
A young marine has returned from the Japanese War , and we see from the newspaper cutting on the wall that he is a local hero .
His expression is worried and uncertain , perhaps because of the horrors he has seen or because he must return to the front again .
There is no hint about the wider meaning of the war , just the suggestion that the young hero is serving the community he has briefly rejoined , represented by his circle of companions .
This is not triumphalism but a more rueful reflection on the realities of a country at war .
If the work contains elements of propaganda , then it is understated .
We may assume the young boys in the picture , after serving as Boy Scouts , will go to war in Korea without a second thought .
The pictorial design is excellent ; the viewer ’s eye is guided by a diagonal line that runs from the red of the flag to the star on the wall .
Also , if you draw an arrow through the eyes of the small boy at the front , the hero and the guy on the bench it leads straight to the eyes on the poster on the wall .
The remaining colours are muted , and nary an Old Glory in sight .
Let me also point out here that Rockwell contributed to the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s with pictures like Southern Justice ( 1965 ) , which would have influenced many people in his vast audience to vote in favour of integration .
Pieter Bruegel , Peasant Dance ( 1945 )
The rather unfair question posed at the beginning of this essay was why Pieter Breugel , who illustrated the life and times of the common people , was a better painter than Norman Rockwell .
The painting shown above is entitled , Peasant Dance .
The villagers are socializing in a rather hedonistic way , but the painter has made no attempt to empathize with these clodhoppers , depicting their good cheer and peevishness in an equally unbiased manner .
This is certainly realism , right down to the broken jug handle in the foreground , and those carefully rendered oak leaves that are easily recognizable .
Notable design features are the angle of the roof carried through the angle of the bagpipes and the piper ’s leg , taking the eye through to the pattern of the black shoes .
The running couple in the foreground move into the picture from right to left along this diagonal path .
Notice also the repetition of the yellow of the apron on the gable of the distant house , the same spatial device used by Rockwell in The Homecoming .
The many patches of white linen catch the eye and make it dance about , contributing to the motion of the dancing figures .
Finally , the range and depth of colouring and tone contributes to the mass of the figures , and the earthiness of peasant life .
The question can now be put .
Regardless of the fame of the artist or financial value of the work , which painter ’s work would you like to have on your wall : Rockwell , Hopper or Breugel ?
The criteria for such a decision are many but in the end it comes down to gut feeling plus acquired artistic taste .
All the paintings referred to are available in reproduction , so the choice is a real possibility .
Maybe Rockwell ’s lasting contribution to American culture was that he documented best what average Americans thought of themselves in the first half of the 20th Century .
Norman Rockwell was perhaps the greatest American illustrator of his age , but an artist who sacrificed his exceptional talents to conformist ideas and the constraints of commercial publishing .
However , he would have been gratified to learn that The Homecoming was sold in 2006 for $ 9.2 m , a fact that may carry more weight with some than its artistic merits deserve .

He 's definitely the top player in this group .
Colorado College recruit Jaden Scwartz is next .
Not only is he having a very strong year in Tri-City , but I wonder if his brother 's success at Colorado College this year is helping prove their success in Saskatchewan was n't just because of weak competition .
On the topic of smaller guys that score a ton , how is Sahir Gill not listed at all ?
That 's very surprising .
His linemate , Russian Andrei Kuchin has had some red flags in the past , but if you 're basing this list on draft eligible talent , I think he'd have to be on there as well .
Central Scouting has UMD recruit Justin Faulk at 4th on their list .
This is probably the highest I 've seen anybody rank him so far ( though inevitably , he 's probably going to start being ranked high by everybody after this ) .
He 's a really athletic kid and has put up some really impressive offensive numbers .
He 's just a shade under 6 ' tall , in a draft that is loaded with very tall , very mobile defensemen , but if he keeps playing well , I could see him holding onto that spot .
Michigan recruit Jon Merrill is 7th on the list , and the sixth defenseman listed , which is quite a bit lower than many people have him .
Northern Michigan recruit Ryan Daugherty is 15th on the list in his second year of draft eligibility .
Central Scouting seems to love this kid-- they had him as an ' A ' prospect at the start of last year -- but he never ended up getting drafted .
Denver 's Jason Zucker is at 18 , which strikes me as way , way too low .
Now granted , some of this could maybe be explained because Merrill and Zucker both played in the World U18s last year , and some people saw them play there and have n't seen the other US kids as much , which is why they rank Merrill and Zucker so much higher , but Zucker is a better player than where he is listed .
No real surprises among the goalies .
The top three will probably get taken somewhere in the draft .
It was 4 p.m. on a recent Friday — a time of the week when I usually relax and leave the rest of my to - do list to finish over the weekend .
But as this recent weekend approached , I kept pushing myself , heart pumping , to get to the bottom of my list of planned tasks for the week .
After years of working on and off throughout most weekends , I was trying a new approach by taking off at least one entire day every weekend this month , away from reporting , writing and all other work .
Early on , I hated it .
As simple as it seemed , sticking to a time - off plan stressed me out at first .
What I did n't see right away was that my little test was forcing me to improve the way I work .
Amid layoffs and burgeoning workloads , it seems , working any time , all the time , has become a habit .
A survey of 605 U.S. workers last spring by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 70 % of employees work beyond scheduled time and on weekends ; more than half blame " self - imposed pressure . "
Now , new research suggests some have reached the point where a paradoxical truth applies :
To get more done , we need to stop working so much .
Work & Family Mailbox Being Your Own Boss Down Time Sticking to a schedule of predictable time off can lead to improved productivity .
Here are some steps to get started :
Agree on future goals with your boss and coworkers .
Plan for deadlines far in advance .
Set , and focus on , top hourly , daily or weekly priorities .
Cooperate with coworkers to back each other up .
A groundbreaking four - year study , set for publication in the October issue of Harvard Business Review , seems to confirm that getting away from work can yield unexpected on - the - job benefits .
When members of 12 consulting teams at Boston Consulting Group were each required to take a block of " predictable time off " during every work week , " we had to practically force some professionals " to get away , says Leslie Perlow , the Harvard Business School leadership professor who headed the study .
But the results surprised Harvard researchers and Boston Consulting executives alike .
Working together to make sure each consultant got some time off forced teams to communicate better , share more personal information and forge closer relationships .
They also had to do a better job at planning ahead and streamlining work , which in some cases resulted in improved client service , based on interviews with clients .
Boston Consulting is so pleased with the outcome that the firm is rolling out a similar teaming strategy over the coming year on many new U.S. and some overseas projects , says Grant Freeland , senior partner and managing director of the firm 's Boston office .
" We have found real value in this , " he says .
" It really changes how we do our work . "
Other companies are putting the brakes on work in other ways .
At KPMG , a professional - services firm , managers use " wellness scorecards " to track whether employees are working too much overtime or skipping vacation , a spokesman says .
At Fenwick & West , a Silicon Valley law firm , " workflow coordinators " review attorneys ' hours to avert overload .
And at Bobrick Washroom Equipment , North Hollywood , Calif. , a 500 - employee manufacturer , staffers are expected to leave in time for dinner .
" If you walk around here at 5:30 , there are going to be very few lights on , and that 's what we expect , " says Mark Louchheim , president .
He sees family dinners together as important to the well - being of employees and their children , and he also believes setting limits on work motivates people to work smarter .
In the Boston Consulting study , most of the four - or five - member teams were asked to guarantee each consultant one uninterrupted evening free each week after 6 p.m. , away from BlackBerrys and all contact with work .
Each team held weekly meetings to talk about the time - off plans , work processes and what consultants called " tummy rumbles " — gut worries or concerns about their project .
Requiring hard - driving consultants to take time off was " nerve- racking " and awkward at first , says Debbie Lovich , a Boston Consulting executive who headed one of the teams .
Some fought the idea , claiming they would have to work more on weekends or draw poor performance ratings .
But the point of the experiment was n't to eliminate the " good intensity " in work — the " buzz " from constant learning and " being in the thick of things , " Harvard 's Dr. Perlow says .
Instead , researchers targeted " bad intensity " — a feeling of having no time truly free from work , no control over work and no opportunity to ask questions to clarify foggy priorities , she says .
Ms. Lovich adds : " We wanted to teach people that you can tune out completely " for a while and still turn out good work .
The work itself became the focus , " because if you know a night off is coming up , you 're not going to let things spike out of control , " she says .
After five months of predictable time off , internal surveys showed consultants were more satisfied with their jobs and work - life balance , and more likely to stay with the firm , compared with consultants who were n't part of the experiment .
As word spread , other consultants began asking to join the study , Ms. Lovich says .
And some clients told researchers the teams ' work had improved , partly because improved communication among team members kept junior consultants better informed about the big picture .
Bobrick Washroom Equipment 's policy to get workers home for dinner came as a shock to Janice Blakely when she joined the company years ago after working " long , long hours " at an energy concern , she says .
Seeing staffers at Bobrick leave by 6 p.m. , " I thought , ' Wow , this is not normal . " '
But in time , the policy " made me look at my performance and tighten up on what I 'm doing , " says Ms. Blakely , a marketing manager .
Mr. Louchheim , the Bobrick president , says that employees who habitually stay late may be revealing poor work habits .
" We worry about whether they can delegate properly and prioritize their work , " he says .
Adds Chris Von Der Ahe , a Korn / Ferry International recruiter who works with Bobrick : " People who do well there are well organized and able to plan their work well . "
Dr. Perlow says an individual worker can get similar results " by challenging oneself to say , ' I 'm going to cut off ' " work at a certain time every day or every week .
" ' Now , how am I going to get work done in the time I have ? '
This is meant to open your eyes to the possibility " that the way you work can be changed .
In my own experiment , I have managed to keep at least one weekend day work - free so far this month .
This has forced me to put proven time - management principles into practice :
Plan blocks of work time and stick to the plan ; set short - term deadlines to keep work from spiraling out of control ; and keep up with email daily , to avoid backlogs .
The rewards have been surprising .
On one recent Monday , after an invigorating weekend of working out , attending church and watching college football and hiking with friends , I quickly solved a work problem that had baffled me the previous week .
Asked to assess my work this month , my editor , John Blanton , said my columns have been fine .
" I 'd say , from our perspective , start enjoying your weekends , " he wrote in an email .
This , I hope , will get to be a habit .

THE big screen 's polemicist - in - chief is back .
In “ Capitalism : A Love Story ” , Michael Moore turns his camera and loud - hailer to the identity crisis that has gripped the world 's most enduring economic system .
His conclusion is characteristically punchy : capitalism is inherently evil , “ a system of giving and taking … mostly taking . ”
His line of argument is also characteristically simplistic .
Mr Moore is a showman , and his film is studded with trademark stunts .
Some are funny , for instance his wrapping of crime - scene tape around the headquarters of bailed - out Wall Street firms to the bemusement of security guards .
The footage of the botched attempts by experts to explain derivatives is hilarious .
His mastery of the issues is less assured .
In his black - and - white world , there is no middle class , just “ the people who got it all and the people who got nothing ” , as one dispossessed homeowner puts it .
Forget greedy borrowers , napping regulators or global economic imbalances .
The recession is entirely the fault of Wall Street 's robber - barons and , in a novel reading of Detroit 's woes , corporate bosses who drove their companies into the ground because of , not in spite of , their determination to slim down their operations and break the power of the unions .
As in “ Fahrenheit 9/11 ” , his film about America 's response to the attacks on the World Trade Centre , Mr Moore sees conspiracies everywhere .
The $ 700 billion bail - out after Lehman 's collapse was no genuine attempt to stave off depression , but a financial coup d'état , staged by big banks .
Like nefarious screen villains , the bankers “ had a simple plan : to remake America to serve them . ”
So busy is Mr Moore imagining such shenanigans and resorting to class - struggle theatrics , and so hectoring his tone , that he risks leaving even his fans unmoved .
Tellingly , the film 's first - weekend box office take was well below expectations .
His biggest failure , however , is his inability to articulate a plausible alternative to the system he loathes .
He talks fuzzily of more democracy , but it is not clear what he means .
He likes small , co-operatively run firms , but how that model could be made to work for multinationals is far from clear .
In the end , Mr Moore fails to produce a convincing riposte to the argument that capitalism , though prone to the occasional spectacular bust , is the economic system best able to correct its own excesses .
Take a closer look at No Love Lost , Blue Paintings by Damien Hirst – the artist 's first London display since his £ 111 m sale at Sotheby 's last year .

I wanted to leave you with one more workout for this series of articles .
This slight modification , like the other two , will help you improve your mile run time and keep things from getting boring .
The other two were pretty simple modifcations and this one 's not that much more complicated .
Let 's get right into the modification .
You 're going to be running intervals , but for two of those intervals you 're going to run backwards !
Why run backwards ?
There 's one obvious benefit to running backwards : variety !
Bringing variety to your workouts will keep you from getting bored and will also help you make more progress .
Variety is n't the only benefit though , here are some other reasons to run backwards :
PITTSBURGH , October 2 , 2009 — After months of national media attention , a student threatened with punishment for attempting to form a gun-rights group at Community College of Allegheny County ( CCAC ) is finally allowed to distribute pamphlets about the group on campus .
The college has also rescinded its unconstitutional policy demanding “ prior written approval ” for “ personal contact with individuals or groups related to non-sponsored college material or events . ”
After Christine Brashier , who wanted to form a chapter of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus ( SCCC ) , was told that her pamphlets were unacceptable “ solicitation ” and that any further efforts would be considered “ academic misconduct , ” she turned to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help .
“ We are pleased that CCAC has finally given its students the right to encourage one another to band together for causes they believe in , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ This is another example of how just one college student standing up for her rights can help bring liberty to her entire campus . ”
In April , Brashier created pamphlets to distribute to her classmates encouraging them to join her in forming a chapter of the SCCC national organization at CCAC .
Her pamphlets stated that the group “ supports the legalization of concealed carry by licensed individuals on college campuses . ”
She personally distributed copies of the pamphlets , which identified her as a “ Campus Leader ” of the effort to start the chapter .
Brashier was quickly summoned to a meeting with administrators , who told her that passing out her non-commercial pamphlets was prohibited as “ solicitation . ”
Furthermore , they insisted that the college pre-approve any pamphlets , that pamphlets like hers would not be approved , and that Brashier destroy all copies of her pamphlet .
At one point during the meeting , Dean Yvonne Burns reportedly said , “ You may want to discuss this topic but the college does not , and you cannot make us . ”
Brashier was warned that any further efforts would be considered “ academic misconduct . ”
FIRE wrote CCAC President Alex Johnson on April 29 about these violations of Brashier ’s First Amendment speech and association rights , pointing out that her speech in no way constituted solicitation , that CCAC may not condition approval of literature on its viewpoint or content , and that if CCAC recognizes student organizations at all , it must recognize an organization that supports concealed carry on campus .
After FIRE took Brashier ’s case public in May , generating national news coverage , CCAC attorney Mike Adams finally replied to FIRE .
Adams assured FIRE that Brashier did not face any disciplinary action and that she did have the right to try to form a SCCC group , but he reported that CCAC would not budge from its unconstitutional policy of prior review of materials .
“ The college ’s demand for a government veto over privately produced handbills could never withstand First Amendment scrutiny , ” FIRE Vice President Robert Shibley said .
“ Fortunately , through FIRE ’s advocacy and the hard work of an attorney from FIRE ’s Legal Network , the college has completely rescinded its policy . ”
Michael J. Rinaldi , a FIRE Legal Network attorney in the Commercial Litigation Practice Group at Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP in Philadelphia , represented Brashier .
Rinaldi successfully pressed CCAC to allow not only Brashier but all CCAC students to exercise their fundamental rights on campus .
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process , freedom of expression , academic freedom , and rights of conscience at our nation ’s colleges and universities .
FIRE ’s efforts to preserve liberty on campuses across America are described at thefire.org .

Enhance Your Twitter Use With Lists
Social media phenomenon
Twitter is on everyone ’s radar screens these days .
Never before have we been able to see so clearly into the eyes of friends , acquaintances , others who share similar interests or corporate marketing people .
This newfound freedom and openness of communication has really taken us by storm , even though we are only able to get glimpses of our fellow communicators , 140 characters at a time .
While there are many fans , there are a good number of detractors as well and criticism of Twitter revolves around the fact that it is quite simply unmanageable to the layman .
You only need to have a few followers to quickly become entranced by the constant flow of tweets .
Indeed you have to try and understand the very concept of the medium to decipher some of these tweets , peppered as they are with “ bit.ly ” references , @ characters and grammatically incorrect sentences obviously designed to cram the message within the available space .
As your Twitter membership continues , the trickle of tweets becomes a monsoon and it is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff and get any benefit from this fast flowing tide of information .
You can quickly lose sight of the very benefit that Twitter was designed for .
While a couple of applications already exist to help you organize your tweeting world into some semblance of order , Twitter is likely to add specific functionality to help you keep your sanity .
While the process is still in beta mode right now , it seems likely that you will have an option to allow you to organize your people into specific lists .
You can come up with lists according to any number of categories , based on friends , acquaintances , local businesses , brands , topics or keywords .
Now , when you receive tweets they will be organized into the categories that you specify , giving you a feeling of much greater control over your tweet - dom .
Your lists will , by default , be displayed as part of your profile and this could be particularly advantageous from a marketing perspective as you will now be able to see individuals classified as important in relation to your keywords and can opt to follow all of these people .
This is likely to be one of the most significant steps forward in the short history of the company and was introduced at the behest of users , according to Twitter developers .
Expect to see this functionality incorporated into many new apps , as it will also be made available within API to external programmers .
Is this development overdue ?

The beauty of running an online business is that you do n’t have to be physically present to make money .
As a result , a lot of online entrepreneurs are able to create highly scalable businesses from anywhere they want .
In fact , leveraging the Internet is how I ’m able to run a blog , an ecommerce store , a podcast , an online course and an ecommerce conference all while working a full time job and playing with 2 cute kids on the weekends .
I also run all of these businesses with very little help .
In total , I have 1 trusted assistant who handles my podcast and video editing .
And outside of my wife who runs the day to day for our ecommerce store , I ’m pretty much a solo entrepreneur .
Now I ’m not saying that this is necessarily a good thing ( the solo entrepreneur part ) , and most successful entrepreneurs often frown upon not outsourcing a good portion of their work .
But my intention when starting my businesses was never to run a large team .
And when I hear stories from other entrepreneurs about not being able to make money on vacation without a strong support staff … I can say based on experience that this is totally false .
The last time I went on vacation , I made enough money relaxing in Hawaii that I could have paid for my entire trip 10 fold .
Anyway , the reason that I can get by with so few resources is because I have learned a set of basic skills over the years that make me a more efficient entrepreneur .
Here are the things that allow me to do what I do .

I Learned Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop is by far the tool I use the most often on a day to day basis .
Why ?
Because if you think about it , everything online is predicated on the use of images .
Every blog post I publish uses multiple images .
Instagram requires images .
Any sales page or promo offer requires images .
Facebook advertising needs images .
If you do not know how to manipulate photos , you can not succeed online .
Period !
Images are even more crucial when running an ecommerce store because your photos often mean the difference between a sale and an abandoned shopping cart .
Of course , you can outsource all of your image processing and a lot of entrepreneurs do this successfully .
But running an online business is infinitely easier when you know how to quickly process your own photos .
I also rely heavily on Photoshop as part of my outreach strategy .
And I ’ll often whip up special images in order to make myself memorable to new people I meet .
For example , I do n’t think Pat Flynn will ever forget this super awesome cover I designed for his latest book , Will It Fly .
Erin Chase will always remember my depiction of her sitting on the iron throne of Westeros .
And I do n’t think that my friends over at Simple Green Smoothies will ever forget how I caught one of their founders drinking a “ Blended Caramel Ribbon Crunch Crème Frappuccino Macchiato ”
In any case , if Adobe Photoshop is too intimidating for you , there are other tools available online that are much easier to use but have far fewer features .
For example , Canva and PicMonkey are great tools for doing basic editing , cropping or adding text to your own images .
Whatever you decide to do , make sure you learn how to use at least one of these tools .
I Learned Basic HTML/CSS
Most people who completely outsource their website design to a 3rd party inevitably find themselves heavily dependent on their web developer .
For example just the other day , I had a reader frantically email me because her store just went live and she could not figure out how to add an extra hyperlink to her front page banner .
I had another reader practically beg me to take a look at her site because her web developer introduced a pretty major bug on her cart but stopped answering her emails .
I ’ve even had colleagues make fun of me by asking me why I bother wasting my time learning basic web skills when I could contract everything out and focus on the selling process .
But here ’s the thing .
If you are basing your entire livelihood on your website , should n’t you at least learn the basics of the technology behind your business ?
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’ve contracted out entire website designs to developers before .
But I always make sure that I fully understand what they are doing .
And this extra knowledge has paid off big time over the years .
For example , I ’ve been hacked a few times in my day and I was able to recover even though my web designer was unavailable .
I am able to make minute tweaks to my site instantly without having to wait for help .
Overall , it ’s amazing how much more productive you can be if you just sit down and learn a few basic skills .
You do n’t have to become an expert .
Just learn the basics and it will also help you become a better employer and outsourcer .
I Learned How To Communicate My Ideas
Originally , this last skill was going to be about learning how to write effectively .
But in this day and age , there are so many different ways to express yourself online that it does n’t really matter what medium you choose .
You just have to do one thing well .
If you are good at writing , then start a blog .
If you are great on camera , start pumping out YouTube videos or use Periscope or SnapChat .
If you have a great voice but you ’re shy on camera , then start a podcast !
The key to being successful at any online business is to put yourself out there and start a following .
Because throwing a bunch of random products on a website is just not going to cut it .
If you can get people to like who you are , then the sales will start rolling in regardless of how much competition is out there .
My blog is the perfect example of this .
Do you know how many “ Make Money ” blogs are out there today ?
I would guess thousands if not tens of thousands .
But the competition does n’t matter because I ’ve attracted a loyal audience .
With my ecommerce store , we are constantly bombarded by new competitors entering our space .
But we ’ve established enough loyal B2B customers that we could make a living off of these customers alone .
The secret to long term success for any business is to gain mindshare and to establish a deeper connection with as many customers as possible .
So what ’s the most effective way to do this ?
The best way is to focus on one medium , understand how it works , master it , and then re-purpose your content across as many platforms as possible .
In fact , this is one of the goals for my blog this year .
Right now I put out 1 blog post and 1 podcast episode per week but I ’m currently doing a poor job of syndicating my content .
Instead what I COULD be doing is taking that 1 podcast episode and putting it on YouTube .
I could also take that same podcast episode , get it transcribed and edited and publish it as a standalone blog post .
With the 1 article I write every week , I COULD be turning that into a Periscope presentation and putting it on YouTube .
I COULD also re-purpose my weekly Periscope ( follow me @mywifequit ) and turn it into a blog post and a podcast episode .
Anyway , you get the point .
There are many opportunities for syndication where you only have to produce 1 piece of content and spread it everywhere .
But content is where the magic starts !
Conclusion
Overall , these are the skills that I rely on for all of my businesses .
And while I do n’t necessarily advocate the path of solo entrepreneurship , I do urge you to pick up some of these skills on your own because they will improve your chances for success .
After all , there ’s nothing wrong with outsourcing different parts of your business as long as you have redundancy .
But often times as a small business owner , you need to be a jack of all trades in the beginning to grow as quickly as possible .
Good luck !

The L.A. City Attorney cites a lack of evidence that Alexandra Kerry was driving drunk

“ We reviewed the arrest report and have declined to file criminal charges due to insufficient evidence , ” says L.A. City Attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan .

RELATED : John Kerry Says Daughter Was Not Legally Drunk
The daughter of Sen. John Kerry was pulled over in Hollywood on Nov. 19 for an expired registration , her father ’s spokesperson said .
Officers conducted a DUI investigation , but Kerry ’s breathalyzer test results at the station were under the legal limit , the rep added .
IRA dissidents - backed by IRA veterans - now pose a major threat to peace in Northern Ireland .
That 's according to the Independent Monitoring Commission which says the security threat is the highest since the 1996 Good Friday Peace Agreement .
There are mounting fears that the dissident groups are planning a major atrocity to wreck peace deal .
There has been a surge of violence in the North since March .
Two British soldiers and a PSNI police officer have been shot dead and there has been a spate of failed bomb attempts on security forces .
An informed source said : " The fact is that the dissident groups are becoming more desperate the more the peace process continues to move forward .
" We have moved beyond the politics of the last atrocity .
The only thing that will bring them back is if the process stalls completely and a political vacuum emerges . "
Meanwhile , the commission says 20 people have been injured in shootings aimed at dissuading Catholics from co-operating with the security forces .
The commission says the dissidents hope to sabotage the transfer of Northern Ireland 's justice system to the Northern Assembly this year .
The violence " is an attack on the peaceful political approach adopted by Sinn Fein and is designed to affect policing and to raise public fears about security , " it said .
The commission , which includes former CIA director Richard Kerr , says both the Real IRA and Continuity IRA , have upped their recruitment , training and weapons smuggling since March .
" The seriousness , range and tempo of their activities all changed for the worse in these six months , " they wrote .
And they said the worst threat came from veterans of the Provisional IRA who are training these new recruits in spite of the Provisionals ' 2005 decision to disarm .
" The majority of new recruits are inexperienced young males , " the commission said .
" There are however now indications that former republican terrorists have , as individuals , provided services in some instances to dissident republican groups , which even if occasional can significantly add to the threat . "
US defence firms are to be barred from lucrative government contracts if they refuse to allow employees access to the courts , after a woman working for a Halliburton subsidiary in Iraq was prevented from taking legal action over an alleged gang rape by fellow workers .
Al Franken , the Senate 's newest member , has won an amendment to the defence appropriations bill prompted by the case of Jamie Leigh Jones .
She alleges that she was drugged and raped by seven American contractors in Baghdad in 2005 .
Jones , who was employed by KBR , which was fighting oil fires , says that a pattern of subsequent behaviour by the firm , including allegedly locking her in a container under armed guard and losing forensic evidence , amounts to a cover-up .
Halliburton / KBR used a clause in her contract requiring disputes to be settled by arbitration to block legal action – a policy which , her lawyer says , has encouraged assaults by creating a climate of impunity .
Franken described it as a denial of justice .
" Contractors are using fine print to deny women like Jamie Leigh Jones their day in court , " he said in a Senate debate .
In legal papers Jones , who was 20 at the time , says she was fed a knockout drug while drinking with KBR firefighters .
" When she awoke the next morning still affected by the drug , she found her body naked and severely bruised , with lacerations to her vagina and anus , blood running down her leg , her breast implants ruptured and her pectoral muscles torn‚ which would later require reconstructive surgery .
Upon walking to the rest room , she passed out again , " the papers say .
Jones was treated by a US army doctor who gave forensic evidence to company officials .
She says the firm placed her under guard in a shipping container and she was released only after her father asked the US embassy to intervene .
When the forensic evidence was handed to investigators two years later , crucial photographs and notes were missing .
Jones says she identified one of the men who attacked her after he confessed , but that Halliburton / KBR prevented her from taking legal action against him or the company by pointing to a clause in her contract requiring disputes to go to arbitration .
She told a Senate committee : " I had no idea that the clause was part of the contract , what the clause actually meant , or that I would eventually end up in this horrible situation . "
Her lawyer , Todd Kerry , said that by forcing earlier assault cases to arbitration , Halliburton and other defence firms had created a climate in which some workers came to believe they could get away with sexual assaults and other crimes .
" I 've received upwards of 40 calls to my office [ about assault cases ] in the past two years .
A good number had been disposed of under arbitration , " he said .
" Had there been public scrutiny to prevent such things happening and these cases taken to court , they might not have been repeated .
Instead one of the men who raped Jamie was so confident that nothing would happen that he was lying in bed next to her the morning after . "
Halliburton and KBR divided into separate companies in April 2007 .
Halliburton declined to comment on the case .
KBR has sought to discredit Jones 's account by saying she was seen drinking and flirting with a firefighter before leaving the gathering with him , and that the man claims to have had consensual sex with her .
The firm denies that Jones was held prisoner , but not that her injuries indicated serious sexual assault .
But KBR defended arbitration as a " fair process " , saying : " Most large companies have a dispute resolution programme which is mandatory and is designed to address employee complaints quickly and efficiently .
Under KBR 's dispute resolution programme 95 % of all employee complaints are resolved quickly to the employees ' satisfaction without a mediation or an arbitration . "
Franken and Kerry challenge the claim that arbitration is usually settled to the satisfaction of complainants .
Other women have come forward to accuse the firms of not taking assault allegations seriously .
Mary Beth Kineston , who drove lorries in Iraq and survived a bloody ambush , has alleged that she was sacked after complaining of sexual assaults by several fellow workers .
" At least if you got in trouble on a convoy , you could radio the army and they would come and help you out .
But when I complained to KBR , they did n't do anything .
I still have nightmares .
They changed my life forever , and they got away with it , " she told the New York Times last year .
Linda Lindsey , who worked for KBR in Iraq for three years , has said that male supervisors regularly offered promotions and other benefits in exchange for sex .
Lindsey said she filed complaints but they that were never acted on .
Last month Jones won a court ruling against Halliburton and KBR that the arbitration clause in her contract did not prevent them from being sued .
But the legal battle to get the case even heard is far from over .
" Four years to fight to get in court is not a day in court , " she said .
The legislation to end the bar on legal action passed the Senate with a clear majority but 30 Republican members voted against it , including the former presidential candidate John McCain .
Among the objections were claims that the government had no business interfering in a private contract between a company and its workers .
• This article was amended on 16 October 2009 .
In the original , the year in which Halliburton and KBR divided into separate companies was omitted .
This has been corrected .
Halliburton 's controversial history
Halliburton and KBR , its former subsidiary , were the largest defence department contractors in Iraq .
Critics allege that huge contracts were won in part because of ties to George Bush 's government , particularly to his vice - president , Dick Cheney , a former Halliburton chief executive who left the company during the 2000 presidential campaign with a $ 36 m pay - off .
The Texas - based firm has a controversial history .
In the early 1990s it was fined $ 3.8 m for breaking trade embargoes on Iraq and Libya .
Last year , a former KBR president , Albert " Jack " Stanley , pleaded guilty to overseeing the payment of $ 182 m in bribes to win engineering contracts in Nigeria .
Critics allege that Halliburton / KBR won a contract to plan oil - well firefighting in the Iraq invasion because no other firm was permitted to bid .
The Pentagon 's auditor found Halliburton / KBR was linked to " the vast majority " of fraud cases investigated by the defence department in Iraq .
Furthermore , a civil servant who oversaw contracts accused Halliburton of unlawfully receiving preferential treatment over contracts for work in Iraq , Kuwait and the Balkans .
The firm reportedly severely overcharged the Pentagon for fuel deliveries to Iraq .
Halliburton is headquartered in Houston , Texas but has recently opened a new joint head office in Dubai .
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it plans to lay off about 3,000 employees , or about 10 % of its work force , because of delays in the closing of its purchase by Oracle Corp .
The hardware and software maker has been reducing its work force over the years because of declining revenues , and additional job cuts have been widely expected to happen after Oracle buys the company .

Not all of Sarah Palin ’s interview with Oprah Winfrey made it onto Monday ’s show .
Sure , Oprah ’s broadcast had lots of good bits , from Palin ’s statement that a run for the White House in 2012 is “ not on my radar screen right now , ” to the conciliatory Thanksgiving dinner invitation she says she proffered Levi Johnston , the father of daughter Bristol ’s baby .
But the outtakes have great stuff , too .
Some are posted on Oprah ’s website .
Among the most interesting items :
Sarah ’s journal .
In discussing how and why the ex-governor of Alaska came to write her memoir , “ Going Rogue , ” Ms. Palin said “ I have a journalism degree and have journalled all of my life . ”
Oprah jumped at this , asking Palin when she first started writing down her thoughts .
For a second , the question hangs there , giving the impression that perhaps Oprah has caught Palin out in some kind of misstatement .
But Palin jumps back in , saying she ’s kept a dairy since she was in elementary school , and that recently she and her sister went over the diary entries .
Lots of them dealt with chopping wood .
“ Almost every day I have some kind of entry about having to stack firewood in order to heat the home , ” Palin told Oprah .
Sarah Palin and the sorcerer ’s stone .
Palin said that many lies and much innuendo was spread about her in the media during the 2008 presidential campaign .
Many of the false statements could have been disproved easily , Palin said .
Take the report that Palin banned books from the public library when she was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska .
Palin told Oprah the story was completely untrue , and was spread by a Wasilla blogger who disliked her .
“ Look at that list of books I supposedly banned – ‘ Harry Potter , ’ it was n’t even written when I was the mayor , ” said Palin .
For the record , Ms. Palin was mayor of Wasilla from 1996 to 2002 .
“ Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone , ” the first volume of J.K. Rowling ’s popular series , was published in the US in 1998 .
Democracy in the Palin family .
Palin told Oprah that at various points in her political life she has gathered all her family together , and the kids and her husband Todd have voted on her course of action .
“ I ’ve abided by the results of some of the polls that the kids have partaken in , ” she said .
Joining Sen. John McCain ’s presidential ticket was not one of those moments , though .
When Palin thought Senator McCain was on the verge of asking her to be his running mate , she called her husband , who urged her to seize the opportunity .
“ He said , yep , he would be there for me , and with me , and he has been , ” said Palin .
Joe Lieberman sets Palin free .
Palin said she found prepping for the vice - presidential debate onerous , in the sense that she thought the McCain campaign was force - feeding her answers to various questions .
At one point , McCain ’s good friend Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I ) of Connecticut came into the darkened hotel room where aides was peppering her with data .
Senator Lieberman said that the effort was “ overly scripted , ” and threw everybody out of the room , Palin told Oprah .
According to Palin , Liebrman said , “ I think I know you well enough already , Gov. Palin , to know that you need to be free , you need some liberty , you need to speak from the heart . "
Lieberman told her to trust herself and have fun .
“ Those things were so simplistic but so absolutely real and helpful at the time , ” said Palin .
“ I was so thankful for his words . ”
Sarah Palin impersonates Tina Fey .
Palin told Oprah that at first she was only dimly aware of the popularity of Ms. Fey ’s impersonations of her on “ Saturday Night Live ” ( SNL ) .
At one point , she saw a clip of the show , with the volume down .
“ I thought it was me , ” said Palin .
Later , when she went on SNL to try and neutralize the act a bit , she met Fey backstage .
At the time , Fey was holding her three - year - old daughter Alice .
Alice looked at her mother , then at Palin , then back again .
“ I said , ‘ We ’re confusing your daughter ’ , ” said Palin .
“ And we were . ”
Then Palin told Oprah that for years , people in Alaska had been telling her she looked like that gal on Saturday Night Live .
So one Halloween , she dressed up as Tina Fey .
“ Yeah , I did .
I went one year as Tina Fey , ” Palin said .

In the case of Afghanistan , we ’re sending them off to fight and possibly die in support of a government that is incompetent and riddled with corruption and narcotics traffickers .
We ’re putting them in the field with Afghan forces that are ill trained , ill equipped and in all - too - many instances unwilling to fight with the courage and tenacity of the American forces .
And we ’re sending them off to engage in a mishmash of a mission that alternates incoherently between aggressively fighting insurgents and the admirable but unachievable task of nation - building in a society in which most Americans are clueless about the history , culture , politics and mores .
In a confidential assessment of the war prepared for President Obama , General McChrystal wrote : “ The weakness of state institutions , malign actions of power brokers , widespread corruption and abuse of power by various officials and [ the American - led NATO force ’s ] own errors have given Afghans little reason to support their government . ”
A friend of mine who lives in South Carolina sent me an e-mail about a young serviceman in civilian clothes whom she and her husband noticed as he talked on a public telephone in the Atlanta airport last week .
He was 19 or 20 years old and quite thin .
His clothes and his shoes were worn , my friend said , but the thing she noticed most “ was the sadness in his eyes and his sweet demeanor . ”
The young man was speaking to his mom in a voice that was quite emotional .
My friend recalled him saying , “ We ’re about to board for Oklahoma for the training before we move out .
I did n’t want to bother Amber at work , so please tell her I called if you do n’t think it will upset her too much .
... I miss you all so much and love you , and I just do n’t know how I ’ll get through this . ”
At the end of the call , the serviceman had tears in his eyes and my friend said she did , too .
She wrote in the e-mail : “ I stood up and wished him good luck , and he smiled the sweetest smile that has haunted me ever since . ”
As President Obama tries to decide what to do about Afghanistan , reality is insisting that he take into account the worn - down condition of our military after so many years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the soaring budget deficits and sky - high unemployment numbers here at home in a country that is hurting badly and could use its own dose of nation - building .
Mr. Obama , in the face of these daunting realities , is said to be re-thinking his plans to ratchet up American involvement in Afghanistan .
One can only hope .
EU Summit Dallying Copenhagen Heads for a Crash

As you might imagine , a planet on the brink of ecological collapse ( ie ours ) has a number of pressing concerns .
The plastic bag issue really is not one of them , and yet in terms of air time and emotion it punches well above its weight , particularly the landfill weight of plastic bags – they take up just 0.3 % of landfill space .
Other experts like to point out that their impact on wildlife has been over - egged , too .
While you 'll often hear that 100,000 - plus marine mammals are killed every year by ingesting plastic bags , Greenpeace experts say wildlife deaths from plastic bags are few and far between .
But while we can establish that they are not the earth 's primary nemesis , they are nonetheless extremely annoying .
And , incidentally , there is a link to oceanic pollution : 6 % of marine sediment has been found to be polyethylene , implicating them in microplastic pollution of the oceans .
The UK uses between 9bn and 17.5 bn plastic bags every year .
Illustration : Rob Biddulph
The single - use carrier bag also represents an unconscionable use of resources .
According to an Australian study , the energy consumed and embodied in manufacturing a conventional supermarket carrier is significant , with 8.7 bags equivalent to driving a car 1 km .
Depending on which report you read , in the UK we use between 9bn and 17.5 bn plastic bags every year ( thanks to voluntary schemes and greater awareness and use of non-plastic bags , retailers say they have halved the number of plastic bags they 've given out since 2006 ) .
The non-production of 800 m bags is equivalent to removing 92 m car kilometers .
So the first thing to do is to make sure you do n't accumulate any more .
But as we 've acquired the wretched things at a rate of 160 - 350 a year for many years ( again depending on the report you read ) , we should all have enough by now .
Strangely , even zero tolerance of plastic bags does not equal zero waste .
Some bright sparks have just transferred their affections to paper bags .
A 1991 US study that still appears to stand found that paper bags produced more air pollution , water borne and solid waste and required more space in landfill than plastic bags .
The only benefit being that you might be able to recycle paper bags more easily .
Plastic - bag recycling rates remain low and in most normal schemes carrier bags are likely to be a contaminant rather than a valued material stream .
Partly this is because initiatives have focused on cloth and reusable bags rather than clawing back some of the energy input from recycling .
Recycling is also dependent on market value and there 's not much of that in lightweight bags when the world has billions of them .
I suggest you turn this on its head .
Plastic bags are undeniably useful – they can carry 2,500 times their own weight – so reuse each one extensively .
Hand them down to future generations , turning the fact that a plastic bag might take 1,000 years to degrade into a virtue .
Give them as presents .
The world 's remaining plastic bags should become family heirlooms . ★

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - President Hugo Chavez ’s government said on Wednesday it was taking control of a landmark hotel run by Hilton on Margarita island , announcing another nationalization by socialist - run Venezuela .
The 280 - room hotel last month housed the likes of Zimbabwe ’s President Robert Mugabe and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for a summit of African and South American leaders .
An official decree from Chavez said the hotel complex , which also has 54 suites and 154 timeshare suites , was being taken over due to “ the need to boost tourism ” on Margarita , one of Venezuela ’s prime Caribbean destinations .
Tourism Minister Pedro Morejon said the government , which is working out ownership stakes after previously taking over two local companies with shares in the hotel , would honor employees ’ contracts and tourism bookings .
He accused Hilton , whose concession ran out this week , of failing to maintain installations , which he said were in a “ high state of deterioration . ”
In a statement , Hilton , which manages but does not own the hotel , said it was “ evaluating how the Venezuelan government ’s action affects its interest in this hotel . ”
The hotel remains a part of the Hilton system , added the company , which is owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group .
Under Chavez , Venezuela has pursued an aggressive nationalization policy , principally in the oil , telecommunications , electricity , metal and land sectors .
Hilton has lost control of two other hotels in Venezuela , when concessions ran out .

It may sound like a sci- fi vision , but Japan 's space agency is dead serious : by 2030 it wants to collect solar power in space and zap it down to Earth , using laser beams or microwaves .
The government has just picked a group of companies and a team of researchers tasked with turning the ambitious , multi-billion - dollar dream of unlimited clean energy into reality in coming decades .
With few energy resources of its own and heavily reliant on oil imports , Japan has long been a leader in solar and other renewable energies and this year set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets .
But Japan 's boldest plan to date is the Space Solar Power System ( SSPS ) , in which arrays of photovoltaic dishes several square kilometres ( square miles ) in size would hover in geostationary orbit outside the Earth 's atmosphere .

Update : Senate Finance Committee passes health care reform bill 14-9
A pivotal Senate committee has approved a sweeping remake of the country ’s health care system , delivering a long - sought boost to President Barack Obama ’s goal of expanding coverage .
The 14 - 9 vote in the Senate Finance Committee sets up a historic debate on the Senate floor and moves health care overhaul closer to reality than it has been for decades .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sen . Olympia Snowe of Maine was the only Republican to join 13 committee Democrats in voting “ yes . ”
The 10 - year , $ 829 - billion plan approved Tuesday is aimed at extending coverage to millions more Americans , holding down costs and improving health care for all .
The Finance Committee was the last of five congressional committees to act .
It produced a centrist - leaning compromise bill .
Original report continues below :
WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama ’s plan to remake the nation ’s health care system is about to take its biggest step yet toward becoming reality .
The pivotal Senate Finance Committee was poised to approve sweeping legislation Tuesday requiring nearly all Americans to purchase insurance and ushering in a host of other changes to the nation ’s $ 2.5 trillion medical system .
ADVERTISEMENT
Much work would lie ahead before a bill could arrive on Obama ’s desk , but action by the Finance Committee would mark a significant advance , capping numerous delays as Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , held marathon negotiating sessions — ultimately unsuccessful — aimed at producing a bipartisan bill .
Four other congressional committees acted before August to pass health legislation , so for months all eyes have been on the Finance Committee , the remaining one .
It ’s also the panel whose moderate makeup most closely resembles the Senate as a whole .
And the committee ’s centrist legislation is seen as the best building block for a compromise plan that could find favor on the Senate floor .
With Democrats holding a 13 - 10 majority on the committee the outcome of Tuesday ’s vote is not in doubt .
The big question mark is whether moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine will become the first Republican to support a health overhaul bill .
The legislation that passed the other House and Senate committees did so without a single Republican vote .
On Monday , Snowe still was n’t saying .

With Finance Committee passage , Obama ’s top domestic priority will have advanced farther than former President Bill Clinton ’s effort ever did .
The Clinton health plan never made it through all the congressional committees with jurisdiction .
The final days before Tuesday ’s long - anticipated vote were rocky .
After playing nice for months , the health insurance industry released a report contending that the legislation would cause hefty increases in health insurance premiums .
ADVERTISEMENT
Democrats and their allies scrambled Monday to knock it down .
“ Distorted and flawed , ” said White House spokeswoman Linda Douglass .
AARP ’s senior policy strategist , John Rother , called it “ fundamentally dishonest . ”
PricewaterhouseCoopers , the accounting firm that did the industry - commissioned analysis , issued a statement late Monday acknowledging it did not look at the entirety of the legislation , only the effects of four provisions that the insurance group wanted analyzed .
The drama threatened to overshadow the vote on the 10 - year , $ 829 - billion plan that Baucus has touted as the sensible solution to America ’s problems of high medical costs and too many uninsured .
ADVERTISEMENT
The bill includes consumer protections such as limits on copays and deductibles and relies on federal subsidies to help lower - income families purchase coverage .
Insurance companies would have to take all comers , and people could shop for insurance within new state marketplaces called exchanges .
Medicaid would be expanded , and though employers would n’t be required to cover their workers , they ’d have to pay a penalty for each employee who sought insurance with government subsidies .
The bill is paid for by cuts to Medicare providers and new taxes on insurance companies and others .
Unlike the other health care bills in Congress , Baucus ’ would not allow the government to sell insurance in competition with private companies , a divisive element sought by liberals .
Last - minute changes made subsidies more generous and softened the penalties for those who do n’t comply with a proposed new mandate for everyone to buy insurance .
The latter change drew the ire of the health insurance industry , which said that without a strong and enforceable requirement not enough people would get insured , and premiums would jump for everyone else .
ADVERTISEMENT
The industry report was timed just ahead of the vote on Baucus ’ bill but the industry was already looking ahead to negotiations on a final package to bring to the Senate floor .
Once the Finance Committee has acted , the dealmaking can begin in earnest with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , working with White House staff , Baucus and others to blend the Finance bill with a more liberal version passed by the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee .
A major question mark is whether Reid will include some version of a so - called public plan in the merged bill .
Across the Capitol , House Democratic leaders are working to finalize their bill , which does contain a public plan , and floor action is expected in both chambers in coming weeks .
If passed , the legislation would then go to a conference committee to reconcile differences .
Snowe to vote for Democratic health care bill

Republican Sen. Olympia
Snowe says she will vote for a Democratic health care bill , breaking with her party on President Barack Obama ’s top legislative priority .
The Maine senator kept virtually all of Washington guessing how she would vote until she announced it late in the Senate Finance Committee debate Tuesday .
Until then , she told reporters , she had not even let Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , in on her secret .
She told her colleagues : “ When history calls , history calls , ” even though she had some criticism of the bill .

DAKAR , Senegal 
Thousands of victims of one of the worst toxic dumping scandals in years could lose their hard - won settlement thanks to maneuverings by a shadowy but “ influential ” figure in Ivory Coast , where the dumping occurred , the victims ’ lawyer said Wednesday .
Up to $ 45 million in compensation is at stake , intended for about 30,000 victims of an oil - based sludge surreptitiously dumped around Abidjan , Ivory Coast ’s capital , in 2006 .
The tanker ’s poisonous shipment has become notorious as a kind of African Bhopal , an example of a multinational corporation ’s negligence in the third world .
The waste was shipped by Trafigura , an international commodities trading giant .
About 108,000 people sought treatment for nausea , headaches , vomiting and abdominal pains , and at least 15 died .
All had apparently been poisoned by the toxic brew of gasoline and caustic soda , refining byproducts dumped by Trafigura ’s contractor .
The company agreed to pay the Ivorian government about $ 200 million in 2007 , then settled separately with the victims in September of this year .
But now the money , frozen in a local bank , has been claimed by a largely self - appointed community representative named Claude Gohourou .
In recent weeks , the Ivorian judiciary has sided with him , according to the London law firm Leigh Day & Company , which represents the victims .

La paraestatal , entre las mencionadas en  El trámite más inútil 
[ email protected ]
Cobros excesivos , problemas para retirar “ diablitos ” , e incluso en revisión de medidores y apertura de nuevos contratos , además de doble facturación y conflictos en la operación general por parte de Luz y Fuerza del Centro ( LyFC ) fueron la constante en las denuncias realizadas por ciudadanos en el concurso “ El trámite más inútil ” .
En el certamen convocado por el gobierno federal , la empresa liquidada juntó un cúmulo de observaciones , quejas y reclamos de la gente , según una revisión de EL UNIVERSAL a los registros .
El concurso lo “ ganó ” el IMSS Aunque LyFC no fue la ganadora del concurso , sino el IMSS , LFyC tuvo un sinnúmero de denuncias , sobre todo por excesos en el cobro del suministro .
Luz y Fuerza fue mencionada por trámites inútiles junto con otras dependencias como el SAT , el ISSSTE , la SEP , la SRE , Sedena , Infonavit y el IFE .
Las fallas de LFyC fueron denunciadas por aspectos administrativos como corregir una doble facturación a un cliente , quien luego de dos años y medio en la intentona no lo conseguía .
Hubo quien tuvo problemas para que le quitaran un “ diablito ” por el que se robaban la luz en Ecatepec .
Entre las denuncias de LyFC , revisadas por EL UNIVERSAL , figuran los problemas para tramitar la apertura de un contrato nuevo ; reclamación de consumos ; solicitud de servicios de vivienda en condominios ; operaciones en general ; conexión a una casa nueva , y la ausencia de recibo para realizar el pago , revisión de medidores y el cambio de nombre para el usuario .
Obtuvo denuncias por cobros excesivos , problemas para consultar saldos y tener información de recontratación .
La gente señaló haber tenido problemas para realizar consultas y obtener información de contratos , y para el pago de reparación de daño causado por accidentes en la línea de la suministradora .
En 2008 , el gobierno federal lanzó dicho concurso con el fin de detectar qué dependencia albergaba el trámite más inútil , el cual culminó el 8 de enero pasado con la entrega de los premios .
Los ciudadanos propusieron a la que reunía esa característica .
Se inscribieron 21 mil 113 propuestas .
A nivel federal , ganó Cecilia Deyanira Velázquez Tello , por el trámite vinculado con el surtimiento y entrega de medicamentos en el IMSS .
A nivel estatal resultó ganadora Ana María Calvo Irurita , por trámites vinculados con el juicio de aclaración del acta de nacimiento , realizados en el Distrito Federal , mientras que a nivel municipal la ganadora fue Monserrat Contreras Castañeda , por el trámite de constancia de residencia , realizado en el municipio de Toluca , estado de México .
Workers at a steel mill and a power plant were the first to notice something strange about the Monongahela River last summer .
The water that U.S. Steel and Allegheny Energy used to power their plants contained so much salty sediment that it was corroding their machinery .
Nearby residents saw something odd , too .
Dishwashers were malfunctioning , and plates were coming out with spots that could n’t easily be rinsed off .
Pennsylvania ’s Department of Environmental Protection soon identified the likely cause and came up with a quick fix .
The Monongahela , a drinking water source for 350,000 people , had apparently been contaminated by chemically tainted wastewater from the state ’s growing natural gas industry .
So the DEP reduced the amount of drilling wastewater that was being discharged into the river and unlocked dams upstream to dilute the contamination .
But questions raised by the incident on the Monongahela have n’t gone away .
In August , contamination levels in the river spiked again , and the DEP still does n’t know exactly why .
And this month the DEP began investigating whether drilling wastewater contributed to the death of 10,000 fish on a 33 - mile stretch of Dunkard Creek , which winds through West Virginia and feeds into the Monongahela .
A spate of other water contamination problems have also been linked to gas drilling in Pennsylvania , including methane leaks that have affected drinking water in at least seven counties .
2011 : 19 million gallons , per day
Pennsylvania is at the forefront of the nation ’s gas drilling boom , with at least 4,000 new oil and gas wells drilled here last year alone , more than in any other state except Texas .
This rapid expansion has forced state regulators to confront a problem that has been overlooked as gas drilling accelerates nationwide :
How will the industry dispose of the enormous amount of wastewater it produces ?
Oil and gas wells disgorge about 9 million gallons of wastewater a day in Pennsylvania , according to industry estimates used by the DEP .
By 2011 that figure is expected to rise to at least 19 million gallons , enough to fill almost 29 Olympic - sized swimming pools every day .
That ’s more than all the state ’s waterways , combined , can safely absorb , DEP officials say .
" I do n’t know that even our [ water ] program people had any idea about the volumes of water that would be used , " said Dana Aunkst , who heads the DEP ’s water program .
Much of the wastewater is the byproduct of a drilling process called hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , which pumps at least a million gallons of water per well deep into the earth to break layers of rock and release gas .
When the water is sucked back out , it contains natural toxins dredged up during drilling , including cadmium and benzene , which both carry cancer risks .
It can also contain small amounts of chemicals added to enhance drilling .
But DEP officials say one of the most worrisome contaminants in the wastewater is a gritty substance called Total Dissolved Solids , or TDS , a mixture of salt and other minerals that lie deep underground .
Drilling wastewater contains so much TDS that it can be five times as salty as sea water .
Large quantities of TDS can clog machinery and affect the color , taste and odor of drinking water – precisely the problems reported along the Monongahela .
While TDS is n’t considered particularly harmful to people , it can damage freshwater streams , which is what happened when TDS levels spiked in Dunkard Creek this month .
West Virginia ’s DEP is investigating whether TDS - laden wastewater from a coal mine near the creek could be to blame .
It is also investigating reports that wastewater from natural gas wells may have been illegally dumped into the stream .
Gas drilling companies currently dispose of their wastewater in Pennsylvania ’s municipal sewage plants , which then discharge it into rivers and streams .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns against this form of treatment , because the plants are n’t equipped to remove TDS or any of the chemicals the water may contain .
Of even more concern , TDS can disrupt the plants ’ treatment of ordinary sewage , including human waste .
A lack of capacity
When U.S. Steel and Allegheny Energy complained about the Monongahela ’s water in 2008 , the DEP found almost twice as much TDS as the agency considers safe .
DEP officials blamed some of the problem on the river ’s low flow last summer and on abandoned mines that have leaked TDS into the river for decades .
What apparently tipped the balance , however , was the drilling wastewater that nine sewage plants were discharging into the river .
Steve Rhodes , president of the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association , an industry trade group , argues that most of the TDS came from abandoned mines , not from drilling wastewater .
A study prepared for a different trade group came to the same conclusion .
Rhodes also says Pennsylvania ’s waterways " are not anywhere near " their capacity to handle TDS and that the DEP ’s estimate of how much wastewater the industry produces is " completely exaggerated . "
DEP chief John Hanger is confident his agency can control the wastewater problem .
In April drilling companies began temporarily trucking their wastewater to other states or to sewage treatment plants in other parts of Pennsylvania : the idea is to dilute it by spreading it among more rivers .
Hanger said a more permanent solution will begin on Jan. 1 , 2011 , when he has promised that new regulations will be in place requiring that the wastewater be treated by plants capable of removing TDS .
But an examination of public records , visits to sewage treatment plants , and extensive interviews with state officials by ProPublica reveal flaws in the DEP ’s plans .
Currently , no plant in Pennsylvania has the technology to remove TDS , and it ’s unlikely that new plants capable of doing so can be built by 2011 .
The company whose bid is furthest along in the permitting process says its plant wo n’t be ready until at least 2013 .
And at its peak that plant would be able to treat only 400,000 gallons of wastewater a day .
The DEP would need 50 plants that size to process all the wastewater expected by 2011 .
In the meantime , the DEP is allowing municipal sewage plants to continue taking drilling wastewater , even though none of them can remove TDS .
" That ’s not what these municipal plants are designed to handle – the DEP is inviting legal problems as well as environmental problems , " said Bruce Baizel , a senior attorney for the Oil and Gas Accountability Project , a Colorado - based nonprofit that focuses on the environmental impact of natural gas drilling .
As the DEP ’s responsibilities continue to grow , its operating budget could be slashed :
The state legislature ’s latest draft of Pennsylvania ’s 2010 budget calls for a 25 percent cut in DEP funding .
Caught off guard
Hanger says Pennsylvania ’s extensive experience with oil drilling – the first oil well in the country was drilled here in 1859 — has prepared it to quickly deal with gas drilling problems .
But ProPublica found that the DEP was caught off guard by the amount of wastewater the industry would produce when drilling began in the Marcellus Shale , a deeply buried layer of rock that some analysts say holds enough gas to meet the nation ’s natural gas needs for more than 20 years .
When energy prices spiked in 2008 , drillers flocked to Pennsylvania , bringing sorely needed revenue and jobs .
A recent Pennsylvania State University study touted the benefits drilling brought last year : 29,000 jobs and $ 240 million in state and local taxes .
Even the industry ’s wastewater promised profits .
" Cha-ching ! " is how Francis Geletko , financial director for the sewage plant in Clairton , described his first thought when he learned that drillers would pay five cents a gallon to get their wastewater processed at his plant .
The 1960s - era facility is in such desperate need of modernization that workers still use shovels to remove solid waste from its traps and filters .
Many of the state ’s plants are similarly outdated : A recent report commissioned by Gov. Ed Rendell concluded that Pennsylvania needs to spend $ 100 billion over the next 20 years to maintain its aging sewage plants and pipelines .
Plant operators say the DEP did n’t initially offer them much guidance about processing the water , a complaint the DEP does n’t dispute .
Ed Golanka , who manages a sewage plant in Charleroi , said that when he checked with the DEP nobody told him that state and federal laws required his plant to get an amendment to its permit before accepting industrial wastewater .
The amendment would require expensive modifications that Charleroi could n’t afford , he said .
" At the time it was a new subject for all of us , " Golanka said .
" There was a limited amount of conversation [ with the DEP ] until the issue with TDS last summer . "
Aunkst , the DEP ’s director of water standards , said he did n’t know the plants along the Monongahela were accepting the water until the spring of 2008 , when people complained about long lines of trucks idling at sewage treatment plants .
But the agency was so short - staffed that it did n’t respond to the complaints immediately .
Aunkst said many DEP regulators had left for more lucrative jobs with drilling companies .
" As the industry was ramping up , we were ramping down , " he said .
" In order for us to really catch these people we have to almost have an inspector coincidentally there on the day that these trucks pull up , because we have so many facilities and so few staff . "
The DEP is supposed to inspect the plants once a year , but ProPublica found that most inspections are triggered by pollution violations or equipment failures .
A review of inspection records at the DEP ’s Pittsburgh office showed that only three of the nine plants along the Monongahela were inspected in the year before Allegheny Energy and U.S. Steel complained .
One plant had n’t been inspected in five years .
DEP officials warned that those records may not have been complete , because inspection reports are n’t filed electronically and pages from the files may have been sitting on an employee ’s desk during the two days when ProPublica was there in March .
Inspections occur even less frequently at sites where wells are drilled .
According to minutes taken at an October 2008 meeting of DEP officials , the agency has so few inspectors that they visit gas wells only once every 10 years .
After Aunkst heard about the trucks , he wrote a letter to all the state ’s sewage plants , reminding them that they could n’t take the wastewater without a special permit .
But before he sent it , TDS levels in the Monongahela skyrocketed , causing U.S. Steel and Allegheny Energy to complain .
The chain of events made Aunkst remember two other peculiar incidents :
Two creeks had been sucked dry , and DEP inspectors suspected that drilling companies had withdrawn the water to fracture nearby wells .
" We were trying to scramble , to put it bluntly , to get our act together to figure out how we were going to address these withdrawals as well as the disposal issues , " Aunkst said .
The DEP did two things to quickly lower the Monongahela ’s TDS level .
It unlocked [ 18 ] dams upriver to flush out some of the TDS .
And it ordered nearby sewage treatment plants to reduce the amount of drilling wastewater they accepted to just 1 percent of the total amount of water that flowed through their plants each day .
The cut shocked the industry .
Trucking water to distant sites is far more expensive than treating it locally , and some drillers threatened to take their rigs to other states if they could n’t dispose of their water in Pennsylvania .
" Basically , it shuts us down , " Lou D’Amico , executive director of the Independent Oil and Gas Association of Pennsylvania , told a local newspaper .
" We ca n’t generate fluids we ca n’t dispose of . "
The DEP issued a news release assuring the public that the TDS was " not considered a major human health risk …
But under the circumstances , if consumers have concerns , DEP recommends consumers use bottled water for drinking and preparing food until the exceedance is eliminated . "
Some sewage plant operators were so alarmed that they stopped taking any wastewater at all .
But by January , the uproar had subsided .
TDS levels in the Monongahela were back to normal and plant operators began accepting the wastewater again , although in smaller quantities .
" We did n’t want to be the ones to stop the economy from growing in this area , and we felt that we were helping the country become energy independent , " said Joe Rost , chief engineer at a sewage plant in McKeesport , 14 miles south of Pittsburgh .
Setting goals
Federal guidelines specifically recommend against sending drilling wastewater to ordinary sewage plants , as Pennsylvania is doing now , because it might damage the plants and taint drinking water supplies .
But the EPA approved Pennsylvania ’s plan , because the DEP promised to have more aggressive regulations in place by 2011 .
" Every time you set an aggressive goal generally you have a transition period to get there , " said Jon Capacasa , the EPA ’s top mid-Atlantic water pollution enforcer .
To keep the water safe until then , the DEP has promised to add more TDS monitors along the Monongahela , although they have n’t been installed yet .
And before the DEP allows a sewage plant to accept drilling wastewater , the agency will assess the current TDS level in the stream where the water will be discharged , to make sure it can handle the additional load .
The DEP also has promised to tighten TDS discharge standards by 2011 , so that all drilling wastewater will be treated in plants capable of removing TDS .
The agency has streamlined the permitting process for companies that want to build the new plants .
But when ProPublica interviewed spokesmen for eight of the 17 plants that have been proposed , all of them said it will be impossible to begin operating by the 2011 deadline .
A spokesman for Larson Design Group , whose application is furthest along in the process , expects that after it gets its permit it will need at least 40 months to build the plant and begin operating .
Temporary lull
Drilling has slowed in Pennsylvania this year , because natural gas prices have dipped to about a third of what they were at the peak of the boom last summer .
But the lull will almost certainly be temporary .
The DEP expects to issue permits for approximately 700 wells in the Marcellus Shale in 2009 , up from 450 in 2008 .
" Companies are willing to get these permits now because they know that competition is going to heat up , " said Raoul LeBlanc , a senior financial consultant at PFC Energy , which provides financial and political advice to energy companies and governments .
" When prices rise they will want to be the first to drill more wells . "
Congress is preparing for the expansion , too .
A group of Democratic legislators have introduced a bill that would allow the federal government to regulate the hydraulic fracturing drilling process under the Safe Drinking Water Act .
The bill prompted an immediate backlash from the oil and gas industry , which says state agencies like the DEP are doing a good job of regulating drilling .
Even if the bill is passed , however , it wo n’t directly address Pennsylvania ’s most pressing drilling - related problem : protecting the state ’s water supply against the coming onslaught of wastewater .
Joaquin Sapien is an investigative reporter for ProPublica , an independent , non-profit newsroom that produces journalism in the public interest .
Amid an overall drop in arrests of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S - Mexico border , an intriguing anomaly has cast a new light on human smuggling : Authorities report an almost tenfold spike in the number of Chinese people caught in the southern Arizona desert , the busiest smuggling corridor on the international line .
The Border Patrol in the Tucson sector has arrested at least 261 Chinese border - crossers this year , compared with an annual average of 32 during the last four years , officials said .
“ They are the main [ non-Mexicans ] we catch , ” said field operations supervisor Juventino Pacheco of the patrol ’s international liaison unit in Nogales .
“ Lately we have been catching more Chinese than Central Americans . ”
When agents find Chinese migrants -- hiding in gulches , perhaps , or huddled in smugglers ’ vehicles -- they often request help from Dean Delap , the sector ’s only Mandarin - speaking agent .
He taught and studied in China , but had not expected that to prove valuable in Nogales .

“ Some are cooperative , ” Delap said .
“ Some are scared .
They ’ve just been arrested , they are in a new place .
I put them at ease . ”
Chinese remain a small fraction of the overall number processed at the Nogales station -- which guards 31 miles abutting Nogales , Mexico .
The Tucson sector , where the Nogales station is located , recorded about 226,000 apprehensions this year .
That is a 24 % decline from the last fiscal year -- reflecting the impact of both the U.S. economic crisis and tougher border enforcement , officials said .
The great majority of those arrested were Mexicans .
Chinese belong to a category known in the Border Patrol as OTMs : other than Mexicans .
And they are big business for smuggling gangs that increasingly have overlapped with Mexico ’s violent drug mafias .

Highest fees
Mexicans typically pay smugglers about $ 1,500 for help crossing the sun-seared landscape , which is as dangerous as it is majestic .
The fees for Central Americans and South Americans often reach $ 6,000 .
A group of Haitians , intercepted a few years ago in Tucson after three nights spent hiking in circles in a canyon , had coughed up $ 10,000 ; another $ 10,000 was to have been paid upon arrival in the Chicago area .
The Chinese -- nearly all of them from Fujian province -- pay the most .
They often have to work off debts of $ 30,000 to $ 70,000 over several years as indentured servants in the sweatshops and kitchens of New York and other cities .

Sophisticated Asian mafias organize intricate journeys to the U.S. A typical route leads from Beijing to Rome to Caracas , Venezuela , to Mexico City to the border , according to Matthew Allen , chief agent of the Phoenix office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
“ It ’s much more elaborate ” than smuggling Latin Americans , Allen said .
“ Waiting in hotel rooms , calls on cellphones , code words .
. . .
The trend [ in increased arrests ] stands out as apprehensions are going down overall . ”
But the uptick in arrests of Chinese does not necessarily reflect a major influx from that country , officials said .
Statistical barometers are imperfect .
High - priced smugglers are better at dodging defenses , so it ’s hard to assess the correlation between arrests , crossing rates and the number who succeed in illegally immigrating .

Nothing new
Chinese smuggling made headlines at its peak in the early 1990s , when flotillas carrying would - be immigrants swarmed the coasts of Southern California , Mexico and Central America .
Ten people died in June 1993 when the ship Golden Venture ran aground in New York carrying 286 immigrants , more than the total captured this year at the Arizona border .

A crackdown at sea and tighter political asylum rules reduced the flow .
Today , Asian smugglers favor air routes , exploiting favorable visa policies for Chinese travelers in countries including Ecuador , Honduras and Venezuela , which are hubs for their travel to Mexico , officials said .
U.S. investigators have gathered intelligence about thousands of Chinese who have settled temporarily in Ecuador with the intention of sneaking into the United States , according to a high - ranking federal official who requested anonymity when discussing the international surveillance .
“ The smugglers are attuned to nuances in South American visa policies , and will adapt , ” Allen said .

The number of Chinese apprehended along the Southwest boundary fluctuates .
Borderwide arrests hit 2,060 in the 2006 fiscal year , dipped to near 700 during the next two years , and then rose to 1,221 as of August , according to the Border Patrol .
The patrol ’s McAllen sector in south Texas , a high - volume corridor for non-Mexicans because of its relative proximity to Central America , led all sectors with at least 667 arrests of Chinese by August , officials say .
But proportionally , the Tucson area experienced the most dramatic surge .
One reason for that , officials said : the convergence of drugs and illegal immigrants in the Sonora - Arizona area .
The dominant drug mafia in the region , the Sinaloa cartel , “ saw an opportunity to get into Chinese smuggling , ” said Border Patrol spokesman Mario Escalante .
Advertisement
The evolving alliance between traffickers of drugs and of immigrants -- once separate specialties -- is complex .
According to investigators , drug lords use their firepower to control turf and tax others for the use of border corridors , known in Spanish as plazas , charging $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 a week .
“ The drug trafficking organizations in the plazas control who smuggles , what they smuggle , where they smuggle , ” Allen said .

At times , when drug mafias are at war or when moving drug loads is difficult , muscling in on the human smuggling racket brings easy profit and less risk , Pacheco said .
And whereas violent retaliation is common among drug traffickers after a big bust , it ’s less so among smugglers whose immigrants are caught .
“ Losing Chinese , you lose money but not an investment upfront , ” Pacheco said .
“ They do n’t buy the Chinese , they charge them . ”
Nonetheless , Allen said , “ the drug and alien smuggling groups are still separate entities .
Once human smugglers make it into the U.S. with their loads , there is not coordination . ”

Chinese immigrants intercepted by the Border Patrol have often spent months on the road .
“ Some speak a few words of Spanish , ” Delap said .
“ Most of them communicate with hand gestures and body language . ”
Delap , who majored in political science and minored in Chinese at Brigham Young University , taught English in Yunnan and Xinjiang provinces eight years ago .
He has been with the Border Patrol two years .
He sees the chance to use his knowledge of Chinese language and culture as one humanitarian aspect of the Border Patrol , which frequently rescues immigrants from the desert .

Although his conversations with Chinese immigrants focus on basic information , it is clear that his presence is reassuring .
“ A lot of times at the end of the shift when I have to go , they realize that and a lot of questions come flooding out :
Where are they going , when will they be leaving the detention facility , what will happen , ” he said .
“ I explain the best I can . ”

The death toll from Sunday ’s massive suicide car bomb attacks in Baghdad has risen to 155 , with another 500 wounded , the Aswat al - Iraq news agency has reported .
The enormous blasts targeted three government buildings – the Justice Ministry , the Ministry of Public Works , and the Baghdad provincial council , where 10 members of Parliament were attending a meeting .
All three buildings were destroyed .
The bombings , the deadliest in two years , took place along a road filled with traffic and set more than 150 vehicles on fire , incinerating entire families .
The attacks occurred just before Iraqi political leaders were to meet to work out a compromise on a disputed election law that is needed to allow national elections to happen on time in January .
The meeting was held but did not reach an agreement and will re-convene next Monday .
The elections are seen as essential to ensuring the scheduled U.S. military pullout goes forward .
In Iraq , the bloody attacks were widely blamed on remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime and other elements seeking to destabilize the country .
“ They are targeting the government and the political process in the country , ” an Iraqi Army spokesman , Maj . General Qassim Atta , told reporters .
“ It ’s about the election , ” Salman , a Kurdish man looking for a car left behind by his injured brother , told a UK Times reporter .
“ It ’s a way of influencing politics . ”
The blasts yesterday underscored how violence in Iraq has changed its nature in the recent period .
Overall , violent attacks have dropped sharply compared to a year ago , and are different from the broad - scale sectarian violence that was rampant a year or two ago .
Sunday ’s attacks fit into a new pattern targeting politicians , government officials and buildings , and police and security officers .
Yesterday ’s bombings were the second major attack on key government buildings in the past few months .
On Aug. 19 , coordinated attacks now referred to as “ Bloody Wednesday ” destroyed the Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry buildings in Baghdad , leaving more than 100 people dead and more than 1,000 wounded .
With the U.S. preparing to withdraw its troops from Iraq , January ’s national elections will set Iraq ’s direction for the post - occupation period .
The aim of the violence now , many U.S. and Iraqi analysts say , is to undermine the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , hurt his chances of re-election in next January ’s vote , and at the same time to delay or disrupt that election if possible .
Many in Iraq have warned that violence would increase as the January elections approach .
Iraqis say die - hard former Baathists are using the attacks as a bargaining chip , hoping to enlist the U.S. in their efforts to regain a political foothold .
Some of these elements fear that with a U.S. withdrawal they will lose this kind of leverage .
In a strongly worded statement yesterday , the Iraqi Communist Party called the attackers “ professional killers and criminals . ”
“ In addition to inflicting harm upon the Iraqi people , the aim is once again to sabotage the ongoing political process in our country , and to create the conditions for its reversal and to return Iraq to the rule of dictatorship and tyranny , ” the statement said .
In yesterday ’s attack , initial investigations suggested that each suicide vehicle was loaded with more than 1,500 pounds of explosives , the UK Times reported .
The blasts were so powerful that they swept away protective blast walls , blew out windows on surrounding buildings and tore deep craters into roads , shattering water mains .
The magnitude of the explosives indicated that these were highly organized and well - financed operations .
“ It is no coincidence that this new crime of genocide , that has been designed and implemented to spread death and destruction on the widest possible scale , has targeted the headquarters of two ministries and the offices of Baghdad ’s provincial council , ” the Iraqi Communist Party said .
“ It is also no coincidence that the people , who are the victims of the barbaric series of crimes by terrorist gangs , are holding the remnants of Saddam ’s Baath party , al - Qaeda , militias and organized crime responsible . ”
Iraqis charge that some of these groups are getting help from surrounding countries who want to keep Iraq in turmoil .
Maliki sent a message to the UN Secretary General and the Security Council demanding the “ formation of an international panel to investigate the assaults . ”
Despite the new bloodshed , the Communist Party urged Iraq ’s political forces to “ overcome their differences and live up to the challenges , and to accelerate the resolution of outstanding political issues , notably the issue of the election law . ”
This is the only way to rid the country of foreign occupation and build a democratic Iraqi state , the party says .

Text Size A A
Wherever there 's a happy hour , there 's allosteric modulation .
Although researchers are only beginning to understand how the ethanol in a keg of beer or a snifter of brandy works on a molecular level , they do know that it interacts with targets at allosteric sites , which are areas of a protein outside the site that binds the natural ligands .
That knowledge may lead to new treatments for alcoholism .
" Ethanol is an unusual drug molecule — it 's very small with little structural complexity , and we take it in quantities more like food than like a prescription , " says R. Adron Harris , a pharmacologist at the University of Texas , Austin .
Compared with a typical medication , the amount of alcohol that elicits biological effects is astronomical .
A blood - alcohol concentration of 0.08 % , the level that in many states classifies a person as legally drunk , equates to an ethanol concentration of 17 mM , whereas a typical drug acts at the nanomolar range .
" To a pharmacologist , this is really strange , " Harris says .
" Everyone wondered how ethanol was working . "
Until the 1980s , scientists thought that alcohol simply interacted with lipids , affecting the cell membrane 's fluidity and nonspecifically altering how neurons functioned .
People did n't think that a molecule as tiny as ethanol flooding receptors at high concentrations could have specific protein targets , Harris explains .
Biophysicists Nicholas P. Franks and William R. Lieb of Imperial College London played a big role in dispelling that idea .
When they treated luciferase — the enzyme that fireflies use to make light — with alcohols , they found that the chemicals lowered the light output ( Nature 1984 , 310 , 599 ) .
Since luciferase is lipid - free and not in the membrane yet is still sensitive to alcohols , that meant , in principle , that a protein could account for alcohol action , Harris says .
After that , " people started finding that some proteins were more sensitive to ethanol than others , " says Richard W. Olsen , a pharmacologist at the University of California , Los Angeles .
In particular , ethanol affects ion channels in the brain , including the glycine receptor , certain types of glutamate receptors , and the GABAA receptor , which is also the target of Valium , the blockbuster sedative that eventually was found to work through an allosteric mechanism .
Ethanol boosts the activity of some receptors while lowering that of others .
Other potential targets , picked up mostly in genetic studies , have varying amounts of support in the literature .
It was soon clear that ethanol works allosterically .
Radioligand - binding assays conducted by several independent groups suggest that ethanol does n't bind where naturally occurring ligands do , Harris says .
Ethanol " does n't activate receptors on its own — it is interfering with or changing natural functions , " Olsen adds .
While researchers can demonstrate ethanol 's allosteric mode of action , the specifics remain to be worked out .
The most detailed explorations have been on GABAA and glycine receptors .
With the help of a radiolabeled small molecule , Olsen 's group proposed an allosteric site for ethanol action on the GABAA receptor ( Proc. Natl .
Acad. Sci. USA 2006 , 103 , 8540 and 8546 ) .
Many researchers mutate receptors to identify ethanol - sensitive targets in the protein .
Daryl L. Davies , a neuropharmacologist at the University of Southern California , searches for ethanol sites of action on glycine and GABAA receptors in just this way ( J. Biol .
Chem. 2009 , 284 , 27304 ) .
To nail down sites of action , it would be handy to have X - ray crystal structures of putative protein targets of ethanol , but most are membrane - spanning proteins and so are tough to crystallize , Harris says .
Among the scant data the field has to go on is a structure ( shown ) of butanol ( green = carbon ) bound to LUSH , a cheekily named protein in fruit flies that helps them avoid toxic concentrations of alcohols .
When LUSH is mutated , flies throw caution to the wind , flocking to cognac and similarly strong spirits .
Most alcohol - addiction drugs work downstream of ethanol action or on ethanol metabolism , says Robert O. Messing , a neurologist and senior associate director of the University of California , San Francisco 's Ernest Gallo Clinic & Research Center , a leading center for the study of substance abuse .
If researchers could conclusively identify allosteric sites where ethanol exerts its effects , it might spur renewed drug discovery efforts for more direct - acting antialcoholism medications .
The path ahead is not yet clear , but the potential to help the millions struggling with alcoholism keeps the field going .

The origins of Human Religious Behavior
Throughout the history of psychology , the topic of human religiosity has been referred to as a learned behavior .
In other words a person 's religion is the final outcome of the person 's interaction with his environment .
Therefore the assumption is that if you are born in a Christian country , you are going to be a Christian .
Theoretically , since the person has been exposed to his religion from early childhood , it would be quite unlikely that he would choose a different religion or have the desire or the need to practice something else .
Although , we do see occasional cases of conversion of single individuals from one religion to another religion , mass conversions are usually rare and mostly are caused by wars and force .
Although , the followers of great religions of the world do not like to admit this historical fact , an honest historian would admit that my ancestors ' conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam was only achieved by sword .
The same is true for natives of South America becoming Christians .
Their faith was sealed by Spaniard swords .
Interestingly , the forceful attempts to make a population atheist have never worked .
The most famous historical example of these attempts is Stalin 's brutal confrontation of religiosity .
Stalin did not look at religion as just " opium of the masses " he looked at it as a menace for the society and considered clergymen as parasites .
Stalin 's method of dealing with religion was the same method that he used in dealing with anything ... elimination .
His answer was total elimination of religion .
He ordered all mosques , churches and temples to be burned , as well as the killing of all clergy .
It should be noted that upon the collapse of the Soviet Union the first changes included reappearance of mosques , churches , temples and clergymen .
In other words you can force people to convert to a different religion , but you cannot force them to become an atheist , as if they can not live with out it .
The Case for the Organic Nature of human religiosity .
The idea of hereditary causes of human religiosity was originally introduced by Charles Darwin .
This idea is articulated in his autobiography :
This conclusion was strong in my mind about the time , as far as I can remember , when I Wrote the Origin of Species ; and it is since that time that it has very gradually with many fluctuations become weaker .
But then arises the doubt can the mind of man , which has , as I fully believe , been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal , be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions ?
May not these be the result of the connection between cause and effect , which strikes us as a necessary one , but probably depends merely on inherited experience ?
Nor must we overlook the probability of the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children producing so strong and perhaps an inherited effect on their brains not yet fully developed , that it would be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God , as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear and hatred of a snake " .
Charles Darwin , Autobiography , 1887
It is known that Darwin personally delayed publication of his " Origin of Species " by twenty years .
The cause of this delay was not his fear of the response to his introduction of the theory of evolution , rather , he feared the response to his assertions on the organic nature of human religiosity , which was totally unacceptable at that time .
It should be noted that 1250 copies of the first edition of " the origin of species " was published in London ; all 1250 copies were sold on the first day .
The evidences for organic nature of human religiosity
There is a general rule in psychology that universal behaviors have organic causes .
And consequently their origin could be traced to human brain .
For example all human beings manifest sexual behavior as well as aggression .
These behaviors are seen universally , in all cultures at all times .
Therefore , if one runs into a person who is totally devoid of sexuality or aggression , .
One can assume that the person is suffering from some kind of disease or condition .
If one examines the human brain one can easily locate those parts of the brain which are in charge of sexual and aggressive behaviors .
At the same time if one cannot locate the original site of a universal behavior it does not mean that the behavior does not have an origin in the human brain .
It just means that one does not have the instrumentation or the knowledge to find it .

CNN last week took steps to repair its tattered image with the Latino community by running a heart - warming series , Latino in America , that does a reasonable job of exploring the realities of daily life the nation 's fastest - growing minority bloc .
But what they really do n't want to talk about is Lou Dobbs -- the most Latino - bashing media figure of them all .
And it 's already biting them in the butt , as the New York Times noted this weekend :
CNN , a unit of Time Warner , has not commented on the protests or covered them on its news programs .
One of the activists featured in the documentary said she tried to raise what she called Mr. Dobbs ’s “ hatred ” on one of the channel ’s news programs Wednesday , but her remarks were cut from the interview .
...
Privately , when some executives are asked about the Dobbs complaints , they sometimes cite the production of “ Latino in America , ” with the implication being that the channel presents many points of view .
The documentary , which drew an average of about 900,000 viewers on Wednesday and Thursday , follows two editions of “ Black in America . ”
It presented Hispanic activists with a new rallying point this fall .
Isabel Garcia , a civil rights lawyer who was featured in “ Latino in America ” and organized an anti-Dobbs protest in Tucson on Wednesday , said that CNN edited her comments about the anchor out of an interview .
She had expected a 15 - minute conversation about immigration opposite Joe Arpaio , the sheriff of Maricopa County , Ariz . , and a staunch supporter in immigration enforcement , on the prime - time program “ Anderson Cooper 360 . ”
During the taped interview Wednesday , she said she made several unprompted comments about Mr. Dobbs .
She said she called Mr. Arpaio and Mr. Dobbs “ the two most dangerous men to our communities , ” and said that “ because of them , our communities are being terrorized in a real way . ”
She also asserted that CNN was “ promoting lies and hate about our community ” by broadcasting Mr. Dobbs ’s program .
The comments were not included when the interview was shown Wednesday night .
“ They heavily deleted what I did get to say , ” she said .
CNN said the segment in question was tied to “ Latino in America . ”
“ As with all pre-taped interviews , they are edited for time and relevance to the topic of discussion , ” a spokeswoman said .
“ The debate between Isabel Garcia and Joe Arpaio was no exception . ”
Yeah , right .
And Dobbs ' birther coverage never promoted any conspiracy theories , either .
Basta Dobbs has been organizing a Dobbs advertising boycott , as well as protests of CNN by Latinos last week to coincide with the broadcast of Latinos in America :
“ Our message to CNN is clear :
You can not have it both ways .
It ’s either promotion of hatred by Lou Dobbs or real news regarding the Latino community , ” said Isabel Garcia , a prominent civil and human rights attorney in Arizona who is highlighted in the “ Latino in America ” series and who is also participating in the BastaDobbs.com effort .
“ Lou Dobbs abuses the CNN platform to dehumanize and spread fear about Latinos and immigrants .
It is no surprise that hard - working Latinos in this country are increasingly victims of hate - motivated violence , ” added Angelica Salas , executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles ( CHIRLA ) .
“ CNN must be accountable to one of the largest minority groups in the United States if it seeks to gain their following and respect ” .
It 's becoming evident that CNN has told Dobbs to chill .
Unlike any similar time period in the past eight years , Dobbs has done only a handful of segments on immigration in the past couple of months .
Of course , when he has discussed it , he can't help referring to comprehensive immigration reform as " amnesty " and fetishizing over the " amnesty question " -- as he did last week :

The cutest picture of a rabbit in a bee costume you ’ll ever see
Federal investigators reported on Monday that a “ strong association ” exists between chemicals in Chinese drywall installed in thousands of homes during the housing boom and electrical problems in those homes .
In addition , investigators said that the drywall was a possible cause of respiratory problems reported by homeowners , brought on by hydrogen sulfide gas emitted from the imported drywall in combination with formaldehyde , which is common in new homes .
The finding , released by the Consumer Product Safety Commission , is the second in a series of progress reports on a widespread investigation into complaints by homeowners that their newly built homes were giving off a rotten egg odor and causing respiratory problems , and that appliances and electrical systems were failing quickly .
More than 2,100 homeowners , mainly in Florida , Louisiana and Virginia , have complained to the government of problems with their homes .
Those three states experienced a home construction boom after devastating hurricanes .
With domestic sources of drywall running low a few years ago , many home builders turned to imported drywall from China , which investigators now say is linked to many of the homeowners ’ problems .
Although statins are widely used to prevent heart attacks , strokes , and other cardiovascular disorders , new research shows that the class of drugs may actually have negative effects on some cardiac patients .
A new study presented at CHEST 2009 , the 75th annual international scientific assembly of the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) , found that statins have beneficial effects on patients with systolic heart failure ( SHF ) , but those with diastolic heart failure ( DHF ) experienced the opposite effect , including increased dyspnea , fatigue , and decreased exercise tolerance .
" Systolic heart failure is most often due to coronary artery disease and appears to have more of an inflammatory component than diastolic heart failure , " said Lawrence P. Cahalin , PhD , PT , Northeastern University , Boston , MA .
" It is possible that statins would help patients with systolic heart failure more than patients with diastolic heart failure due to the cholesterol - lowering and antiinflammatory effects of statins . "
Researchers from Northeastern University and Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , MA , retrospectively reviewed the charts of 136 patients with heart failure in order to examine the effect of statins on pulmonary function ( PF ) and exercise tolerance ( ET ) in patients with DHF vs. SHF .
A non-statin group ( 82 percent of patients had DHF ) of 75 patients was compared with a statin group ( 72 percent of patients had DHF ) of 61 patients .
Atorvastatin was prescribed in 75 percent of the patients on statins .
Results of the analysis showed that overall PF and ET of patients in the statin group were significantly lower than patients in the non-statin group .
Further subgroup analyses revealed that PF measures in the DHF statin group were 12 percent lower than PF measures in the DHF non-statin group .
Furthermore , the amount of exercise performed by patients with DHF who were on a statin was almost 50 percent less than patients with DHF not on a statin .
" Some patients with diastolic heart failure may be more prone to the adverse effect of statins on muscle .
It may be that patients with particular preexisting factors will experience unfavorable results from statin therapy , including exercise intolerance , dyspnea , and fatigue , " said Dr. Cahalin .
Although the PF and ET measures in the SHF statin group were not significantly greater than in the SHF non-statin group , the PF measures were 11 percent to 14 percent higher , and the peak ET measures were 2 percent to 7 percent higher than the PF and ET measures of the SHF non-statin group , suggesting that statins did benefit patients with SHF .
" Not all statins are alike and not all patients are alike .
Some statins are stronger than others and are likely to act differently , given particular patient characteristics , and produce different degrees of wanted and unwanted effects , " said Dr. Cahalin .
" In our continuing study , we hope to identify patient characteristics that are associated with favorable and less than favorable results from statin therapy . "
Although the new data suggest that statins may actually worsen symptoms in patients with DHF , researchers feel that the benefits of using statins in patients with SHF and DHF outweigh the risks .
" Due to beneficial effects on lipids and other cardiovascular factors , statins are becoming a standard treatment for many patients with or without systolic or diastolic heart failure .
It is likely that the use of statins for these conditions will continue to increase , " said Dr. Cahalin .
" However , if patients taking a statin are short of breath , fatigued , and unable to exercise or perform functional tasks , then exams of muscle strength and endurance , as well as pulmonary function and exercise tolerance , are warranted . "
" Statins provide significant benefits for patients with cardiovascular disease , said Kalpalatha Guntupalli , MD , FCCP , President of the American College of Chest Physicians .
" However , as for any new medication prescribed , clinicians should closely monitor the effects that different types of statins have on individual patients . "

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
Citing pressure from the European Commission 's antitrust enforcers , ING on Monday announced a sweeping plan to break itself apart as well as to repay some of the state aid that Holland has provided .
ING ING , +0.14 % ( INGA ) said it will divest the units that comprise its insurance arm by sale or initial public offering over the next four years .
" Splitting the company is not a decision we took lightly , " Chief Executive Jan Hommen said , noting the scale , capital efficiency and earnings stability benefits from the existing structure .
But demands for greater transparency , simplicity and reliability took greater priority .
The moves will end up reducing ING 's balance sheet by 600 billion euros when compared with Sept. 30 , 2008 levels , a drop of 45 % .
The E.C. also required Germany 's Commerzbank ( CBK ) to reduce its size and the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) and Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY ) may be formally told to sell off assets after receiving state aid .
Lloyds on Monday announced the sale of a relatively small unit as reports grow that the U.K. bank is on the verge of a multi-billion - dollar rights issue .
Jan Hommen , Chief Executive Officer of ING Reuters
ING 's Hommen , during a conference call , repeatedly stressed that the sale of different divisions wo n't be done at fire - sale prices , pointing to other assets the Dutch lender has already disposed .
ING shares dropped around 3 % at the start of the day , but later in the session , ING shares dropped 9.7 % to 10.53 euros .
U.S. shares also nursed double - digit - percentage falls in early action .
" While a deal does reduce the uncertainty and the third - quarter results look solid , an immediate capital raising of 7.5 billion euros , 2 billion euros more than we had calculated , and more radical surgery on the ongoing business mean our target price is under review , " said Keefe , Bruyette & Woods analyst Christopher Hitchings in a note .
It would have been " much more complicated to split off the bank , " Hommen added , and just hiving off ING into separate insurance and banking arms would n't generate proceeds to repay the Dutch government .
ING separately announced a 7.5 billion euro rights issue -- the issue of discounted shares to existing holders -- as it said it will repay 5 billion euros , or half , of state aid it 's received .
It 's going to take a 1.3 billion euro fourth - quarter charge , to account for the risk transfer the Dutch government absorbed in guaranteeing its portfolio of Alt - A mortgages .
ING will pay a premium between 333 million and 691 million euros to the Dutch state depending on whether its stock price is above 11.16 euros .
That premium of 12 % to 19 % is steeper than the 10 % Aegon ( AGN ) was assessed .
ING also put its ING Direct USA unit on the block but said it 's not likely to sell that unit until the end of 2013 .
Selling the unit was a stipulation of the E.C. regulators .
Hommen declined to characterize the back - and - forth negotiations with the regulators during the analyst call .
The European regulators also required ING not to be a price leader in retail and small - to medium - sized business banking until all the Dutch aid has been repaid .
ING also reported preliminary third - quarter results , expecting a 500 million euro profit for the third quarter after divestments and special items .
Excluding those , its profit climbed to 750 million euros from 229 million euros .
It took write - downs of 850 million euros on its portfolio of investments on debt and real estate investments , including 550 million euros on Alt - A residential mortgage - backed securities .
Stem cell research is making great strides .
This is yet again illustrated by a study carried out by the I - STEM Institute ( France ) , published in the Lancet on 21 November 2009 .
The I - STEM team , directed by Marc Peschanski has succeeded in recreating a whole epidermis from human embryonic stem cells .
The goal is to one day be able to propose this unlimited resource of cells as an alternative treatment in particular for victims of third degree burns and patients with genetic diseases affecting the skin .
These studies were financed in particular by Telethon donations .
Cell therapy has radically changed the life of serious burn victims .
For more than two decades , physicians have used cell culture techniques in order to obtain a sufficiently large area of skin to reconstruct the destroyed epidermis from a small sample harvested from the patients themselves .
Although this type of graft has been used with success , one of its limits is the time required ( three weeks ) to produce a sufficient amount of epidermis to cover the affected areas , leaving the patient unprotected during this interval .
For a few years , research has led to the development of skin substitutes that help protect patients during the period before grafting .
However , these technological means do not rule out the risk of immune rejection and transmission of disease .
Rapid access to an unlimited number of cells capable of yielding a well - formed epidermis , perfectly controlled in the laboratory before use , would therefore be the ideal solution to the problems posed by existing techniques .
For these reasons the I -STEM researchers attempted to reconstruct a whole epidermis using human embryonic stem cells .
A protocol in several stages
Human embryonic stem cells ( hES ) have two fundamental characteristics : a capacity for unlimited proliferation and pluripotency i.e. the capacity to differentiate into all the cell types in the human body .
The first objective of the team was to obtain skin stem cells ( keratinocytes ) similar to those naturally present in the human epidermis from hES cells .
Keratinocytes , permit the constant renewal of the skin .
Once this stage was achieved , the second objective of the researchers consisted in finalising strategies to isolate keratinocyte stem cells in order to test their capacity to reconstitute a functional epidermis firstly in vitro - then in vivo .
" It is these cells that interest us as they are the only cells capable of recreating all the layers of the human epidermis " pointed out Christine Baldeschi .
The transformation of hES cells into epidermal cells was made possible by a combination of cell biology and pharmacological approaches .
A " cell niche " was first created around the ES cells to guide them towards an epidermal destiny and an appropriate pharmacological agent was then added to the culture medium .
The researchers decided to maintain this treatment for the 40 days that is normally required for an embryo to form its epidermis .
By applying this concept of respecting chronobiology , the hES cells engaged in this differentiation process acquired first the markers of a simple epithelium and then finally those of keratinocytes .
A population of cells presenting all the characteristic marker of adult keratinocytes was isolated and then amplified .
It is without doubt by maintaining this treatment for 40 days that the I - STEM team succeeded where many others had failed .
Thanks to the complementarity of the research teams working at I - STEM and the sharing of means , the researchers succeeded in rebuilding in vitro a functional epidermis in which keratinocyte stem cells have all the qualities required for satisfactory function ( self - renewal , stratification and final differentiation properties ) .
It remained to be shown if these results obtained in vitro could be confirmed in vivo .
The final stage therefore consisted in reproducing this protocol in the mouse .
For these experiments , I - STEM collaborated with a Spanish research team specialised in the use of such grafts in animals with a weakened immune system to overcome potential graft rejection .
Twelve weeks after transplantation , the mice presented localized areas of completely normal and functional adult human epidermis containing all the skin cell types .
" Our team is currently the only one to have succeeded in finalising a protocol making it possible to transform human embryonic stem cells into a pure and homogeneous population of keratinocytes able to reconstitute a whole epidermis both in vitro and in vivo . " concluded Marc Peschanski , director of I - STEM .
For the researchers , there are numerous future applications of this work .
These " ready - to- use " cells will be proposed to produce epidermal cells for the treatment of third degree burn victims and also other skin diseases such as genodermatoses or ulcerations which complicate diabetes in a very large number of patients .
" For more than 25 years we have known how to make epidermis with skin stem cells and skin grafts are made in particular for victims of third degree burns .
The keratinocytes obtained from human embryonic stem cells therefore have an immediate clinical application .
We are now therefore seeking how , in concrete terms , to pass to man . " added finally Christine Baldeschi , leader of the team performing this study .
Research on human embryonic stem cells is at the centre of the debate on the bioethics laws .
Since the bioethics law of 2004 , this research is authorized by special dispensation in exceptional cases after submitting protocols to the Biomedecine Agency for an opinion .
The I - STEM team is one of the 28 French teams to have received an authorisation to conduct research on these cells .

The latest Top 500 Supercomputer list is now out ( see my colleague Andy Patrizio's story on InternetNews.com ) , with the top rig doubling its performance to 1.75 petaflops .
Of particular interest to me is the fact that while multi-core CPU's are the hardware components enabling the fastest computers , it is Linux as the operating system the powers the software .
Just over 78 percent of the top 500 supercomputers run some type of Linux .
The official Top 500 Supercomputer site lists 391 of the top 500 supercomputers as using ' Linux ' .
Digging a little deeper , there are 32 additional machines that identify themselves as running some version of Novell 's SUSE Linux Enterprise Server .
There are some 16 that identify Red Hat Linux or one of its derivatives including CentOS .
So doing a little bit of math , at least 88 percent of the list is using some form of Linux , generic or otherwise .
That 's astounding .
The only other operating system that is even noteworthy beyond Linux is IBM 's AIX Unix at 22 systems ( or just over 4 percent ) .
It 's also interesting to see how the list has changed over the past nine years .
Shades of gray in Sammy 's skin
He says he is n't racist , but Sammy Sosa 's new look raises troubling questions .
Is Sammy Sosa trying to look white ?
If you 've seen recent photos of him , it 's a fair question .
The last time most of us saw Sosa , his skin was the color of mahogany .
Now it looks as if he dipped his face in baking powder .
Photos of Sosa at the Latino Grammy Awards last week floated from inbox to inbox and blog to blog , arguably causing as much controversy as his dishonest performance at the congressional steroid hearings in 2005 .
[+]

This is Sosa 's look last week
And just as I did n't believe then that Sosa was steroid - free , I do n't buy now that Sosa 's drastically lightened skin is merely the result of a skin rejuvenation process and an illusion caused by bright TV lights at the awards show .
According to Sosa , who addressed the skin controversy with ESPNDeportes.com 's Enrique Rojas , he is using a cream that " whitens " his skin .
Mostly , Sosa said , it 's a skin softener .
Yeah , and using that corked bat was a " mistake . "
Sosa certainly is n't the first sports figure to use cosmetic assistance -- [ cough ] Jerry Jones -- but when a once - dark - complected man from the Dominican Republic is whitening his skin and wearing green colored contact lenses , it suggests he 's suffering from issues that extend well beyond dermatology .
Sosa 's new look implies that he has a " color complex " -- a term used to describe those who have been brainwashed to believe adopting more " white " features will help them gain mainstream acceptance .
If you do n't believe there 's any racial component to Sosa 's new look , you have n't been paying attention to the backlash he 's been receiving since those photos hit the Web .
Time magazine wrote about it , quoting Chicago dermatologist Dr. Jonith Breadon , who asked " Why would he do this ? "
And during halftime of Tuesday 's NBA broadcast on TNT , Charles Barkley and crew clowned Sosa , even going so far as to paint Barkley 's face in white cream to mock the former Cub .
" I love you , Sammy , " Barkley said , " but c'mon , man ! "
And in the background , analyst Kenny Smith shouted , " Say it loud !
I 'm black and I 'm proud ! "
Although we might never know Sosa 's true motivations for changing his appearance , the consensus is that he lightened his skin in an effort to look whiter .
[+]
Enlarge Andrew H. Walker / Getty Image and this is his look in May .
The same was said about Michael Jackson , even though he was diagnosed with the skin condition vitiligo , which reportedly was the cause of his skin tone 's transformation from caramel to milky white .
But vitiligo never explained the obvious surgical changes to Jackson 's nose and lips .
And using a skin softener does n't explain why Sosa 's eye color and hair texture are suddenly different .
Sosa claimed he's not a " racist , " but that does n't address whether he 's being honest when he says he 's happy being who he is .
" A lot of younger people probably just think Sosa 's weird , " said Dr. Todd Boyd , a professor of critical studies at the USC School of Cinematic Arts .
" Whereas those old enough to remember the days when Ebony magazine still had ads for skin lightening cream on their pages , these people might look at Sammy with a certain amount of disgust and see his actions as the epitome of self - hatred . "
I 've always questioned whether Sosa tried too hard to be accepted by white America .
When Sosa and Mark McGwire teamed up to bring baseball back to relevance with their exciting home run chase in 1998 , Sosa seemed all too eager to play the role of the buffoonish sidekick .
His antics made it easier for Sosa to be accepted as a friendly challenger instead of a villain .
" Sammy never seemed to realize that the joke was on him every time he acted out that Chico Escuela role : ' Baseball been berry , berry good to me , ' " said Boyd , referring to the fictional baseball player Garrett Morris played on " Saturday Night Live . "
" And then all of a sudden he can't speak English when he 's sitting in front of Congress ?
I 'm sure Sammy has his fans , but a lot of people view him as a clown . "
Some of you are probably wondering why Sosa 's skin color is an issue , especially given that white people routinely go to tanning booths to darken their skin , and non-ethnic women receive injections and implants that make their lips look fuller and their behinds bigger .
The difference is history and perception .
Historically , black features have been ridiculed , exaggerated and patronized , often for the amusement of whites .
As a result , some people of color have adopted a negative attitude toward their looks , so when someone like Sosa goes to such lengths to alter his appearance and says -- even in jest -- that he plans to market the product , too , you have to wonder whether there 's an underlying issue of racial identity .
Even though I 'm wary of Sosa 's motives , I believe him when he insists he is n't trying to look like Jackson .
I just wonder why Sosa is n't satisfied looking like himself .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , California ( Reuters ) - New Google
Inc software will start up a computer as fast as a television can be turned on , the search company said on Thursday as it showed off its Chrome operating system designed for PCs that do their work on the Web .

Google gave the first public look at its Chrome OS four months after declaring its intention of developing the PC ’s main software , a move that pits it directly against Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc .
True to Google ’s Internet - pedigree , the Chrome OS resembles a Web browser more than it does a traditional computer operating system like Microsoft Windows , matching Google ’s ambition to drive people to the Web -- where they can see Google ads .
Google said the software will initially be available by the holiday season of 2010 on low - cost netbooks that meet Google ’s hardware specifications , such as using only memory chips to store data instead of slower hard drives , the current standard .
Netbooks running Chrome OS will only be able to run Web applications and the user ’s data will automatically be stored on the Web in the so - called cloud of Internet servers , Google executives said at an event at the company ’s Mountain View , California headquarters on Thursday .
“ It ’s basically a Web browsing machine , ” said Altimeter Group analyst Charlene Li , referring to the netbooks powered by Chrome OS .
Such a machine is made for a world of near - constant , extremely fast Web connection , without the type of software that made Microsoft famous , since most of the work would be done by big machines on the Web which take directions and send information to relatively uncomplicated devices like a Chrome PC .
Sundar Pichai , vice - president of product management for Google ’s Chrome OS , said that computers running Chrome OS will be able to start in less than seven seconds .
“ From the time you press boot you want it to be like a TV :
You turn it on and you should be on the Web using your applications , ” Pichai said .
MORE WEB USE DRIVES MORE GOOGLE ADS
Google said it is giving away the software for free , similar to its Android smartphone software , with the idea that improving the Web experience will ultimately benefit its Internet search advertising business , which generated roughly $ 22 billion in revenue in 2008 .
“ They ’re doing it to get further and further entrenched in whatever people are doing to go online , whether that ’s a browser , an operating system or in applications , ” said Todd Greenwald , an analyst with Signal Hill Group .
“ If Chrome is the OS then the attach ( access ) rate on Google searches will be a lot higher , ” he said .
But analysts noted that the differences between conventional PCs and Chrome OS netbooks might give some consumers pause .
“ If they view it from the conventional perspective , then it falls short , ” Gartner analyst Ray Valdes said of Chrome OS , citing its lack of compatibility with traditional software and its limited offline capabilities .
Google officials said Chrome OS netbooks will be able to provide some functions when offline , but that the product was primarily designed to be connected to the Internet .
But Valdes said if Google can deliver on the products ’ promises , such as fast performance , then consumers may view Chrome OS netbooks as distinct class of products with attractive benefits .
“ I think that it ’s initially going to appeal to small subset of the general consumer population , ” said Valdes .
“ The question is can they build on that and expand that over time . ”
Google made the computer code for the Chrome OS available to outside developers on Thursday , allowing developers to tinker with the software and potentially design new applications to run alongside it .
With Chrome , Google is seeking to challenge the dominance of Microsoft Corp ’s Windows , which runs on nine out of 10 personal computers .
The Chrome OS also challenges makers of traditional , desktop software , including Microsoft and its lucrative Office suite of productivity software , since Chrome OS only runs Web applications .
Google ’s Pichai , noted during a demonstration on Thursday , that Chrome OS - based PCs would be interoperable with Web - based versions of software , such as Microsoft ’s online version of its Excel spreadsheet .
Google said all data in Chrome will automatically be housed in the so - called cloud , or on external servers , but also cached on the computer ’s internal hardware to boost performance .
If a person loses their netbook , Google Engineering Director Matt Papakipos explained , they can buy a new one , log in and within seconds have a machine with access to all the same data as their previous device .
“ What really makes this a cloud device is that all the user data is synced back to the cloud in real time , ” said Papakipos .
Shares of Mountain View , California - based Google fell $ 3.66 to $ 572.99 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq .

Worried that too many tweets are mere pointless babble ?
So is Australia 's Griffith University , who recently made Twitter education part of the mandatory courseload for journalism students .
According to a senior lecturer at the University , " Some students ' tweets are not as in depth as you might like . "
The solution ?
Make Twitter writing practice a compulsory part of the course curriculum for would - be journalists .
University officials cited increasing demand from employers for new hires well - versed in social media , and Twitter 's importance in global events like the Iran elections earlier this year .
While we perhaps would have given up a prized appendage to have anything as cool as a Twitter course available back when we were in school during the Pleistocene Era , the Griffith U students ' reactions have been mixed .
Some students had no idea what Twitter even was ( sort of proving the point of needed education for future journalists ! ) , and a few outspoken J - schoolers who felt the class was " a waste of time . "
Clearly kids these days do n't know how good they have it .
What 's your take : should Twitter fluency be required for future journalists ?
Or is it impractical to expect students to inject " more depth " into their tweets ?

Precedence parsing error
cannot mix `>>=' [ infixl 1 ] and ` >>>' [ infixr 1 ] in the same infix expression
-----
now here is all that is needed to fix that problem as the improper mixing is between the monad bind { >>= } and the arrow { >>> } operators .
The applicative { < $> } is already enclosed or it would ring bells with both the >>= and the >>>.
So here is the fix :
-------
* Big3 > [ [ 2,4,6 ] , [ 7..13 ] , [ 10,20..100 ] ] >>= (((* 3 ) <$ > ) >>> return )
[ [ 6,12,18 ] , [21,24,27,30,33,36,39 ] , [ 30,60,9 0,120,150,180,210,240,270,300 ] ]
-------
NOTICE that this is the same as the { return .
fmap (* 3 ) } above .. just using all three notations ..
I never said that it will always be a less obsfucated choice .. but sometimes it is a much better choice .
The real point is that you do have the choice .
Now that should serve to show everything a person would need to see that they can be mixed .. but more is at hand .
This is and applicative functor operation " ( ^ 2 ) < $ > " being applied to a list value generated by an enclosed monad , " ( [ 1..10 ] >>= return . (* 5 ) ) " .
----
* Big3 > ( ^ 2 ) < $ > ( [ 1..10 ] >>= return . (* 5 ) )
[ 25,100,225,400,625,900,1225,1600,2025,2 500 ]
-----
Now a better way in my opinion to skin that cat is to skip the monadic element and use an arrow computational element composed of the (* 5 ) and the ( ^ 2 ) directly applied to the initial list [ 1..10 ] .
------
* Big3 > ( (* 5 ) >>> ( ^ 2 ) ) < $ > [ 1..10 ]
[ 25,100,225,400,625,900,1225,1600,2025,2 500 ]
------
This keeps all the computational elements grouped together and is more easily read , and due to the use of the >>>
the computations are written in a more natural to me anyway left to right progress of the various functions being applied .
If you are really enamored by the right to left of the (. ) , composition notations , well you can always use a series of the arrow operators ( < <<) that accomplish that .
Okay here is the true motivation to using arrows ... as the notation for splitting into two branches and doing separate computations on both sides is not as clean in much of any other type of notation .
In this case a list of the pairs consisting of the " id " of the element being operated on from the original list , and the result of the computation .
-------
* Big3 > ( id &&& ( (* 5 ) >>> ( ^ 2 ) ) ) < $ > [ 1..5 ]
[ ( 1,25 ) , ( 2,100 ) , ( 3,225 ) , ( 4,400 ) , ( 5,625 ) ]
-------
And then the slightly more complex version that puts the results one per line :
-------
* Big3 > ( ( ( id &&& ( (* 5 ) >>> ( ^ 2 ) ) ) ) <$ > ) >>> ( show < $ > ) >>> mapM_ putStrLn $ [ 1..7 ]
( 1,25 )
( 2,100 )
( 3,225 )
( 4,400 )
( 5,625 )
( 6,900 )
( 7,1225 )
Okay this may not seem too worthwhile to this point , as we are just doing things to the LIST Monad .. aka the also LIST Functor .
ah yes it is .. and so is the Maybe monad a Functor too .. which leads to a much more wonderful use of the applicatives , as they
do n't care too much about the type of functor that they are dealing with ..
Here is some more motivation in the dressing of a new operator that ( < $ $ > ) which bores down a through two layers of functor to apply a function to the innards of the second one down .
Here is the type signature of it :
* Big3 > :t ( <$ $ >)
( <$ $ >)
:: forall a b ( f1 :: * -> *) ( f :: * -> *) .
( Functor f , Functor f1 ) =>
( a -> b ) -> f1 ( f a ) -> f1 ( f b )
so that ( a to b ) function is applied to the elements of the inner functor {f} which is enclosed in the outer functor {f1} .
So for the first set of examples I will use a Maybe ( Maybe a ) :
----
* Big3 > (* 4 ) <$ $> Just Nothing
Just Nothing
* Big3 > (* 4 ) <$ $> Just ( Just 5 )
Just ( Just 20 )
-------
Okay not too impressive , but it does what it advertises ----
Now a bit more interesting , a list of Maybe ( Num ) that is applied to by an arrow computation .
------
( ---- arrow ---- ) ( app ) (---- List of Maybe Num -------------- )
* Big3 > ( (+ 3 ) >>> (* 10 ) ) < $ $>
[ Nothing , Just 3 , Just 7 , Nothing , Just 9 ]
[ Nothing , Just 60 , Just 100 , Nothing , Just 120 ]
This can be prettied up by pulling discarding the Nothings and giving the resulting " a " value of the " Just a "s using catMaybe .
* Big3 > ( ((+ 3 ) >>> (* 10 ) ) < $ $ >)
>>> Maybe.catMaybes
$ [ Nothing , Just 3 , Just 7 , Nothing , Just 9 ]
[ 60,100,120 ]
Also have a few more applicative operators that I have conjured up that let me go down to level 3 and 4 and are :
( <$ $ $ >)
:: forall a
b
( f2 :: * -> *)
( f1 :: * -> *)
( f :: * -> *) .
( Functor f , Functor f1 , Functor f2 ) =>
( a -> b ) -> f2 ( f1 ( f a ) ) -> f2 ( f1 ( f b ) )
eg :
* Big3 > (* 3 ) < $ $ $> [ [ Just 3 , Nothing , Just 4 ] , [ Nothing ] , [ Just 5 , Just 6 , Nothing ] ]
[ [ Just 9 , Nothing , Just 12 ] , [ Nothing ] , [ Just 15 , Just 18 , Nothing ] ]
This one is a bit dense .. but .. will spread it out down page to try and make it easier to read :
* Big3 > Maybe.catMaybes $
((
( words < $ > ) >>>
( ( \cs -> if length cs < 3 then Nothing else Just cs ) < $ $ > ) )
) [ " follow is a test " , " As is offer bloat " ] >>=
( (++ " ing " ) < $ $ >)
[ " following " , " testing " , " offering " , " bloat ing " ]
This one just goes down another level into a fourth layer of functor , and BELIEVE it or NOT , I have used it too .
These can occur in situations of a lookup of a lookup of a perhaps lookup where you could have a result like :
[ Nothing , Just Nothing , Just [ Just a , Nothing , Just c ] ]
( <$ $ $ $ > )
:: forall a
b
( f3 :: * -> *)
( f2 :: * -> *)
( f1 :: * -> *)
( f :: * -> *) .
( Functor f , Functor f1 , Functor f2 , Functor f3 ) =>
( a -> b ) -> f3 ( f2 ( f1 ( f a ) ) ) -> f3 ( f2 ( f1 ( f b ) ) )

That 's all for now .. probably more than enough !!
In trying to get a handle on monads , which I was having more then a bit of trouble with for some time , I got so disgusted that I decided to look at the arrow notation , and at least I was able to make use of them , and then I took a look at applicative functors , and the various operators .
In doing what I call investigative programming , " playing around with " could be a better way to put it , I came to find that all three could be mixed and matched to make a better soup then just one paradigm alone in some cases .
If another person wants to try this , the main thing to remember is that in order to do that each computational unit , HAS to be encapsulated , usually just by a set of parenthesis to keep things in order , or things will blow up with some sort of compiler error message about mismatch , or precedence problems .. but all that can be avoided by a simple surrounding of whichever , arrow , applicative Functor or monad , in use with said parenthesis .
I think that some examples will make this much clearer .
So I will use a run of the ghci with a ghc extras turned on for -- farrows and -- ghc-exts and then I fire up a mostly empty module called Big3.lhs that just has the imports of Control .
Arrow , Control .
Applicative , and Control .
Monad , to allow all three of those notations .
Standard monadic bind:* Big3 > [ [ 2,4,6 ] , [ 7..13 ] , [ 10,20..50 ] ] >>= return . fmap (* 3 ) [ [ 6,12,18 ] , [21,24,27,30,33,36,39 ] , [30,60,90,120,150 ] ] and the same although w/ o the return , so leaves unwrapped : * Big3 > [ [ 2,4,6 ] , [ 7..13 ] , [ 10,20..50 ] ] >>= fmap (* 3 ) [ 6,12,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,30,60,90,120,150 ]
Now here is the result I was talking about with the mixed usage and a failure to compute due to a not having the individual types of computations enclosed properly .
So when I see this type of error message , I immediately know that I have forgotten to slap some parenthesis around some part of the computation to isolate it properly .-----*Big3 > [ [ 2,4,6 ] , [ 7..13 ] , [ 10,20..100 ] ] >>= ((* 3 ) ) >>> return
I got a hate email from a perpetual candidate and lunatic .
His name is Pavel Goberman and he lives in Beaverton and he is running for office .
I give him more publicity than he deserves .
The following is the most recent hate email Pavel sent to me .

I wish you ’d run to Canada and quit sending me hate email .
EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. 
In a match between Super Bowl finalists from the previous two seasons , neither the Giants nor the Arizona Cardinals played at a championship level Sunday night .
But they sure made it close and interesting , with the Cardinals winning , 24 - 17 , at Giants Stadium .
Two Giants drives that could have tied the score died in the final five minutes , both on turnovers .
The first drive ended on a fumble by running back Ahmad Bradshaw .
The second ended on an interception by Eli Manning , his third of the game .
“ I ’ve got to play better football , ” Manning said .
“ Hopefully , you do n’t throw interceptions .
I do n’t think we have to get concerned .
We ’ve lost two in a row .
We definitely do n’t want to lose three in a row .
Ca n’t turn the ball over four times . ”
Marc Faber Predicts the Collapse of Capitalism
As contrarians , we ’re used to holding unpopular views on the economy .
We believe the recovery is a sham ; that things will get worse before they get better ; and that the effects of the current recession will reach farther than most people think .
Well , our good friend Dr. Marc Faber could n’t agree more .
And in a recent interview for Yahoo ’s Tech Ticker , he explains why .
Your computer ’s data is very critical and losing it can can occur due to variety of reasons .
A complete ( or even partial ) backup of your system is always a good idea .
SBackup is a tool that ’ll help you backup and restore data on your Ubuntu machine with utmost ease .
SB Backup
SBackup is a simple backup solution for the Ubuntu desktop .
It allows you to backup selected files and directories , define the file size limit , use regular expressions to exclude files and folders , and much more .
These backups can then be saved locally , on removal media or even on remote directory .
Let ’s see how to install and configure SBackup for creating a backup and restore solution for an Ubuntu machine .
Install SBackup
Type the following command to install SBackup on your Ubuntu machine :
sudo apt - get install sbackup
Backing up using SBackup
Once installed SBackup will be available under System \ Administration \ Simple Backup Config .
SBackup window will look like the one below :
As you can see on the first tab “ General ” , there are 3 options for making backup .
Depending on your need you can choose the one that you want to use .
It can be used in 3 modes .
1 . Use recommended backup settings
Has all the default settings .
All you have to do is click “ Backup now ” button to backup the default files and folders .
2 . Use custom backup settings
This one is for custom backups where the user can define what she / he wants to backup on a regular basis .
This setting can be configured for automatic backups
3. Manual backups only
This option should be used if you do not want to have regular automatic backups .
You can backup manually whenever you think you need backups .
However , for the sake of this demo let ’s use “ Use custom backup settings ” .
The next tab is “ include ” which let ’s you define the folders and files you want to include while creating a backup .
You can click add a file or folder by clicking the respective buttons .
The third tab is “ exclude ” .
Here you can define , path , filetypes , regex and maximum size for exclusion criteria .
For example you have added a directory included for backup , but you do n’t want to backup files larger than 50 MB , you can use the exclude tab to define it .
The fourth tab is “ Destination ” .
This one is used to define the destination location where you want to save the backup file .
As you can see there are 3 options for setting up destination backup location .
The first one is the default location / var / backup / .
The second option can be used to define the custom backup destination .
The third option is used when you want the backup destination on a remote location .
The fifth tab is to set up schedule of backup .
This one is pretty self explanatory .
The last tab “ purging ” is about how the old backup files will be handled .
You can choose from one of the 2 options .
In my case I am leaving it as the default selection which is Logarithmic ( Recommended ) .
We are done with configuring all the settings .
All that is left is to click the “ Save ” button for the backup settings to be effective .
However , you can also click “ Backup Now ! ” button to make an instant backup .
Restoring from a backup
In order to restore from an existing backup go to System \ Administration \ System Backup Restore .
Select from the available backups , the one that you want to restore .
If you are looking for a quality backup app for your Linux desktop , SBackup is a great choice .

New York 's recently released review of the environmental risks ( PDF ) posed by natural gas production in the Marcellus shale offers the clearest picture yet of the chemicals used in the drilling process called hydraulic fracturing .
The document makes public the names of 260 chemicals , more than eight times as many as Pennsylvania state regulators have compiled .
The list is the most complete released by any state or federal agency and could help answer concerns about hydraulic fracturing in Congress and in states where gas drilling has increased in recent years .
The review also takes another dramatic step by proposing that in certain situations companies that drill in New York be required to report the concentrations of the chemicals they use to state regulators , thereby creating a suite of information that environmental scientists say is essential to investigating water pollution from drilling .
New York would be the first state to make such a demand .
The industry has been reluctant to release information about the chemicals it uses , because it considers them a proprietary trade secret .
While New York has made the names of the chemicals public , it seems likely that the data about their concentration will be shared only with state officials .
The 800 - page environmental impact assessment also proposes a slew of safeguards for well construction , waste disposal and water protection .
If those rules are finalized after the ongoing public review period , New York 's environmental protections for gas drilling would be among the strongest in the nation .
" In a number of areas these regulations are more stringent than in other states , " said Kate Sinding , a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" As commendable as that is , and wanting to give the department credit where credit is due , the bar set in most other states is so abysmally low , it still begs the question of whether stronger is strong enough . "
Environmental scientists have long sought complete information about the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing , saying they need it to thoroughly investigate water pollution .
Contamination can occur when the chemicals are pumped underground , held in waste pits or trucked to water treatment plants before being discharged back into rivers and drinking water supplies .
Colorado passed regulations last year requiring companies to disclose the names of chemicals , but they apply only to chemicals held in 50 - gallons drums or larger .
Now the industry is suing Colorado to repeal the group of regulations that includes that clause .
In Pennsylvania , environment officials told ProPublica that their list of chemical products used for drilling there was complete , but it names just 39 products and 31 unique chemicals .
Congress has been debating a bill to require disclosure , but the industry is fighting the legislation with millions of dollars in lobbying efforts .
New York obtained the names of the chemicals by surveying drilling companies , their contractors and the manufacturers of the chemicals .
The Department of Environmental Conservation identified 152 trademarked products and obtained the complete list of their ingredients ; it gathered a partial list of ingredients for an additional 45 products .
The review , which was released last month , leaves some environmental concerns unanswered .
It offers few specific measures to protect New York City 's watershed -- the unfiltered source of drinking water for nearly half the state 's population .
It says that wastewater will be treated by facilities in New York and Pennsylvania , but does not confirm whether those plants have the capacity to receive Marcellus shale wastewater or the technology to make that water safe .
Critics also complain it does little to describe how several thousand new wells would cumulatively affect air and water quality , leaving the analysis to a per-well basis .
" The DEC 's shocking refusal to assess cumulative impacts undermines the validity of the entire study and if implemented will lead to devastating , unanticipated outcomes , " said Roger Downs , a conservation associate at the Sierra Club 's Atlantic Chapter , which has called for a ban on drilling in New York despite the Sierra Club 's general support for gas development in the United States .
The review does , however , deal directly with some of most critical problems that have led to contamination in other drilling states .
It suggests strict limits on the kind of open waste pits that have led to hundreds of cases of water contamination in other states ; guarantees additional scientific review before drilling can happen near water supplies ; and requires government inspectors to be more regularly involved at several stages of the drilling and fracturing processes .
An environmental review , sometimes including public hearings , would be required each time a gas well is proposed within 150 feet of a private water well , stream or pond or within 300 feet of a reservoir .
An additional environmental review would also be required before gas wells could be hydraulically fractured within 1,000 feet of water supply infrastructure , or within 2,000 feet of the surface .
Private water wells within 1,000 feet of a gas well would be tested before drilling begins , to create a baseline for measuring any future pollution .
The review recommends requiring that chemical - laden wastewater from hydraulic fracturing be enclosed in steel tanks rather than pits at well sites , a practice that has been proven to reduce the risk of spills and prevent evaporation of chemicals into the air .
Some waste could still be kept in open pits , but new rules would require that those pits be emptied after seven days , and that state inspectors check the pits and their liners before they can be used again .
The review also suggests strengthening structural requirements to prevent leaks from inside gas well pipes , and establishing an explicit chain of custody record to make sure drilling wastewater is delivered to treatment facilities that are capable of accepting it .
Yancey Roy , a spokesman for the DEC , declined to answer questions about the document .
Instead he cited passages in the environmental review .
New York 's industry group , the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York State , did not return calls for comment .
Two prominent new natural gas industry associations -- America 's Natural Gas Alliance and Energy In Depth -- also declined to comment on New York 's rulemaking process .
The draft review , called the Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement , updates the state 's 1992 drilling study .
It was ordered by Gov. David Paterson last summer after an investigation by ProPublica found that the state was not familiar with the chemical makeup of fracturing fluids and was unprepared to manage a boom of modern drilling in the Marcellus shale .
The state has allowed for a 60 - day comment period before the recommendations will be finalized and is holding four hearings across New York beginning later this month .
Several state , city and federal lawmakers , including U.S. Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand , D - N.Y. , have said the comment period is too short and called for an extension from the Nov. 30 deadline .
Comments can be submitted online or sent by e-mail ( dmnsgeis@gw.dec.state.ny.us ) .

It ’s been more than three months since Left 4 Dead 2 was announced at E3 and it ’s less than two months now until we get it in our hot , little , zombie - killing hands .
Since its announcement , Valve has given us a ton of info about the game — a little here , a little there .
To make things easier on you , I ’ve gone through and compiled all of the available info into one place .
And that place is this site , so without further ado , here it is : everything we know so far about Left 4 Dead 2 .
Overview : Like most sequels , it hits the “ bigger , better , more ” target .
It will have five campaigns to the original ’s four .
This time it ’s set in the South and we get four all - new characters ( more on them below ) .
The three gameplay modes of the original — co-op , versus and survival — will be present , as well as a fourth , yet - to - be revealed mode .
Additional new touches include dynamic weather , the addition of daylight fights â€ “ and a more aggressive , agitated horde during those daylight fights — and , perhaps best of all , a much more realistic and gruesome damage model .
So we ’ll get severed limbs , shredded torsos , decapitations and all the other good stuff a proper zombie game should have .
Perhaps the biggest improvement is the improved AI Director .
Valve are promising it will not only be smarter , but also able to do plenty of new things , such as changing the layout of a level to make it more or less difficult depending on the players ’ skill and the aforementioned dynamic weather .
It will also reward players who explore levels and take the longer , more difficult routes with perks such as special ammo .
The original game ’s “ crescendo events ” have been tweaked , too .
Now , some of them happen on the move — so backing into a corner is no longer a viable strategy .
Back to the drawing board …
Some of the original bosses are being tweaked .
Most of these are minor and / or transparent , such as a different costume for the Hunter ( turns out , it ’s too hot for a hoodie in the South ) .
The most significant of these is the new Witch behavior — during those daylight levels , she ’ll be wandering around all agitated - like instead of sitting and crying , so slipping by her gets a little harder .
Not to mention , now she can sneak up on you …
The story is getting beefed up this time around .
It starts in Savannah , Georgia and ends up in New Orleans and this time we get a better idea of how the survivors get from one place to another — it should be a zombie - infested road trip through the deep South .
Valve aims to tell the story of the characters and the world this time — so we should have a much better idea of exactly how things got so fucked up .
We also get to see some of how it starts : the initial level , Savannah , is set before the zombie infection hits …
New Stuff : Okay , on to the new stuff .
I know it ’s what you ’ve all been waiting for anyway .
Characters :
Once again the characters will have some snappy dialog .
Everything I ’ve seen so far indicates it is at least as good as the first game ’s .
Word is they will progress as characters throughout the game , growing more confident , for example .
Coach â€ “ A black high - school football coach .
Kind of a big , fat guy .
Voiced by Chad Coleman .
Rochelle â€ “ A black , female , cable news producer .
Hot and apparently likes Depeche Mode .
From Cleveland , in the area to do a story on the outbreak .
Voiced by Rochelle Aytes .
Ellis â€ “ A white , redneck mechanic good ole boy , but supposedly smarter than that stereotype might imply .
Voiced by Eric Ladin .
Nick â€ “ A white con man and gambler .
Cynical and not too sure of his compatriots .
Seems to cross Lost ‘s Sawyer with GOB from Arrested Development , which instantly makes him my preferred character .
Voiced by Hugo Dillon .
Campaigns :
There are five of them this time around .
You ’ll start in Savannah and end in New Orleans .
As mentioned , they will be connected with an overarching narrative .
Only three of the five have been revealed thus far .
In brief , these are :
“ Swamp Fever ” â € “ As you might gather from the name , this is set in a swamp , which is awesome .
Murky water slows you down , spooky trees add to the atmosphere .
Somewhere in there is a ferry you need to cross and a downed airplane you ’ll defend , both of which are crescendo events .
“ Dark Carnival ” â€ “ A semi-operative amusement park full of fun-turned - creepy elements .
Some of the carnival games will actually be playable , which is a nice touch .
A merry - go - round plays a role in one crescendo event .
“ The Parish ” - Â New Orleans , daytime level and the end game .
One crescendo has you crossing a mass of cars , trying not to trigger the alarms .
Weapons and Items :
You can hardly have a first - person shooter sequel without new guns , can you ?
And you get melee weapons too , plus some other fun stuff .
Total will be more than twenty new weapons , including more than ten melee weapons .
Here ’s what ’s been seen so far .
Guns :
A silenced SMG based on a MAC - 10 .
Supposedly no gameplay difference from the original SMG but it looks and sounds awesome .
New assault shotgun modeled on SPAS12
Magnum ( A bigger pistol ?
Not entirely clear )
Multiple assault rifles including the AK - 47 and FN SCAR
Grenade Launcher – a one - shot - at - a - time monster that can destroy a horde of zombies in one shot — or take out your entire team if you are n’t careful
New semi-auto sniper / assault hybrid .
Thirty round capacity , fires 2 rps , scoped
There will also be incendiary ammo , to set things on fire and explosive ammo , to make them explode .
These will presumably be among the “ perks ” the Director offers for exploring and taking the hard way .
Melee Weapons :
All of these are very powerful , capable of taking out a common infected with a single hit .
Despite this , they are somewhat awkward and require you to forgo guns while carrying them .
They also have some sort of fatigue system built in so you ca n’t just hammer away indefinitely .
These vary by level , contextually â€ “ so the swamp level might offer axes stuck in trees , but a nightstick is something you ’ll find in the city levels .
Crowbar â€“ can knock a zombieâ€™s head off
Katana â€ “ good for limb and / or head severing
fire axe â€ “ good versus groups , can one - shot kill a Witch from behind !
frying pan â€ “ good at batting your way through crowds plus it ’s comedy gold , especially the sound effect
chainsaw – it ’s a freaking chainsaw .
What else do youÂ need to know ?
baseball bat
cricket bat
night stick
electric guitar – Impractical perhaps , but I bet it makes a great sound effect too .
All that plus two new items .
Adrenaline injectors giveÂ a 25 - point temporary health boost , reduce melee fatigue and prevent infected from slowing down your movement .
Good for escapes , then .
There are also ammo packs that you can choose to carry in place of a first - aid kit .
These allow you to refill your ammo supply wherever , whenever .
Infected :
Bosses :
There will be three new bosses for sure , and maybe a fourth which could come later as DLC .
The new bosses address some specific tactics popular in the previous game — specifically , camping — and help the old bosses work more effectively against disciplined teams .
Spitter – spits a wad of flame - type goo that does continual damage over time to the area it hits .
Should be very effective at ending the “ pile in a corner ” strategy for crescendo events , and make it harder to help downed foes in some circumstances .
Â
Incredibly freaky looking , to boot .
Charger -Â
It ’s like half a Tank .
This bad boy runs at groups of players and knocks them down / apart and stuns them .
It can breaks up even the most well - disciplined groups .
Oh , it also can pick up survivor and pile drive them repeatedly .
At least it ’s easier to kill than its
Tank brother .
Jockey –
This fun guy jumps on a survivor and â€œridesâ€ him away from the rest of the group , towards other zombies or environmental hazards ( like , say , Spitter goo ! ) .
It takes partial control , and the player can resist it .
Presumably good against that guy that insists on wandering off , much like the Hunter is .
Uncommon common : Each campaign has specific infected that fall somewhere between the common and special infected .
There will be six of these , one for each level except “ The Parish , ” which has two .
These are n’t any stronger than the base infected , but have special abilities that can make the survivors ’ lives more difficult .
Mud men –
You ’ll find these guys in “ Swamp Fever . ”
They crouch down and the low profile makes them hard to hit .
That crouching hides them under the waters of the swamp for sneaking around purposes .
Oh , they can also fling mud , Â partially blinding players temporarily .
Hazmat â€ “
These well - dressed zombies can be found in “ The Parish . ”
The Hazmat suits they were wearing before the infection makes them fireproof .
Riot gear – Former riot cop gone zombie in “ The Parish . ”
Their kevlar makes them bulletproof from the front .
You ’ll have toÂ get behind them to do the job .
Or knock them on their ass with a melee attack , then shoot them in the back .
Clown â€“ Where else would you find a zombie clown but in a “ Dark Carnival ” ?
Their squeaky clown shoes alert and attract other zombies .
Also , there ’s nothing more terrifying than a freaking zombie clown .
That ’s pretty much it !

All the info for this came from the sources cited in and linked from this handy Left 4 Dead 2 Wikipedia entry and the press page of the official Left 4 Dead site .
I just compiled it all and offered minor analysis here and there .
Das Drängen der USA und anderer westlicher Staaten zur Einführung strikter Regeln zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums in Schwellenländern wie China könnte sich bald als Bumerang erweisen .
" Heute sind wir die Erfinder und die anderen die Lizenznehmer " , gab Kenneth Cukier , Redakteur beim Wirtschaftsmagazin The Economist , auf der Verbraucherschutzkonferenz im Rahmen des Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue ( TACD ) in Brüssel über " die Politik und die Ideologie des geistigen Eigentums " zu bedenken .
" Aber wären wir bereit , von anderen Lizenzen zu kaufen ? "
Der Regulierungsexperte ist sich sicher , dass " die nächsten großen Innovationen aus Asien kommen " .
Vermutlich würde der Westen dann die jetzt noch forcierten Schutzmechanismen für Ideen im Eigeninteresse aufbrechen wollen .
Cukier stellte jedoch klar : " Wenn wir internationale Regeln schaffen , müssen wir auch gewillt sein , sie zu befolgen " .
Ein Umdenken auf der politischen Ebene hat angesichts dieser Bedrohung der westlichen Marktdominanz bereits eingesetzt .
So überraschte Bruce Lehman , langjähriger Berater der Clinton - Regierung in Fragen des geistigen Eigentums und einer der Väter mehrerer umstrittener internationaler Rechtsabkommen auf Ebene der WIPO ( World Intellectual Property Organization ) und der WTO ( World Trade Organization ) , auf der Tagung mit der Aussage , dass sich das TRIPS - Abkommen ( trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights ) zur Verbreitung geistiger Eigentumsrechte nach westlichem Muster " für die USA als großer Fehler herausgestellt hat " .
Es werde meist vergessen , dass die Vereinigten Staaten damit auch Zugang zu vielen ihrer Märkte gegeben hätten .
Dies beziehe sich auch auf Länder mit niedrigen Lohnverhältnissen und ohne Auflagen beim Umweltschutz .
Es sei daher kein Wunder , dass etwa selbst Apples iPod und damit eines der Vorzeigeprodukte der US - Hightech - Wirtschaft in China gefertigt werde .
Dass ein Großteil der Profite trotzdem in Cupertino bleibt , habe Apple allein der Eigentümerschaft am geistigen Eigentum an dem Abspielgerät zu verdanken .
Doch auch die Schutzwirkung von Patent- , Urheber - und Markenrechten könnte sich bald als negativer Wirtschaftsfaktor für den Westen erweisen .
Die Gesetzgeber und Drahtzieher internationaler Handelsvereinbarungen sehen sich damit in einem Dilemma .
Antony Taubman von der WIPO stellte die Situation in den Worten des Philosophen Soeren Kierkegaard dar : " Tu etwas oder tu nichts , du wirst es in jedem Fall bereuen " .
Das von ihm mitbetreute Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources , Traditional Knowledge and Folklore ( IGC ) schlage sich daher bereits seit Jahren mit der Frage herum , ob das Ziel des Diskussionsprozesses überhaupt ein internationaler Vertrag sein sollte .
Schließlich würde von der einen Seite befürchtet , dass mit der Verankerung geistiger Eigentumsrechte in traditionellen Gesellschaften deren Kulturen in eine " Zwangsjacke " gesteckt und bestehende Werte überlagert werden könnten .
Andererseits werde aber auch in Frage gestellt , ob es überhaupt Berechtigungen für die Existenz öffentlicher Domänen und Allmenden gäbe .
Unbeirrbar hält derweil die EU - Kommission an ihrem Kurs fest .
" Wir haben die klare Linie , dass wir das E - Business und die Rechtehalter stärken wollen " , betonte Leonardo Cervera Navas von der Generaldirektion Binnenmarkt .
Nur mit durchschlagkräftigen Schutzrechten könnten Rechtehalter ihre Geschäftsmodelle ins Internet verlagern .
Dem von der Zivilgesellschaft erhobenen Anspruch auf einen besseren Zugang zum Wissen will sich die Kommission aber dennoch nicht ganz verschließen .
Das
Thema sei auf der politischen Agenda , betonte der bekennende " Eurokrat " .
Konkret eine Rolle spiele es etwa bei der Evaluierung der Urheberrechtsrichtlinie von 2001 oder im Rahmen der Initiative zum Aufbau einer digitalen Bibliothek in Europa .
Für Verbraucherschützer und Wissenschaftler haben das breitbandige Internet und P2P - Netze dagegen bereits ganz neue ökonomische Modelle etabliert , für die sich ein unreformiertes System des geistigen Eigentums als Hindernis erweist .
" Die digitale Revolution hat die Bedingungen für einen neuen , kollaborativen Produktionsmodus geschaffen " , führte Mark Cooper , Forschungsdirektor der Consumer Federation of America , aus .
Es mache keinen Sinn mehr , digitale Güter wie Musik oder Filme künstlich rechtlich oder mithilfe technischer Restriktionen zu verknappen .
Gerade P2P habe die kosteneffektive Verbreitung einst rarer Ressourcen ermöglicht und eine Demokratisierung der Kreation digitaler Werke vorangetrieben .
P2P übersetzt Cooper daher mit " People 2 People " .
Schon im Fall Napster hätten die Verbraucher letztlich zur Selbsthilfe gegriffen und die Musikindustrie gezwungen , von ihren mit CD - Verkäufen erzielten Überschüssen einen Teil zurückzugeben .
Generell würden inzwischen 60 bis 70 Prozent der Inhalte im Netz von den Nutzern erstellt , zitierte der Verbraucherschützer aus aktuellen Studien mit Blick auf Weblogs oder Podcasting .
Auch Luc Soete , Wirtschaftswissenschaftler an der United Nations University of Maastricht , sprach von einer " kreativen Aktivierung " durch das Internet , dank der immer mehr " Amateure " enorme positive , im Prinzip nicht mehr " aufzubrauchende " Werte und Werke schaffen würden .
Historisch betrachtet wären schon immer " Kollaboration und altruistisches Verhalten " die wichtigsten Antriebsfaktoren wirtschaftlichen Handelns gewesen , weniger Tendenzen zur Kommerzialisierung der Lebenswelt .
Noch fehle es aber den Ökonomen an Maßstäben , um etwa den Wert der Erstellung von freier Software zu messen und ins erwirtschaftete Bruttosozialprodukt von Volkswirtschaften einzufügen .
Generell seien dessen Wachstumsraten auf einer schier grenzenlose Privatisierung von Raum , Zeit und Information zurückzuführen , wobei Kreativität , Innovation oder nicht - kommerzielle Arbeit nicht berücksichtigt würden .
