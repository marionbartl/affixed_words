How Can The Music Industry Be Dead When More Music Is Being Produced And More Money Is Being Made ?
from the woe - is - me dept
On my own MySpace page , I can upload my own band 's music to the web in a matter of minutes , and sell it to anyone in the world with an internet connection .
Theoretically , it has never been easier to be heard .
Yet hundreds of thousands of other musicians are competing for attention online .
Without support from a record label , musicians must master the intricacies of search engine optimization , social networking , email blasts , and twittering -- not to mention traditional tasks like booking shows .
Not surprisingly , many musicians lack such skills .
Can you , even for a moment , imagine Janis Joplin pouring over HTML manuals , or Jimi Hendrix spending hours each day spamming potential fans on MySpace ?
Not likely .
Had those two tried to make it in today 's marketplace , we may never have even heard of them .
In other words , it may not hurt Beyonce or AC / DC if you download their music .
They are , after all , astonishingly wealthy .
But it does hurt the record labels , which , in turn , cannot afford to sign , develop and promote as many new artists .
Consequently , our music is becoming less diverse .
In the long run , music lovers themselves are deprived .

Kyle sent over yet another musician , named Nathan Harden , pulling out the " woe is me " schtick in an article claiming that this generation " killed rock ' n ' roll . "
It hits on all the usual debunked points and only quotes industry sources on the major label side of the business , assumes that the only way to make money in the music business is by selling albums or songs , and does n't even realize what a huge contradiction it makes in the process .
It starts out by quoting record sales stats , but ignoring all of the recent studies that show that money has n't gone away , it 's just shifted to other channels -- and those channels are ones where the actual artists get more money .
It 's true that the major record labels are making less -- no one denies that .
But it 's folly to claim that this means the death of rock ' n ' roll or music at all .
Another recent study showed more music being released today than ever before in history .
That does n't sound like a dying industry at all .
In fact , this guy effectively admits that when he complains :
But wait ... just before that you were claiming that rock ' n ' roll was dead .
And yet here you are admitting that there are so many other musicians putting up their music as well ?
The two things do not compute .
As far as I can tell , Harden 's real complaint is n't that rock ' n ' roll is dying , but that a major label wo n't just turn him into a rockstar .
Instead , he might have to actually do someto build up a fan base , and that 's icky :
This has been discussed at length , with musicians who do that stuff pointing out that it's not that much work at all , and if it 's really a problem , you work with someone ( the " 5th Beatle " ) who does it for you .
Can you , even for a moment , imagine Jonathan Coulton going the major label route or Matthew Ebel getting a six figure advance from a major label ?
Not likely .
Had those two tried to make it in yesterday 's marketplace , we may never have even heard of them .
The fact that more musicians are making music today and being able to release itmake a living from it than ever before suggests that things are actually looking much better , and we 're far from " the death of rock ' n ' roll , " but reaching an incredible age of creativity , where people who had no chance at all before are now able to make music and make a living .
And furthermore , it 's ridiculous to suggest that artists like Hendrix and Joplin did n't work hard to build their fanbase with what tools were available at the time .
I 'm not sure what music Harden 's been listening to lately , but I 've actually found music to be a lot more diverse these days , because it 's possible for bands to experiment and try different styles , and reach a worldwide audience .
I 've been listening to a reggae band from Spain the past few days .
A few years ago , I never would have known they existed .
Sorry , Nathan Harden , but you 've been sold the myth that only record labels make the music industry and that only through selling records does the music industry work .
That 's simply not true .
Yes , the record labels are having trouble , but rock ' n ' roll is n't dying .
It 's thriving by adapting to this new market .

This is not a disaster .
Ceci n'est pas une pipe ?
No , really , this is not a disaster .
Unless you 're Martin Brodeur .
In which case your tournament is likely done .
A strange bat attempt on the second goal , swimming on the third and a puck through your stick and your wickets on the fourth .
And where was he on that fifth goal !
You 're not going to save anything from the bench !
We 'll forgive that last one , and perhaps we should forgive them all .
If we believed Brodeur should start when the tournament began we should believe in him now .
I do , however , prefer Luongo .
But big picture .
The Canadians controlled the game and looked good doing it .
Ryan Miller was doubleplusgood , Martin Brodeur was plusungood and the US team took fewer unsmart penalties .
That 's it for American advantages until you look under the " goals " column .
When we look at the fantastic shot chart from the BBC ( if the NHL expands I can only hope it's to London - and I guess I should specify here , London ENGLAND - so that the BBC will start making these for NHL games ) the Canadians held a " Fenwick " ( Goals + Saved Shots + Missed Shots ) advantage of 64 - 31 .
There were 25 faceoffs in the US zone compared to 16 in the Canadian end of the ice .
Territorially , the Canadians had the advantage and it was n't just visible in the numbers .
My own damn eyes saw it too .
But they could n't cash and the fumbles in the defensive end ( Pronger ) along with some offensive zone penalties did them in .
I still like this team going forward .
They 're surely one of the best teams in the tournament - better than the Americans who just claimed victory I dare say - and hopefully the wins will follow .
They had better , because we 're running out of time .
Now really big picture .
The path to the gold medal is now a difficult one .
The Canadians have Patrick Thoresen and Norway to take care of on Tuesday ( Edit : It 's actually Jochen Hecht and Germany ) followed by a game against the Russians on Wednesday ( should they beat the Norwegians for a second time ) .
If they defeat Russia , they have the winner of the United States - Slovakia game ( unless this Sweden - Finland game goes to OT ) .
And then it's the final against Scandinavia or the Czechs .
A tough road to hoe .
It 's single elimination now , no room for unexecution or plusunluck .
As a famous Duck once said , " Let 's get dangerous . "
More detail - oriented game discussion after the jump .
Gabriel Desjardins is the man .
He directed me to those BBC charts ( although they 're on the CTV Olympics website now too ) and he 's keeping track of all kinds of stuff for every game in these Olympics .
Check him out .
Nonetheless , I 've continued keeping the play - by - play for the Canadian side and it's listed below .

End of Game
The defence again saw quite a bit of flux with regard to the pairings throughout .
Brent Seabrook drew a lot of praise from the commentators in the second intermission but did n't get a single shift in the third period .
Duncan Keith ended up instead mostly with Drew Doughty and the two looked pretty good together .
Dan Boyle saw a lot of ice with a wide variety of partners , though mostly Chris Pronger which left Niedermayer and Shea Weber to team up for most of their shifts .
When the game was on the line at the end the team turned to Weber , Doughty , Boyle , Niedermayer and Keith - Pronger 's last shift came with about seven minutes to go .
Up front , Jarome Iginla started on a line with Brendan Morrow and Jonathan Toews but was moved up to play right wing with Crosby and Nash for the third period , taking the place of Mike Richards who had only one EV shift in the third period on a makeshift unit alongside Staal and Toews which also happened to be Toews ' only shift of the period .
And that was one more than Brendan Morrow who did n't have a single EV shift in the third , his place taken by the aforementioned Staal .
Patrice Bergeron 's role continued to shrink with only four EV shifts in the entire game , all of them for an extra center on an otherwise established line .
And even that defensive role seemed to be slipping away when Joe Thornton was once put out as the extra - center - straight - to - bench man for a DZ draw in the first .
The other two lines rolled pretty much as usual , the only hiccup coming when Crosby took Staal 's place for a shift with Getzlaf and Perry on the PP .
Perry was also chosen as the extra attacker when the Canadians pulled the goalie , which I found a bit odd at first and infuriating once Ryan Kesler ate Perry 's lunch to put home the empty - net marker .
Ryan Smyth would n't have lollygagged back like that .
I ... can 't ... help ... myself ...
Did you know that Ryan Smyth is a natural winger ?
And that he knows how to make himself an outlet option in the defensive zone ?
And how to get the puck out ?
And how to play in front of the net when you 're looking for dirty goals ?
And that he can PK pretty good ( or at least he could when he was an Oiler , not a lot of evidence of it these last few years ) ?
And that he cursed the Oilers when they sent him away ?
But we needed seven ( teen if you prefer hyperbole ) centers .
And now we 're cursed .
Now the losing makes sense .
Right Derek ?
Margot Kaessmann said she would face the legal consequences
The head of Germany 's Protestant church has admitted drink - driving , after she was charged with passing a red light while three times over the legal limit .
Bishop Margot Kaessmann , appointed the church 's first female leader last year , was arrested in Hanover at the weekend .
She told Germany 's Bild newspaper : " I am shocked at myself that I could have made such a grave error . "
Leaders of the 25 million - strong church are discussing how the incident affects the 51 - year - old 's official position .
Ms Kaessmann , who became the first bishop in Germany to divorce in 2007 , allegedly drove her VW Phaeton through a red light in central Hanover on Saturday night while " completely unfit to drive " .
The mother of four daughters told Bild : " I know how dangerous and irresponsible drink - driving is .
I will of course assume the legal consequences . "
Courted controversy
Ms Kaessmann faces a fine of a month 's salary and a one - year driving ban .
The breast cancer survivor , who leads the Protestant Lutheran Church in Germany , became her country 's youngest bishop in 1999 .
This is not the first time Ms Kaessmann has made the headlines .
She irritated senior politicians by calling for the withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan , in a sermon on New Year 's Day .
She has also criticised Catholic teachings on homosexuality , the ordination of women and celibacy .
The BBC's Oana Lungescu in Berlin says it is not just the Protestant church in Germany that faces controversy .
On Monday , the head of Germany 's Catholic Church apologised for the growing number of sexual abuse cases that are coming to light at Jesuit high schools across the country .
Instead of praising bailed - out bankers , the president might have more profitably instructed his press secretary to drop the lame Palin jokes and dismantle the disinformation campaign her speech delivered to a national audience .
Palin , unlike Obama , put herself on the side of the angels , railing against Wall Street ’s bonuses and bailout , even though she and John McCain had supported TARP during the campaign .
Palin also bragged that she had “ joined with other conservative governors ” in “ rejecting some ” stimulus dollars when in reality she rejected only a symbolic 3 percent of those dollars  soon to be overruled by the Alaskan Legislature , which took every last buck .
This disingenuousness is old hat for Palin , who hired lobbyists to pursue $ 27 million in earmarks while serving as mayor of the town of Wasilla ( pop. 6,700 ) and loudly defended her state ’s “ bridge to nowhere ” until her politically opportunistic flip - flop .
What ’s new is the extent to which her test - marketed dishonesty has now become the template for her peers in the G.O.P. “ populist ” putsch .
Adopting her example  while unencumbered by her political baggage  the party is exploiting the Tea Party movement to rebrand itself as un-Washington while quietly conducting business as usual in the capital .
There ’s “ no difference ” between G.O.P. and Tea Party beliefs , claims the House Republican leader , John Boehner .
Not exactly .
The three senators named “ porkers of the month ” for December by the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste were all Republicans : Richard Shelby of Alabama , Susan Collins of Maine and Thad Cochran of Mississippi .
Shelby is so unashamedly addicted to earmarks that he used a senatorial “ hold ” to halt confirmation votes on 70 Obama administration appointees until his costly shopping list of Alabama pork projects was granted .
Or so he did until his over - the - top theatrics earned him unwelcome attention and threatened to derail his party ’s pious antispending posturing .

While more brazen than his peers , Shelby is otherwise typical of them .
Jonathan Karl of ABC
News last week unearthed photographs of various G.O.P. congressmen posing in their districts with stimulus checks that they had publicly opposed .
The Washington Times uncovered more than a dozen other Republican lawmakers who privately solicited stimulus money from the Department of Agriculture while denouncing the stimulus to their constituents and the news media , often angrily .
Even the G.O.P. / Tea Party heartthrob of the hour , Scott Brown , is not the barn - coat - wearing populist he purports to be .
In her speech , Palin saluted him as “ just a guy with a truck ” who was doing “ his part to put our government back on the side of the people . ”
In reality Brown ’s Massachusetts Senate campaign benefited from a last - minute flood of contributions from financial industry donors  with 80 percent of the haul coming from outside the state .
It says all you need to know about our politics that his Democratic opponent , Martha Coakley , matched him by holding a fund - raiser largely sponsored by lobbyists for the health care and pharmaceutical industries .
Now that he’s in the Senate , Brown is likely to junk the truck and side full time with Wall Street against Main Street .
To do otherwise would be to buck his party ’s entire establishment .
Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , has already signaled that he ’ll fight the Obama administration ’s push for a “ Volcker rule ” to rein in too - big - to - fail financial behemoths .
The conservative message guru Frank Luntz has drafted a memo instructing G.O.P. legislators on how to defeat a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency while camouflaging themselves as populist foes of the very banks and credit card companies that that agency would regulate .
That ’s a neat trick 
Luntz ’s nonpolitical clients include Merrill Lynch and American Express  and it helps explain why Wall Street is now tilting its contributions to Congressional Republicans for 2010 .
My colleague Gene Sloan at Cruise Log has readers in high dudgeon today as he reports on Celebrity Cruise line 's call to stop discounting cruises for priests who offered daily Mass on the ships .
The idea that Catholic clergy would have to pay full fare -- like rabbis , ministers , imams or any other clergy -- and organize services through a ship 's guest relations department like any group that wants to hold a gathering , has cruisers all wound up .
Comments are fascinating : Some , like a Catholic civil rights group leader , are swearing off any future Celebrity sailings .
Others were annoyed that Catholic clergy had ever been favored over other faiths that have daily or weekly prayers .
Daily Mass is not a widespread practice in the cruise industry , Sloan says .
And Celebrity will continue to invite clergy aboard for the major holidays of major faiths .
But some readers just found it amusing because they themselves do n't keep up religious obligations on vacation .
DO YOU go to worship services away from home just as you do when you 're not traveling ?
Susan Hamaker , a JFR reader who writes the Shrinecastle blog , graciously contributed this account of eating at Japanese baseball stadiums .
Hot dogs and pretzels ?
Oh , so much more !
Read Susan 's terrific story below .
Thanks so much for sharing it with us , Susan !
( And your photo , too . )
Every trip I take to Japan is a culinary experience , and my most recent one was no exception .
From curry rice in Tokyo to takoyaki and okonomiyaki in Hiroshima , each city offered its own style and flavor .
Oh , did I mention that I found these dishes at Japanese baseball stadiums ?
I spent the first week of September with a group of twenty - five American baseball fans as part of a tour run by JapanBall .
Each year the Seattle area - based JapanBall creators , Bob Bavasi and Mayumi Smith , guide an assemblage of folks from all walks of life through Japan to experience the Japanese version of our American pastime .
As a result , tour members receive a healthy dose of Japanese culture , especially Japanese food culture .
We saw five baseball games in four different cities : Tokyo , Kobe , Hiroshima , and Tokorozawa .
As we crisscrossed the nation jumping from bullet train to hotel to baseball stadium , eating at the ballparks became a necessity .
That was fine with me because I love all kinds of Japanese food , whether it comes from an upscale restaurant 's finest entrees or a yatai serving ramen noodles on a busy city street .
The first stop on our tour was Tokyo Dome to see the Yomiuri Giants host the Yakult Swallows .
A beer garden and restaurants serving fare ranging from burgers to ramen to Italian cuisine surround the dome .
I prefer grabbing my food inside the stadium rather than in a bordering restaurant , so that evening I enjoyed edamame and yakitori while I observed other fans eating steaming bowls of udon at their seats .
We also saw a game at the other baseball stadium in Tokyo , Meiji Jingu Stadium .
Built in 1926 , Meiji Jingu Stadium is located on the grounds of a revered Shinto shrine and is Tokyo's oldest professional ballpark still in use .
You 're allowed to bring your own food and drinks into the stadium - unprecedented in any country - but why would you want to do that ?
I loved the food there despite reading online declarations that Jingu Stadium has the worst variety .
I devoured both curry rice and an omu -rice bento - all in the name of research , of course - while other fans chowed down on gyoza and yakisoba .
The carnival atmosphere surrounding the outer grounds of the Seibu Dome in Tokorazawa , Saitama , brought to mind funnel cakes and corn on a stick .
Instead I saw a mural advertising KFC and a truck serving native Okinawan dishes .
Seibu Dome is home of the Seibu Lions , a powerhouse team from the 1980s and '90s and , most recently , the 2008 Japan Series champions .
The Lions improved concession stands and installed picnic tables behind first and third base after receiving a windfall of money - $ 51.1 million - when the Boston Red Sox purchased the rights to Seibu 's star pitcher , Daisuke Matsuzaka , in 2007 .
My favorite stadium in Japan is without a doubt Mazda Zoom Zoom Stadium , the brand new home of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp .
For variety in food and friendliness in atmosphere , this place can't be topped .
Perhaps I fell for the new ballpark flair , but the food sealed the deal .
A popular item on the menu was the local specialty in Hiroshima , okonomiyaki .
I also indulged in takoyaki , one of my favorite Japanese snacks .
My most disappointing experience was at Skymark Stadium in Kobe , the part - time home of the Orix Buffaloes .
The stadium itself was fine , and it offered a large selection of food choices .
But I could n't find my food choice : Kobe beef .
Ah , yes , that succulent , black Tajima - ushi meat from the Wagyu breed of cattle that once cultivated rice is now allegedly pampered with beer and massages to produce the world 's finest - and priciest - meat .
From the moment I discovered the tour would take in a game in Kobe , I craved the tender , fatty , marbled goodness that is Kobe beef , and I made it my mission to satisfy this craving .
After passing tables set up with popcorn and shrimp - flavored chips , rack after rack of bento boxes , and , strangely enough , a crepe stand , I finally found a counter advertising Kobe beef croquettes .
Jackpot !
Alas , the heavenly meat fried in whatever croquettes are fried in was sold out .
I could have looked for the Italian stand to purchase the Japanese interpretation of pizza or Panini , or I could have humored myself with a curious , foot - long chicken stick .
I could 've eaten a regular dog , a curry dog , and a cheese dog , but my when - in - Rome policy of eating only local foods would n't let me .
Crestfallen over the sold - out status of my Kobe beef , I bought the first thing I saw when I walked away from the Kobe beef croquette counter : I settled for karaage ( delicious ) and French fried potatoes ( not so much , and definitely not local ) .
Good food needs to be washed down with good beverages , and there 's plenty of that in Japanese ballparks .
Beer girls with kegs strapped to their backs roam the stands , and vendors mix liquor drinks such as shochu right at fans ' seats .
Watching the process is almost as much fun as drinking the beer .
In my second year on this baseball tour , I have seen 11 of the 13 stadiums in Japan and eaten almost everything they have to offer .
Despite the sadness of not fulfilling my quest for Kobe beef , I thoroughly enjoyed eating my way through these ballparks .
Although new MLB parks such as Yankee Stadium and Citi Field in New York lean toward high - end , gourmet offerings from celebrity chefs , I 'll take the concessions in Japan any day .
Such basic staples as bento boxes and yakitori are fixtures at all parks , yet each park celebrates the specialty of its region .
It may seem exotic to the average American baseball fan , but this food is delicious , down - and - dirty Japanese junk food .
It may not be as sophisticated as Harris 's nabe pots and soy sauce - marinated tuna , but these ballpark treats will provide enough sustenance to get anyone through a dizzying week of travel and baseball .

Nic L has done what I think you ’ll find to be a very interesting analysis of GHCN data .
All of these analyses should be considered preliminary because of the huge amount of data and unusual QC issues in the data .
I ’ve checked his code briefly and his version of the getstation should work fine with the mod parameter set .
My older version had a problem in it that resulted in it ignoring the WMO version number .
There are a couple of other QC issues with the data that this getstation function does n’t attempt to repair , but they should not affect the results .
In the meantime , It ’s very interesting what Nic found .
Consider that old GISS had 1934 vs 1998 ratios of 1.4 : 0.9 – Nic ’s results mirror their original .

Long Record GHCN Stations – an Analysis of the Data
At Jeff ’s request , I present here some findings from work I have carried out using long - record GHCN stations .
I have defined these as stations with temperature data in both 1900 and 1999 and fewer than 240 months ( 20 % ) in that period with no data .
The reason for looking at long record stations is primarily that one can have some confidence that trends over the last 100 years or so reflect actual changes in recorded temperature and are not affected by changes over time in the set of stations that are combined to produce an average .
The GHCN database contains temperature records from 7280 separate stations ; 4495 of these are WMO stations and the remainder are non-WMO stations , whose station number includes the WMO number of the closest WMO station but also a non-zero modifier to distinguish them from that WMO station .
The map below shows the location of all 7280 GHCN stations .
( Please ignore the large black spot in the centre , which I have not yet figured out how to get rid of .
J )
Although the geographical coverage of the 7280 GHCN stations is impressive , unfortunately many of them have short records , with only a minority having data before 1950 or after 1990 , and fewer still having data before 1900 .
The map below shows the location of the 1034 GHCN stations ( not all of which are WMO stations ) that meet my long record criteria in respect of their raw data .
It can be seen that the long record station set is dominated by the USA , but that there are a fair number of stations elsewhere with 100 year raw data records , with quite a wide geographical spread .
The variation over time in the total number of stations with raw data at GHCN is shown below .
Most of the long record stations have data for some years after 1999 , but the number of stations reporting data collapsed by over 1000 in April 2006 , when many Indian stations ceased reporting , following a previous sharp fall in the early 1990s .
Therefore , I have measured trends in the long record stations over the period 1900 to 2005 , rather than to 2009 .
I have been using a simpler QC method than Jeff but , unlike Jeff , analysing stations with the same WMO number but different modifiers completely separately .
Where there are duplicate series for a station , I have taken their simple mean but marked as NA any months where the standard deviation between points in duplicate data series exceeded 4 .
This may be too high a tolerance , but bear in mind that GHCN has already carried out quite detailed QC on the data and thrown out all data that it considers likely to be bad .
In many cases , there is little disagreement between the various duplicate data series , with data common to particular months showing exact or near exact matches , and different series covering different periods ( overlapping or otherwise ) .
For instance , there is actually very little disagreement between the 8 duplicate series for WMO station 25563 , featured in Jeff ’s recent post “ GHCN , Sorting a box of sox “ .
Having thus obtained a single temperature data series for each station , I then converted it to temperature anomalies by deducting from all data point s for each calendar month the mean of the post - 1899 data for that calendar month .
I then took the unweighted average of the anomaly series for all relevant long record stations .
I used the same methods for adjusted temperature data , where present , as for raw temperature data .
Raw Data
So what story does the raw data from the 1034 long record GHCN stations tell ?
Shown below is the unweighted mean of the temperature anomalies for all data from those stations for each month from 1999 to 2005 .
The mean is slightly smoothed , hence the high Lag - 1 serial correlation .
The trend is fairly low , at 0.0269 Deg.
C / Decade – which are the units I hereafter use for all trends .
The confidence interval is over three times as high as the trend , which is accordingly far from being statistically significant .
There is no pronounced peak in 1998 , and the peak temperature occurred in the 1930s .
As this data set largely represents temperatures in the USA , that is perhaps unsurprising .
In order to confirm that combining the long record station data had resulted in the trend of their mean temperature accurately reflecting the temperature trends of the individual stations , I also calculated the mean of those trends .
It was 0.0256 , very close to the 0.0269 trend of the mean temperature .
The distribution of these trends is shown in the below plot .
Adjusted Data
For many of the long record stations , GHCN also presents homogeneity - adjusted temperature series , of which there may again be duplicates .
Where there are duplicate series , the GHCN files do not indicate which of the duplicated raw series each adjusted series is based on , although often it will be possible to work this out .
Peterson ’s 1997 Bulletin of the AMS paper “ An overview of the Global Historical Climatology Network Temperature Database , available at the GHCN website , gives a very useful summary of the adjustment process , as well as of many other aspects of the GHCN temp data .
However , the adjustments appear to be primarily , if not exclusively , aimed at correcting for discontinuities .
So far as I can tell , they would not correct for gradual distortions to data caused by , for instance , an increasing Urban Heat Island effect as a conurbation encroached on a previously rural station or the size of a town in which a station was located grew .
The number of GHCN stations with adjusted data peaked at just over 4,000 , compared with just under 6,000 with raw data , but has fallen even more sharply in the last twenty years , with recent adjusted data only being available for about 250 stations .
This is illustrated below .
Of the 1034 long record GHCN stations , 764 also have adjusted temperature data satisfying the same completeness requirements .
As can be seen from the below map , the dominance of USA stations is even greater than for the long record station raw data .
One can gain some idea of the effects of the homogeneity adjustments by comparing the mean trend for all stations with adjusted data with the mean trend for all stations with raw data .
The graph below shows that the 1900 - 2005 trend in the mean anomaly temperature from the 764 stations using adjusted data was 0.0536 , again not statistically significant .
The mean of the trends of the individual series is almost identical at 0.0523 .
These trends are double those for the 1034 stations with long raw data records , which seems a little surprising .
A plot of the trends of the adjusted station data is given below .
There is perhaps slightly less scatter than for the raw data , but then there are fewer stations .
In order to get a clearer picture of the effects of the adjustment process , I calculated the trend in the combined raw data from all 764 stations which had long records of adjusted data , thereby ensuring a like - for - like comparison .
The mean raw temperature anomaly record of those 764 stations is shown below .
What this shows is that on average the adjustment process more than quadrupled the trend in raw temperatures , increasing the trend of the mean from 0.0113 for raw data to 0.0536 .
Indeed , if the mean trend change of 0.0423 resulting from adjustments to the long record stations were typical of the effect of adjustments to station data generally , the adjustment process would account for a substantial proportion of the recorded global mean temperature increase over the twentieth century .
It is not obvious why the mean adjustment should be positive , and of size that swamps the ( admittedly very small ) mean raw trend .
Maybe there is some further metadata information that explains what accounted for all the discontinuities for which adjustments were made , but as the process appears to be largely driven by statistical analysis it may be that the cause of the discontinuities is unknown .
In the Brohan et al ( JGR 2006 ) paper describing the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset , it is stated that station moves were often to a ( cooler ) out of town airport , so homogeneity adjustments were more likely than not to increase the trend .
However , only 106 of the 764 GHCN stations with long records of adjusted data are shown as located at an airport , and in many cases that is unlikely to follow a move from a nearby town , so I find this explanation unconvincing here .
The homogeneity adjustments affect the GHCN gridded temperature database , which is based on the adjusted data .
GISS uses raw data , and performs adjustments of its own .
It is unclear to me whether the homogeneity - adjustments that CRU uses for its HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset are entirely their own or whether they use some adjusted data from GHCN .
One can envisage circumstances in which adjusting for discontinuities could artificially increase the true trend , such as where a station had been encroached upon by a city or gradually affected by some other non-climatic warming and was then moved ( possibly on more than one occasion ) in order to restore its original type of surroundings .
That would produce a gradual warming that would not trigger any adjustment followed by a sharp drop that would be detected as a discontinuity and adjusted for .
Does this sort of problem occur often in practice ?
Dunno .
Examination of the of the effect of the homogeneity adjustments on the trends of individual stations are by no means uniformly positive , as the below scatter plot shows .
Nevertheless , the mean effect on trend of the adjustments is definitely greater than zero ( t=15.6 – highly significant ) .
Rural Data
In an attempt to avoid possible inflation in station trends resulting from UHI effects , I also screened out from the 1034 GHCN stations with long raw data records all but stations marked as rural .
That left 484 rural stations , of which unfortunately only 28 were outside the USA , located as per the below map .
The graph below shows that the mean 1900 - 2005 trend in the anomaly temperature raw data from the 484 rural stations was 0.0117 , statistically completely insignificant .
The mean of the trends of the individual series , as shown in the scatter plot below the temperature graph , is almost identical at 0.0102 .
These trends are under half those for all 1034 stations with long raw data records .
USA vs Rest of the World
Finally , I thought it worthwhile to divide the 1034 long record stations between USA stations ( of which there are 832 ) and the 202 non-USA stations .
The mean temperature anomaly of the USA stations , and the 1900 - 2005 trend thereof ( being 0.0144 ) , is shown in the next graph .
By comparison , the mean temperature anomaly of the non-USA stations has a much higher 1900 - 2005 trend , of 0.0805 , as shown in the below graph .
This is the only one of the graphs that shows a statistically significant trend .
Why should the non-USA long record stations show a mean 1900 - 2005 decadal trend of 0.0805 whilst the USA ones show a mean trend of only 0.0144 ?
Perhaps the USA has warmed by far less than other areas .
But as the non-USA stations are also very largely northern hemisphere , with in many cases similar latitudes to those of USA stations , it is not obvious to me why that should be .
However , there is one obvious possible explanation that is worth investigating further here : the UHI effect .
A majority , 456 out of 832 , of the long record USA stations are classified as rural .
Any many of the remainder may be in cities that had by 1900 already reached the size ( relatively small , I believe ) by which most of the UHI effect occurs .
By contrast , only 28 of the 202 long record non-USA stations are classified as rural , and it may be that relatively more of the urban stations are in towns that only became sizeable post 1900 .
Could the bulk of the difference in trend ( amounting to 0.7 deg. C over 1900 - 2005 ) between the long record USA and non-USA stations could be due to the UHI effect ?
At first sight , It seems conceivable .
Having said that , the pattern of temperature movements over 1900 - 2005 is not the same for the USA and non-USA stations , and there is so much weather noise in the data ( even when taking averages of hundreds of stations ) that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions .
In an attempt to estimate how much of the difference between the trends of long record USA and non-USA stations might be due to the UHI effect , I shortened the qualifying period to 1900 - 1990 .
Doing so increased the total number of rural stations from 484 to 574 .
More importantly , it increased the number of non-USA rural stations from 28 to 86 , albeit these are rather dominated by Australia , Canada and Siberia , as shown on the below map ( the final graphic , you will be pleased to know J ) .
I took the mean of the individual station trends over 1900 - 1995 rather than the trend of the mean , as the anomalisation period is more variable with only a 90 year qualifying period .
For the USA stations , the mean trend was - 0.0024 ( yes , a negative trend , albeit a completely insignificant one ) .
By comparison , the mean 1900 - 1995 trend of the 86 non-USA rural stations with 90 + year records was 0.0548 .
The mean trend over the same period for the 297 non-USA non-rural stations was only modestly higher than this , at 0.0606 , although the geographical distribution of the rural and non-rural non-USA data sets is different .
These results suggest that the UHI effect may account for part of the difference between twentieth century mean recorded temperature trends in the USA and elsewhere , but not the bulk of it .
However , these rural station results may not be representative of the rest of the world , and are almost certainly not statistically significant .
Further , non-USA stations marked as rural may be more likely to be affected by non-climatic warming , or warming affected by their type of environment , than are rural stations in the USA .
For instance , only 12 % of USA rural stations are near the coast , next to a large lake or on a small island , whereas 41 % of non-USA rural stations are .
It is conceivable that such environments could be are associated with greater ( or lesser ) twentieth century warming than land bound ones , although I am not aware of any evidence to that effect .
In conclusion , the raw data from long record GHCN stations shows little apparent warming in the USA and moderate warming ( on land ) elsewhere , only part of which seems likely to be due to the UHI effect .
The adjusted data shows much higher trends than the raw data for the same stations , and it is not clear why the homogeneity adjustments should on balance be significantly positive .
I do n’t have time to post a full turnkey R script , but I give in the Appendix my version of Jeff ’s getstation function , amended to include the modifier part of the station number , and the other key parts of the code used for generating the various long record station sets and the temperature graphs .
That should enable an interested reader who has loaded all the functions needed for running the script in Jeff ’s CRU # 2 post to generate the temperature graphs in this post .
I should end by noting that I cribbed functions and other bits of R code from work by Steve M , Ryan O and Jeff
Id in order to carry out the work outlined in this post .

Force India has become the latest team to unveil its 2010 challenger , after releasing images of its new VJM03 on Tuesday morning .
The car features the high nose and the shark - fin engine cover that has become typical of this year 's designs .
On the back of the team making big progress in 2009 , as it captured its maiden pole position and podium finish , Force India is looking for more success this year .
The new car will be tested for the first time at this week 's Jerez test and its design chiefs are confident it will be a match for the machinery that has already been unveiled .
Design director Mark Smith told AUTOSPORT that the Silverstone - based team had seen nothing on its rival cars that had caught it by surprise .
" There 's a little bit of variety out there but predominantly we are happy , " he said .
" You will always see something on each car that makes you think ' that 's interesting ' but understanding how they work on your car is the key thing .
" We have n't looked at photos and thought ' we 've missed something significant ' and we 're excited to get down to Jerez . "
Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi will race for Force India this year , with Paul di Resta installed as reserve and test driver .
Blog Posted in Kroft Ottokar 's Blog Can CEO 's learn from Alexander the Great in 2010 ?
blog:5084:0::0 Posted Jan 3 , 2010 in Business Comments By Kroft Ottokar Tweet Without question 2009 was a year of financial failure in America .
Can we rely on CEO's of our major corporations to turn the red ink to black ink on the bottom line ?
Many CEO 's have resided in a zone of comfort , unwilling to take risks that would benefit stockholders and the American worker .
The past two decades have changed America into a " retail " nation of unemployed workers , as our manufacturing sector has moved overseas .
The impact has been so deep that the taxpayer will now cover the losses for a generation or two .
Not only have tax dollars been spent to bail out failing corporations , but we will also pay tax to buy their products .
With 2010 upon us many citizens are very pessimistic regarding the future , and wonder if there could be a change in how America does business .
If we look back in history to Alexander the Great , we find an outstanding individual who in his short life of 32 years left lessons for the modern CEO of today .
We find that he ate , slept , played with his men , and even led his army into battle , rather than watch from afar .
He knew exactly what his army could and couldnot do .
His men followed him to the ends of the then known world , making his Persian empire the greatest in history up to that time .
Alexander took necessary risks by leaving any comfort zone behind to pursue growth and advancement never seen before .
He conquered the then known world in two years by his engagement as a visionary leader .
The modern CEO of today must resemble Alexander the Great , by leaving any zone of comfort , take necessary risks , and know exactly what a company can and cannot do .
The manufacturing sector " must " return home , to benefit the American worker with good pay and benefits .
Corporations mostly have become global in nature , so to achieve these goals require making corporate sacrifices to bring growth back to America .
Obviously stockholders of a company may resist a change in the way business is performed , so the modern CEO will use whatever means to accomplish goals that will bring growth back to America .
A great nation is defined by it 's moral principles to it 's citizens .
Alexander the Great is the greatest CEO of all time , he would be proud to know his legacy lives on today .
Without question 2009 was a year of financial failure in America .
Can we rely on CEO's of our major corporations to turn the red ink to black ink on the bottom line ?
Many CEO 's have resided in a zone of comfort , unwilling to take risks that would benefit stockholders and the American worker .
The past two decades have changed America into a " retail " nation of unemployed workers , as our manufacturing sector has moved overseas .
The impact has been so deep that the taxpayer will now cover the losses for a generation or two .
Not only have tax dollars been spent to bail out failing corporations , but we will also pay tax to buy their products .
With 2010 upon us many citizens are very pessimistic regarding the future , and wonder if there could be a change in how America does business .
If we look back in history to Alexander the Great , we find an outstanding individual who in his short life of 32 years left lessons for the modern CEO of today .
We find that he ate , slept , played with his men , and even led his army into battle , rather than watch from afar .
He knew exactly what his army could and couldnot do .
His men followed him to the ends of the then known world , making his Persian empire the greatest in history up to that time .
Alexander took necessary risks by leaving any comfort zone behind to pursue growth and advancement never seen before .
He conquered the then known world in two years by his engagement as a visionary leader .
The modern CEO of today must resemble Alexander the Great , by leaving any zone of comfort , take necessary risks , and know exactly what a company can and cannot do .
The manufacturing sector " must " return home , to benefit the American worker with good pay and benefits .
Corporations mostly have become global in nature , so to achieve these goals require making corporate sacrifices to bring growth back to America .
Obviously stockholders of a company may resist a change in the way business is performed , so the modern CEO will use whatever means to accomplish goals that will bring growth back to America .
A great nation is defined by it 's moral principles to it 's citizens .
Alexander the Great is the greatest CEO of all time , he would be proud to know his legacy lives on today .

President Barack Obama called Saturday for new steps to support America ’s small businesses , saying they are key to rebuilding the economy on a new , stronger foundation and creating jobs .
“ These companies represent the essence of the American spirit – the promise that anyone can succeed in this country if you have a good idea and the determination to see it through , ” Obama said in his weekly radio address .

The president said last year , his administration had taken measures that supported over 47,000 loans to small businesses and delivered billions of dollars in tax relief to small business owners .
But he argued that more must be done .
Obama said he had proposed taking 30 billion dollars from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) fund originally used for bailing out Wall Street investment banks and create a new Small Business Lending Fund that will provide capital for community banks on Main Street .
“ These are the small , local banks that will be able to give our small business owners more of the credit they need to stay afloat , ” the president noted .
He said the government should also continue to waive fees , increase guarantees , and expand the size of loans for small businesses .
Obama said he had also proposed a new tax credit for more than one million small businesses that hire new workers or raise wages “ to give these companies greater incentives to grow and create jobs ”

The president also called for “ targeted support ” for small businesses with the greatest potential to export new goods and products .
Obama urged members of Congress , who will start debating many of these proposals next week , not to create obstacles to their passage .
“ The proposals I ’ve outlined are not Democratic or Republican ; liberal or conservative , ” he argued .
“ They are pro-business , they are pro-growth , and they are pro-job . ”

With AFP .
Mr Garg was working at a fast food restaurant The Australian government has played down a travel advisory issued by India warning of the risk of violence against Indian students in Melbourne .
The warning followed the killing last week of an Indian graduate , Nitin Garg , who was stabbed to death in the city .
The Indian travel advisory warned of an increase in robberies and assaults .
But acting Australian foreign minister Simon Crean urged Indian leaders to avoid fuelling hysteria and said Melbourne was safe for visitors .
India 's travel advisory said acts of violence against Indians had often been accompanied by verbal abuse and fuelled by drugs and alcohol .
Basic safety " The government advises Indian students studying in Australia , as well as those planning to study there , that they should take certain basic precautions in being alert to their own security while moving around , " the notice said .
Fewer Indians to study in Australia
The foreign ministry 's eight - point advisory also asked Indian citizens to report " complaints " to Indian diplomatic missions in Australia .
" The number of such incidents of assault as well as of robbery has been on the rise in recent months , which has affected not only Indian students but also members of the larger Indian community in Australia , " it added .
Mr Garg 's murder has received wide media coverage in India , with one newspaper describing his death as proof " that the issue of racist attacks on the Indian community needs to be addressed by the Australian authorities " .
' Not racist ' Australian police have said 1,447 people of Indian descent were victims of a crime in Victoria in the 12 months to July 2008 .
But Australian authorities insist there is no racism behind the attacks , only opportunistic criminals .
" What we have to do is to let the investigations take their course , but certainly on the basis of what we 're being told so far , by the Victorian authorities , there 's no basis for a racial motivation behind this , " Mr Crean told Australian radio .
Indian Foreign Minister SM Krishna urged the Australian authorities to " speedily book " the people responsible for the killing of Nitin Garg .
Mr Garg was stabbed to death on his way to a fast food restaurant in Melbourne on Saturday night .
Mr Krishna said the attack was " highly condemnable " .
He said the Australian government should realise such attacks were making public opinion in India " polarised " .
Australia 's Tourism Forecasting Committee ( TFC ) said Indian students were choosing to stay away because of a series of attacks in mid-2009 .
The number of Indian students studying in Australia is projected to fall by about 20 % in 2010 , the TFC said .

FOUNDER & PRESIDENT
RIGVEDA DESHPANDEY
( MUMBAI )
Rigveda Deshpandey is a multi-talented media professional - a Sound Engineer , Dubbing Director , Writer , Quality Controller & Lecturer .
He is presently a Vice President in a corporate studio .
He loves teaching Sound Engineering and sharing his industry experiences with students , making concepts very simple to understand and involving them in his projects for hands on experience .
He has been whistling musically since the age of 6 , looking up to his dad and founded the Indian Whistlers ’
Association at a young age of 18 with a utopic dream of changing the ‘ taboo ’ perception of musical whistling in India and spreading it as a serious performing art among the people of India .
His mother Meeinal is his biggest supporter and critique and he believes that this art specially needs an extraordinary amount of family support to hone and prosper .
He aims to bring out all the “ bathroom whistlers ” on to the stage .
His pioneering work has been a Whistling Syllabus - first and only one of its kind in India and he teaches from the basics - “ Man is the instrument ” and all about the anatomy and origins of whistling to how one should prepare to perform at international platforms .
It was under his leadership and vision that Indian Whistlers ’ Association made a Limca Book Record of 48 whistlers whistling “ Saare Jahan Se Achha ” together at one place in July 2008 ( published in 2009 ) , a 4 member team competed at the International Whistling Convention , 2010 China doing a skit called “ Bollywood Love Story ” along with whistling and won the 3rd prize - first for anyone from India .
In 2016 , a 8 member team traveled to World Whistlers Convention , 2016 Japan and won 3 - 1st prizes and became World Champions .
Also for the first time in the world he attempted Salsa dance and whistling with his dance partner Dr. Farzana Lakdavala .
In 2018 , a 150 whistlers National Record was created under his leadership and in 2020 he directed and produced a viral music video of “ Mile Sur Mera Tumhara ” involving 50 whistlers , from India and abroad , mostly shot on mobile .
I once tried setting my watch ahead a few minutes to help me make it to appointments on time .
At first it worked , but not because I was fooled .
I would glance at the watch , get worried that I was late , then remember that the watch is fast .
But that brief flash acted as a sort of preview of how it feels to be late .
And the feeling is a better motivator than the thought in the abstract .
But that did n’t last very long .
The surprise wore off .
I wonder if there are ways to maintain the surprise .
For example , instead of setting the watch a fixed time ahead , I could set it to run too fast so that it gained an extra minute every week or month .
Then if I have adaptive expectations I could consistently fool myself .
I think I might adjust to that eventually though .
How about a randomizing watch ?
I do n’t think you want a watch that just shows you a completely random time , but maybe one that randomly perturbs the time a little bit .
Would a mean - preserving spread make sense ?
That way you have the right time on average but if you are risk - averse you will move a little faster .
You could try to exploit “ rational inattention . ”
You could set the watch to show the true time 95 % of the time and the remaining 5 % of the time add 5 minutes .
Your mind thinks that it ’s so likely that the watch is correct that it does n’t waste resources on trying to research the small probability event that it ’s not .
Then you get the full effect 5 % of the time .
Maybe its simpler to just set all of your friends ’ watches to run too slow .
MOSCOW  Vadim V. Vodyanitsky runs a fish processing plant in Russia ’s Far East , and one question looms over his day , as crucial as the trawler schedules or the Pacific tidal patterns .
What time is it in Moscow , 5,000 miles away ?
There are many ways to measure Russia ’s girth , but Mr. Vodyanitsky can speak to one of the most compelling : it has 11 time zones , from the Polish border to near Alaska , a system so vast that you can get a walloping case of jet lag from a domestic flight .
The time zones , set up by the Soviets to showcase the country ’s size , have long been a source of national pride , but the government is now viewing them as a liability and is considering shedding some .
In today ’s economy of constant communication , it is hard to manage businesses and other affairs when one region is waking up and another is thinking about dinner .
Mr. Vodyanitsky , for example , has his plant on the Kamchatka Peninsula , nine hours ahead of Moscow , and his office in Vladivostok , seven hours ahead .
But his business often depends on decisions by regulatory and banking officials in the capital .
“ It ’s extremely inconvenient getting anything done through Moscow , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ For any activity , we often have to wait a day , wasting a whole 24 hours . ”
A new human sex hormone has been found , a new study says .
The naturally occurring substance could lead to the long - sought male birth control pill , researchers cautiously speculate .
Gonadotropin - inhibitory hormone ( GnIH ) — first identified in birds about a decade ago — was recently discovered in the hypothalamus of the human brain .
The hypothalamus produces hormones that regulate sleep , sex drive , body temperature , and more .
GnIH suppresses another hormone — gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) — which spurs the release of additional hormones , which prime the body for sex and reproduction .
So scientists cautiously suggest that contraceptives based on the newfound hormone could someday be possible .
" That is an idea we 've toyed with , " said study co-author George Bentley , a biologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
But " we do n't know enough about it yet . "
Louis DePaolo , the U.S. National Institutes of Health's Reproductive Sciences Branch chief , agreed " it 's too premature " to consider a male birth control pill .
GnIH has been known in animals since 2000 , and it was known that humans have a GnIH gene , but until now it was a mystery whether humans actually produce the hormone and what its role is .
The researchers , however , extracted GnIH from five human hypthalumuses and proved that the it affects nerve cells that produce the GnRH , the fertility - boosting hormone .
Now Hormone Could Be Cancer Fighter ?
But GnIH could be part of new treatments to combat hormone - sensitive cancers , such as breast and prostate cancers , the study said .
Romney : ' Obama fails to understand America '
Mitt Romney has gone from being an overeager suitor to being a favored son of the Conservative Political Action Conference since he ended his presidential campaign here in 2008 , and his speech today was well - calibrated to an audience basking in a conservative resurgence and eager for attacks on Obama .
Sen . Scott Brown introduced Romney , sharing a bit of his new star power with the former governor , whose aides ran Brown ’s campaign , and calling him perfectly qualified " to fix a broken economy . "
Romney ’s prepared remarks lace into Obama on an array of issues , all hinged on a single theme : Obama has departed from American values .
Romney uses the word “ America ” and variants 39 times in his prepared remarks , in which he also sharply attacks the health care plan that ’s been compared with his own Massachusetts plan and says he wonders “ whether Washington ’s liberal politicians understand the greatness of America . ”
“ President Obama fails to understand America , ” Romney says .
“ He said : ‘ With all the lobbying and horse trading , the process left most Americans wondering , “ What ’s in it for me ? ” ’
That ’s not at all what they were asking .
They were asking : ‘ What ’s in it for America ? ’
“ America will not endure government - run health care , a new and expansive entitlement , an inexplicable and surely vanishing cut in Medicare and an even greater burden of taxes .
Americans said no because Obamacare is bad care for America ! ” Romney says .
Obama's " Americanness " was the subject of a famous , and largely ignored , memo from Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn to the candidate that suggested Clinton exploit questions about Obama 's specifically American values .
Romney calls labor - backed compromises on health care legislation “ certainly unconstitutional , ” and he questions the president ’s judgment on questions from the Supreme Court to national security .
But Romney also appears to position Republicans to respond to an economic recovery , blaming Obama that it had not come more swiftly .
“ Will the economy and unemployment recover ?
Of course .
Thanks to a vibrant and innovative citizenry , they always do , ” he says in the speech .
“ But this president will not deserve the credit he will undoubtedly claim .
" He has prolonged the recession , expanded the pain of unemployment and added to the burden of debt we will leave future generations .
President Obama , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and their team have failed the American people , and that is why their majority will be out the door . ”
The full remarks are after the jump .
Romney 's speech to CPAC , as prepared :
Thank you to Jay and to Scott for those generous introductions .
Both these men have made real contributions to our nation .
It ’s good to be back at CPAC .
I ca n’t think of an audience I ’d rather be addressing today .
I spent the weekend in Vancouver .
As always , the Olympic Games were inspiring .
But in case you did n’t hear the late - breaking news , the gold medal in the downhill was taken away from American Lindsey Vonn .
It was determined that President Obama is going downhill faster than she is .
I ’m not telling you something you do n’t know when I say that our conservative movement took a real hit in the 2008 elections .
The victors were not exactly gracious in their big win : Media legs were tingling .
Time Magazine ’s cover pictured the Republican elephant and declared it an endangered species .
The new president himself promised change of biblical proportion .
And given his filibuster - proof Senate and lopsided House , he had everything he needed to deliver it .
They won , we lost .
But you know , you learn a lot about people when you see how they react to losing .
We did n’t serve up excuses or blame our fellow citizens .
Instead , we listened to the American people , we sharpened our thinking and our arguments , we spoke with greater persuasiveness , we took our message to more journals and airwaves , and in the American tradition , some even brought attention to our cause with rallies and Tea parties .
I know that most of you have watched intently as the conservative comeback began in Virginia and exploded onto the scene in New Jersey .
But as a Massachusetts man , who , like my fellow Bay Staters , has over the years , been understandably regarded somewhat suspiciously in gatherings like this , let me take just a moment to exalt in a Scott Brown victory !
For that victory that stopped Obama–care and turned back the Reid - Pelosi liberal tide , we have something to that you ’d never think you ’d hear at CPAC , “ Thank you Massachusetts ! ”
2009 was the President ’s turn to suffer losses , and not just at the ballot box , but also in bill after bill in Congress , and most importantly , in his failure to reignite the economy .
In how he has responded to these defeats , too , we have learned a great about him and about his team .
He began by claiming that he had not failed at all .
Remember the B+ grade he gave himself for his first year ?
Tell that to the 4 million Americans who lost their jobs last year , and to the millions more who stopped looking .
Explain that to the world ’s financial markets who gaped at trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see .
Square that with the absence of any meaningful sanctions against Iran even as it funds terror and races to become a nuclear nation .
President Obama ’s self - proclaimed B+ will go down in history as the biggest exaggeration since Al Gore ’s invention of the Internet !
Unable to convince us that his failure was a success , he turned to the second dodge of losing teams :
Try to pin the blame on someone else .
Did you see his State of the Union address ?
First , he took on the one group in the room that was restrained from responding — the Supreme Court .
The president found it inexplicable that the First Amendment right of free speech should be guaranteed not just to labor union corporations and media corporations , but equally to all corporations , big and small .
When it was all over , I think most Americans felt as I did :
His noisy critique and bombast did not register as clear and convincingly as Justice Alito ’s silent lips forming these words : “ Not true ! ”
Next he blamed the Republicans in the room , condescending to lecture them on the workings of the budget process , a process many of them had in fact mastered while he was still at Harvard Law School .
He blamed Republicans for the gridlock that has blocked his favorite legislation ; but he knows as well as we do that he did not need one single solitary Republican vote in either house to pass his legislation .
It was Democrats who blocked him , Democrats who said “ no ” to his liberal agenda after they had been home to their districts and heard from the American people .
As Everett Dirksen used to say , “ When they felt the heat , they saw the light . ”
God bless every American who said no !
Of course , the President accuses us of being the party of “ no . ”
It ’s as if he thinks that saying “ no ” is by definition a bad thing .
In fact , it is right and praiseworthy to say no to bad things .
It is right to say no to cap and trade , no to card check , no to government health care , and no to higher taxes .
My party should never be a rubber stamp for rubber check spending .
But before we move away from this “ no ” epithet the Democrats are fond of applying to us , let ’s ask the Obama folks why they say “ no ” — no to a balanced budget , no to reforming entitlements , no to malpractice reform , no to missile defense In Eastern Europe , no to prosecuting Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a military tribunal , and no to tax cuts that create new jobs .
You see , we conservatives do n’t have a corner on saying no ; we ’re just the ones who say it when that ’s the right thing to do !
And that leads us to who he has most recently charged with culpability for his failures : the American people .
It seems that we have failed to understand his wise plans for us .
If he just slows down , he reasons , and makes a concerted effort to explain Obama - care in a way even we can understand , if we just listen better , then we will get it .
Actually , Americans have been listening quite attentively .
And they have been watching .
When he barred CSPAN from covering the healthcare deliberations , they saw President Obama break his promise of transparency .
When the Democrat leadership was empowered to bribe Nebraska ’s Senator Nelson , they saw President Obama break his promise of a new kind of politics in Washington .
And when he cut a special and certainly unconstitutional healthcare deal with the unions , they saw him not just break his promise , they saw the most blatant and reprehensible manifestation of political payoff in modern memory .
No , Mr. President , the American people did n’t hear and see too little , they saw too much !
Here again , with all due respect , President Obama fails to understand America .
He said : “ With all the lobbying and horse - trading , the process left most Americans wondering , ‘ What ’s in it for me ? ’ ”
That ’s not at all what they were asking .
They were asking : “ What ’s in it for America ? ”
America will not endure government run health care , a new and expansive entitlement , an inexplicable and surely vanishing cut in Medicare and an even greater burden of taxes .
Americans said no because Obama - care is bad care for America !
When it comes to shifting responsibility for failure , however , no one is a more frequent object of President Obama ’s reproach than President Bush .
It ’s wearing so thin that even the late night shows make fun of it .
I am convinced that history will judge President Bush far more kindly — he pulled us from a deepening recession following the attack of 9/11 , he overcame teachers unions to test school children and evaluate schools , he took down the Taliban , waged a war against the jihadists and was not afraid to call it what it is — a war , and he kept us safe .
I respect his silence even in the face of the assaults on his record that come from this administration .
But at the same time , I also respect the loyalty and indefatigable defense of truth that comes from our “ I do n’t give a damn ” Vice President Dick Cheney !
I ’m afraid that after all the finger - pointing is finished , it has become clear who is responsible for President Obama ’s lost year , the 10 percent unemployment year — President Obama and his fellow Democrats .
So when it comes to pinning blame , pin the tail on the donkeys .
There ’s a good deal of conjecture about the cause of President Obama ’s failures .
As he frequently reminds us , he assumed the presidency at a difficult time .
That ’s the reason we argued during the campaign that these were not the times for on the job training .
Had he or his advisors spent even a few years in the real economy , they would have learned that the number one cause of failure in the private sector is lack of focus , and that the first rule of turning around any troubled enterprise is focus , focus , focus .
And so , when he assumed the presidency , his energy should have been focused on fixing the economy and creating jobs , and to succeeding in our fight against radical violent jihad in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Instead , he applied his time and political capital to his ill - conceived health care takeover and to building his personal popularity in foreign countries .
He failed to focus , and so he failed .
But there was an even bigger problem than lack of focus .
Ronald Reagan used to say this about liberals : “ It ’s not that they ’re ignorant , it ’s that what they know is wrong . ”
Too often , when it came to what President Obama knew , he was wrong .
He correctly acknowledged that the government does n’t create jobs , that only the private sector can do that .
He said that the government can create the conditions , the environment , which leads the private sector to add employment .
But consider not what he said , but what he did last year , and ask whether it helped or hurt the environment for investment , growth and new jobs .
Announcing 2011 tax increases for individuals and businesses and for capital gains hurt .
Passing cap and trade hurt .
Giving trial lawyers a free pass hurt .
Proposing card check to eliminate secret ballots in union elections hurt .
Holding on to GM stock and insisting on calling the shots there hurt .
Making a grab for healthcare , almost 1/5th of our economy , hurt .
Budgeting government deficits in the trillions hurt .
And scapegoating and demonizing businesspeople hurt .
President Obama instituted the most antigrowth , anti-investment , antijobs measures we ’ve seen in our lifetimes .
He called his agenda ambitious .
I call it reckless .
He scared employers , so jobs were scarce .
His nearly trillion dollar stimulus created not one net new job in the private sector , but it saved and grew jobs in the government sector — the one place we should have shed jobs .
And even today , because he has been unwilling or unable to define the road ahead , uncertainty and lack of predictability permeate the private economy , and prolongs its stall .
America is not better off than it was $ 1.8 trillion ago .
Will the economy and unemployment recover ?
Of course .
Thanks to a vibrant and innovative citizenry , they always do .
But this president will not deserve the credit he will undoubtedly claim .
He has prolonged the recession , expanded the pain of unemployment , and added to the burden of debt we will leave future generations .
President Obama , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and their team have failed the American people , and that is why their majority will be out the door .
Is n’t it fitting that so many of those who have contempt for the private sector will soon find themselves back in it ?
The people of America are looking to conservatives for leadership , and we must not fail them .
Conservatism has had from its inception a vigorously positive , intellectually rigorous agenda .
That agenda should have three pillars : strengthen the economy , strengthen our security , and strengthen our families .
We will strengthen the economy by simplifying and lowering taxes , by replacing outmoded regulation with modern , dynamic regulation , by opening markets to American goods , by strengthening our currency and our capital markets , and by investing in research and basic science .
Instead of leading the world in how much we borrow , we will make sure that we lead the world in how much we build and create and invest .
We will strengthen our security by building missile defense , restoring our military might , and standing - by and strengthening our intelligence officers .
And conservatives believe in providing constitutional rights to our citizens , not to enemy combatants like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed !
On our watch , the conversation with a would - be suicide bomber will not begin with the words , “ You have the right to remain silent ! ”
Our conservative agenda strengthens our families in part by putting our schools on track to be the best in the world .
Because great schools start with great teachers , we will insist on hiring teachers from the top third of college graduates , and we will give better teachers better pay .
School accountability , school choice and cyber schools will be priorities .
We will put parents and teachers back in charge of education , not the fat cat CEO ’s of the teachers unions !
Strong families will have excellent health care .
Getting health care coverage for the uninsured should be accomplished at the state level , not a one - size - fits all Pelosi plan .
The right way to rein in health care cost is not by making it more like the post office , it ’s by making it more like a consumer - driven market .
The answer for health care is market incentives not health care by a Godzilla - size government bureaucracy !
When it comes to our role in the world , our conservative agenda hews to the principles that have defined our nation ’s foreign policy for over six decades :
We will promote and defend the American ideals of political freedom , free enterprise and human rights .
We will stand with our allies , and confront those who threaten peace and destroy liberty .
There ’s much more on our positive , intellectually rigorous conservative agenda .
Not all of it is popular .
But the American people have shown that they are ready for truth to trump hope .
The truth is that government is not the solution to all our problems .
This year , I have taken the time to write a book that tells the truth about the challenges our nation faces , and about the conservative solutions needed to overcome them .
I have titled it : No Apology : The Case for American Greatness .
I ’ve set up a booth outside so that you can buy a few hundred copies each .
Well , maybe one or two .
Sometimes I wonder whether Washington ’s liberal politicians understand the greatness of America .
Let me explain why I say that .
At Christmas time , I was in Wal - Mart to buy some toys for my grandkids .
As I waited in the check - out line , I took a good look around the store .
I thought to myself of the impact Sam Walton had on his company .
Sam Walton was all about good value on everything the customer might want .
And so is Wal - Mart : rock bottom prices and tens of thousands of items .
The impact that founders like Sam Walton have on their enterprises is actually quite remarkable .
In many ways , Microsoft is a reflection of Bill Gates , just as Apple is of Steve Jobs .
Disneyland is a permanent tribute to Walt Disney himself — imaginative and whimsical .
Virgin Airlines is as irreverent and edgy as its founder .
As you look around you , you see that people shape enterprises , sometimes for many years even after they are gone .
People shape businesses .
People shape countries .
America reflects the values of the people who first landed here , those who founded the nation , those who won our freedom , and those who made America the leader of the world .
America was discovered and settled by pioneers .
Later , the founders launched an entirely new concept of nation , one where the people would be sovereign , not the king , not the state .
And this would apply not just to government , but also to the American economy : the individual would pursue his or her happiness in freedom , independent from government dictate .
Every American was free to be an inventor , an innovator , a founder .
America became the land of opportunity and a nation of pioneers .
We attracted people of pioneering spirit from around the world .
They came here for freedom and opportunity , knowing that the cost was incredibly high : leaving behind family and the familiar , learning a new language , often living at first in poverty , sometimes facing prejudice , working long and hard hours .
All of these pioneers built a nation of incomparable prosperity and unrivaled security .
After its founding , our national economy grew thanks to more pioneers — people like Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison , Henry Ford , William Procter and Robert Wood Johnson , Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard and Thomas Watson .
These are names we know — but the less well known are just as vital American innovators , and they number in the millions .
That American pioneering spirit is what propelled us to master the industrial age just as today we marshal the information age .
This course for America , chosen by the founders , has been settled for over 200 years .
Ours is the creed of the pioneers , the innovators , the strivers who expect no guarantee of success , but ask only to live and work in freedom .
This creed is under assault in Washington today .
Liberals are convinced that government knows better than the people how to run our businesses , how to choose winning technologies , how to manage healthcare , how to grow an economy , and how to order our very lives .
They want to gain through government takeover what they could never achieve in the competitive economy — power and control over the people of America .
If these liberal neo -monarchists succeed , they will kill the very spirit that has built the nation — the innovating , inventing , creating , independent current that runs from coast to coast .
This is the liberal agenda for government .
It does not encourage pioneers , inventors and investors — it suffocates them .
In a world where others have lost their liberty by trading it away for the false promises of the state , we choose to hold to our founding principles .
We will stop these power seekers where they stand .
We will keep America America by retaining its character as the land of opportunity .
We welcome the entrepreneur , the inventor , the innovator .
We will insist on greatness from every one of our citizens , and rather than apologizing for who we are or for what we have accomplished , we will celebrate our nation ’s strength and goodness .
American patriots have defeated tyrants , liberated the oppressed , and rescued the afflicted .
America ’s model of innovation , capitalism and free enterprise has lifted literally billons of the world ’s people out of poverty .
America has been a force for good like no other in this world , and for that we make no apology .
Alright , time to schedule another meetup !
Overall , the most requests have come in for a " Dave & Busters - esque " scenario , so ...
Let 's just meet up at Dave & Busters .
The closest ( and most Metro accessible one ) is in Kensington , MD .
It 's not as far as most probably think - hit up the White Flint Metro stop , and take a short walk over .
Google Map 'd below for your convenience , too .
http://maps.google.co...
( http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=White+Flint+Station+%4039.048146,-77.112842&geocode=&dirflg=&daddr=11301+Rockville+Pike++Kensington+,+MD+20895&f=d&sll=39.049585,-77.11132&sspn=0.019297,0.039825&ie=UTF8&z=17)
Let 's meet up on the 20th , around 8 PM .
I 'll throw more details about specifically where / how to meet as the date gets closer , which you 'll all most likely get emailed to you ( if you 're using the default Meetup.com settings ) .
You 'll also get reminders about the event as it gets closer .
Place should be good for everyone - food , beer , games , etc .
On one final note , Dave & Busters has a policy about under - 21's ; if you 're in that age range , you just need to be there with someone who 's 25 or older .
Not sure the best way to go about dealing with this - it's a problem that 's gonna come up in a lot of meetup scenarios on a Saturday night , but this one seems deal - able .
If you 're under 21 , please let me know so I can gauge how big of an issue this is , as well as how to best solve it .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. banks that spent more money on lobbying were more likely to get government bailout money , according to a study released on Monday .
Banks whose executives served on Federal Reserve boards were more likely to receive government bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , according to the study from Ran Duchin and Denis Sosyura , professors at the University of Michigan ’s Ross School of Business .
Banks with headquarters in the district of a U.S. House of Representatives member who serves on a committee or subcommittee relating to TARP also received more funds .
Political influence was most helpful for poorly performing banks , the study found .
“ Political connections play an important role in a firm ’s access to capital , ” Sosyura , a University of Michigan assistant professor of finance , said in a statement .
Banks with an executive who sat on the board of a Federal Reserve Bank were 31 percent more likely to get bailouts through TARP ’s Capital Purchase Program , the study showed .
Banks with ties to a finance committee member were 26 percent more likely to get capital purchase program funds .
As of late September , nearly 700 financial institutions had received bailouts of $ 205 billion under the capital purchase program , the study said .
The banking industry has long been criticized for using political influence to obtain bailouts .
Scott Talbott , a senior vice president with industry lobbying group The Financial Services Roundtable , said the study was skewed because it did not exclude nine of the largest banks that were “ strongly asked ” by the government to take bailouts .
Those banks included Goldman Sachs Group Inc , JPMorgan Chase & Co , and Morgan Stanley -- all of which repaid their bailouts in June .
Bank of America Co and Citigroup Inc more recently announced plans to pay back taxpayers .
Talbott also noted that $ 116 billion has been repaid with interest .
“ This demonstrates the banks were excellent stewards of the taxpayer ’s money , ” Talbott said .
But a watchdog for the government ’s bailout , the special inspector general for TARP , said last month that the broader $ 700 billion bailout program “ almost certainly ” will result in an overall loss for taxpayers .
President Obama said in October that despite the bailout , there was still too little credit flowing to small businesses .
There is n't much going on in most kitchen gardens at this time of year , but there 's one item you can produce all winter long .
Satisfy your cravings for homegrown produce with an indoor mushroom kit .
As one of nature 's most versatile foods , mushrooms go with just about any dish and can be used in a multitude of ways .
Just imagine what the smoky flavor of shiitakes can do in soups and stews , the delicate texture of oyster mushrooms in a frittata , or the richness of baby portobellos in stir -fry .
And , depending on the type of mushroom kit you choose , you can be sautéing a few in just a matter of weeks .
Unlike regular garden vegetables that are produced by seeds , these fleshy fungi are produced from spores underneath the cap .
The microscopic bodies are smaller than the tiniest seeds .
Mushrooms are also produced from germinated spawn , which are the threadlike mycelia grown in a specially prepared medium .
If it helps , think of spores as seeds and spawn as seedlings .
Getting started
The most reliable and convenient way to start growing your own edible fungi is with an easy - to - use mushroom kit .
The kits -- which generally consist of a cardboard box or perforated bag containing pre-inoculated media for growing mushrooms -- have all the ingredients you need to get started .
Depending on the type of mushroom , most kits will produce several crops over a period of eight to 15 weeks .
Many kits to get you started are available for around $ 20 .
Go for cool and damp
Prime indoor mushroom - growing locations include any cool , damp place in the bathroom , kitchen , basement or garage , such as an unused cabinet , closet , shower , or underneath the kitchen sink .
The space need n't be large , but it does need to be an area where you can create near - darkness , maintain a consistently humid environment ( 70 to 80 percent humidity is ideal ) and , depending on the kit , keep the temperature between 55 and 70 degrees .
Control the light
The area should be sheltered from direct light .
Some filtered or indirect light is needed for oyster mushrooms and some other varieties to produce .
Portobellos and their relatives the white and cremini mushrooms , however , need complete darkness as any amount of light causes them to develop dark brown caps .
What to grow indoors
While commercial growers sell a wide range of mushroom spawn , the easiest culinary varieties to grow indoors and the most readily available from a kit are oysters (
Pleurotus species
) , wine caps (
Stropharia rugosoannulata
) , and various button - type mushrooms (
Agaricus bisporus
) , which include the cremini and portobellos .
You can purchase a shiitake (
Lentinula edodes
) mushroom kit for growing indoors , which also comes as a cardboard box containing pre-inoculated media .
However a more common method for growing these mushrooms is with " shiitake logs , " which are usually 40 - inch - long , 4 - to 6 - inch - diameter logs of oak or other dense hardwood inoculated with plugs of spawn encased in wood dowels .
The inoculated logs , which can produce for years , are usually stacked in a shady place outdoors .
They can be kept fruiting through winter , however , in a greenhouse sheltered by the shade of taller plants .
Growing tips
Moisture is key to getting the most production from your mushroom kit as constant humidity is crucial for mushrooms to develop and grow .
Air that 's too dry can quickly lead to the downfall of any mushroom - growing endeavors .
The medium should be kept moist but not so much that it becomes soggy or wet .
A daily misting from a water - filled spray bottle will provide needed moisture and help maintain a humid environment .
The area also needs to be well - ventilated to prevent a buildup of carbon dioxide -- an excess can drastically slow or even close down your mushroom production .
Using an electric fan will help increase air circulation with a constant flow of air .
So put a damper on winter 's chill by growing your own gourmet mushrooms indoors .
It 's a fun project that takes little time or effort -- and the rewards will be some of the freshest and most flavorful mushrooms you may ever eat .

KEEP ON GROWING OUTDOORS
After your mushroom kit has completed fruiting indoors , you can use the remains to start a more permanent outdoor colony .
Once established , they will continue to pop up , fruiting in flushes for years .
Think of the remains as you would sourdough culture .
Given the right conditions , the culture can be kept viable for years .
The key is to use the remains before all of the spawn has expired .
Mushrooms grow in organic material such as sawdust , manure or compost .
However the type of preferred growing medium varies depending on the type of mushroom .
For example , shiitake mushrooms are typically grown on hardwoods or hardwood sawdust , while oyster mushrooms prefer clean wheat or oat straw .
Button mushrooms and their relatives are grown on rich compost or composted manure .
Wine caps flourish on decaying matter ranging from shady garden soil to piles of wood chips or compost heaps .
With a little patience and luck , they may even naturalize on their own .

When Tim Berners - Lee arrived at CERN , Geneva 's celebrated European Particle Physics Laboratory in 1980 , he'd been hired to help replace the control systems for several of the lab 's particle accelerators .
Almost immediately , the inventor of the modern Web page noticed a problem : thousands of people were coming and going from the famous research institute , many of them temporary hires .
" The big challenge for contract programmers was to try to understand the systems , both human and computer , that ran this fantastic playground , " he later wrote .
" Much of the crucial information existed only in people 's heads . "
In his spare time , Berners - Lee was working on some software that might alleviate this fragmentation and spread more useful information around .
It was a little program he named Enquire , and it allowed users to create " nodes " — information - packed index card - style pages that linked to other pages .
Berners - Lee was pleased with what he eventually produced , but the PASCAL application ran on CERN 's obscure and proprietary operating system , so he did n't take it with him when his contract expired .
" I gave the eight - inch floppy disk to a systems manager , and explained that it was a program for keeping track of information , " Berners - Lee recalled , and told CERN staff to deploy the program as they saw fit .
" The few people who saw it thought it was a nice idea , but no one used it .
Eventually , the disk was lost , and with it , the original Enquire . "
Four years later , Berners - Lee returned to CERN .
This time his innovation took on a life of its own and gradually morphed into the World Wide Web .
But for now , let 's stay with the Enquire story .
Let 's stay with that eight - inch floppy sitting in a circular file in the back corner of somebody 's office — a great communications technology idea that got lost in the shuffle .
Why focus on the the dustbin ?
Because from the dawn of telecommunications history through the present , that 's where most innovations actually wind up .
Wholly unnecessary
Take Sir Francis Ronalds .
In 1814 , it occurred to the British meteorologist that Europe 's widely used semaphore telegraph system could be improved by sending signals electronically , rather than visually through sign post towers .
So he put together an elaborate gizmo in the garden of his Upper Mall house in London .
Can you imagine Jack Dorsey inventing Twitter , then offering it to the State Department ?
That 's pretty much the equivalent of what Francis Ronalds did .
I 've never been able to find a description that adequately explained Ronalds ' contraption , but the device centered around a glass tube encasing a wire linking two synchronized clocks .
Each station had a pair of pith balls ready to bounce into each other in response to an electrical signal , then the receiving clock would rotate to the specific character prompted by the electrically charged sending clock .
By 1816 , Ronalds had demonstrated the machine to his satisfaction .
What did he do next ?
Something that is completely unthinkable in our time , so far as I can tell .
He offered to hand his gadget over to the Crown .
" Why should not our government govern at Portsmouth almost as promptly as at Downing Street ? "
Ronalds wrote to Viscount Melville , Lord of the Admiralty .
" Let us have electric conversazione offices , communicating with each other all over the kingdom , if we can . "
Can you imagine Jack Dorsey inventing Twitter , then offering it to the State Department ?
That 's pretty much the equivalent of what Francis Ronalds did .
And what did Lord Melville say in response to this patriotic largesse ?
He turned Ronalds down .
Since the war with Napoleon had concluded , Melville 's secretary wrote back , there was no particular reason to improve on the semaphore system .
" Telegraphs of any kind are now wholly unnecessary .
No other than the one now in use will be adopted . "
Not being able to give away your masterpiece ; can it get any worse than that ?
Sure it can .
At least Ronalds noticed that he had built a world - changing invention .
The same could n't be said for Reginald Fessenden .
A song for the ships at sea
In 1906 , the Canadian engineer was experimenting with high frequency alternators to send wireless Morse code across the Atlantic Ocean .
But he also saw that his continuous wave technology could be used to transmit the human voice .
And so on Christmas Eve of that year , Fessenden broadcast live to the ships sailing by his Brant Rock , Massachusetts wireless station .
He played his violin , some phonograph records , sang a few tunes himself , then made a speech .
Amazed shipboard wireless operators wrote back to say that they had heard Fessenden 's performance .
" The Christmas Eve program is still considered the first radio broadcast in American history , " notes the communications historian Susan Douglas , " and a truly dramatic demonstration of the alternator 's capabilities . "
So what did Fessenden do then ?
About radio broadcasting — nothing .
He saw his innovation only as a way to improve wireless communications between individuals .
" It is important to note that Fessenden was not proposing that the wireless telephone be used for broadcasting , " Douglas adds .
He was " still trying to improve point - to - point communication . "
Bottom line : either Fessenden did n't notice that he'd invented modern radio , or he just did n't care .
Just about every innovator in history has been described as " ahead of their time . "
But the trick is not to be too ahead of your time .
You do n't want to invent the telegraph in 1816 when hardly anyone had access to electricity and railroads , telegraphy 's natural partners .
You want to be Charles Wheatstone or Samuel Morse twenty years later , when both Britain and the United States were more technologically developed and it was clearer that semaphore telegraphy could n't keep pace with the economy .
Similarly , you also do n't want to be Reginald Fessenden in 1906 , when radio receivers were still not a popular consumer item .
You want to be innovator and broadcast radio booster Lee De Forest just a half decade down the road , when amateur wireless had become all the rage and the possibilities for broadcasting were more obvious .
And you definitely do n't want to be entrepreneur Cyrus Field , mid-19th century developer of the Trans - Atlantic Cable .

' Albertans call that the smell of money ! ' says the helicopter pilot as we fly over Alberta ’s tar sands .
Even 2,000 feet above open - cast mines , man -made lakes of mining waste and refineries belching fumes and flames , there is the acrid stench of burning oil .
It stinks .
Until the 1960s , this Canadian landscape was unspoiled boreal forest , home to moose and caribou and the Clearwater people who hunted them .
Today , this First Nations ’ people go shopping for processed food in an industrial wasteland .
Flocks of migratory birds die as they land on toxic lakes , that cover over 50 square kilometres .
Downriver , further north , in the remote First Nations ’ settlement of Fort Chipewyan , on the shore of Lake Athabasca , the incidence of bile duct cancer is significantly higher than expected .
The Alberta government rebuffs such claims of environmental and medical impacts .
' We do not proceed with development at the expense of the environment , ' says the website of Alberta Environment .
The government prefers to highlight that the Athabasca tar sands is the second largest known deposit of oil in the world , after the Middle East , and , geopolitically , represents a secure source of oil for North America .
An estimated 173 billion barrels is considered to be recoverable .
No wonder every major oil company – and many minor ones - has rushed to get a piece of the action .
$ 215 billion worth of projects have been proposed and billions of dollars have been paid to the government of Alberta in mineral rights and royalties .
( Meanwhile , billions more have been given to the oil companies in tax breaks . )
The process of extracting the oil from the sands is expensive and energy intensive , so when oil prices dropped from their high last year , the rush of investment and exploration slowed and projects were cancelled .
Now , with prices reaching over US $ 70 a barrel once more , the tar sands ( called ‘ oil sands ’ by the industry ) are looking attractive again .
The first new project since the recession has just been approved - a US6.3 billion dollar venture by Imperial Oil , forecast to extract 110,000 barrels of oil a day by 2012 .
Ancient wealth
For centuries , the indigenous people have dug up handfuls of this bitumen - rich sand to burn for light and heat and to caulk their canoes .
For the last few decades , oil companies have been chopping down the forest and gouging out the land around the remote oil - boom town of Fort McMurray .
Canada 's tar sands yield around 1.7 million barrels of oil per day , with projections to reach as high as 6.2 million bpd by 2020 .
Excavators scrape at the black sand and load it into waiting dumper trucks , as large as houses .
These 400 - ton dumper trucks can flatten a 4WD without noticing .
They rumble over the scarred landscape , driven by school leavers earning $ 100,000 a year .
The tarry loads are heated to release the thick oil .
The process uses as much natural gas in a day as could heat three million homes .
There are even proposals to use nuclear power in the processing .
( A scheme to explode nuclear bombs below ground , thus melting the oil in the sands whilst at the same time creating caverns , into which it would flow , was shelved . )
All this demonstrates that it is not the energy per se that is so vital : rather energy in the form of liquid hydrocarbons , to which our species has become addicted for everything from transport to clothing .
This addiction is killing us : producing one barrel of synthetic crude oil from tar sands emits up to five times as much greenhouse gases as extracting one barrel of conventional oil .
On top of this , tar sand mining necessitates that large swathes of one of the world ’s most important carbon - sinks - the boreal forest - are destroyed .
The government of Alberta boasts that it is investing $ 2 billion in carbon capture and storage in ambitious plans for reducing its heavy CO2 emissions but environmental groups dismiss this as being unworkable .
Pockets of resistance
While other nations have been reducing carbon emissions since the Kyoto agreement was signed , Canada ’s have increased 26 per cent .
No wonder the First Nations ’ people , who call this land their home , describe the tar sands development as ' Mother Earth bleeding to death ' .
Now , one small First Nations community is determined to make sure its hunting and fishing grounds – and perhaps the planet - do not become irreparably damaged by expansion of this industry .
The story is unfolding further south , away from the ugly epicentre of Fort McMurray .
Here , the tar sands are in seams deep below the forest of spruce , birch and poplar .
Surface mining is not viable , so a different , even more expensive , energy intensive method is used to extract the oil .
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) is , visually , less obtrusive as much happens below ground , melting the oil from the sand in situ .
However , pipelines criss - cross the forest above ground , leading to and from industrial plants where steam is made and bitumen collected .
Look on Google Earth and it shows the pipelines like fine wires on a circuit board .
' The moose and the caribou , they ca n’t get over the pipes , ' says Len Benson , of the Beaver Lake Cree , the small ‘ band ’ of indigenous people at the forefront of the fight against the expansion of tar sands mining happening on the doorstep of their small reserve .
As we tour a network of roads carved in the forest , where Shell and Imperial Oil have SAGD projects , Benson , who works in the band ’s new ‘ office of intergovernmental affairs and industry relations ’ , explains the impact .
' These pipes prevent the animals from migrating , from reaching their calving grounds and escaping from wolves . '
The oil companies put in occasional wildlife crossing points – steps up and over the pipes - but Benson says this is of little help .
'“ The animals do n’t cross at the same point all the time .
They get confused and panic , ' he says .
' You see there ? ' he says , pointing to a big dent in one of the pipes , ' that must be where a moose tried to jump across . '
Suddenly , an oil tanker stops on the gravel road and the driver leans out the window , his engine still ticking over .
' You should n’t be taking pictures , ' he warns , even though this is public land .
' Magnetism from the camera can cause an explosion . '
Pipelines and industrial developments – with their spurious ‘ health and safety ’ prohibitions - also restrict access by the people to traditional hunting grounds and to pick medicinal plants .
As for pollution – there is much less waste water from in situ mining than there is from open - cast mining and no toxic lakes .
However , the waste is pumped below ground into ‘ salt cavities ’ .
' The problem is , animals go to their natural salt licks and they ’re getting poisoned , ' says Benson .
' People are scared to eat the moose now . '
The Cree themselves are afraid to drink the water because of possible contamination of the water table .
' When I was a kid , I used to dip a mug in the muskeg [ wetlands ] and drink .
We do n’t do that now . '
Quiet please : we 're consulting ...
Benson ’s office documents breaches of environmental law by oil companies – the damming of a river , important for spawning fish , to lay a pipeline and the filling in of wetlands .
His office also has to deal with literally tonnes of paperwork from oil companies .
' They deliver these , ' he says , in his office , standing next to a pile of folders measuring over a metre in height , ' and our office - just two people - is supposed to respond to them in a few weeks , ' he laughs .
' They call that " community consultation " . '
In the forest , elders talk of animals being sickly , thin and unfit to eat .
So far , these claims remain uncorroborated by science but what needs no proof is the disturbance to their habitat by industrial development , including lines , several kilometres long , where forest has been razed for seismic exploration .
Other parts are filled with the noise of building works and trucks .
The Beaver Lake Cree number just 920 worldwide .
Less than 400 live on their small reserve , in the Lakeland area of Alberta , 260 km south of Fort McMurray .
Yet , in a story that is shaping up into a Hollywood film script , the Beaver Lake Cree are preparing to take the governments of Alberta and Canada to court for violating their treaty rights .
The constitutionally enshrined treaty that the Cree signed in 1876 promises that they can have access to the land of their ‘ core territory ’ to hunt , fish and collect plants .
Lawyers acting for the Beaver Lake Cree argue that some 17,000 approved mining projects within this 195,000 square kilometres ( almost the same size as England and Scotland ) will result in habitat loss and environmental degradation that renders the treaty meaningless .
' It has to be a meaningful right to hunt and fish , ' says Jack Woodward , a leading authority on aboriginal law with a history of winning such cases .
' It ’s all about habitat – you do n’t preserve animals , you preserve the habitat . '
In preparation for a trial that looks set to last several years , battle lines are being drawn up in what is being ( predictably ) billed as a ‘ David and Goliath ’ encounter .
The adversaries are still thrashing out pre-trial motions but the struggle looks set to cost millions .
UK - based Co-operative Financial Services ’ has donated C$ 100,000 to get the wheels in motion for the challenge ’s first injunction , with more to follow for a wildlife impact assessment .
A charitable trust has also been set up to raise a fighting fund .
' Supporting First Nations ’ legal challenges is possibly the best chance we have of averting new tar sands development , ' says Colin Baines , ethics adviser to Co-operative Financial Services .
' This inspiring community deserves our support and we are confident that they will win , but it ’s going to take money .
If you care about climate change , this is a key cause to support . '
As part of its Toxic Fuels campaign , The Co-operative has mobilised investors , representing US $ 3 trillion , to pressurise the tar sands industry and , in the UK , is campaigning for a financial reporting standard that would hugely penalise carbon intensive oil reserves such as tar sands .
Preserving the past ; looking to the future
For the Beaver Lake Cree , it ’s not about any money that may come their way in the form of compensation .
' It ’s about preserving the land , the water and the animals for future generations , ' says their Chief , Al Lameman .
' We know how to survive . '
Supplementing their diet with wild meat , fish and berries is still important to the Cree .
Even those with the latest mobile phones and shiniest 4WDs have a moose in the freezer , which they shot and butchered themselves .
It is about respect too .
The indigenous people of North America share a similar story with other indigenous people worldwide .
Over generations , their land , their names and even their children have been stolen from them .
Land is key to their identity .
Jackie Gladue , a fashionable Beaver Lake Cree woman in designer sunglasses , does n’t , at first glance , look like the kind of person who could survive in the wild but she talks passionately of ice - fishing , canoe trips and hunting moose .
Her 21st century appearance belies an age - old connection with nature .
' I hate the thought of oil workers stepping on our medicine plants , ' she says .
She talks of ‘ court medicine ’ - a root that , when chewed in court , leads to a trial ’s success .
' When we win this case , I will feel so proud . '

If it is n’t enough that average Americans are contending with the rising cost of healthcare , education , and daily necessities like food now additional funds are going directly to the banking sector to keep them propped up like a money loving puppet .
Since the Great Depression the rise of the middle class has been the envy of many people around the globe .
The ability for hard working Americans to have access to an economy that supported them so long as they worked hard and followed an implicit guarantee with their nation .
With this implicit guarantee it was assumed that the government would also protect people to a certain degree especially when it came to their financial well being .
This did not assure a winning portfolio but it did mean we would n’t turn our stock market into a giant game of casino where the connected had a loaded deck .
Much of the strong regulatory arm that came from the Great Depression was because of the speculative gambling during the Roaring 1920s .
Yet as time went on slowly Wall Street took these structures away and now we are finding ourselves once again with the middle class largely at risk in the United States .
It is n’t by accident we are in the situation we are in today .
The first important thing to understand is that yes , the income of middle class families has gone up since the 1950s but a large part of this was the rise of the two income households with women entering the workforce :
The above chart is disturbing in many ways because it bucks the nearly 50 year long - term trend of employment .
Now , even with two income households many with rising job losses are finding they now have to make it with one income while inflation has eroded their buying power over the decades .
In this recession 3 out of 4 job losses have been men .
If you have any doubt regarding the insidious nature of inflation I put together a chart looking at various costs over the last few decades :
Part of this is due to the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury trashing the U.S. dollar over the decades .
For example , in 1950 it took the median household income ( which was largely a one income household ) about 2 times the annual household income to purchase the median priced home .
In 2008 , it took the median household income ( now largely a two income household ) four times annual earnings to purchase the median priced home .
In fact , the two income household has hidden a large part of how much the middle class has fallen behind in this country .
Now with this recession , the deep cracks are now being exposed in the system .
Income inequality has also risen in this country and a large part of it is due to the financial sector .
1 percent of our population control 42 percent of all financial wealth .
In fact , in the last decade the only segment of our population that has seen any sizeable gains in true wealth is the top 1 percent .
Every other category has seen a loss of housing net worth , wage stagnation , and higher costs for daily items that consume a larger part of their budget .
Just take a look at the chart below showing this change :
Source : CNN
The above is looking at a one income household in 1973 versus the two income household in the 2000s .
It is interesting to note that in the 1970s Nixon took the dollar into a purely fiat system and since that time , the dollar has lost much of its actual value .
This would be expected .
The Federal Reserve with its banking lieutenants has been able to put our country so deep into debt that realistically we are in a position of never paying back all our outstanding obligations .
The only way out is via inflation and with a fiat system that is the path we are heading down .
This is important because when you look at the charts above prices rise for various reasons and inflation is a hidden tax .
No need for higher taxes to bailout the banking sector when you can just destroy the purchasing power of middle class Americans by monetizing enormous amounts of debt as we have done .
That is why in the next decade , Americans are now working for someone else beyond their immediate household .
A large chunk of their money is now going to the banking sector .
This can be in absurd payments to credit card companies , loss of purchasing power because of the Fed , or other hidden methods of taxing the public .
We are really at a crossroads for the middle class .
If we dissect the data further we realize that even though things cost more , much of it has been financed through debt :
Ironically the family in the early 1970s had more discretionary income than the family in the early 2000s even with a dual income .
Yet if you look around , it is n’t immediately apparent because of the massive debt bubble financed by the banking sector .
Sure people bought bigger homes and newer cars but all this was under a phony veneer of success and was financed with debt .
All of it was built around a mountain of debt .
Yet here is where the big divide hits .
Middle class families are now losing their homes through foreclosure .
Many are having their cars repossessed because they can’t make their payments .
Bankruptcy filings are soaring because people cannot service their debt .
So middle class Americans are paying the price with the rules that are setup .
Yet banks are not .
They are sucking the American taxpayer for all their horrible bets and are not dealing with the ramifications of their actions .
In other words , the bill is going to the middle class as the middle class is dealing with their own bad decisions .
This is part of the system built around the corporatacracy model of government .
Losses are socialized while gains are privatized .
And do n’t kid yourself , this entire game was financed on debt :
And the small group of banks at the top now control a large portion of all FDIC backed assets in our country :
Source : FDIC , Bank Financial Statements
Forget about the Republican or Democrat parties , we are being governed by the financial sector of this economy .
It is amazing how hard it is to get sensible legislation even after this great calamity .
To prove this point , in California an insurance company announced they are hiking healthcare premiums by 30 percent in the midst of this recession even though they pulled in billions in profits .
The government will sit back and let the middle class get fleeced because they are part of the problem .
They speak a good game but are bought by the industry .
Prove us wrong if this is n’t the case .
Enough talk , time for action .
From now on we need to focus on who is delivering results .
If you can , take you money out of the big banks and put them in local regional banks .
Let your local representatives know that their number one priority should be focusing on protecting our struggling middle class .
Time to get some real reform or we really risk losing our middle class .

HAUNTED ?
The ghostly apparition in a window of the old St Bathans post office .
An Invercargill man has taken a photograph that could be proof of the afterlife , or it could be a cloud – who knows ?
Andrew Watters travelled to St Bathans , near Alexandra , with his partner Kim Ward during the weekend in search of the spirits that reputedly haunt its buildings .
" I 'd always been nagging my Kim to go and have a look at the Vulcan Hotel and its supposed ghost , hoping we would find something . "
ANDREW WATTERS UP CLOSE : A magnified portion of the ghostly image taken in St Bathans .
That search turned up short .
" I had a beer at the pub and got goosebumps but I think it was just the excitement . "
The pair took plenty of photos and did n't think they had anything until a friend spotted a shape with an uncanny resemblance to a woman in the window at the post office , he said .
" It 's freaked me out a bit .
The shape is very close to a human figure . "
The photograph did not make him any more or less sceptical about the existence of ghosts but it was bizarre , Mr Watters said .
Vulcan Hotel leasee Jude Cavanagh said it was the first she had heard of a ghost sighting at the post office .
" It 's a very spirited town , so who knows ? "
The post office , which was managed by the Department of Conservation since the 1950s , had been vacant for about a year , at least in the bodily sense , she said .
" It all adds to the legend of the place . "
The department 's Alexandra community relations programme manager Amanda Ware said she had no knowledge of any phantom presence at the post office .
The building , opened in 1909 , was a category two historic place and had been vacant for about a year , she said .
The interior largely remained unchanged from its days as a working port office and the second floor , where the mysterious shape was seen , was the postmaster 's living quarters , Ms Ware said .
" Maybe it was him coming back for a visit . "
She would tread carefully the next time she stopped by , she said .
MC Frontalot is the stage name of Damian Hess , a hip hop musician and self - proclaimed " world 's 579th - greatest rapper . "
Many of his songs deal with things nerdy in nature , which has led him to be categorized as nerdcore , a word he himself coined in his first single , " Nerdcore Hip Hop " .
In 2002 , the popular webcomic Penny Arcade ( http://www.penny-arcade.com) declared him their official rapper laureate .
He composed and recorded a song called ' The Penny Arcade Theme ' , and has appeared at the Penny Arcade Expos in the past few years .

Turns out all that excitement and frothing at the mouth was for nothing , as Motorola 's surprisingly nippy move to Android 2.1 on the Droid is n't going to be all that rapid after all .
The Moto Owners ' Forum manager has admitted that a few trigger - happy souls rushed out the details of the Droid 's upcoming OS update ahead of time , and the current situation is quite as it was before this news : your Droid will be chomping down on an Eclair , just not as soon as you might have been led to hope .
The original source of the belief that the update will be hitting this week was Moto's Facebook page , but PC Mag 's sleuthing has revealed that the position has now changed to " soon " over there as well .
Patience is a virtue , eh ? [ Thanks , Steve ]

" When I discovered what was true , I could not resist acting on it and telling others . "
Daily Bell :
You have almost singlehandedly led a revolution in thought that has changed the world .
How does that make you feel ?
Rockwell :
Well , thank you , but that 's not how ideas work .
Without donors , faculty , students , collaborators , distribution media , and the division of labor , we are all just isolated scribblers .
That has always been true , for the ancient world and today .
We like to say that one person can make a difference , but that is only true to some extent .
All forms of production , including in the world of ideas , require as much cooperation with others as possible .
And while we were making great progress before 1995 , the advent of digital media has made a vast difference precisely because it has dramatically expanded opportunities for communication and cooperation .
Daily Bell :
Can you familiarize our readers with the depth and breadth of the organizations you have founded and that offer services — especially on the ' Net .
Rockwell : I founded the Mises Institute in 1982 to try to make sure that the influence of Mises and other Austrian economists would grow .
Today Mises.org is the largest economics website on the planet that is not - for - profit , and it is a teaching and publishing powerhouse .
I founded LewRockwell.com in 1999 , mainly because I had lots of information to share with others , and I got tired of using email lists .
I figured that I might as well post what I found interesting , in every area , on a public website .
Today , it is the best - read libertarian site on the web .
Daily Bell : Did you ever dream of this level of success ?
Rockwell : Neither I nor any of my mentors , like Rothbard , nor influences , like Mises , could have imagined such a thing .
Of course , reaching minds is what liberty is all about .
The default position of the world is despotism .
In the sweep of things , liberty is the exception .
What makes the exception possible is ideological work , that is , spreading the ideas through every possible means .
Daily Bell :
You attribute some of your success to your father .
Can you tell our readers about this unique man ?
Rockwell :
He was a surgeon and a man of great strength of character , a man of the Old World of the sort we hardly meet anymore .
He was n't a complainer , did n't whine when things did n't go his way .
He was incredibly smart , and he loved liberty in the way that the men of the Enlightenment loved liberty : he did n't believe that the state could do anything better than people can do for themselves .
He was a man of the Old Right who despised FDR , in whose deliberate war my older brother was killed ; and he was an admirer of Robert Taft , not least because of his noninterventionist foreign policy .
My father worked hard until the last moment he possibly could .
So should we all .
Daily Bell :
Can you provide us with a brief history of how you became interested in free markets and decided to make them your life 's work ?
Rockwell :
As with most people , it began with the observation that something was profoundly wrong with the conventional wisdom , which even from grade school seemed to presume that wise masters at the top knew more than anyone else and so should be in charge of everyone and everything .
That supposition seemed to lack empirical evidence , so far as I could tell .
I discovered the literature of freedom hiding in the library and realized that truth was something I would forever have to dig for .
It would n't be given to me by network news anchors , politicians , nor the leading lights in establishment academia .
When I discovered what was true , I could not resist acting on it and telling others .
It really is n't any more complicated than that .
Daily Bell :
Is the logical outcome of Austrian economics the disappearance of the state ?
Rockwell : Mises did n't think so — neither did Hazlitt .
Sudha Shenoy argues that of all the people who entertained the possibility of society without a state in that generation , Hayek comes closest to embodying the anarchistic temperament .
In any case , the man who made the real difference in the Austrian School in this regard is Rothbard .
It was he who pushed the theoretical apparatus " over the edge , " so to speak .
Hardly any modern Austrian today is not an anarchist .
This is also thanks to Rothbardians such as Walter Block , Hans - Hermann Hoppe , and David Gordon , of course .
At one time Rothbard was denounced for his views , for having allegedly marginalized the Austrian School .
Now , of course , his anarchism is probably the largest part of the legacy he left for the world .
It is very appealing to young people , unlike the statism of regime economists .
Daily Bell :
Is it reasonable to believe that the state will ever wither away or does reality instruct us that the best that can be done is to limit its power ?
Rockwell :
To me , that 's like asking if we can imagine a society without robberies and murders .
Maybe it wo n't ever happen , but we must have the ideal in mind or else we 'll never get closer to it .
Without the ideal , progress stops .
To some extent , then , whether reality will finally ever conform is not the critical question .
What counts is that what we imagine can and should exist .
I like to imagine a society without legally sanctioned aggression against person and property .
Daily Bell :
Are you worried that your organizations will come under significant attack as the free - market movement continues ?
Rockwell : No , I do n't worry about it .
On the other hand , it is completely normal for radicals to be under attack from every quarter , so this would not be a surprise .
Daily Bell :
Take us back in time .
You founded Imprimis .
Were you bitter when you left ?
Rockwell : Not at all !
I admired George Roche , and still do .
But my work at Hillsdale was done , and I moved on .
Daily Bell :
When did you decide to found the Mises Institute ?
Was it when you became allied with famous Austrian economist Murray Rothbard ?
Rockwell : I had been Mises 's editor at Arlington House Publishers in the late 1960s .
After his death in 1973 , it became increasingly clear to me that no idea in this world stands a chance for success without an infrastructure of support .
Misesians did not have that in the universities nor think tanks .
Mises himself dealt with the lack of support by leaving Austria and moving to a wonderful institute in Geneva .
I wanted to found an institute in the United States that would be a sanctuary for free thought in the Misesian tradition .
First I approached his widow , Margit von Mises , who gave me her blessing and agreed to serve as our first chairman .
Then I asked Murray , whom I had also known , to guide our scholarly affairs .
He was thrilled as well .
He was a natural ally not only because he was Mises 's greatest student , but also because he was being shunned as too extreme , too radical , insufficiently willing to play the game — just as Mises had been .
I take very seriously his example , and the trust he reposed in me by making me his executor .
In many ways , he was the critical force behind our growth and success .
His spirit still surrounds us today .
Daily Bell :
What would Rothbard think of what has happened ?
Would he be surprised ?
Rockwell :
Well , mostly he would be thrilled .
But remember that he was the greatest optimist for liberty .
He was filled with hope and hated despair .
Nor was this just a disposition .
It was real hope rooted in the firm belief that if we did the right thing , we could make a difference .
In this sense , I do n't think he would be surprised that we have more student applications than we can accept , that more and more scholars seek us out , that our member programs sell out , that our audio files are being downloaded by the millions , that our books are selling faster than we can print them , and all the rest .
Daily Bell :
There has been a resurgence of Randism .
Are you surprised ?
Do you approve ?
Rockwell : I met her and heard her give lectures and I was always impressed .
Recall that when Atlas Shrugged came out , Mises and Rothbard both wrote glowing reviews .
Her works of fiction are profoundly effective in promoting the capitalist message , and this is all to the good .
But there are some critical errors .
I do n't think she fully understood the cooperative nature of the capitalist social order , for example .
She had less regard for the consumer than the capitalist , and in this respect she was only half - right .
But in general , if her books can disabuse people of canards against the free economy , that is great .
Daily Bell :
Can you give our readers a very brief overview of Antiwar.com and how it is related to your enterprises , if at all ?
Rockwell : I would say that AWC specializes in one aspect of Rothbardian thought .
But while it is an ideological cousin of LRC and Mises.org , there is no direct relation .
Rothbard 's children are everywhere , of course .
One reason has to do with his special way of communicating with people .
He spoke to anyone at length about his or her own intellectual interests .
If you loved news , he would talk news .
If you loved the history of ideas , he would talk the history of ideas .
If you were dedicated to the partitioning of Belgium , he would talk to you about this cause .
He was a gigantic personality and intellect .
No one penchant or interest or cause can sum up his life .
Daily Bell :
How is fundraising going ?
Has it diminished since the financial crisis ?
" The default position of the world is despotism .
In the sweep of things , liberty is the exception . "
Rockwell : Not at all .
If anything , people are even more dedicated to the idea of freedom and the propagation of the truth .
Austrian ideas are getting far more attention than ever before — in the wake of a crisis that conforms so closely to the Austrian paradigm .
Daily Bell :
Are you seeing a steady increase in people willing to fund free - market efforts ?
Rockwell :
Here too , we see great progress .
Daily Bell :
What is the future of the Ron Paul freedom movement in your view ?
Rockwell :
This much is clear : the Paul movement has made a huge difference in bringing people to libertarian ideas .
In some way , there is an element of tragedy in that it takes politics to wake people up .
Ideally , people would discover the ideas of liberty through other means .
Ron Paul agrees with this observation , by the way .
He sees himself as an educator first .
He chose politics because , for him , it was an effective route for his larger and more important goal .
And what an extraordinary job he has done , in his writing and speaking and personal example for almost four decades .
He has brought vast numbers of people into the light .
That was always his dream .
I should add that his early support was very important in the Mises Institute 's success .
We are honored to have him as our distinguished counselor .
Daily Bell :
Will your educational organizations become more involved in political efforts or not ?
Rockwell : I would say no to that .
Unless you are Ron Paul , politics is a dangerous business that tempts people to say and do crazy things .
Success is fleeting , whereas we are in this for the long term .
Daily Bell :
How is the free - market movement spreading overseas ?
Rockwell : Wonderfully .
One might compare Austrolibertarianism to Marxism in the extent of its international reach .
This is very exciting .
Human liberty is a universal desire , so of course there can be no libertarian movement that is n't truly international .
Daily Bell :
Are you hopeful that growth will continue at the pace that it has over the past decade ?
Rockwell :
The future is always uncertain , but we have the tools and the energy and the ideas .
Just in the last few years , we brought back to print virtually the whole of the Austrian and libertarian libraries .
Our downloads are immense , especially among young people .
If you must predict the future , look to the ideas held by young people and you will come close to finding it .
In this sense , I 'm certain that our movement will continue to grow long past my own life .
Daily Bell :
Have you noticed increased resistance to your efforts coming from organized governmental entities ?
Rockwell :
One hears rumors , but nothing is known for sure .
Government these days has many enemies , and all the usual bureaucratic problems in keeping up with them all .
Daily Bell :
Where does the US government and its allied power structure go from here ?
We think they are bleeding credibility and influence .
Rockwell : Yes , and compare today 's antigovernment feelings with the way things were just after 9/11/01 , a massive state failure that the state used to promote itself .
Today we see antistate feeling growing , picking up where it left off in the 1990s .
But here is the problem .
The Left hates some aspects of the state and loves others .
The Right is the mirror image .
The job of the libertarian is to get both sides to see that the other guys are half - right .
Think of the Tea Parties , for example .
The crowds roar disapproval of socialism even as they cheer for socialistic military invasions .
Daily Bell :
Is it possible to return the United States to a more republican form of government ?
Can history be repealed ?
Rockwell :
We have a history as a radically decentralized nation , and this memory has not entirely evaporated .
It could be that the path to liberty in the United States is nullification or even secession .
Or the decentralization may be de facto as more and more people discover means of individually seceding from specific sectors of statism : using alternative currencies , homeschooling their children , reading alternative media , circumventing the pharma - industrial complex , starting an unofficial business , smoking whatever substances they want , or refusing to return to a military assignment .
Rebellion can take many forms .
We have to learn to welcome them all .
Daily Bell :
Do you expect in your lifetime to see gold competing with the US dollar as currency ?
Rockwell : Technology makes this possible as never before .
Gold is not going away , but the dollar 's life is limited .
Daily Bell :
Do you expect the Fed to be audited ?
Rockwell :
This might happen , though as Ron Paul notes , transparency is only one step towards what must be the ultimate goal : shutting down the central bank .
Daily Bell :
What do you think of Ellen Brown 's theory that the state historically has created money , and that banks , including the Fed , ought to be nationalized and operated by " the people 's " government .
Some say that the oversight that Ron Paul wants Congress to have over the Fed is somehow an endorsement of the Brownian position .
Rockwell : I am not very familiar with Brown , but the Fed is the government 's central bank , the audit bill gives no monetary power to other parts of the government , and the banks are already in cahoots with the regime .
That 's why we have a Fed and officially enabled fractional reserves .
Daily Bell :
We are well aware that Ron Paul seeks a gold standard and in a perfect world the end of the Fed .
Can you reaffirm this position for our readers ?
Rockwell :
Yes , though he does not seek a monopoly for anything , including gold .
He wants money to be rooted in market experience .
It is not complicated .
Daily Bell :
We have noted what we think is a softening of an institutional position regarding the gold standard — and the possibility that free banking would be a considered option as well .
Is this a correct observation of your organizations ' stance ?
Rockwell : I would n't say that we have an official position .
There are many ways to move to free - market money and noninflationary banking .
I would never want to close off any viable path .
One problem with Mises 's plan for a gold standard is that it relies on the idea that the people in charge will do the right thing .
That is a charming , Old World idea , but I do n't think it holds true in our times .
We need to be open to the possibility that reform will never come from the top .
Daily Bell :
Are you sympathetic to a private gold - and - silver standard or is a gold standard always preferable ?
Rockwell : I am all for competing metals .
But a true specie standard is always private , and it always leaves room for competing currencies .
Daily Bell :
One of the hardest issues to resolve from a free - market point of view is ownership of intellectual property .
Can you tell our readers where you come down on this difficult issue ?
In a free market , would individuals be able to claim and enforce intellectual property rights with any prospect of success ?
Rockwell : Rothbard condemned patents but not copyrights .
Mises and Machlup saw patents as government grants of monopoly , but neither condemned them outright .
Hayek was against copyrights and patents , but did n't write about them much .
It is digital media that have brought the issue into focus .
The key thinker here is Stephan Kinsella .
He and Jeffrey Tucker have done the heavy lifting and convinced most all of us that intellectual property is an artifice that has no place in a market economy .
There are incredible implications to this insight .
The infinite reproducibility of ideas means that we stand a great chance of success .
The fact that ideas are not scarce goods means that they need not be controlled .
This is a wonderful thing .
There is much work left to do in this area .
The whole history of invention needs revision , and our theory of markets needs to take better account of the central place of emulation in social progress .
Daily Bell :
Do you think the military - industrial complex in the United States will gradually erode as the free - market movement gathers even more strength , or is the power structure hell - bent on empire ?
Rockwell :
It has to erode .
The empire is insanely overextended .
At some point , we 'll go the way of Britain and Rome .
We can only hope that the United States takes this path in wisdom and not in desperation .
Daily Bell :
Where do you go from here ?
Do you have other organizational changes in the works ?
Expansions ?
Rockwell :
There are expansions every day .
We are looking at marvelous things , things that are bigger than anything we 've yet done .
But I do n't want to spoil the surprise .
Daily Bell :
What is your future personally ?
What intellectual endeavors are you focused on ?
Rockwell : I want to keep working , especially on my website , and to keep pushing the boundaries of ideas and technology .
I never plan on retiring , and neither should anyone else .
There is too much work to do .
Daily Bell :
Can you give our readers any advice as to what publications and information to seek out on your web sites — where do they start ?
Rockwell :
We always begin with our passions , whatever they are .
No two people are alike .
This is what search engines are for .
But let me say that at some point , everyone should aspire to be a serious student of Mises and Rothbard .
No education is complete without that .
" The Left hates some aspects of the state and loves others .
The Right is the mirror image .
The job of the libertarian is to get both sides to see that the other guys are half - right . "
Daily Bell :
If readers wish to learn more about your organizations , where is the easiest starting point ?
Can anyone attend Mises seminars , etc . ?
Rockwell :
The websites are a great starting place , but of course we love to have new people come to our conferences .
We are working to create more opportunities for that .
Daily Bell :
Where would you recommend that a young person go for higher education in the United States ?
Rockwell :
Do you mean education or college ?
They are n't always the same .
You can get a good education online today .
For university degrees , I would suggest the least - cost investment .
But remember that the opportunity costs of formal education are very high .
After four to six years in college , a person can discover that he or she has no skills .
That is the worst way to enter a workforce .
Daily Bell :
Thank you for your time and insights .
Rockwell : You 're welcome .
Having slipped up twice in the preliminary round , Canada pays the price starting today with an " extra " game , a match - up with Germany simply to qualify for the quarterfinals , ( hopefully ) to be followed with a very tough road to the gold medal game , through Russia and probably Sweden , as the three pre-tournament favourites all wound up on the same side of the draw .
The single point lost to Switzerland wound up costing the squad nearly as much as the three points surrendered to USA , but so it goes .
Failure to hold or build on a 2 - 0 lead against an inferior squad deserves to be punished .
Win the damn game !
Starting today .
The margin for error is now officially zero , and the only way to go on the requisite four - game winning streak is to win the first one .
When it comes to Germany , at least , history is on our side :
1932 : Canada 4 , Germany 1
1932 : Canada 5 , Germany 0
1936 : Canada 6 , Germany 2
1952 : Canada 15 , Germany 1
1956 : Canada 4 , Germany 0
1956 : Canada 10 , Germany 0
1964 : Canada 4 , Germany 2
1968 : Canada 6 , West Germany 1
1968 : Canada 11 , East Germany 0
1988 : Canada 8 , West Germany 1
1992 : Canada 4 , Germany 3 ( SO )
2002 : Canada 3 , Germany 2
2006 : Canada 5 , Germany 1
13-0-0 , 85 GF , 14 GA
Average score of ~ 6 - 1 , which would n't be a bad prediction for tonight 's scoreline .
Canada comes out with a lot to prove , and if they 're not pissed off at this point they have n't got a bloody pulse .
I pity Germany , already 0 - 0 - 0 - 3 in this tournament , facing this angry bear defending her home territory .
That said , in recent times Germany has been a tougher nut to crack , holding Canada to a one - goal win in 2 of the last 3 outings .
Most relevant are those two recent games against NHL - calibre opposition in Salt Lake City 2002 and Torino 2006 , in which Martin Brodeur and Roberto Luongo respectively led Canada to victory .
Tonight the changing of the guard as Canada 's # 1 becomes official as Luongo steps between the pipes for a must - win game , and presumably has the car keys for the duration .
A nice little run of four games here , and BobbiLu might earn himself a new fan .
A less relevant but far more memorable puck encounter between these two nations was the one time they previously met in a sudden death game , in Albertville 1992 .
That was pre-NHL of course , but Canada nonetheless sent a mighty fine team that was heavily favoured to crush the Germans in that quarter - final encounter , which was a first against fourth crossover game .
Instead it was a nailbiter all the way , featuring one of the most incredible endings to a game I will ever see .
That 1992 Team Canada featured Eric Lindros , probably the most decorated amateur hockey player this country has produced in my lifetime .
Not yet 19 , Lindros was about to add Olympic silver to a trophy wall that already contained two World Junior gold , a Memorial Cup , and Canada Cup gold .
That 's right , he made Team Canada # 1 as an 18 - year - old amateur , and excelled .
He was the Next One , and was trying to prove it in Albertville , all the while holding out on the Nordiques of course .
Lindros was the headliner almost over and above the team , which was not good , but he played damn well and deserves credit for that .
Sharing the offensive load with Lindros ( 8 GP , 5 - 6 - 11 ) was one Joé Juneau , himself at a contract impasse , who led the tourney in scoring ( 8 , 6 - 9- 15 ) .
The following season Juneau would score 102 points for the Bruins , Lindros 41 goals for the Flyers , and both would be on the All - Rookie Team with a bullet .
Another " ringer " was Sean Burke , a proven NHL netminder who was , uh , between contracts in the manner of Andy Moog at Calgary ' 88 .
Burke was seen as a major Canadian advantage in every game , perhaps the best netminder in the tourney .
Canada also had its usual assortment of strong developing pros with solid NHL careers ahead of them : Trevor Kidd , Adrien Plavsic , Jason Woolley , Dave Hannan , Kent Manderville , Dave Tippett , and more .
Meanwhile , Germany was Germany , a few decent players but no big stars whatsoever .
But they were tenacious sons of guns , and they hung on to Canada in that game like a terrier on your ankle .
It was frustrating as hell to watch , similar to the Swiss game the other night except it was a " one and yer done " affair .
Canada could never build a lead , and Germany kept chipping away , scoring very late in the third to tie it up , forcing the game to and through a ten - minute overtime that gnawed my nails to the quick .
From there it was the shootout , a routine thing today but the first one I and many Canadian fans had ever seen .
This was n't any regular season game , either , this was to decide an elimination game at the freakin ' Olympics .
Like most hockey fans , I had strong opinions on that front , but I sure was n't going to boycott watching it .
Proponents of the skills contest could hardly have asked for a more exciting introduction to the concept , which featured the most dramatic conclusion to a shootout I have seen to this day .
It was a 5 - rounder , which went extra innings after a further deadlock , each team scoring twice .
In the 6th round , Lindros , who had missed in the first go - round , was given a second opportunity and made no mistake with a nifty deke .
A save by Burke and Canada was into the semi's with a 3 in 4 chance to win its first Olympic medal since 19 bloody60 , and still - realistic dreams of gold .
The Berlin Wall had gone up and come back down since Canada had last made the podium ... did I mention I had left the edge of my seat and was standing to watch by this point .
In my own living room .
The Germans gave the task of equalizing to the immortal Peter Draisaitl , who roared in and tried to beat Burke 5 - hole .
Burke closed the gap , the puck disappeared , and Burke rolled to his side .
The game was won ! ... except what seemed like seconds later , the puck reappeared behind Burke , slowly , agonizingly rolling towards the goal line .
The goalie was either oblivious to it or , as likely , afraid to move for fear of knocking it in .
But sure as hell that darn puck was going just fast enough to dribble an inch over the line , in super slo-mo .
Then it wobbled , fell flat , and stopped .
Right on the damn goal line .
Up top is a very poor - quality video ( in the original Japanese ! ) from this showdown , the only video record I could find .
It is nonetheless worth watching at least for its denouement , which occurs right around the 2:00 mark .
People tend to remember the subsequent shootouts that cost Canada Olympic Gold in Lillehamer 1994 and a medal period in Nagano 1998 , but on first exposure to the confounded gimmick the hockey gods were smiling on us .
* * *
But if it pleases the hockey gods , who have remained angry with our hubris , can we please , please , avoid the bloody shootout tonight ?
Let the better team win is all I ask .
Cuz I 'm pretty sure I know which team that is .
Faces of alleged hit squad appear on Interpol website in connection with killing of Hamas operative
Official " wanted " notices were released today for a suspected team of Israeli secret agents accused of participating in the assassination of a Palestinian militant .
The faces of an 11 - strong alleged hit squad appeared on the Interpol website this morning , 48 hours after authorities in the United Arab Emirates issued arrest warrants for the killing last month of the Hamas operative Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Their offences are listed as " crimes against life and health " .
The group stands accused of entering the emirate state using forged or stolen European identities , murdering the militant in his hotel and then fleeing the country on 19 January .
The red wanted notices are not international arrest warrants , but allow details of fugitives to be released worldwide with the request that the wanted person be arrested and extradited .
The requests were lodged by the National Central Bureau in Abu Dhabi , Interpol said .
" Based on close co-operation among our member countries and on information provided by innocent citizens , it is becoming clear that those who carefully planned and carried out the murder of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh most likely used forged or fake European passports of innocent citizens whose identities were stolen , " said the organisation 's secretary general , Ronald Noble .
" The decision by Dubai and Interpol to share all existing available information with the international law enforcement community can only help shed light on those who perpetrated and masterminded the attack .
In the process it will also help to establish the innocence of the ordinary citizens and even of countries whose identities were stolen and fraudulently used . "
An Interpol official said an initial listing on its website earlier today , which contained the names of alleged killers using German , French and Irish passports as if their details were genuine , was due to a " technical issue " and had been corrected .
All the faces of the suspects now appear on Interpol 's website beside the name " unknown " , with their alias identities included .
" The red notices were issued with the names and features based on evidence we provided to Interpol , " Dubai 's head of police told the Abu Dhabi - owned National newspaper .
He confirmed for the first time that investigations indicated the involvement of Mossad , Israel 's foreign intelligence agency .
" Our investigations reveal that Mossad is involved in the murder of Mabhouh .
It is 99 % , if not 100 % that Mossad is standing behind the murder , " said the head of police .
Mabhouh , 49 , was a founder of Hamas 's military wing .
IN THE ten years since hybrid electric vehicles first hit the highways and byways of America , they have come to represent 2.5 % of new car sales .
Yet , in places like Los Angeles , the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington , DC , every other car seems to be a Toyota Prius .
That is because hybrids like the Prius have sold overwhelmingly where well - heeled early adopters reside .
Expect the new generation of “ Post - Prius ” electrics — plug - in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt from General Motors and those relying only on a battery such as the Nissan Leaf — to end up nosing around the same upscale neighbourhoods .
With more than a dozen plug - in and pure - electric models arriving in showrooms over the next year or so , sales are expected to outstrip even those enjoyed by the Prius and other hybrids in their early days .
A couple of million of the new electric vehicles could be bought by early adopters during the first few years .
Alamy
That would be a problem .
Unlike the Prius and its ilk — which use their petrol engines , along with energy recovered from braking , to recharge their batteries while motoring — plug - in hybrids and pure electrics have to be recharged direct from the grid .
The popular assumption is that they will be plugged into a wall socket in the garage late at night , taking advantage of cheap off - peak power .
Unfortunately , things are not that simple .
For a start , the new generation of electric vehicles are not glorified golf - carts , but cleaner and more frugal alternatives to today 's petrol - powered family cars .
When fully charged , the Volt ( to be called the Ampera in Europe ) can travel 40 miles ( 64 km ) on electric power , enough for three out of four commuters in America to get to work and back without needing to burn a single drop of fuel .
Beyond that range , a 1.4 - litre engine kicks in to generate electricity and simultaneously propel the car and recharge its batteries .
The medium - sized hatchback Leaf can carry five adults 100 miles on a single charge .
To go farther , Nissan has put its faith in a network of rapid - charging stations it is developing with partners .
The Leaf is expected to cost $ 25,000 - 30,000 , about the same as a comparable diesel - powered car .
But the battery pack will have to be leased separately ( for around $ 150 a month ) .
One thing the new plug-ins and pure electrics have in common is a beefy lithium - ion battery pack that needs a lot of heavy charging .
At the very least , that involves installing 220 - volt wiring in the home .
Trying to recharge a modern electric car with a standard American 110 - volt supply takes too long to be practical ( up to 18 hours in the case of the Leaf ) .
Of course , if not fully charged at night it may have to be recharged during the day — when electricity rates can be up to five times more expensive .
Average peak rates in America are 33 cents a kilowatt - hour compared with seven cents off - peak .
Charging at the peak rate is equivalent to buying petrol at $ 3.63 a gallon ( 80 cents a litre ) , instead of 77 cents a gallon off - peak , reckons Southern California Edison , a utility based in the Los Angeles area .
In America , peak - rate charging totally destroys any economic advantage an electric car may have .
At least the electricity companies ought to be pleased at the prospect of selling more power , day or night .
In theory , recharging electric vehicles during off - peak hours should help utilities “ fill the valley ” — the trough in electricity demand between midnight and six in the morning , and thereby get better utilisation from their coal - or gas - fired generating stations .
But , again , things are not quite as they seem .
No utility wants to run its network flat out .
Scheduling maintenance becomes difficult , which can lead to more frequent failures .
The net result is that additional capacity has to be installed at a cost that would not otherwise be justified .
A study done a few years ago by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland , Washington , suggested there was enough idle generating capacity in America to recharge three quarters of the country 's 230 m cars if they were plug-ins of one sort of another — provided they only connected to the grid during off - peak hours , and preferably in the coal - rich midwest .
But the vast majority of new plug-ins will be located in a handful of urban centres on the east and west coasts , which , unlike the midwest , do not have huge reserves of cheap , coal - fired generating capacity .
Nor can they import it easily from the middle of the country , given the fragile nature of the grid .
Southern California Edison has been operating a fleet of 300 electric vehicles to find out how customers will use and recharge them .
Above all , it wants to make sure that a conversion to electric motoring goes smoothly , unlike a previous attempt in the mid-1990s .
Back then , California thought electric cars like the Honda EV + and the General Motors EV1 were the wave of the future , and thousands of public charging points were hurriedly installed in shopping centres , libraries and airports .
But the enthusiasm collapsed when the motor industry successfully lobbied the California Air Resources Board in 2001 to get it to relax a mandate requiring 10 % of new cars sold in the state to be emission - free by 2003 .
With no need to worry about zero-emission vehicles any more , GM and Honda promptly called in all their leased electric cars and crushed them .
This time the Californian utilities are being more circumspect .
They are concerned about highly concentrated pockets of ownership and the effects of everyone deciding to recharge their electric vehicles at once — as they inevitably will do when they return home from work .
The local electricity system could be easily overwhelmed , and wider swathes of the grid brought to its knees in the process .
Preparing for this means beefing up local transformers as well as installing heavy - duty wiring and smart meters in homes to provide early warning of network troubles ahead .
Sooner or later , those additional costs will have to be passed on to customers .
Much , of course , will depend on how quickly the new plug-ins and pure electrics become part of mainstream motoring .
Generally speaking , it takes 15 - 20 years for a new technology to capture 10 % of an established market , and a further 10 - 15 years for it to own 90 % .
That was the case when steam ships replaced clippers in the mid-19th century , and when petrol - engined taxis took over from horse - drawn cabs in the early 20th century .
The same sort of lag occurred with the introduction in the 1970s of emission controls on cars .
It takes years for the benefits of volume production to work their way through to the market , and for the supply chain to catch up .
If plug - in electrics follow a similar demand curve to other disruptive technologies , there could be 25 m of them humming quietly around by 2025 , and ten times that number by 2040 .
Hopefully , by then , the utilities will have learned to cope with recharging them .

Section III : MACHINE GUNS AND MORTARS 1 12 . M.G. 342 a. General The M.G. 34 , machine gun , model 34 , is not directly comparable to any U.S. weapon .
It can be fired without a mount ( fig. 32 ) , or it can be mounted on a bipod ( fig. 33 ) for use as a light machine gun,3 on a tripod ( figs. 34 and 35 ) for use as a heavy machine gun, 4 and on a special antiaircraft mount ( fig. 36 ) or on the standard tripod mount with adapter and special sight ( fig. 37 ) for use as an antiaircraft gun , as well as on numerous other types of mounts on tanks and other vehicles ( fig. 38 ) .
Consequently , this all - purpose gun is the most common German automatic weapon in use by the German armed forces .
Every infantry squad, 5 and many other types of small German units , can be expected to be armed with the M.G. 34 .
Figure 32 .— M.G. 34 in action without bipod or tripod .
b. How to Identify The M.G. 34 may be identified by — ( 1 ) Air -cooled jacket .
( 2 ) Shape of plastic shoulder stock .
( 3 ) Plastic pistol grips and double trigger .
( 4 ) Folding front and rear sights .
( An auxiliary antiaircraft ring sight that fits on the barrel jacket may also be found . )
( 5 ) Operating handle on the right side .
Figure 33 .— Two views of M.G. 34 on bipod mount .
Figure 34 .— M.G. 34 on tripod mount .
c. Characteristics6 ( 1 ) General .
—The M.G. 34 is a short - recoil weapon , the bolt being locked to the barrel by means of interrupted screw threads at the moment of firing and for three - sixteenths of an inch of recoil , unlocking itself from the barrel in the next nine - sixteenths of an inch in travel .
There is no accelerator to assist the backward movement of the recoiling parts , but a recoil assister on the muzzle helps to move the recoiling parts to the rear by gas pressure on the front face of the barrel .
The same purpose is served by a similar part on the U.S. Browning caliber .30 M2 aircraft machine gun .
Figure 35 .— M.G. 34 on tripod mount , and with antiaircraft adapter .
Although the rate of fire is probably too high for the weight , the gun is a handy air - cooled automatic weapon .
A simple mechanism makes it easy to exchange a cool barrel for a heated one .
The gun is belt - or magazine - fed , the feed usually coming from the left .
However , by substituting a special feed arm in the feed cover , it can be made to feed from the right side .

d. How to Operate ( 1 ) Safety .
—A manual safety is located on the left side of the receiver , just above the trigger and in front of the sear .
To prevent the safety lever from jumping from either the " safe " or the " fire " position ; a spring - actuated catch is assembled to the safety lever .
This catch engages in notches cut in the receiver at the " S " ( sicher — " safe " ) and " F " ( Feuer — " fire " ) positions and holds the safety in the position where it is set .
This gun cannot be cocked with the safety lever in the " safe " position , that is , when the letter " S " is exposed .
When the letter " F " is exposed , the gun is ready to fire .
Figure 39 .— Sketch showing method of inserting loaded belt in feedway of M.G. 34 .
( 2 ) To load and fire . —( a) Using belt from belt box .
— Insert the tab of the belt ( see fig . 39 ) , with the open ends of the links down , in the feedway on the left side of the receiver ( if you have no tab on the belt , take two cartridges from the end of the belt and use the empty links as a tab ) .
This may be done with the feed cover either open or closed .
Close the cover plate , and pull the belt through until the first round is stopped by the three cartridge - holding pawls on the underside of the feed block .
Now cock the gun by pulling the operating handle , on the right side of the receiver , to the rear as far as it will go .
The bolt now catches in its rearward position , and can be released only by squeezing the trigger .
The operating handle must be returned to the forward position before firing the gun , since otherwise injury may result from the handle moving forward when the trigger is pulled .
Check the safety lever to be sure that it is in the " fire " position , that is , with the letter " F " exposed .
Figure 40 . — Close - up of 75 - round saddle - type drum .
( b ) For semi-automatic fire .
— Check the sights to see that both the front and rear sights are in position .
Press the top part of the double trigger which is marked " E " ( Einzelschussfeuer — " single - shot fire " ) .
( c ) For full - automatic fire .
— Press the bottom part of the double trigger which is marked " D " ( Dauerfeuer — " continuous fire " ) .
The assistant should hold down the bipod legs , as this gun , in full - automatic fire , has a marked tendency to jump .
( d) Using 50 - round belt from drum .
—Press the catch on the sliding lever of the drum , and move the cover to the open position so that the tab end of the belt can be pulled from the drum .
Insert the tab in the feedway , with the open end of the links down .
Engage the hook which is on the front ( narrow ) end of the drum onto the lug on the front end of the feed - plate lower assembly .
Turn the rear end of the drum toward the gun until the spring catch on the drum engages the lug on the rear end of the feedway .
Now proceed as in belt loading from a belt box ( see d( 2 ) ( a ) , p. 61 , above ) .
( e ) Using 75 - round double drum .
—If this type of drum ( fig. 40 ) is found with the gun , more than likely the gun will be set up to take these drums without any changes , that is , with a special feed - cover ( see fig . 41 ) .
This special feed - cover has an opening to take the 75 - round drum , and it also has a folding dust cover to protect the breech mechanism when the drum is not in place on the gun .
No belt is used in this type of drum .
Place the drum in position , straddling the feed opening and thereby depressing the dust cover .
Pull the operating handle to the rear and then push it forward , thus cocking the gun and placing the operating handle in a position where it will not fly forward when the trigger is squeezed .
Use the trigger for semi - or full - automatic fire in the same manner as in firing belted ammunition from a belt box or drum .
Figure 41 . — German method of firing M.G. 34 from bipod mount .
( 3 ) Sights . —( a ) Rear sight .
—The rear sight is divided into meters .
( For a conversion of the meters into yards , see fig .
42.8 ) ( b ) Telescopic sight .
—The telescopic sight is used with the tripod mount for aiming the machine gun in either direct or indirect fire ( see figs . 43 and 44 ) .
When direct fire is being employed the shutter is set to direkt ( " direct " ) , thus exposing the meter graduations of the elevation drum .
The required range is then set , in meters , on the elevation drum by turning the elevating knob .
Figure 42 .— Rear sight of M.G. 34 , showing relation between yards and meters .
In indirect fire the shutter is usually turned to indirekt ( " indirect " ) , thus covering the elevation drum and bringing into position an index for reading the elevation micrometer .
The required elevation is then set , in mils , on the elevation scale and elevation micrometer . 9
A collimator ( see fig .
44 ) is provided for use in establishing the safety point of minimum elevation for firing over the crest or over the heads of friendly troops .
The collimator traverses with the telescope , but can be elevated or depressed .
As one looks into the collimator , a cross may be seen which remains stationary as though it were at an infinite distance .
Aiming is accomplished by lining up this cross with the target .
Figure 43 .— Telescopic sight on M.G. 34 .
Figure 44 .— Telescopic sight for M.G. 34 ( rear view ) .
( 4 ) Immediate action .
—( a ) General .
—If the gun fails to fire , cock it by pulling the operating handle to the rear , and then squeeze the trigger .
In drawing back the operating handle , the gunner must know by the feel whether the bolt was in the extreme forward position or whether it was halfway forward .
If the bolt was already in the extreme forward position and the cartridge was not fired , the gunner may , after he has made sure that the dud cartridge has been ejected , try to fire again .
If no cartridge is ejected when the bolt is drawn back , or if a cartridge case falls out of the ejection port , the gunner must in no case try to fire again , but should put the gun on " safe , " open the cover with the left hand , and remove the belt from the feed - block lower assembly in order to see whether a cartridge has been left in the front part of the receiver or in the barrel .
If necessary , the feed - block lower assembly should be removed .
If there is a cartridge in the front part of the receiver , it should be removed .
However , if the cartridge is already in the chamber , the gunner should close the feed cover , put the safety on " fire , " and squeeze the trigger .
If the shot does not go off , the bolt should be left in the extreme forward position in order to prevent a " cooked - off round " ( self - ignition of the cartridge in the hot barrel ) when the breech mechanism is open .
If the cartridge has not been loosened within 5 minutes , the lock and the barrel should be changed .
Then the cartridge in the chamber can be removed by the gunner at his leisure .
When heated by firing , a barrel which has a live cartridge in the chamber must never be changed immediately .
In case another cartridge becomes stuck in the same chamber after a short time , a thorough cleaning of the chamber is recommended .
If the bolt pulls the base off a cartridge case in extracting it , and then jams a new round into that part of the empty case remaining in the chamber , first remove the new round and change the barrel .
When time permits , extract the cartridge - case remnant from the barrel , using the extractor for ruptured cartridges which may be found in the M.G. 34 tool kit .

—To unload ( using the belt drum or belt ) , cock the gun by pulling the operating handle to the rear , and set the safety lever to the " safe " position .
Raise the feed cover by pushing forward the feed - cover catch ( at the rear end of the feed cover ) .
Remove the belt from the gun .
After checking to be sure that the chamber is empty , close the feed cover , move the safety lever to the " fire " position , and ease the bolt forward by holding the operating handle and squeezing the trigger .
To unload when using the 75 - round double drum , proceed as in unloading with the belt or belt drum , except that the double drum must be removed before the feed cover is opened .
( 6 ) To change barrels .
—( a ) General .
— The barrels on this gun should be changed after firing 250 rounds in full - automatic fire , or , in cases of emergency , after firing 400 rounds .
Spare barrels are regular equipment with the M.G. 34 and are carried in either single - or double - barreled containers by the gun crew .
Figure 45 .— Removal of barrel of M.G. 34 . ( b ) Procedure .
—Cock the gun and set the safety lever to the " safe " position .
Push in the receiver catch ( located just below the rear sight base on the left side of the barrel jacket ) and turn the receiver almost a half turn in a counterclockwise direction ( see fig . 45 ) .
Lower the shoulder stock until the barrel slides out of the barrel jacket .
Remove the hot barrel , using an asbestos hand pad which is furnished with the spare - parts kit .
Now level the piece and insert a cool barrel into the barrel jacket .
Turn the receiver back to the right until the receiver catch again locks together the barrel jacket and the receiver .
Set the safety lever to the " fire " position and commence firing .
( 7 ) Tripod mount .
—( a) General .
— When the M.G. 34 is employed on its tripod mount , it is considered to be a heavy machine gun .
On this mount , overhead and indirect fire may be employed .
( See figs . 34 and 35 . ) ( b ) Mounting gun on tripod .
—After unfolding and erecting the mount ,10 first place the rear end of the machine gun on the mount so that the projections on each side of the gun fit into the claws on the cradle ( see fig .
34 ) ; then lower the muzzle end of the gun onto the cradle .
The front part of the gun is secured by means of the hinge clamp .
( c ) Elevation and traverse .
—The elevating handwheel is on the left of the elevating gear ( see fig . 46 ) .
A wing nut is furnished for clamping the elevating gear , and adjustable elevating stops are provided to enable the gun to be elevated gradually .
Adjustments for direction are made by shifting the traversing slide along the traversing arc by means of a handle on the right in which an oil bottle is fitted .
There is a clamping lever for locking the traversing slide .
Traversing stops are arranged for the traversing arc , which is graduated to facilitate adjustment of the stops ( see fig . 46 ) .
Figure 46 .— Rear view of tripod mount for M.G. 34 .
( See tables 1 and 2 , pp. 76-77 , below , for a translation of the plate containing overhead firing data . )
In front of the elevating gear is an automatic searching - fire device , operated by the recoil of the gun in the cradle , which causes a projection on the cradle slide to strike a roller on the device .
Actuated in this manner , the device alternately elevates the cradle step by step and depresses it similarly each time a shot is fired .
The limits of the searching fire , and consequently the distance on the ground covered by it , can be increased or reduced by means of two levers at the inner end of the elevating handwheel .

Ammunition ( 1 ) Belts .
—The belts used in this gun are of the non-disintegrating metallic - link type .
Each length holds 50 rounds .
Lengths may be joined together to give a belt of any length , but lengths of 250 rounds are usually the longest used .
When the gun is moved frequently , and when it is used for antiaircraft purposes , the 50 - round belt in the belt drum is employed ( see fig . 47 ) .
Figure 47 .— Method of joining metallic - link ammunition belt .
( 2 ) To join belts .
—At one end of a belt there is a link with a small semicircular tongue ( fig. 47 (1 ) B ) and at the other end of the belt ( fig. 47 ( 1 ) B ) there is a link with a small rectangular hole in the side of the curved body of the link .
To join one belt to another , the tongue on the last link of one belt is slipped through the hole on the first link of the second belt until the small projection on the tongue is over the small D - shaped hole in the center of the curved body of the link ( fig. 47 ( 2 ) ) .
Now place a round in the link and the belts will be locked together ( fig. 47( 3 ) ) .
This can be done while the gun is firing .
( 3 ) Types of ammunition . —
Type German Name Identification Ball Patrone schweres Spitzgeschoss ( Patr. s.S. ) , cartridge with heavy , pointed bullet .
Green lacquer coloring around the primer seat .
AP Patrone mit Spitzgeschoss mit Stahlkern ( Patr. S.m.K. ) , cartridge with steel - core pointed bullet .
Red lacquer coloring around the primer seat .
AP tracer Patrone mit Spitzgeschoss mit Stahlkern und Leuchtspur ( Patr. S.m. K.L' Spur ) , cartridges with steel - core pointed bullet with tracer .
Red lacquer coloring around the primer seat , and black tip on the bullet .
Ammunition is usually packed 1,500 rounds to a case .
A case weighs about 113 pounds .
Ammunition cartons holding 5 - round clips have their identification labels overprinted with I.L. in red ink .
Ammunition is not packed in belts ; it is loaded into the nondisintegrating metallic link belts with the aid of a belt - loading machine .
These belts are not expendable .
( 4 ) Hand - loading belt .
— When there is no belt - loading machine available , the belts may be loaded by hand .
Insert rounds in the belt from the end with the projection until the cannelure of the cartridge case is stopped by the tit on the end of the projection .
This will correctly place the round in the belt .
Belts are connected as stated in e( 2 ) , p. 79 , above .
( 5 ) Lubrication of belt .
—The belts should be lubricated with heavy oil if the cartridges are kept in them for any purpose other than immediate use .
One application of heavy oil will last for 10 usings of the belt in the gun .
f. Maintenance ( 1 ) Oiling and cleaning .
—The M.G. 34 is sensitive to dirt , dust , and sand .
To function well , it must be kept cleaned and oiled at all times .
The ejection - port cover should be kept closed whenever the gun is not firing .
This ejection - port cover will automatically open whenever either of the double triggers is pulled .
The belts should be kept oiled .
The same type of care and cleaning given to similar U.S. weapons will suffice .
( 2 ) Stripping . —( a ) To remove bipod .
—Raise the front sight .

The Juliet Club Provides Love Advice from Shakespeare ’s Tragic Heroine
Juliet Capulet , from William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet , receives a lot of mail .
Luckily , " Il Club de Guilietta " ( The Juliet Club ) is there to answer it .
Juliet Capulet is one of the world ’s most famous love - struck teens .
As the tragic heroine of William Shakespeare ’s Romeo and Juliet , she ’s been portrayed by countless actresses , and her impassioned words have been read in millions of high school English classes .
Though Shakespeare ’s famous play was based on a supposedly true story , the ill - fated young woman has been dead for hundreds of years .
But that does n’t stop lovelorn people from all over the world from seeking her advice on matters of the heart .
For more than seventy years , as the timeless story of Romeo and Juliet has gained even more cultural prominence , thousands of people of all ages have written to Juliet ’s supposed address in Verona , Italy , asking her advice on relationship matters .
Strangely , the fictional figure has become a sort of “ Dear Abby ” for the romantically destitute .
While it seems a bit unlikely that Miss Capulet herself will pen a reply , a group of volunteers , “ Il Club de Guilietta ” ( “ The Juliet Club , ” in English ) , have made it their mission to respond to every missive .
Giulio Tamassia , a retired baker , is the club ’s organizer .
Since 1993 , he ’s been providing love advice to Juliet ’s fans as a full - time job .
Because the letters are written in many different languages , and come from people all over the world , Tamassia passes on the correspondence to native speakers who can offer a wise reply .
When the letters are more serious in nature , the letter - writers often seek help from a psychologist or a priest in coming up with a response .
“ It is very important that every letter receives an answer , ” Tamassia told the Christian Science Monitor .
“ For many , they have no one else to talk to .
This is about love .
This is serious . ”
Curious to see what people are writing to Juliet ?
Read some of the letters , and more of the story , in the book Letters to Juliet .
Lane Kiffin really is getting a jump on recruiting .
No sooner had the Trojans new coach put the finishing touches on the Class of 2010 recruits , that he turned his attention to the Class of 2015 .
That 's right , 2015 .
Thursday evening Kiffin received a verbal commitment from 13 - year old wunderkind quarterback David Sills of Bear , Del .
Too young ?
Not according to his personal coach Steve Clarkson , who has mentored some of the game 's best quarterbacks including current USC starter Matt Barkley .
" His skill set is off the chart , " Clarkson said .
" I 've never seen anyone at his age do what he 's been able to do . "
The commitment has happened in college basketball previously , but is unprecedented for college football where it's harder to project how a player as young as Sills will develop physically .
Clarkson says that wo n't be a problem .
" He 's already six feet as a 13 - year old , " Clarkson said .
" And he 's breaking down NFL footage . "
Clarkson said the scholarship offer emerged after he called Kiffin to discuss a quarterback recruit for next year 's class .
Al - Shabab has been carrying out hit - and - run attacks throughout central and southern Somalia
At least 47 people have been killed and 100 injured in fighting in the central Somali town of Dhuusa Marreeb , a human rights official has told the BBC .
Ali Yasin Gedi , of Somali human rights group Elman , said many people had fled the town where allies of the government fought to drive out Islamist rebels .
The pro-government Ahlu Sunna group is said to have recaptured the strategic town from al - Shabab militants .
The militants were reportedly in control of the town for a few hours .
SOMALI ISLAMISTS Ahlu Sunna Moderate Sufi Muslims
Loose government allies Al - Shabab Follow hardline Wahhabi Islam Anti-government Control much of southern Somali Accused of links to al - Qaeda Hizbul Islam Hardline Muslims Anti-government Recently fallen out with al - Shabab
Sufi rage at grave desecration Behind Somalia 's Islamist rivalry Correspondents say Ahlu Sunna was founded as a non-violent group to promote moderate Sufi Islam but decided last year to take up arms against the radical al - Shabab group , which is accused of links to al - Qaeda .
Somalia has not had a functioning national administration since 1991 .
Its UN - backed government controls only a few parts of the capital , Mogadishu .
Mr Gedi said his information was based on conversations with his organisation 's workers in the town , 500 km ( 310 miles ) north of the capital , Mogadishu .
He told the BBC that some people had been taking the wounded to hospitals elsewhere in the region .
" Our monitoring office has confirmed that most of the casualties were from the warring factions , but some civilians were also killed , " he said .
" Many people who fled from the town have not returned yet and they are in the outskirts of the town without shelter and the sun is extremely hot . "
One resident , Hussein Moalim Mahad , told AFP news agency the fighting had been " the most violent ever seen in Dhuusa Marreeb " .
Local chief Abdulahi Gedi said he had sent out two teams to collect bodies lying inside and outside the town .
Unverified reports say al - Shabab has been spotted regrouping in areas outside the town .
It is said to be the first fighting in the area since Ahlu Sunnah defeated al - Shabab a year ago .

Now is the time the world has to fight for the Elephants .
The integrity and credibility of the International organization established to regulate the trade in Endangered Species , namely CITES or the International Convention for Trade in Endangered Species , has long been questionable , mainly because of this organization 's blatant bias towards trade over and above its mandate of safeguarding the world 's endangered species .
Sadly , today 's world seems to have lost ethics about what is right and what is wrong .
Greed and corruption sway decisions that adversely affect our fragile planet and the teeth of the world 's largest living land mammal ' the elephant ' have become a very hot political issue .
In March 2010 at Doha in the Middle East , the 15th Conference of the Parties that are signatories to the CITES Convention will seal the ultimate fate of Elephants in Africa , and certainly those remaining in East and Central Africa when Tanzania and Zambia will seek authority to sell their ivory stockpiles .
Either the elephants will be granted a reprieve through the imposition of another ( this time long - term ) international ivory trade ban , or the demise of the world 's elephants will be sealed simply because signatories to the Convention selfishly seek trade with ivory consuming Nations above the survival of the elephants .
The main consumers of both legal and illegal ivory are the Far Eastern countries of the world , mainly China , Thailand and Japan all of whom are important trading partners of the West , so the elephants have always been the pawns in a political game of trade .
Kenya and Mali are chairing a six day Meeting in Brussels from January 22nd bringing together 23 countries that are members of the Convention aimed at forging a united front against Tanzania and Zambia 's proposal seeking CITES ' permission for the sale of their ivory stockpiles .
It is a known fact that there has been an alarming upsurge in illegal poaching since CITES sanctioned the sale of the so - called legal ivory stockpiles of four Southern African countries in 2008 - namely South Africa , Botswana , Namibia and , astonishingly , even Zimbabwe , licensing China , for the first time as a legal bidder along with Japan , despite the fact that China is the main driver of the illegal ivory trade History is simply repeating itself since the same pattern followed a previous so - called legal CITES sanctioned stockpile sale in 2006 .
Between 8 % and l0 % of Africa 's remaining elephants ( now estimated to number at best some 300,000 , down from 1.3 million 100 years ago ) are being killed annually .
The price of ivory has escalated nine fold , currently standing at between US $ 1500 - $ 5000 a Kg in the Far East .
The price paid to the poacher and Buying Middlemen Dealers has escalated in tandem , providing a growing incentive amongst impoverished Africans to kill elephants for personal gain .
Yet again , as in the seventies , eighties and early nineties a veritable WAR is being fought over Africa 's elephants , and people are dying along with the elephants as a result .
Apart from the poaching toll , there is the unseen silent death of all the tuskless dependent young i.e. all calves under 5 years of age who are still milk dependent and cannot survive without their murdered mother 's milk .
Then there are many others that have already , and will continue to succumb to the affects of drought since Africa is predicted to become ever drier and more prone to the sort of devastating drought experienced in 2009 when rivers and lakes dried up and elephants died in large numbers as a result .
To this , add the toll taken by disease transmitted by drought stricken domestic livestock , as well as premature deaths due to psychological grief and stress .
Elephants are known to be vulnerable to the same kind of psychological problems that affect humans and they have been scientifically proven to be ' human ' in terms of intelligence , emotional family and friendship bonding , nurturing of one another , along with age progression , and expected life span .
All these factors have , and will , take a further toll of elephants beyond that of the crooked ivory syndicates that organise the poaching .
Such factors must also be taken into account by CITES officials charged with assessing the viability of trading demands .
The plausible argument that funds so generated are needed for elephant conservation are invalid , for such funds merely fill the pockets of corrupt Government officials where corruption is overtly endemic .
Elephants are now more endangered than ever , and yet there is evidence that CITES still harbours a bias in favour of trade at the expense of the survival of the elephants .
Evidence of this is through the Secretariate 's selection of pro trade oriented individuals on the CITES Panel of Experts charged with assessing the management practices of such countries .
Currently the panel is in Tanzania and Zambia and the choice of its officials has been questioned by Kenya .
Africa 's elephants faced annihilation after 3 decades of rampant poaching during the seventies and eighties .
Only a total ban imposed by CITES under intense international pressure in 1989 saved the situation , but the ban was lifted before even one generation of young elephants had been born because CITES allowed Southern African countries to sell their so - called legal stockpiles .
Thereafter poaching escalated instantly .
Illegal ivory hauls amounting to some 29,000 Kgs of African ivory were seized representing the lives of at least 43,000 tusked elephants , not counting their milk dependent young .
It must not be forgotten that illegal seizures represent only about 10 % of what slips through the net undetected .
DNA testing proved beyond all doubt that over 1/3 of this illegal haul originated from elephants poached in Tanzania 's Southern Selous National Reserve and at the same time the Japanese refused DNA testing on another huge illegal stockpile seized in Osaka , similarly widely believed to have also originated in Tanzania .
Significantly , that same year Tanzania put in a bid to CITES to sell its ivory stockpile , which , fortunately , was turned down after intense international pressure .
NOW HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF .
Zambia along with Tanzania have again put forward a request to CITES to sell their so - called legal stockpiles without consulting Kenya whose elephants cross over into Tanzania .
This , despite over 14,380 kgs of illegal ivory seized in Vietnam , the Philippines and Kenya during in 2009 , ( again proven through DNA testing to have originated from Tanzanian and Zambian elephants , mainly from the Selous National Reserve , allegedly with Government collusion ) .
Again , this represents just a fraction of what slips through the net undetected and since then gunshots have been heard regularly in southern Selous National Reserve and gun-toting poaching gangs have even been spotted by visiting tourists , so the poaching continues with impunity !
Elephant population figures have allegedly been fudged and inflated and are scientifically ' dubious ' at best .
Likewise 6,200 kgs of ivory identified as coming from Zambia has recently been seized in Singapore as has another 6,000 Kgs. of fresh blood stained tusks intercepted in the Philippines en route to China .
DNA testing has proved that Tanzania and Zambia are driving poaching in the region , something that will impact on the elephants of neighbouring States .
Central Africa 's forest elephants are on the brink of extinction .
Should they disappear from the world 's important tropical forest lungs , the global consequences would be far reaching for they disperse the seeds of the forests trees and ensure their replacement and continuity
Were elephants to disappear in Eastern Africa , many other wildlife species would be adversely affected , especially the grazers , for elephants are the Gardeners of Eden that recycle scrubland into the grassland upon which all grazing species depend .
East African Nations would lose the mainstay of their economies , and this would increase poverty , insecurity and misery for millions of deprived people .
The richer countries of the world have to make a stand against the lust of the Far East Nations for animal products .
Nor should they be taken in by the argument that funds from so - called legal sales will further enhance elephant protection in the countries that are responsible for killing them .
This money enhances corrupt pockets and further jeopardizes elephant survival .
Nor should the European Union conveniently be taking the cowardly stand of abstaining simply because they can not all agree .
By so doing they deny the elephants votes that could mean the difference between life and certain death .
This year the Vote of the Signatories to the CITES convention will seal the fate of Africa 's elephants one way or another , and because of this all caring people have a duty to speak out forcefully , or else become guilty of sinning through silence .
Reading this article in Charisma by Exodus International ’s Alan Chambers , I was struck with a realization : these people really are misogynist pigs .
In the piece , Alan is announcing the arrival of Gayle Haggard ’s sadly misguided book Why I Stayed : The Choices I Made In My Darkest Hour .
Under the guise of encouraging Christians to more openly and honestly minister to the wives of gay men ( excuse me , “ men struggling with same - sex atttraction ” ) , Chambers lays out a philosophy that holds women hostage to their gay husbands , out of a desire to “ serve the Lord . ”
It ’s very twisted :
Having personally struggled with feelings of same - sex attraction , my heart is always burdened when I hear of such heartache .
The truth is that while Mrs. Haggard ’s circumstances are unique , her situation is not .
Alan is probably moreso burdened because , as a gay man , he has remained married to a woman , thereby hijacking her life and her opportunity to be with a man who truly wants her , all of her .
But yet , instead of taking his inner conflict and at least keeping it to himself , Alan has chosen to use his perceived victimhood to victimize another .
The fact that his wife may be oblivious to this is irrelevant .
These men have simply taken the normal patriarchal control over women to a new , sick level , but it ’s part of a theme that ’s been running through religious ideology for centuries : women are not viewed as whole , valid sexual beings on their own .
They are captives to an idea of “ male headship , ” and their needs — emotional , physical , mental , spiritual — are secondary to those of their husbands .
Put simply , these women are caught up in a lifestyle where their husbands are the final arbiters of their needs .
There is no credible evidence that men like Alan can change their inherent sexuality .
It goes against everything we know about biology , about sexuality , about men ’s sexual responses to stimulus .
The fact that men like Alan Chambers and Randy Thomas have chosen lives which consist of abject denial in the service of that which they wish were true , and have profited handily from it , does not in any way negate reality .
They ’ve admitted as much , as they ’ve constantly moved the goalposts over the years .
These days , only the most ridiculous liars on their side suggest that gay men actually become heterosexual .
Most have changed the official message from “ you can become straight ! ” to “ Jesus will fill the hole in your life where men are supposed to be ! ”
So they go about their lives , staying on message with the daily flare - ups of their chosen stigmata , and yet , the wives ?
They ’re mostly ignored .
Some are likely brainwashed fully into the belief that their husbands are truly attracted to them .
Others are held in captivity like orcas , content to do tricks because they ’ve been taught over the years that their actual feelings and needs are simply unimportant , desires to be squelched just like their husbands ’ desires for men .
Still others likely live in a silent hell because they know , instinctively , that everything they say they believe about their marriages , about their husbands , is simply not true .
I personally know many who have struggled with homosexuality as married men and women , sought help and like Gayle Haggard , witnessed powerful , albeit hard - fought , healing in their marriage .
One of them is my good friend , Mike Goeke .
Mike grew up in the church , buried his struggle with homosexuality for years and eventually married his wife , Stephanie , with the hope that it would squelch rumors about his sexuality and help ‘ fix ’ him .
After two years of marriage , Mike left a letter on the door of their home telling his wife that he was gay and wanted a divorce .
He jumped headlong into a gay life style and left the church in bitterness and anger .
Even so , Stephanie courageously told him , “ God put us together and I do n’t know how , but I know He can repair this situation . ”
Over time and through a book his father gave him , he heard truth and though he argued with God , he heard only one response – I love you .
Eventually , Mike gave in to the call of the Lord and returned to Stephanie and they began the long and arduous process of rebuilding their marriage .
The church that Mike had once resented became an integral part of their healing when godly men helped him find his true identity as a man and a child of God .
The Goekes now minister to couples who find themselves in similar situations and hold a marriage seminar at our ministry ’s conference each year .
Poor Stephanie .
Snowed under by a fundamentalist lifestyle that devalues knowledge and information , she relied on “ God ” to “ repair ” something that biology tells us is not in need of repair .
It ’s sad that she ended up married to a gay man ( then and now ) , but we all deal with sad things from time to time , and what we need in those times is not dogmatic brainwashing , but honest counsel and support .
These women may or may not believe , in their hearts , that their marriages are “ repaired . ”
But they ’re not , because their husbands are committed to an ideology that states that their wives are not important enough , as human beings , to be treated honestly .
Their husbands are committed to an ideology that states that sex is shameful in the first place , so the idea of their wives experiencing true sexual fulfillment is simply not on the radar .
Yes , these women do need support .
They do need love .
They also deserve the potential to experience the fullness of life , and as long as they allow themselves to be tied up in the basement by their ideology and that of their gay husbands , fed the occasional table scrap of attention and encouraged to pray about the rest , they will not fulfill that potential .
John McCain , 2010 ( emphasis added ) :
" I suspended my campaign -- as did Senator Obama -- to come back to Washington because the President had told me that we were in a world financial collapse .
That 's why I did what I did .
I always said that consistently . "
McCain 's claim that Barack Obama suspended his campaign comes a few days after McCain claimed that Bush had asked him to suspend his campaign , and it 's just as false .
In case McCain needs a reminder of what actually happened , here 's video of then - Senator Obama rejecting McCain 's demand that he suspend his campaign and skip the presidential debate :
There 's lies , there 's liars , and then there 's John McCain .
No wonder he said he was ' soulmates ' with Sarah Palin .
Google has added Pompeii to its Street View application , allowing internet users to take a 360 - degree virtual tour of the ancient Roman city .
Italy 's culture ministry says it hopes the move will boost tourism to the site , state news agency Ansa reports .
Among the ruins visible on the search engine 's free mapping service are the town 's statues , temples and theatres .
The city was buried in ash after Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79 and was not discovered until the 18th Century .
The volcanic debris preserved many of the city 's buildings , frescos , silverware , mosaics and other artefacts .
" Giving people a chance to take a virtual stroll through Pompeii will give an extraordinary boost to Italian tourism , " Ansa quoted Mario Resca of the culture ministry 's heritage promotion department as saying .
The Google Maps service , launched in 2007 , provides panoramic street - level views of more than 100 cities around the world .
It also includes the ancient heritage site of Stonehenge .

Army special forces units are operating in a republican dissident stronghold of Northern Ireland , it was alleged tonight .
Republican Sinn Féin , political allies of the Continuity IRA , have claimed masked undercover soldiers have been carrying out surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan , County Armagh in recent weeks .
They claimed the men were scouting the areas in white civilian vans .
Republican Sinn Féin said the soldiers belong to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment .
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers – formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit – is controversial because British troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets , especially in nationalist areas .
Martin Duffy , press officer of Republican Sinn Féin in Lurgan , said the sightings of the elite military unit should be seen as part of a wider strategy to suppress " republican resistance " in the north Armagh area .
Duffy said that 14 of the 24 Continuity IRA prisoners held in the top- security Maghaberry prison outside Belfast are from the Lurgan area .
As well as being subjected to surveillance , Duffy said that the prisoners ' relatives and friends have been subjected to drug searches by sniffer dogs during visits .
He also claimed that under the stop and search powers of Article 44 of the Terrorism
Act hundreds of mainly young people have been stopped and searched .
" In the Lurgan area we are selling up to 600 copies of Republican Sinn Féin 's newspaper Saoirse a month .
Support for republican resistance is high in Lurgan and Craigavon especially among the young people .
So it is not a surprise the Brits and the RUC / PSNI are targeting our areas .
" On the Tullygalley estate a couple of weeks ago , a white van was spotted going around the area .
When it reached the back of the local youth centre , men in boiler suits , armed with rifles and wearing ski masks got out .
They were not members of the republican movement .
Nor were they ordinary police or British soldiers .
They wore no uniform or had any badge markings .
We believe they were the SRR brought in to intimidate republicans . "
The housing estates of nationalist north Lurgan have been the focal points for rioting , bomb attacks on the Belfast to Dublin rail line and shootings at police patrols over the past 12 months .
One of the men who visited a relative in Maghaberry a fortnight ago said that he was strip - searched after being threatened with arrest .
Gerard ( not his real name ) said he was forced to strip naked and then pin himself against a wall where police officers made him lift each leg up so they could even inspect his anus .
A PSNI spokesman said the police could not comment on the alleged presence of military units .
Republican Sinn Féin's Geraldine Taylor , a one - time ally of Gerry Adams and now an opponent of the peace process , predicted there would be protests in the jail over the use of sniffer dogs .
In the 18th century Casanova referred to them as “ English frock coats ” and made prodigious use of the “ little preventive bag invented by the English to save the fair sex from anxiety . ”
In 1709 the English literary journal The Tatler alluded to their supposed invention by an eponymous doctor of “ eminent Quality ” ; the success of his “ Engine ” eventually “ made it an Immodesty to name his Name . ”
But there was never a Dr. Condom as far as we can tell , and no one really knows who first created condoms ( or named them ) , since bladders , animal membranes , sheaths and salve - coated cloths have been used for similar purposes since the beginning of recorded history .
Spend some time at the fascinating new exhibition at the Museum of Sex , “ Rubbers : The Life , History & Struggle of the Condom , ” and their origins hardly matter : their history is what is extraordinary .
These commonplace objects  widely used and rarely spoken of , often seen but infrequently displayed  are icons of far more than the phallus .
The museum ’s curator , Sarah Forbes , has gathered condom boxes and vending machines , horrific photos of disease and collections of birth - control devices , American military videos and a dress made out of dyed condoms , television commercials and artworks , creating a modest exhibition that elevates the status of the condom .
And , not incidentally , the show explicitly encourages its use  particularly , as one major section reminds us , to prevent the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS .
CAPE TOWN , South Africa —
They were big , though not nearly as big as what we divers had anticipated .
Nothing like the jaws that faced Chief Brody as he threw bits of bloodied fish over the side of his boat , the Orca , in the 1975 movie , " Jaws . "
But then we saw the teeth .
When they lunged for the chum , or bait , their mouths opened really , really wide .
Rows upon rows of giant white jagged teeth glared at us .
Their huge , blank , black eyes rolled back in their heads .
It was awe - inspiring .
It was exciting .
It was petrifying .
Adrenaline crept up my spine and churned in my belly every time a Great White cruised next to the cage which we divers were soon eye - to - eye with underwater .
Pulses quickened and hearts pounded , first in excitement and then in panic .
The sharks were curious and quick , but also quick to lose interest .
The divers alternated between fascination , terror and thinking this was the coolest thing ever .
Some could n’t wait to get in the water .
The enthusiasm of others waned the further we got from shore during a bumpy three - hour ride .
I had researched the safety of cage - diving before I signed up .
Would the sharks associate me with the bits and pieces of chopped up fish , or chum , the tour operators sprinkled into the sea to get their attention ?
Would they try to barge in between the cage bars ?
John McCosker , senior scientist and chair of the aquatic biology department at the California Academy of Sciences said there was no evidence that sharks associate chum with the contents of the shark cage .
“ I think that ’s giving them too much credit , ” he said .
However , McCosker mentioned that chumming , or fishing with bait , is not allowed near shark - cage diving in California because some correlation exists between shark - cage diving that uses chumming and attacks on surfers and swimmers .
If shark attacks on people increase , he said , animosity toward sharks will increase , which makes conservation more difficult .
Does he advise people to be more careful in the areas where shark cage diving is going on ?
" Most certainly , " McCosker said .
I looked down at the cage , peeking a mere foot above water .
What if the one of the sharks breached , leaping out of the water and landing on top of the cage ?
Or worse , in it ?
South Africa is famous for its breaching Great White sharks , who attack their prey by swimming underneath and then hurtling themselves from great depths through the water , toward the surface , and up under their prey , sending both predator and prey flying into the air .
In South Africa , Great - White shark attacks tend to ebb and flow with the tide of holiday beach - goers , regardless of the frequency of cage - diving .
“ This time of year they can go in a meter of water , ” explained Lyndie Harbenberg , an operator at Shark Diving Unlimited in Gansbaai , South Africa .
“ You can actually count the great whites in - between the holiday people . ”
I started to waffle .
I tried taking deep calming breaths , but my lungs quivered as I inhaled deeply .
My stomach felt queasy , and I was pretty sure that it was n’t just from the rocking boat .
The wetsuit I put on was cold , clammy and not very reassuring .
But once I got in the water , I calmed down .
A little .
I felt safe in the cage .
Sort of .
The boat bounced up and down on the surface of the choppy ocean , and the cage bounced , too .
I was jostled by the waves , and my hands and feet were thrust through the bars .
Pure panic ensued as my heart dropped through the bottom of my stomach every time one of my limbs slipped through the bars of the cage into shark territory .
That is , until the limb floated back in , still attached .
Once I was back in the boat , I wished I could have seen more sharks underwater .
The sea was a little rough , and underwater visibility was murky .
“ People who do it become great stewards , ambassadors and protectors of white sharks , ” McCosker had told me earlier .
There is little new that scientists can learn from cage diving with Great Whites , he explained .
“ Now it ’s just really for the ecotourism industry , ” he said , that helps fund conservation efforts and gives governments , like South Africa , incentives to protect the sharks .
I was hooked .
Being eye to eye with a Great White that thrashed on the surface of the water was unbelievable .

LEGALISING POT :
The report says there is " no reason why cannabis should not be able to be used for medicinal purposes in limited circumstances " .
Cannabis would be allowed for medicinal use and low - level pot-smokers sent to rehab instead of prison under proposals revealed this afternoon by the Law Commission .
The Law Commission Issues Paper on Controlling and Regulating Drugs also calls for a " major overhaul " of the law governing new drugs like BZP party pills .
Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey
Palmer today said there was " scope for a range of different approaches " to drug laws in New Zealand .
" There may be a case for taking more flexible approaches to offences involving possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use , " Sir Geoffrey said .
The report says there is " no reason why cannabis should not be able to be used for medicinal purposes in limited circumstances " .
Under a proposed scheme , people suffering from chronic or debilitating illnesses would be able to use cannabis under medical supervision , particularly where conventional treatment options had proven ineffective .
Cannabis cultivators would be licensed to provide medicinal marijuana in the same way as other legitimate dealers in controlled drugs , the report said .
Justice Minister Simon
Power today said he would be interested in submissions on the report but he would not allow medicinal use of cannabis .
" There is not a single solitary chance that as long as I 'm the Minister of Justice that we 'll be relaxing drug laws in New Zealand , " Mr Power said .
Mr Power 's comments were at odds with the report , which suggested there should be less emphasis on conviction and punishment for low level drug users and more on treatment .
" Simply punishing a drug user , without taking steps to address their drug use , is a wasted opportunity , " the report said .
It suggested three options where personal use of marijuana was detected .
The options were : a three strikes caution regime ; on the spot infringement notices ; or legislation allowing police to choose from a range of options for punishment .
The regulation of new drugs - like party pills - was recommended for change .
The Commission said there should be a new regime where any new psychoactive substance would not be available without prior approval .
The report said that the proposals were likely to raise concern they would lead to an increase in drug use .
" However , most studies in this area have concluded that changes in use levels are independent of the regulatory approach in place - that is , the regulatory approach itself neither increases or decreases drug use , " the report said .
Many homes on the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota have been without power for more than a week because of an ice storm that knocked down utility lines and damaged the water system .
Crews have restored electricity to most communities on the sprawling reservation , but about 1,500 homes in outlying areas are without power and could be for weeks , tribal officials said .
As they worked to distribute blankets and food to those in need , tribal officials said they were grateful that the outcome of the storm , which struck on Jan. 21 , was not worse .
“ I ’m just so thankful that none of the people living on this reservation died , ” said Joseph Brings Plenty , the chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe .
Tribal officials estimate that the storm brought down about 3,000 utility poles , causing extensive failures .
Many residents stayed in their homes as they lost water and power and as temperatures plummeted , with wind chills reaching 20 degrees below zero .
A new report by the Surveillance Camera Awareness Network ( SCAN ) at Queen 's University shows that Canadians believe surveillance cameras promote safety , but their perceptions do n't match the actual evidence .
The first of its kind in Canada , A Report on Camera Surveillance in Canada will be used as background to help structure new federal surveillance legislation .
" There is little or no evidence that surveillance deters crime , " says David Lyon , coordinator of the report and director of the school 's new Surveillance Studies Centre .
" Media such as TV police shows and crime stoppers promote the perception that cameras are more important than they really are . "
The report looks at the rapid growth of surveillance in Canadian society based on studies about :
The lack of Canadian legislation addressing public camera surveillance
Camera surveillance as big business
An exploration of camera operators
Research on public opinions about camera surveillance
Camera surveillance as one of the legacies of hosting the Olympic Games
Camera surveillance in Ottawa taxicabs
Camera surveillance in shopping malls
" The public should be concerned , " adds Professor Lyon .
" Surveillance technology is constantly changing .
Closed - circuit television does not accurately describe it anymore ; now surveillance footage is increasingly digitized and free to flow online .
What stops are in place to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands ?
We need to question the social ethics of surveillance footage as well as establish legal limits on how the footage can be used . "
###
The Surveillance Camera Awareness Network at the Queen 's Surveillance Centre completed the report with funding from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada .
The report is the topic of a surveillance workshop on January 15 and 16 , 2010 at Queen 's University .
Woman who found coin worth £ 2,000 in garden becomes first to be prosecuted for not reporting treasure
' Disorganised ' : Kate Harding pictured outside court .
She was found guilty of failing to report treasure
A woman who found a 700 - year - old coin in her garden as a child has become the first person to be convicted of failing to hand in suspected treasure .
Kate Harding , 23 , was prosecuted under the Treasure Act after she ignored orders to report the rare find to a coroner .
A court heard the silver piedfort marking Charles IV 's ascension to the French throne in 1322 was discovered by Miss Harding 14 years ago as she worked in the garden with her mother .
Following her mother 's death a short time later , Miss Harding kept the 1.4g item as a memento until she eventually approached museum experts with it last year who identified it as a piedfort , but she did not inform the coroner .
The exact use of piedforts is unknown .
They are generally thicker than coins and were not used as currency .
Experts have suggested they were used as guides for mint workers or as reckoning counters for officials .
Only three others have been found in the UK .
One found in 2007 was bought by the British Museum for £ 1,800 .
Under the Treasure Act 1996 , treasure is defined as any single object at least 300 years old which is not a coin but has a precious metal content of at least 10 per cent .
The Act gives a finder 14 days to inform the local coroner of potential treasure and creates an offence of failing to carry out that duty where this is not followed .
Ludlow magistrates heard how Miss Harding had ignored calls and letters from Ludlow Museum advising her to report the piedfort to the district coroner once it had been identified last February .
Treasure :
The silver piedfort marked Charles IV 's ascension to the French throne in 1322
Museum staff then notified Anthony Sibcy , the coroner for South Shropshire , who informed police .
Miss Harding initially claimed she had lost the piedfort , the court heard .
Defending Miss Harding , Brendan Reedy said she had failed to notify the coroner because of ' disorganisation ' on her part and that the artefact had a sentimental value to her .
Miss Harding , who lives with her boyfriend on the outskirts of Ludlow , admitted having an object that is believed to have been treasure and not reporting it to the coroner .
She faced up to three months in jail or a fine , or both , but walked free from court on Wednesday with a conditional discharge and was ordered to pay £ 25 of the £ 300 costs .

“ We are at war .
We are at war against al - Qaeda , a far - reaching network of violence and hatred that attacked us on 9/11 , that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people , and that is plotting to strike us again . ”
Thus did Barack Obama clear the air as to whether we are at war , and with whom and why .
Following his remarks , during a White House briefing by National Security Council aide John Brennan , Helen Thomas asked a follow - up question to which we almost never hear an answer :
Why is al - Qaeda at war with us ?
What is its motivation ?
It was Osama bin Laden himself , in his declaration of war in 1998 , published in London , who gave al - Qaeda ’s reasons for war :
First , the U.S. military presence on the sacred soil of Saudi Arabia .
Second , U.S. sanctions causing terrible suffering among the Iraqi people .
Third , U.S. support for Israel ’s dispossession of the Palestinians .
“ All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear declaration of war on God , his Messenger , and Muslims , ” said Osama .
He began his fatwa quoting the Koran : “ But when the forbidden months are past , then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them , seize them , beleaguer them , and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war . ”
To Osama , we started the war .
Muslims , the ulema , must fight because America , with her “ brutal crusade occupation of the [ Arabian ] Peninsula ” and support for “ the Jews ’ petty state ” and “ occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims there ” was waging war upon the Islamic world .
Terrorism , the direct killing of civilians for political ends , is al - Qaeda ’s unconventional tactic , but its war aims are quite conventional .
Al - Qaeda is fighting a religious war against apostates and pagans in their midst , a civil war against collaborators of the Crusaders and an anti-colonial war to drive us out of the Dar al - Islam .
On Sept. 11 , they were over here – because we are over there .
Nothing justifies the massacre of Sept. 11 .
But these are the political goals behind the 9/11 attack , and this is why Islamists fare well in elections in the Middle East .
Tens of millions of Muslims , who may despise terrorism , identify with the causes for which Osama declared war – liberation of Muslim peoples from pro-American autocrats and Israeli occupiers .
Americans are being killed for the reasons Osama said we should be killed – not because of who we are , but because of where we are and what we do .
Consider .
America lost 4,000 soldiers in six years in Iraq , with 30,000 wounded .
Yet not one American of the 125,000 soldiers in Iraq was killed in December .
Why not ?
Because we no longer conduct raids , patrol streets , kick down doors , and pat down suspects .
We have ended our combat operations , withdrawn to desert bases , and seem anxious to go home .
When we stopped fighting and killing them , they stopped fighting and killing us .
Most Americans today appear content to let Shia and Sunni , Arab and Kurd decide the future of Iraq .
And if they cannot settle their quarrels without a civil - sectarian war , why should their war be our war ?
According to Gen. Barry McCaffrey , we must now prepare for 300 to 500 dead and wounded every month in Afghanistan by summer .
Why are the Taliban killing our soldiers ?
Because we threw them out of power , took over their country , and imposed the Hamid Karzai regime , and our troops , some 100,000 by fall , are the force preventing them from recapturing their country .
We will bleed in Afghanistan as long as we are in Afghanistan .
But if , as Obama said , “ we are at war with al - Qaeda , ” why are we fighting Taliban when al - Qaeda is in Pakistan , Yemen , Somalia , and North Africa ?
Hamas has used terrorism , but not against us .
Hezbollah has used terrorism , but not against us since the bombing of the Marine barracks , a quarter - century ago .
And our Marines were attacked in Lebanon because we were in Lebanon , intervening in their civil - sectarian war .
Had the Marines not been sent into the midst of that war , they would not have been targeted .
When Ronald Reagan withdrew them , the attacks stopped .
Like Europe ’s Thirty Years ’
War – among Germans , French , Czechs , Dutch , Danes , Swedes , Scots , and English , Catholics and Protestants , kings , princes , and emperors – the Muslim world is roiled by conflicts between pro-Western autocrats and Islamic militants , Sunni and Shia , modernists and obscurantists , nationalities , tribes and clans .
The outcome of these wars , the future of their lands – is that not their business , and not ours ?
The Muslims stayed out of our Thirty Years ’ War .
Perhaps we would do well to get out of theirs .
But as long as we take sides in their wars , those we fight and kill over there will come to kill us over here .
This is payback for our intervention .
This is the price of empire .
This is the cost of the long war .

On Friday , golfer Tiger Woods held a TV appearance to talk about life after marital problems .
At around 2:30 p.m. , I screen capped some of the websites for some of the largest news organizations and aggregators .
Today , I looked at the screen - caps , cropped them to the top 1600 pixels , and marked in green the areas of the pages devoted to Woods coverage ( or related coverage , such as “ Slideshow : Top 10 Adultery Confessions ) .
It was a slow news day .
Any controversial government news is usually released in the late afternoon ( This time , it was the Dept. of Justice ’s decision to not punish Bush administration lawyers for their memos on “ enhanced ” interrogation ) .
The other top American news that day were follow - ups on Joe Stack , the man who crashed his plane into the IRS , the Winter Olympics , and devlopments in the Afghanistan war .
Still , it ’s interesting to see what the non-Tiger - watching organizations put on their front pages .
Click on the images below to see a larger version .
Even three hours after what was generally considered a highly - scripted 15 minutes of non-revelations ( the Golf Writers Association of America boycotted it ) , Woods pretty much dominated the most visible spaces on general news websites .
Of the major American news organizations , CNN probably had the most real estate devoted to Tiger ; New York Times , the least .
Both Drudge Report and Huffington Post had Woods as the lede .
Asian publications ( the few that I could read ) gave little space .
Among social / computerized news aggregators , Google News gave Woods front placement … unsurprising considering its algorithm is driven by what news organizations have .
Neither Reddit and Digg had any mention of it in their news sub-sections .
This may be a little unfair , as these sites ’ users may be me more strict in keeping all sports - related news strictly in their sports subsections .
But I did check their frontpages ( which are the top stories from all the major sections ) and Tiger did n’t make an appearance .
Also , for many of the other sites , Tiger stories were not always in the top 5 most read … then , or a day later .
Maybe everyone watched it on TV and decided they did n’t need to read it online ?
Or maybe there ’s an overestimation of the general interest in Tiger news that does n’t involve new mistresses ’ names or him retiring from the sport ?
More About Finland
Finland is the jam .
It came from an exploding egg , the egg of a water bird , the top half of which you can still see in the shape of the starry canopy that hangs over the earth .
Finland is the most sparsely - populated country in the EU with only 5 million people .
It 's also been ranked the second most stable country in the world , after Norway .
Historically , Finland has been a part of Sweden and later , Russia .
It was an autonomous Grand Duchy during the Russian Empire 's reign and lasted as such until their declaration of independence in 1917 .
Subsequently Finland survived a civil war and wars against both Russia and Nazi Germany to eventually settle down as an EU member circa 1955 .
Finnish language is cool , it 's totally unrelated to the whole Latin - root thing .
Its closest relative is Hungarian .
Linguistic historians estimate that it came from northern central Russia from 3000BC .

Text by Steve Smith .
While flipping through a recent issue of Government Security News , I came across this gem :
An ad for DRS Technologies , a manufacturer of military electronics and surveillance equipment .
It 's a full - page come - on for the company 's " competitively priced " line of electro- optical / infrared surveillance cams , the Compact High - Resolution Infrared Long - Wave Imager , a.k.a. CHILI , and the Jalapeno modular imaging system .
Cute , huh ?
As the ad seems to imply , CHILI ( " the choice for border surveillance and force protection applications " ) and Jalapeno ( " high performance in a small package " ) are supposed to be ideal for monitoring the U.S. - Mexico frontier .
Now , defense contractors rarely score points for sensitivity .
But this ad – which features a sepia - toned photo of the border fence , with the menacing tagline " Tourist or terrorist ? " – suggests a marketing department that is willing to push the boundaries of taste .
Que malo , DRS .
Que malo .
Perhaps I 'm reading too much into things : I mean , no one raised much of a fuss about the Army 's plan to dub their next - generation self - propelled howitzer the Crusader , regardless of the message that might have sent to our Middle Eastern allies .
So , some free advice for DRS Technologies :
If you want to market these products to the Mexican government , rethink your acronyms .
Or invent some that make a subtle dig at the Yankees : How about " HOTDOG " or " BIG - GULP ? "
Anyway , if you 've got more examples of awesomely bad advertisements from the military - industrial complex , drop us a line .
We wo n't report you to la policia , we promise .

ARMOR -PIERCING AMMUNITION FOR GUN , 90 - mm , M3 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF ORDNANCE
WASHINGTON , D.C. JANUARY 1945 INTRODUCTION
Various models of the latest enemy Armored Force Vehicles encountered and captured on the battlefield were shipped to the Ordnance Research and Development Center , Aberdeen , Maryland , for tests and examination .
Ballistic tests revealed the need for armor piercing ammunition with greater penetrative power to defeat the thick oblique armor plate being used .
Immediate steps were taken to provide our troops with ammunition for the 90 mm guns which possess the required penetrative ability .
Three armor piercing rounds for the Gun , 90 mm , M3 have been developed and a detailed description of each and comparative penetration performances are presented in this brochure .

Yes , the banana fruit is a berry .
Berries are identified as being many seeded with a fleshy inner layer .
So , technically a banana is a berry .
And , believe it or not , bananas do n't grow on trees !
Originally from Asia , the " banana tree " is really not a tree in the true sense .
In fact , banana plants have no wood fiber .
The banana plant is the world 's largest herb and a member of the lily family .
Big freeze gives rise to rarest frosty phenomenon : a snow pipe
It looks like the work of aliens , late - night pranksters or an as yet undiscovered animal building a nest .
But this strange - looking snow formation has a very natural explanation .
' Snow rolls ' are cylinders of snow found in freezing conditions on open ground and most commonly appear on the prairies of North America .
Also known as snowrollers , snow bales and snow doughnuts , the phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature , ice , snow , moisture and wind .
They are essentially a wintry version of tumbleweed .
Totally natural :
An example of the giant self - rolling snow rolls pictured by dog walker Ron Trevett
Builder Ron Trevett , 55 , and his wife Aileen , 54 , were amazed to find them in a field near their home in Yeovil , Somerset , as they walked their dogs .
' We saw them from a distance on the ridge of the field , and we thought some kids had been playing up there and making giant snowballs , ' said Mr Trevett .
' But when we got up there we saw there were no footprints and there were hundreds of them , too many for children to have done it .
We realised it must have been the wind . '
The couple considered themselves privileged to have had the chance to see them .
' We feel very lucky .
I 'm the wrong side of fifty and I 've never seen anything like it in my life .
Dozens of snow rolls were found scattered across this Somerset field
' We were gobsmacked to look at them there in the sunlight .
It was a really impressive sight and I took some pictures so other people could share it .'
Frank Barrow , a lecturer in meteorology at the Met Office , described the exact science behind the formations and said it was nature 's version of a snowman .
He said : ' They start off with a nice thick layer of snow , with the top snow just on the point of melting either because of general temperature or sunshine on the surface .
' The top snow layer becomes a bit sticky and you then need a fairly strong wind .
The sticky layer can be peeled off the colder and more powdery snow underneath by the wind , forming a roll .
' In the first picture you can see some of the powdery stuff sticking to the lower outside surface of the roll .
I suppose it is a natural version of making a snowman . '
The rolls are not hollow to begin with , as a number of layers build up as the roll gets larger the further it is blown .
However , the inner layers are weaker as they are formed first and are easily blown away .
Eventually the rolls become too big to be blown any further or come to rest against vegetation or at the bottom of a hill .
Liz Bentley , from the Royal Meteorological Society , said despite their rarity more snow rolls could appear in the UK in the coming days .
' These rolls are unusual here because we do n't tend to have major snow events like the one we 're experiencing now .
' They happen with the combination of lying snow and high wind speeds , mostly in North America and Northern Europe , and they can be as small as a tennis ball or they can be as large as two feet across – depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is , ' she said .
' There are quite strong winds predicted this weekend as well as more snow , so if people keep a look out they might see a few more of these appearing around the country over the next few days . '
Most importantly though , this program is both cheap and fast .
At a cost of only $ 860,000 per UAV , and with the technology ready to hit the Afghan skies today , the Marines can get these birds in the air as quickly as possible .
And for the grunts waiting for supplies , driving in those supplies across IED - laden paths , or flying them in through treacherous canyons , a robotic replacement can't arrive soon enough .

TeX line breaking algorithm in JavaScript
This is an implementation of the Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm using JavaScript .
The goal of this project is to optimally set justified text in the browser , and ultimately provide a library for various line breaking algorithms in JavaScript .
The paragraph below is set using a JavaScript implementation of the classic Knuth and Plass algorithm as used in TeX .
The numbers on the right of each line are the stretching or shrinking ratio compared to the optimal line width .
This example uses a default space of 1/3 em , with a stretchability and shrink - ability of 1/6 em and 1/9 em respectively .
The following paragraph is set by a browser using text - align : justify .
Notice the lines in the paragraph have , on average , greater inter-word spacing than the Knuth and Plass version , which is successful at minimizing the inter - word spacing over all lines .
The browser also ends up with ten lines instead of the nine lines found by the Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm .
This comparison might not be completely fair since we do n't know the default inter-word space used by the browser ( nor its stretching and shrinking parameters . )
Experimental results however indicate the values used in most browsers are either identical or very similar .
The next section explains how the ratio values for the browser were calculated .
Measuring the quality of browser line breaks
Unfortunately there is no API to retrieve the positions of the line breaks the browser inserted , so we 'll have to resort to some trickery .
By wrapping each word in an invisible < span > element and retrieving its y position we can find out when a new line starts .
If the y position of the current word is different from the previous word we know a new line has started .
This way a paragraph is split up in several individual lines .
The ratios are then calculated by measuring the difference between the width of each line when text - align is set to justify and when it is set to left .
This difference is then divided by the amount of stretchability of the line : i.e. the number of spaces multiplied by the stretch width for spaces .
Although we do n't know the actual stretchability we can use 1/6 em , just like the Knuth and Plass algorithm , if we only use it for comparison .
Assisted browser line breaks
The line breaking algorithm can also be used to correct the line breaks made by the browser .
The easiest way to do is to split a text up into lines and adjust the CSS word - spacing property .
Unfortunately , Webkit based browsers do not support sub - pixel word - spacing .
Alternatively , we can absolute position each word or split the line into segmants with integer word spacing .
You can see the latter approach in action on the Flatland line breaking example .
Examples
The line breaking algorithm is not only capable of justifying text , it can perform all sorts of alignment with an appropriate selection of boxes , glue and penalties .
It is also possible to give it varying line widths to flow text around illustrations , asides or quotes .
Alternatively , varying line widths can be used to create interesting text shapes as demonstrated below .
Ragged right and centered alignment
The following example is set ragged right .
Ragged right is not simply justified text with fixed width inter-word spacing .
Instead the algorithm tries to minimize the amount of white space at the end of each sentence over the whole paragraph .
It also attempts to reduce the number of words that are " sticking out " of the margin .
Ragged left text can be achieved by using a ragged right text and aligning its line endings with the left border .
The example below is set centered .
Again this is not simply a centering of justified text , but instead an attempt at minimizing the line lengths over the whole paragraph .
Variable line width
By varying the line width for a paragraph it is possible to flow the text around illustrations , asides , quotes and such .
The example below leaves a gap for an illustration by setting the line widths temporarily shorter and then reverting .
You can also see that the algorithm chose to hyphenate certain words to achieve acceptable line breaking .
It is also possible to make some non-rectangular shapes , as shown in the examples below .
In the first example , the text is laid out using an increasing line width and center aligning each line .
This creates a triangular shape .
Using some basic math it is also possible to set text in circles or even arbitrary polygons .
Below is an example of text set inside a circle .
The following are some extensions to the algorithm discussed in the original paper , which I intend to implement ( at some point . )
Hanging punctuation .
The following quote from the original paper explains how to implement it using the box , glue and penalty model :
Some people prefer to have the right edge of their text look ‘ solid ’ , by setting periods , commas , and other punctuation marks ( including inserted hyphens ) in the right - hand margin .
For example , this practice is occasionally used in contemporary advertising .
It is easy to get inserted hyphens into the margin :
We simply let the width of the corresponding penalty item be zero .
And it is almost as easy to do the same for periods and other symbols , by putting every such character in a box of width zero and adding the actual symbol width to the glue that follows .
If no break occurs at this glue , the accumulated width is the same as before ; and if a break does occur , the line will be justified as if the period or other symbol were not present .
Compare quality against line - breaking implemented by Internet Explorer 's text - justify CSS property .
Figure out how to deal with dynamic paragraphs ( i.e. paragraphs being edited ) as their ratios will change during editing and thus visibly move around .

These are the resources I found most useful while implementing the line breaking algorithm .
25nm NAND Is Here
IM Flash Technologies is a joint venture between Intel and Micron that is targeted for producing NAND flash memory .
With a focus on research and development , IMFT has doubled NAND density approximately every 18 months .
In 2006 , they started production with a 50nm process , then moved to a 40nm process in 2008 .
This co-development inevitably lead to smaller , more affordable NAND flash - based products featuring higher capacities , much like we have witnessed in the SSD market and with USB flash drives over the past couple of years .
February 1 , 2010 will mark the official announcement of IMFT 's 25 nanometer NAND technology - - a major advancement for the company .
Intel and Micron now lay claim to the smallest production ready semiconductor process technology in the world .
The companies describe their collective efforts as such ...
“ Through our continued investment in IMFT , we ’re delivering leadership technology and manufacturing that enable the most cost - effective and reliable NAND memory , ” said Tom Rampone , vice president and general manager , Intel NAND Solutions Group .
“ This will help speed the adoption of solid - state drive solutions for computing . ”
“ To lead the entire semiconductor industry with the most advanced process technology is a phenomenal feat for Intel and Micron , and we look forward to further pushing the scaling limits , ” said Brian Shirley , vice president of Micron ’s memory group .
“ This production technology will enable significant benefits to our customers through higher density media solutions .

25 nm Wafer
So what does this mean for consumers ?
Basically , the shrink to 25nm reduces the dies size of the NAND flash chips , which enables higher densities , and hence the chip count within products can be reduced by up to 50 % when compared to the previous process generation .
It allows for smaller , yet higher density designs at lower costs .
For example , a particular SSD may be able to be produced using only 16 chips versus 32 .
Solid State Drives will feature larger maximum capacities while prices of current options will be driven further down .
We were told to expect performance to be on par with 34nm products , though there are the obvious intrinsic benefits of a die geometry shrink from a performance standpoint .
8 GB MLC NAND Device - 167mm²
Of course , there will be a number of products based on this technology over time .
The first one will be the industry 's first monolithic 8 GB NAND device .
At a die size of 167 mm² , it is twice the capacity of their highest density 34nm part in roughly the same footprint .
It is
small enough to fit through the hole in the middle of a compact disc , but is able to store more than 10 times the data capacity of a CD .
In roughly the same real estate , SSD makers will now be able to provide double the capacity as the previous generation .
IMFT is on track to begin production of this device and expects to start shipping in the second quarter of this year .
Consumers can expect products featuring 25nm flash memory towards the end of 2010 .
In the search for yet - undiscovered pulsars or ultra - fast spinning neutron stars , a grand - scale sky survey at the Cornell - managed Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is now taking advantage of the combined processing power of personal computers around the world .
The PALFA Survey , a sky survey using the Arecibo L - band Feed Array ( ALFA ) -- a system of detectors with seven feeds that enables researchers to image large swaths of sky -- has joined forces with Einstein@Home , an effort based at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee ( UWM ) .
Einstein@Home involves more than 200,000 people worldwide who donate time on their computers to search for gravitational waves from unknown pulsars .
Using new methods developed at the Albert Einstein Institute ( AEI ) in Hannover , Germany , Einstein@Home will search for radio pulsars that are part of binary star systems with orbital periods as short as 15 minutes .
Conventional searches for radio pulsars lose sensitivity if the pulsars are in orbits shorter than about one hour .
But the enormous computational capabilities of the Einstein@Home project -- equivalent to a cluster of more than 50,000 computers -- make it possible to search for pulsars in binary systems with significantly shorter periods .
" Discovery of a pulsar orbiting a neutron star or black hole , with a sub - hour orbital period , would provide tremendous opportunities to test general relativity and to estimate how often such binaries merge , " said Jim Cordes , professor of astronomy at Cornell and chair of the Arecibo PALFA Consortium .
Einstein@Home participants will automatically receive work for both the radio and gravitational - wave searches .
" We hope to discover at least a few new radio pulsars per year , " said Bruce Allen , director of AEI .
" We expect that most of the project 's participants will be eager to do both types of searches . "
" Combining the sensitivity of the world 's largest radio telescope with the distributed computing capabilities of Einstein@Home creates a powerful partnership for discovery , " added Dana Lehr , program manager for the Division of Astronomical Sciences at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
Cornell 's National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center manages Arecibo for the NSF .
All data for PALFA , which began in 2004 and is one of three ongoing sky surveys using the ALFA receiver , are archived and dispensed by the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing .
" The Einstein@Home computing resources are a perfect complement to the data management systems at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing and the other PALFA institutions , " Cordes said .
Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 as a consequence of his general theory of relativity but have never been directly detected .
Radio pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit a lighthouse - like beam of radio waves that sweeps past the Earth as frequently as 600 times per second .
Radio pulsars in short - period binary systems are especially interesting because the effects of general relativity can be very strong .
The discovery of new pulsars in short - period binaries would also improve estimates of the rates at which binary star systems form and disappear in our galaxy as well as provide new targets to search for gravitational waves .
The large data sets from the survey are archived and processed initially at Cornell and other PALFA institutions .
For the Einstein@Home project , data are sent to AEI via high - speed network , preprocessed and then distributed to volunteers around the world .
The results are returned to AEI , Cornell and UWM for further investigation .
The Arecibo Observatory is the largest single - aperture radio telescope on the planet and is used for studies of pulsars , galaxies , solar system objects and the Earth 's atmosphere .
The NSF supports the work through grants to Einstein@Home ; to PALFA ; and through a cooperative agreement with Cornell to operate the Arecibo Observatory .
BBC must not become an evangelical wing of the Church of England
Church of England claims that the BBC is sidelining religious broadcasting are untrue and self - serving , says the National Secular Society .
Responding to accusations at the Church of England ’s General Synod that the BBC is not committed to religious programming , the NSS pointed out that the amount of programming in this genre was larger than that to which the Corporation had committed itself .
Research also shows that that religious programmes on TV are the least watched and least valued .
In the 2005 Ofcom report into Public Service Broadcasting viewers were asked what types of programming they most valued on the terrestrial channels .
Religion came 16th out of 17 .
In that same report , people were asked to rank what programme genres people thought of as having societal importance .
Religion again came 16th out of 17 .
The BBC annual report revealed that the amount of religion broadcast on BBC1 TV during the period covered by the report was 105 hours – 25 hours more than had been committed to .
This was part of a commitment of 112 hours together with BBC2 .
BBC 3 promised 5 hours and delivered two .
BBC 4 was committed to 15 hours and delivered 36 .
Radio 4 had committed to 200 hours of religious programming , but had in the end , unsurprisingly , delivered 223 hours .
This did not take into account the large amount of religious input into programmes such as Today , Woman ’s Hour , You and Yours and other current affairs programmes .
Radio 2 promised 170 hours of religion and delivered 186 .
Overall , the amount of religion broadcast on BBC radio rose from 1,078 hours in 2006 / 7 period to 1,114 in the 2007 / 8 period .
Only four per cent of viewers in a trial of High Definition Television ( HD ) would opt to watch religious programmes , a study carried out on Freeview in 2006 found .
Of all the programme categories that the 450 trial viewers would most want to watch in HD , religion comes last – by a very large margin .
“ News ” came top with 84 percent and “ Sport ” second with 80 percent , while religion came limping home at 4 percent .
Viewers would even prefer watching educational programmes rather than religious ones by a factor of almost four - to - one .
Ofcom research into viewing habits published in April 2008 asked the question : “ Which of the following types of programmes , if any , would you say you watch regularly on the main TV channels ? ”
News was first at 70 % , while religion was last with 6 % .
The same report asked “ Which five programme types are most important to you ? ” Religion scored 5 % .
Research from the Human Capital consultancy showed that in homes that have access to Sky Television , religious programmes broadcast by terrestrial channels suffer an audience fall - off of 84 % .
Our detractors point to minor reductions in religious coverage from twenty years ago but deliberately overlook the fact that over the last two decades , Mass attendance has halved , and Anglican normal Sunday attendance has dropped by 38 % .
Terry Sanderson , President of the National Secular Society , said : “ It is clear from this research that religious programmes are not popular and not valued .
It is important that the BBC is not bullied into becoming an evangelical tool for the Church of England while ignoring the clearly expressed wishes of the licence - payer . ”
Mr Sanderson said that while he accepted that the BBC had a public service remit to serve the whole community and that some religion on TV was legitimate ; it should be kept in proportion .
“ Very few people go to church and religion is now very much a minority interest .
Its presence on TV should reflect that .
The BBC pours far too much of its resources into satisfying these religious demands , ” he commented .
MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT :
The professor ’s amazing climate change retreat
Data : Professor Phil Jones admitted his record keeping is ' not as good as it should be '
Untold billions of pounds have been spent on turning the world green and also on financing the dubious trade in carbon credits .
Countless gallons of aviation fuel have been consumed carrying experts , lobbyists and politicians to apocalyptic conferences on global warming .
Every government on Earth has changed its policy , hundreds of academic institutions , entire school curricula and the priorities of broadcasters and newspapers all over the world have been altered – all to serve the new doctrine that man is overheating the planet and must undertake heroic and costly changes to save the world from drowning as the icecaps melt .
You might have thought that all this was based upon well - founded , highly competent research and that those involved had good reason for their blazing , hot - eyed certainty and their fierce intolerance of dissent .
But , thanks to the row over leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit , we now learn that this body ’s director , Phil Jones , works in a disorganised fashion amid chaos and mess .
Interviewed by the highly sympathetic BBC , which still insists on describing the leaked emails as ‘ stolen ’ , Professor Jones has conceded that he ‘ did not do a thorough job ’ of keeping track of his own records .
His colleagues recall that his office was ‘ often surrounded by jumbled piles of papers ’ .
Even more strikingly , he also sounds much less ebullient about the basic theory , admitting that there is little difference between global warming rates in the Nineties and in two previous periods since 1860 and accepting that from 1995 to now there has been no statistically significant warming .
He also leaves open the possibility , long resisted by climate change activists , that the ‘ Medieval Warm Period ’ from 800 to 1300 AD , and thought by many experts to be warmer than the present period , could have encompassed the entire globe .
This is an amazing retreat , since if it was both global and warmer , the green movement ’s argument that our current position is ‘ unprecedented ’ would collapse .
It is quite reasonable to suggest that human activity may have had some effect on climate .
There is no doubt that careless and greedy exploitation has done much damage to the planet .
But in the light of the ‘ Climategate ’ revelations , it is time for governments , academics and their media cheerleaders to be more modest in their claims and to treat sceptics with far more courtesy .
The question is not settled .
' Supertaxes ' always fail
The Treasury appears to have waved goodbye to large sums of money it could have collected in tax from the super - rich , thanks to a poorly designed attempt to help the film industry .
Compare and contrast this laxity with the inescapable tax burden on ordinary people whose income is taxed at source and who are pursued with severity for every penny .
This sort of inequality is the direct result of ever more ‘ creative ’ attempts to use the tax system for social engineering .
As HM Revenue and Customs will find when the new 50 pence tax rate is imposed in April , higher rates stimulate the rich into ever more ingenious efforts to avoid paying up .
Taxes should be simple , low and fair .
Then everyone will pay them .

The prominent Egypt blogger Wael Abbas has been sentenced 6 months in jail and LE 500 pounds ( 92 USD ) as a judiciary bail , as a lawsuit was filed against him by a citizen and his police officer brother on charges of damaging an internet cable !
Wael was ruled in absentia last November .
The Arab Network for Human Rights , who has been offering the legal support for Al - Wa 'I Al - Masri editor , Wael Abbas , clarifies in a statement that the man who filled this lawsuit , was the same doer of another violation against the blogger :
Officer Aglan , of Cairo tourist police force , and his brother Ahmed Aglan raided Wael Abbas house and beat him up leading to several injuries on his body and a broken tooth .
The officer abused his connections such that his brother would report Wael for damaging the brother ’s internet cable
The public prosecutor has filed the complaint submitted by Wael Abbas in April 2009 after he had been physically assaulted by a police officer and his brother .
The complaint was concluded allegedly for insufficient evidence despite the presence of three medical reports including a forensic record of injuries and despite that one of Wael ’s teeth got broken .
Ta3beer ( Expression )
Blog reveals more informations about other harassments Wael Abbas has faced :
Until some months ago , Abbas had generally been left to operate with limited interference or intimidation from authorities .
However , he has been subjected to steadily increasing curtailment as he faced annoyances every time he entered or left Egypt
As Abbas was receiving this bad news ; Amnesty international called for the immediate and unconditional release of blogger Hani Nazeer , a prisoner of conscience .
Nazeer , a Coptic Christian and blogger from Qina ( Upper Egypt ) has been detained since October 2008 , This was after residents of Qina denounced him for posting on his blog the cover of a book they deemed insulting to Muslims .
AI called on the Ministry of Interior to release Nazir , and condemned his administrative detention :
Amnesty International urges the Interior Minister to respect the court decision to release Hani Nazeer and to immediately order the release from administrative detention of all those who are detained under the Emergency Law for whom release orders have been issued by the court .
The Minister should also stop misusing emergency powers to curb the right to freedom of expression
It is expected that Hani Nazeer will remain in Borg al - Arab Prison until a new administrative detention order is issued against him , as has been the case since his arrest in late 2008 .

On Saturday , Jon Chait warned that a storm is coming :
[ Conservatives ’ ] mustache - twirling bonhomie has started to give way to the realization that the legislative door to health care reform is wide open , and Democrats simply need to walk through it .
By no means is it clear that they ’ll succeed .
But I ’ve been waiting for conservatives , filled with hubris at having swept liberalism into the dustbin of history , to wake up to the fact that health care reform is very far from dead , and start to freak out … .
You can imagine how this feels to conservatives .
They ’ve already run off the field , sprayed themselves with champagne and taunted the losing team ’s fans .
And now the other team is saying the game is still on and they have a good chance to win .
There may be nothing wrong at all with the process , but it ’s certainly going to feel like some kind of crime to the right - wing .
The Democrats may not win , but I ’m pretty sure they ’re going to try .
The conservative freakout is going to be something to behold .
Chait is basically saying that health care reform is “ The Play . ” Conservatives are the Stanford band , and health care reform supporters are the Cal Golden Bears .
Behold :
Democrats are n’t really any closer to finishing health care reform than they were on Friday , but I ’m already starting to see some major freakouts .
One example is an email from one of the conservative email lists I ’m on , entitled “ Obama Planning to Push Through Gov’t Healthcare TODAY ” :
ALERT : Did you think that , because Barack Hussein Obama has called for a “ bipartisan healthcare reform summit ” on Feb.
25th , that the Democrats were serious about starting over and including the Republicans ’ ideas in their plans ?
WRONG !
According to liberal bastion The New York Times , “ President Obama will put forward comprehensive health care legislation intended to bridge differences between Senate and House Democrats ahead of a summit meeting with Republicans next week , senior administration officials and Congressional aides said Thursday . ”
But that ’s not all they ’re reporting : Democratic officials said the president ’s proposal was being written so that it could be attached to a budget bill as a way of averting a Republican filibuster in the Senate .
The procedure , known as budget reconciliation , would let Democrats advance the bill with a simple majority rather than a 60 - vote supermajority .
So , in other words , Obama is LYING about compromising on his healthcare plans , and Reid and Pelosi are preparing to use a parliamentary trick to ram ObamaCare down the throats of the American people ! [… ]
Here ’s the “ trick ” that Obama , Pelosi and Reid are planning to use to ram ObamaCare through : it ’s called “ reconciliation ” .
As the Wall Street Journal explains , “ House Democrats would pass a series of ‘ fixes ’ to the Senate bill .
The Senate would then pass the House reconciliation bill , sending amendments to President Obama to a bill that — strictly speaking — did n’t exist , because it had n’t yet emerged from the House .
The House would then retroactively pass the Senate bill as is . ”
So by using the “ reconciliation ” process , the Senate will only need 51 votes to pass their socialized healthcare bill !
Never mind that reconciling differences between House and Senate bills is what the reconciliation process is for .
Never mind that it ’s been used repeatedly to pass major legislation — including crucial health care reforms like the State Childrens ’ Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) and COBRA ( the R stands for “ reconciliation ) .
Conservatives are convinced that passing legislation by majority vote is bad .
( Sen. John Barrasso , R - Wy. , thinks you should need 70 or 80 votes in the Senate to pass health care reform . )
So they ’re freaking out about it .
Canada is a country with heavenly natural beauty , stunning landscapes and untouched reserves .
Many parts of Canada are known as unexplored , lonely wilderness , and flora and fauna of the country should be stunningly diverse .
Canada consists largely of vastness uninhabited and unspoiled natural landscape and is large enough to reveal a distance measurement in kilometers as inappropriate – latitude and longitude are used more frequently .
About one tenth of the land area of Canada is unaffected and not inhabited .
But that does not mean that the person has left no trace in these regions .
Environmental problems also arise without dense population .
The colder regions near the Arctic are sensitive far to interventions in natural processes .
Since the consequences of thoughtless consumption in Canada are often visible in the distance of densely populated areas that Canadians have comparatively late developed an awareness of environmental protection .
The country lies with its carbon footprint only in midfield , the carbon dioxide emissions per capita is one of the world ’s highest .
Critical to the nature of Canada ’s wood consumption in the country .
While there are still uncontaminated forests in Canada , but which are too far away from the settlement areas , as they could be used sustainably .
Instead , settlement near forests are exploited and planted in fast - track procedure , animals can not be there to settle , other plants have no chance .
The rainforests in western Canada are also threatened .
In the area covered by ice regions in the north of the country , other factors play a role : the extraction of oil and gas takes only limited consideration to the habitats of polar bears , seals and whales .
Kanad owns more than 40 national parks , and because conservation is a top priority .
The parks are excellently maintained and attract tourists from all over the world .
However , many of them are very far apart , corridors between the parks are still missing but the program is on the expansion .
This piece was originally published on the Blowfish Blog .
In my last Blowfish column , I linked you to Scarleteen , the sex information website for teenagers .
When I was at the site , I found this letter , " We waited for marriage ... but it was n't worth the wait " .
It completely broke my heart , and I had to write about it .
The gist , for those who do n't have the patience to link :
The couple in question ( not teenagers , late twenties in fact ) had decided for religious reasons to abstain from intercourse until after they got married .
The woman had a high libido , and had been very excited about being able to have sex whenever -- and wherever , and however -- they wanted .
But the marriage was a big disappointment sexually .
Their sex life was less frequent by far than the woman wanted ... and more seriously , it was intensely unsatisfying .
Their sexual encounters lacked passion , spontaneity , and fun , and were depressingly brief .
Hubby eventually admitted that he just is n't that sexual a person ... to which wifey , the person writing the letter , was responding , not unreasonably , " You could n't have told me that before we got married ? "
It broke my heart .
Especially since their religious beliefs , and religious community , will probably make them feel pressured into sticking with the marriage , even if they both decide it 's an unsalvageable failure .
There are so many directions I could go with this .
I could talk about the ridiculous over - emphasis our society places on marriage : the absurdly high expectations we place on it , the idealistic glow we place around it , the assumption that it will magically transform everything , including and especially sex .
( And that 's speaking as someone who is herself married -- ritually , if not legally -- and who does think that her marriage has changed both the relationship and the sex for the better . )
And of course , I could get on my atheist high horse , and talk about the fucked - up effect religion so often has on sexual happiness .
That would certainly be a fruitful direction .
Of all the dreadful sources of sexual misinformation and general bad sex advice in the world , religion has to take the cake -- because it can't be argued with .
It is n't based on evidence , it 's based on scripture and religious authority and personal faith ... and it's therefore singularly resistant to change , to adaptation in response to evidence or data .
About sex , or anything else .
But I want to go in a different direction here .
I want to express my gratitude for the fact that I -- and most of us -- do n't live in that world anymore .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , having sex with someone , lots of times , before you settle down with them for the long haul , is generally considered , not only normal and acceptable , but sensible , obvious , and even self - evident .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , premarital sex , never - marital sex , multiple sexual relationships , living together before marriage , living together without ever getting married , and so on , are all commonplace and generally accepted in much of the country , and indeed much of the world .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , masturbation and oral sex are generally considered normal , mainstream , not even all that interesting ... and things like anal sex , spanking , and bondage are generally seen as mildly kinky thrills at most , somewhat outre but really not all that wild compared to all the other freaky stuff people are up to .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , birth control is widely and easily available , and even advertised on national TV .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , sex toys , sexual information , and sexual entertainment are widely and anonymously available , and even joked about in sitcoms .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , gay sex is no longer a crime anywhere in my country ... and gay relationships have a fair amount of social and legal recognition in large parts of the country and the world .
Even divorce .
Unhappy as it is , I 'm grateful for divorce .
I 'm grateful that unhappy marriages that do n't work for anybody can be ended , without bringing ruin and disgrace to the couple and their family .
I want to express my gratitude that in my world , it was relatively easy , and almost entirely unstigmatized , for me to get out of a marriage to a guy who was decent but a disastrous choice for me ... so I could spend some time getting my shit together before I settled down with a partner who it actually made sense for me to settle down with .
It 's easy to take all this for granted .
It 's easy to forget how different things were in my parents generation ... and how radically different they were in my grandparents ' .
It 's not like things are perfect now .
Trust me , I get that .
We have , among other things , a world with a glut of sexual imagery and a relative dearth of sexual information .
We have a world in which there 's a lot of pressure to be an amazing sexual performer ... at an increasingly young age .
We have a world in which the mere mention of the word " penis " can be effectively used in the movies to generate enormous laffs .
We have a world that 's still fairly uncomfortable with sex , and that often does n't know how to deal with it .
What 's more , we have a world where even these basic sexual freedoms and privileges are limited to very specific people and regions .
Large numbers of people and extensive regions , but still very specific .
We have a world where , in large parts of it , gay people are still being put in prison , and women are still being executed for adultery .
And of course , we have a world filled with plenty of people who are working like crazy to turn back the clock to the good old days ... the days of sexual ignorance and secrecy and shame .
But things are better now .
A lot better .
We 're beginning , I think , to see sex as a normal part of a happy life ... and to see sexual experimentation , with different partners and different kinds of sex , as a natural and sensible way to figure out who you are and what you like and whether you and your honey are compatible .
And I 'm never reminded of that more vividly than when I hear about people who still live , for all intents and purposes , in the old world , the world of my parents and grandparents ... and who are being made miserable by it .
Mr Mabhouh , a senior figure in the military wing of Hamas , was found dead in a hotel room on Jan 20 .
According to one report he was killed by a female assassin who entered his room by posing as a member of hotel staff , injected him with a drug that induced a heart attack and hung a “ Do Not Disturb ” sign on the door .
The boys of Xalisco , Mexico have built a heroin business that now spans the US .
What makes it interesting are the loose network dynamics that drive its growth ( from Sam Quinones writing for the LATimes ) :
In contrast to Mexico 's big cartels -- violent , top - down organizations that mainly enrich a small group -- the Xalisco networks are small , decentralized businesses .
Each is run by an entrepreneur whose workers may soon strike out on their own and become his competitors .
They have no all - powerful leader and rarely use guns , according to narcotics investigators and imprisoned former dealers .
This decentralized organizational structure has allowed the businesses to focus on other forms of competition : customer service and price .
Their success stems from both their product , which is cheaper and more potent than Colombian heroin , and their business model , which places a premium on customer convenience and satisfaction .
Users need not venture into dangerous neighborhoods for their fix .
Instead , they phone in their orders and drivers take the drug to them .
Crew bosses sometimes call users after a delivery to check on the quality of service .
They encourage users to bring in new customers , rewarding them with free heroin if they do .
The county consists of the town of Xalisco and 20 villages with a total population of 44,000 -- about the size of Los Angeles ' Silver Lake neighborhood .
Landless sugar - cane workers , eager to grasp their version of the American Dream , provide a virtually endless supply of labor for the heroin networks , one reason the system has proved so hard to eradicate .... one reason the system did not evolve into a cartel controlled by one person or family is that Xalisco County is made up of ranchos , small villages famous for their independent spirit and intense rivalries .
" We 're real envious of each other .
Families cannot work together , " he said .
One potential reason why it remains decentralized is due to the community from which it originated :
In short , while there is intense competition , it 's limited to business operations .
Since everyone knows each other , violence is n't a default option .
Further , due to these social connections , drivers are paid very well at $ 1,000 a week ( plus expenses ) .
The high pay for line workers likely allowed them to save enough to start their own businesses , which in turn drives the expansion of the aggregate network .
Another big driver is the high levels of innovation due to an open source sharing of techniques :

The concentration of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) in the atmosphere is already so high that the climate system has been brought out of balance .
The CO2 concentration and global temperatures have increased more rapidly in the last 50 years than ever before on Earth , and will rise even faster in the coming decades .
This adds to a multitude of other serious ecological imbalances , the impacts of which threaten the lives and livelihoods of the people of the world , most acutely , impoverished people and other vulnerable groups .
The imbalance of the climate system leads to greater and more frequent extremes of heat and rainfall patterns , tropical cyclones , hurricanes and typhoons , extreme flooding and droughts , loss of biodiversity , landslides , rising sea levels , shortage of drinking water , shorter growing seasons , lower yields , lost or deteriorated agricultural land , decreased agricultural production , losses of livestock , extinction of ecosystems , and diminished fish stocks , among others .
These phenomena result in food crises , famine , illness , death , displacement , and the extinction of sustainable ways of life .
-- People ’s Declaration from Klimaforum09
January 2010 --
In response to this , the United Nations agreed to hold a Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP15 ) , which met in Copenhagen December 7 - 18 to draft a treaty for the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming .
The meeting ended without any agreement since the countries primarily responsible for global warming — led by the United States , which , with only 4 per cent of the world ’s population , produces 25 per cent of the pollution due to carbon dioxide emissions — were unwilling to commit themselves to even the least reduction in that pollution .
At the last minute , after the official meeting had broken up , US President Barack Obama met with some accomplices and got them to sign , without discussion , a paper expressing “ every intention ” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but without any binding commitments , and promising “ to help ” the major victims of warming , basically in Africa and other poor countries , but again without establishing any amounts or enforcement mechanisms .
Simply expressions of good intentions without any commitment .
Despite the failure of the official meeting , Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales stated : “ They say it was a failure , but I would not say that the Copenhagen summit has failed , but rather that it is a triumph for the entire world ... because the developed capitalist countries could not impose their statement . ”
We fully agree with him .
It was different from the Kyoto meeting which set ridiculous goals that the US and other major culprits did not sign and did not fulfill — which made environmental protection a commodity , but nevertheless gave hope to people that something was being done .
In Copenhagen , fortunately , the failure of the official meeting was completely clear .
This awakened many who still had the illusion that within the capitalist system it is possible to stop global warming , that the world ’s major predators can act in defence of the survival of the human species .
Copenhagen brought together not only official representatives .
In the international demonstration on Saturday , December 12 , there were 100,000 people concerned about climate change .
The meeting was preceded by massive demonstrations in England and other countries .
An organisation was formed , “ Change the system , not the climate ” , and it issued the “ People ’s Declaration in Klimaforum09 ” .
In the meeting of the presidents , Venezuela ’s Hugo Chávez repeated two slogans raised by the people in the streets : “ Change the system , not the climate ” and “ If the climate were a bank they would have saved it by now . ”
Evo Morales reported that when he went to speak they evacuated the room so that only the official leaders heard him .
He posed five questions on climate change that the United Nations should put to the world ’s peoples in a global referendum , asking that they answer yes or no , " That will leave the decision in the hands of the peoples of the world . ”
( The United Nations will hold no such referendum , of course . )
1 . Do you agree with re-establishing harmony with nature while recognising the rights of Mother Earth ?
2 . Do you agree with changing this model of over - consumption and waste that the capitalist system represents ?
3 . Do you agree that developed countries should reduce and re-absorb their domestic greenhouse gas emissions so that the temperature does not rise more than 1 degree Celsius ?
4 . Do you agree with transferring everything spent on wars to protecting the planet and allocating a budget for climate change that is bigger than what is used for defence ?
5 . Do you agree with establishing a Climate Justice Tribunal to judge those who destroy Mother Earth ?
Morales has also issued a call for the “ Peoples ’ Summit on Climate Change ” in defence of humanity , life and the planet .
Those invited will be not only the presidents of interested countries concerned about the issue , but experts , academics and representatives of the social organisations .
“ The goal is to achieve a consensus position to be raised at the next Summit on Climate Change to be held in Mexico in December 2010 . ”
The People ’s Summit will be held in Cochabamba , Bolivia April 20 - 22 , coinciding with the first worldwide celebration of Mother Earth Day recently instituted by the United Nations .
It is naive to think that the world ’s major polluters will do anything about climate protection .
Large multinational companies are the ones who govern the world through the “ leaders ” who are nothing more than their servants .
Their neoliberal religion commands them to make as much money as possible in the shortest time possible .
They know very well that to do this they must destroy nature .
They know very well that they will have no descendants , but they do not care .
Through their media they spread the most possible disinformation about global warming and the appropriate steps to be taken .
Evo is right when he says :
They only deal with the effects and not the causes of climate change .
Climate change is a product of the capitalist system , which favours the pursuit of the maximum possible profit .
That is the purpose of the capitalist system , with no consideration for the lives of others .
In Copenhagen we should analyse which countries are doing the most damage to the environment and , with that in mind , focus on the need for those countries with the greatest responsibility to pay for this debt to the global climate .
That is an obligation ...
The Copenhagen summit is much more global in nature , it is a debate about life , about humanity .
Here we have profound differences with capitalist governments .
I remain convinced that capitalism is the worst enemy of humanity .
We might still be able to ensure the survival of the species .
We have cause for optimism in the meeting of 100,000 people in Copenhagen , the formation of the organisation “ Change the system , not the climate ” , the call for the meeting in Cochabamba , the violent impact on the rich countries of Europe of the freezing temperatures in recent days .
Apparently we Indigenous peoples , who for centuries have been struggling and dying in defence of Mother Earth and the defence of our collectivist solidarity , will no longer be alone .
Only the extinction of capitalism will ensure the survival of our species , and the sooner the world understands this the better .

Reunión sobre cambio climático Copenhague
Hugo Blanco
La concentración de gases de efecto invernadero en la atmósfera ha alcanzado niveles tan altos que el sistema climático se ha desequilibrado .
La concentración de dióxido de carbono ( CO2 ) y la temperatura del mundo han aumentado aceleradamente en los últimos 50 años y subirán aun más rápido en las próximas décadas .
Esto se suma a multitud de desequilibrios ecológicos , cuyo impacto pone en peligro las vidas y medios de subsistencia de los pueblos del mundo , y en particular de las personas desfavorecidas y otros grupos vulnerables . ”
El desequilibrio del sistema climático da lugar a episodios extremos más acusados y frecuentes de calor y lluvias , ciclones tropicales , huracanes y tifones , inundaciones y sequías intensas , pérdida de biodiversidad , corrimientos de tierras , aumento del nivel del mar , escasez de agua potable , periodos vegetativos mas cortos , menor rendimiento , deterioro o pérdida de tierras agrícolas , menor producción agrícola , pérdidas de ganado , extinción de ecosistemas y agotamiento de los caladeros , entre otros .
Estos fenómenos dan lugar a crisis alimentarias , hambruna , enfermedades , muertes y desplazamientos , así como a la desaparición de formas de vida sostenibles .

Declaración de los pueblos en Klimaforum09
Enero de 2010 -- Frente a esto las Naciones Unidas acordaron realizar una Convención Marco sobre Cambio Climático ( COP 15 ) , que se desarrolló del 7 al 18 de diciembre en Copenhague con el objeto de diseñar un tratado para la reducción de las emisiones de gases de invernadero , causantes del recalentamiento planetario .
Dicha reunión fracasó , no se llegó a ningún acuerdo , pues los países que más culpables son por el calentamiento ( Estados Unidos aunque solamente representa el 4 % de la población mundial , produce el 25 % de la contaminación por emisión de dióxido de carbono ) no quisieron comprometerse a reducir ni un ápice de la contaminación .
A última hora , luego del fracaso de la reunión oficial , Obama se reunió con algunos cómplices y les hizo firmar un papel , sin discusión , donde se manifestaba “ buenos deseos ” de reducir la emisión de gases de invernadero pero sin fijarse ninguna meta , también prometieron “ ayudar ” a las principales víctimas del calentamiento , fundamentalmente de África y otros países pobres , pero también sin fijar cantidades ni ejecutores .
Sólo expresiones de buenos deseos sin compromiso alguno .
A pesar del fracaso de la reunión oficial , Evo Morales dijo :
“ Se dice que fue un fracaso , pero yo diría que no ha sido un fracaso la cumbre de Copenhague , más bien diría que es un triunfo de todo el mundo ( … ) porque los países capitalistas desarrollados no pudieron imponer su declaración ” .
Coincidimos plenamente con él .
Fue diferente a la reunión de Kyoto que fijó metas ridículas que no firmaron EEUU ni otros grandes culpables , que no se cumplieron , que convirtió la defensa del medio ambiente en mercancía , pero que a pesar de eso dio esperanzas a la gente de que algo se estaba haciendo En Copenhague afortunadamente fue completamente claro el fracaso de la reunión oficial .
Esto despertó a muchos que todavía tenían la ilusión de que dentro del sistema capitalista es posible detener el calentamiento global , de que los grandes depredadores del mundo pueden actuar en defensa de la supervivencia de la especie humana .
Copenhague no reunió sólo a mandatarios , en la manifestación internacional del sábado 12 de diciembre hubo 100.000 personas preocupadas por el cambio climático .
La reunión fue precedida por manifestaciones masivas en Inglaterra y otros países .
Se conformó la organización “ Cambiemos el sistema , no el clima ” que emitió la “ Declaración de los pueblos en Klimaforum09 ” .
Hugo Chávez repitió en la reunión de presidentes dos consignas que pregonaba la gente en las calles : “ Cambiemos el sistema , no el clima ” y “ Si el clima fuera un banco ya lo hubieran salvado ” .
Evo Morales denunció que cuando iba a hablar hicieron desalojar la sala para que sólo los mandatarios lo escucharan .
Dejó cinco preguntas para que las Naciones Unidas consulten a los pueblos del mundo sobre el cambio climático en un referéndum mundial para que los pueblos del mundo digan si o no :
“ Eso dejaremos en manos de la decisión de los pueblos del mundo ” .
( Se sobrentiende que las Naciones Unidas no impulsarán el referéndum ) .
1 ¿Está usted de acuerdo con restablecer la armonía con la naturaleza , reconociendo los derechos de la Madre Tierra ?
2.- ¿ Está usted de acuerdo con cambiar este modelo de sobre consumo y derroche que es el sistema capitalista ?
3.- ¿ Está usted de acuerdo con que los países desarrollados reduzcan y reabsorban sus emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero de manera doméstica para que la temperatura de la tierra no suba más de 1 grado centígrado ?
4.- ¿ Está usted de acuerdo en transferir todo lo que se gasta en las guerras y destinar un presupuesto superior a los presupuestos de defensa para el cambio climático ?
5.- ¿ Está usted de acuerdo con un tribunal de justicia climática para juzgar a quienes destruyen la Madre Tierra ?
Además Morales convocó a la “ Cumbre Mundial de los Pueblos sobre el Cambio Climático ” en defensa de la humanidad , la vida y el planeta .
Serán invitados no solamente presidentes de países interesados y preocupados sobre el tema , sino expertos , académicos y representantes de las organizaciones sociales .
“ El objetivo es lograr una posición de consenso a ser planteada en la próxima Cumbre sobre el Cambio Climático que se realizará en México en diciembre de 2010 . ”
Se realizará en Cochabamba , Bolivia , del 20 al 22 de abril , coincidirá con la primera celebración mundial del Día de la Madre Tierra recién instituido por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas .
Es ingenuo pensar que los grandes contaminadores del mundo hagan algo en defensa del clima .
Las grandes empresas multinacionales son las que gobiernan el mundo a través de los “ mandatarios ” que no son más que meros sirvientes suyos .
Su religión neoliberal les ordena ganar la mayor cantidad de dinero posible en el menor tiempo posible .
Ellos saben muy bien que para hacer eso deben destruir la naturaleza , saben muy bien que sus descendientes ya no existirán , pero no les importa .
A través de los medios de comunicación que están a su servicio , desinforman en la medida de lo posible sobre el calentamiento global y las medidas que debieran tomarse .
Tiene razón Evo cuando dice :
Solamente tratan de los efectos y no de las causas del cambio climático ” .
El cambio climático es producto del sistema capitalista que favorece la obtención de la máxima ganancia posible .
Ese es el propósito del sistema capitalista sin tener en consideración la vida de los demás .
En Copenhague deberíamos analizar que países son los que mas están dañando el medio ambiente y deberíamos considerar estos daños para enfocarnos en los países con mayor responsabilidad para que paguen por esta deuda con el clima del planeta , es una obligación ” .
… “ La cumbre de Copenhague es mucho más de carácter mundial , es un debate sobre la vida , sobre la humanidad .
Ahí tenemos profundas diferencias con Gobiernos capitalistas .
Yo sigo convencido de que el capitalismo es el peor enemigo de la humanidad .
Pueda ser que todavía alcancemos a lograr la supervivencia de la especie .
Nos pone optimistas la reunión de 100.000 personas en Copenhague , la conformación de la organización “ Cambiemos el sistema , no el clima ” , la convocatoria para la reunión en Cochabamba , el sacudimiento de los países ricos de Europa por la baja violenta de temperaturas en estos días .
Al parecer vamos a dejar de estar solos los pueblos indígenas que desde hace siglos venimos luchando y muriendo en defensa de la Madre Tierra y por la defensa de nuestras organizaciones colectivistas , solidarias .
Sólo la extinción del capitalismo logrará la supervivencia de nuestra especie , cuanto más antes lo comprenda el mundo , mejor .
The New Testament commands us never to “ repay evil with evil ” but instead to “ overcome evil with good ” ( Rom.12:17 ; cf. I Thess 5:15 ; I Pet 3:9 ) .
Jesus said , “ Do not resist an evildoer .
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other also ” ( Mt 5:39 ) .
He also said , “ Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you , bless those who curse you , pray for those who abuse you ” ( Lk 6:27 - 28 ) .
The teaching seems pretty straightforward , yet this very straightforwardness presents us with a dilemma .
On the one hand , we who confess Jesus as Lord do n’t want to say that Jesus and other New Testament authors are simply off their rockers in telling us not to resist evildoers , to repay evil with good , to love our enemies and to do pray for and bless people who mistreat us .
If our confession of faith means anything , we have to take this teaching very seriously .
On the other hand , we have to frankly admit that it ’s very hard to take this teaching seriously when it comes to extreme situations like having to protect ourselves and our family from an intruder .
Not only would most of us resist an evildoer in this situation , killing him if necessary , but most of us would see it as immoral if we did n’t use violence to resist such an evildoer .
How can refusing to protect your family by any means be considered moral ?
Is n’t it more loving , and thus more ethical , to protect your family at all costs ?
How do we resolve this dilemma ?
It helps somewhat to remember that the word Jesus uses for “ resist ” ( antistenai ) does n’t imply passively allowing something to take place .
It rather connotes resisting a forceful action with a similar forceful action .
Jesus is thus forbidding responding to violent action with similar violent action .
He ’s teaching us not to take on the violence of the one who is acting violently toward us .
He ’s teaching us to respond to evil in a way that is consistent with loving them .
But he ’s not by any means saying do nothing .
Still , the teaching is problematic , for most of us would instinctively use , and feel justified using , violence to protect our family from an intruder if necessary .
The most common way people resolve this dilemma is by convincing ourselves that the “ enemies ” Jesus was referring to are not our enemies – e.g. people who attack our family ( or our nation , or our standard of living , etc … . ) .
Jesus must have been referring to “ other kinds ” of enemies , less serious enemies , or something of the sort .
We tell ourselves that when violence is justified – as in “ just war ” ethics – Jesus ’ teachings do not apply .
This approach allows us to feel justified , if not positively “ Christian , ” killing intruders and bombing people who threaten our nation — so long as we are nice to our occasionally grumpy neighbors .
Unfortunately , this common- sensical interpretation makes complete nonsense of Jesus ’ teaching .
The whole point of Jesus ’ teaching is to tell disciples that their attitude toward “ enemies ” should be radically different from others .
“ If you do good to those who do good to you , ” Jesus added , “ what credit is that to you ?
For even sinners do the same ” ( Lk 6:32 ) .
Everybody instinctively hates those who hate them and believes they are justified killing people who might kill them or their loved ones .
In contrast to this , Jesus is saying : “ Be radically different . ”
This is why Jesus ( and Paul ) did n’t qualify the “ enemies ” or “ evildoers ” he taught us to love and not violently oppose .
Jesus did n’t say , “ Love your enemies until they threaten you ; until it seems justified to resort to violence ; or until it seems impractical to do so . ”
Enemies are enemies precisely because they threaten us on some level , and it always feels justified and practically expedient to resist them , if not harm them if necessary .
Jesus simply said , “ love your enemies ” and “ do n’t resist evildoers ” – and note , some of the people he was speaking to would before long confront “ enemies ” who would feed them and their families to lions for amusement .
The teaching could not be more radical and as kingdom people we have to take it seriously .
At the same time , what do we do with the fact that most of us know we would not take it seriously , let alone obey it , in extreme situations like our family coming under attack ?
As with all of Jesus ’ teachings , it ’s important to place this teaching in the broader context of Jesus ’ kingdom ministry .
Jesus ’ teachings are n’t a set of pacifistic laws people are to merely obey , however unnatural and immoral they seem .
Rather , his teachings are descriptions of what life in the domain in which God is king looks like and prescriptions for how we are to cultivate this alternative form of living .
In other words , Jesus is n’t saying : “ As much as you want to resist an evildoer and kill your enemy , and as unnatural and immoral as it seems , act loving toward him . ”
He ’s rather saying : “ Cultivate the kind of life where loving your enemy becomes natural for you . ”
He ’s not merely saying , “ Act different from others ” ; he ’s saying , “ Be different from others . ”
This is simply what it means to cultivate a life that looks like Jesus , dying on a cross for the people who crucified him .
How does this insight help address our dilemma ?
A person who lived with the “ normal ” tit - for - tat kingdom - of - the - world mindset would instinctively resort to violence to protect himself and his family .
Loving his attacker and doing good to him would be the farthest thing from his mind .
As with the Jerusalem that Jesus wept over , the “ things that make for peace ” would be “ hidden from [ his ] “ eyes . ” ( Lk 19:41 - 42 ) .
Indeed , from this kingdom - of - the - world perspective , Jesus ’ teaching seems positively absurd .
But how might a person who cultivated a non-violent , kingdom - of - God mindset and lifestyle on a daily basis respond differently to an attacker ?
How might a person who consistently lived in Christ - like love ( Eph 5: 1 - 2 ) operate in this situation ?
For one thing , such a person would have cultivated the kind of character and wisdom that would n’t automatically default to self - protective violence .
Because he would genuinely love his enemy , he would have the desire to look for , and the wisdom to see , any non-violent alternative to stopping his family ’s attacker if one was available .
He would want to do “ good ” to his attacker .
This would n’t be a matter of him trying to obey an irrational rule that said , “ look for an alternative in extreme situations . ”
In extreme situations , no one is thinking about obeying rules !
Rather , it would be in the Christ - like nature of this person to see non-violent alternatives if they were present .
This person ’s moment - by - moment discipleship in love would have given him a Christ - like wisdom that a person whose mind was conformed to the pattern of the tit - for - tat world would not have ( Rom. 12:2 ) .
Perhaps he ’d see that pleading with , startling , or distracting the attacker would be enough to save himself and his family .
Perhaps he ’d discern a way to allow his family to escape harm by placing himself in harm ’s way .
Not only this , but this person ’s day - by - day surrender to God would have cultivated a sensitivity to God ’s Spirit that would enable him to discern God ’s leading in the moment , something the “ normal ” kingdom - of - the - world person would be oblivious to .
This Christ - like person might be divinely led to say something or do something that would disarm the attacker emotionally , spiritually , or even physically .
For example , I heard of a case in which a godly woman was about to be sexually assaulted .
Just as she was being pinned to the ground with a knife to her throat , she out of nowhere said to her attacker , “ Your mother forgives you . ”
She had no conscious idea where the statement came from .
What she did n’t know was that her attacker ’s violent aggression toward women was rooted in a heinous thing he had done as a teenager to his now deceased mother .
The statement shocked the man and quickly reduced him to a sobbing little boy .
The woman seized the opportunity to make an escape and call the police who quickly apprehended the man in the park where the attack took place .
He was still there , sobbing .
The man later credited the woman ’s inspired statement with being instrumental in his eventual decision to turn his life over to Christ .
The point is that , in any given situation , God may see possibilities for non-violent solutions we cannot see and a person who has learned to “ live by the Spirit ” is open to being led by God in these directions ( Gal. 5:16 , 18 ) .
Not only this , but a person who has cultivated a kingdom - of - God outlook on life would have developed the capacity to assess this situation from an eternal perspective .
Having made Jesus her example on a moment - by - moment basis , she would know — not just as a “ rule , ” but as a heart felt reality — the truth that living in love is more important than life itself .
Her values would not be exhaustively defined by temporal expediency .
Moreover , she would have cultivated a trust in God that would free her from defining “ winning ” and “ losing ” in terms of temporal outcomes .
She would have confidence in the resurrection .
As such , she would be free from the “ preserve my interests at all costs ” mindset of the world .
Of course , it ’s possible that , despite a person ’s loving wisdom and openness to God , a man whose family was attacked might see no way to save himself and his family except to harm the attacker , or even to take his life .
What would such a person do in this case ?
I think it is clear from Jesus ’ teachings , life and especially his death that Jesus would choose non-violence .
So , it seems to me that a person who was totally conformed to the image of Jesus Christ , who had thoroughly cultivated a kingdom mind and heart , would do the same .
At the same time , I have to frankly confess that I ’m not sure this is what I ’d do in this situation .
Indeed , I have to honestly admit that , like most people , I do n’t yet quite see how it would be moral to do what I believe Jesus would do .
Yet , I have to assume that my disagreement with Jesus is due to my not having sufficiently cultivated a kingdom heart and mind .
If I felt I had to harm or take the life of another to prevent what clearly seemed to be a greater evil , I could not feel righteous or even justified about it .
Like Bonhoeffer who , despite his pacifism , plotted to assassinate Hitler , I could only plead for God ’s mercy .
What we must never do , however , is acquiesce to our present , non-kingdom , spiritual condition by rationalizing away Jesus ’ clear kingdom prescriptions .
We must rather strive every moment of our life to cultivate the kind of mind and heart that increasingly sees the rightness and beauty of Jesus ’ teachings and thus that would naturally respond to an extreme , threatening situation in a loving , non-violent manner .

While filming a kidnapping scene for the film Sieben gegen Chicago ( 1964 ) , he learned that his son , singer Frank Sinatra Jr. , had been kidnapped from his hotel room in Lake Tahoe , Nevada .
For obvious reasons , the scene was never used in the completed film .

When Tom called , Frank told him that he wanted to appear on Magnum , but that Tom should not worry , because he did not want to be paid , he just wanted his expenses paid .
Tom agreed , and asked Frank what kind of story line he wanted for his character .
Frank said that he did not care , as long as his character was a tough guy , and that there be a fight scene where Frank knocks someone out .
Tom agreed to Frank 's terms and concept for the character Frank would play , and Frank did appear on Magnum in 1986 , in what would be Frank 's last , full acting , non-cameo role .
Frank's " expenses " turned out to be a problem for the producers of Magnum and CBS ( the network which aired Magnum during its original broadcast run ) , because Frank 's expenses included the costs for his personal jet and his full entourage .
The final expenses tally ?
$ 300,000 ( in 1986 dollars ! )

Shortly before the interview began , Sinatra told Jacobs that he could ask any questions he liked , but if he asked anything about Gardner he would " shove the microphone down his throat ! "

JFK canceled and instead chose to stay at the home of Sinatra 's biggest rival , Bing Crosby .
When Sinatra found out he was furious , and immediately grabbed a sledgehammer and began demolishing the newly - constructed helipad .
It was theorized by some that this was one of the reason's why he switched to the Republican party later in life .

Exxon profit slides 23 %
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Exxon Mobil reported a 23 % drop in quarterly profit Monday as economic conditions remain challenging , but the energy giant 's earnings beat Wall Street 's expectations .
The world 's largest publicly traded oil company said it earned $ 6.05 billion in the last three months of 2009 , down 23 % from $ 7.82 billion a year earlier .
On a per-share basis , Exxon said it earned $ 1.27 , a decline of 18 % from the fourth quarter of last year .
The results were better than many on Wall Street had expected .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of $ 1.19 per share .
Shares of the company were up nearly 3 % to $ 66.14 at midday .
" Despite continuing difficult global economic conditions , Exxon Mobil delivered strong business results and built on our long - term focus , " Rex Tillerson , Exxon 's chief executive , said in a statement .
For the full year , Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) said it earned $ 19.42 billion .
That 's down 56 % from last year , when Exxon reported the largest annual profit in U.S. history , as the sluggish economy has undermined energy demand .
Exxon and other companies that convert crude oil into refined products such as gasoline and diesel have been squeezed as demand for fuels remains weak and oil prices have trended higher .
Indeed , the company suffered a quarterly loss of $ 189 million in its refining unit , compared to a profit of $ 2.4 billion a year earlier .
Earnings in Exxon 's production and exploration unit were up $ 146 million to $ 5.8 billion .
The company also reported higher quarterly earnings in its chemicals unit .
Despite the ongoing weakness in energy demand , Exxon said production increased 2 % in the quarter .
Capital and exploration expenditures rose 21 % to $ 8.3 billion .
" All in all , it was a good quarter , " said Fadel Gheit , an Oppenheimer energy analyst .
" This might be a turning point for the stock . "
Gheit said the weakness in Exxon 's refining operations was more than offset by increased natural gas production and higher oil prices , as well as better - than - expected performance in the company 's chemicals business .
" It was certainly a tough year , " said David Rosenthal , Exxon 's vice president of investor relations .
" But we ended the year strong and we look forward to that momentum continuing as this year gets started . "
He said the company has been making adjustments to its portfolio of assets , including refining operations , pipelines and retail stations .
But he said the company has no immediate plans to follow the lead of rival energy companies that have divested refining operations to curb losses .
" We do n't see a need right now for any significant restructurings , " he said .
Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , the second largest U.S. oil company , said last month it would restructure its refining and retail business .
Some independent refiners have also moved to sell or close facilities in recent months .
Sometimes it's not hard to see why lawyers have such a bad reputation .
There is more news out of California of scamster lawyers taking advantage of desperate homeowners .
According to the ABAJournal , the California Bar is looking into more than 400 lawyers who may have taken advantage of homeowners by accepting payments despite exerting little effort to save their homes .
ABA Journal : A total of 15 attorneys have either been suspended or resigned in the face of pending disciplinary charges , and many more are expected to lose their licenses , according to state bar authorities .
The complaints are still going through the roof , " says Suzan Anderson , who serves as lead mortgage fraud prosecutor for the bar and says she is deluged with more than 30 new complaints a day .
The state previously reported they were investigating 1,200 loan modification cases and 300 lawyers who are accused of mishandling funds from clients .
The Russian Sukhoi SU - 27 has a top speed of Mach 1.8 ( more than 1,300 mph ) and a thrust - to - weight ratio greater than 1:1 .
In other words , it can accelerate while climbing straight up .
It was designed to fight the best the United States had to offer , and it can be yours for the cost of a mediocre used business jet .
Last week , we told you about a cool DIY jet .
If you like the idea of a jet but not the thought of doing it yourself , John Morgan has you covered .
He 's got a pair of beautifully restored Sukhoi SU - 27 Flanker jets .
They 're first - rate pieces of Soviet - era hardware designed to go head - to - head with the McDonnell Douglas F - 15 Eagle .
They 're for sale , joining a very elite group of former military fighter jets offered for private ownership in the United States .
If you 've always dreamed of being a fighter pilot , but missed your chance at the military route , this might be your chance to become a Top Gunski without having to deal with the Iceman trying to steal the limelight .
Never flown a jet ?
No problem .
" We have a training program for any prospective owner " Morgan says .
The SU - 27 was one of the Soviet Union 's premier Cold War weapons .
The same SU - 27UB model Morgan 's offering for sale was flown by the Russian Knights , the Soviet 's closest equivalent to the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds .
Morgan 's team at Pride Aircraft has " zero timed " the airframe and engine , so you 're getting an aircraft that 's just like new .
Theses Cold War fighters have been modernized with Western instrumentation , radios and GPS .
Both are fully IFR equipped with U.S. avionics .
Nothing currently on the aircraft market comes close to these airplanes .
Several companies talk about how their aircraft feel like a fighter jet or offer fighter jet - like performance .
But it 's not very often you can actually buy a fighter jet .
Oh sure , there are a handful of former U.S. supersonic trainer jets like the Northrop T - 38 out there , and the Douglas A - 4 or MiG 21 fighters are impressive by any measure .
But few , if any , airplanes come close to one of the best fighter jets made during the Cold War .

Morgan got started in the aviation business restoring North American Aviation T - 28's , an old American trainer used at the dawn of the jet age .
After several years of success in the piston market , Morgan grew curious about some of the former Soviet Bloc jet trainers that started appearing after the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s .
For the last 10 years , Morgan has built his reputation importing , restoring and selling Aero Vodochody L-39s , a small primary jet trainer used throughout the Eastern Bloc .
" One of our L - 39 customers liked what we did and asked us to manage the Sukhoi project , " Morgan said .
The pair of SU - 27s were purchased for a company that needed to do some high - altitude research ( the jets can reach 57,000 feet ) .
" They needed a platform that could carry sophisticated technology to high altitude , " Morgan says .
But the company went bust and the project faltered .
Morgan decided to finish restoring the jets and put them up for sale .
" We 're in the final stages in getting the last one licensed , " he says .
SU - 27 landing with speed brake deployed
The jets are the " UB " variant of the SU - 27 , never intended for combat , so they are n't fitted with weapons .
But all the performance is still there .
Morgan has a pair of former Air Force fighter pilots flight testing them .
His chief pilot is a former F - 15 driver , and he says the SU - 27 is remarkably similar to the F - 15 Eagle ( video of his first flight below ) .
Though according to Morgan , the pilot says you get the impression you 're definitely pushing a bigger airplane through the sky .
But who 's going to spend $ 5 million on a Russian fighter jet ?
It 's definitely not for everybody , but if pure performance and excitement is what you 're after for , look no further .
When it comes to sheer bang - for - the - buck , the SU - 27 is tough to beat , says Tom Haines , editor in chief of Pilot magazine , published by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association .
" For what you get from a performance standpoint , and a thrill standpoint , it 's a great value , " Haines says .
" Now , putting gas in them is another story . "
There 's always a catch , is n't there ?
The $ 5 million price tag is only the beginning .
Even if you 're flying around without the afterburners lit , the Flanker burns 1,000 to 1,200 gallons per hour .
With Jet A currently selling for $ 4 to $ 5 a gallon , this is n't a cheap thrill .
We wo n't even go into the potential maintenance costs .
As for the training you might need if you want to own and fly the SU - 27 ?
Morgan recommends some jet experience before starting the training .
Of course , his pilots are happy to teach you in an L - 39 , much the same way the original pilots of the Sukhoi fighter gained experience back at the peak of the Cold War .

The Oil Export Crisis Has Arrived Venezuela and Mexico : The Point of the Exports Spear
Last March , my study of the effect of peak oil on U.S. imports had brought Mexico to the forefront .
As our # 3 source of imports , the crashing of its supergiant Cantarell field had put the future of our oil supply in serious jeopardy .
The possibility that Mexico's oil and gas exports to the U.S. could go to zero within seven years looked very real .
As I explained in that piece , rising domestic consumption coupled with declining supply puts an ever - tightening squeeze on imports .
I have found no evidence that policymakers are paying any attention to this critically important dynamic , but it is the very point of the peak oil spear .
Were it not for the market meltdown and recession , it would have pierced our vital organs .
Instead we felt a pinprick .
Hardly anybody realized what it really was , and most ran off on a wild goose chase for evil oil speculators .
Now Venezuela has appeared on my radar for similar reasons ... only this time , we 're really going to feel it .
Let 's begin with a review of Mexico 's exports .
~~ad_0 ~~
Mexico
Shortly after publishing that article , I casually remarked to my friend and fellow energy analyst Gregor Macdonald that Cantarell 's production could fall to under 0.5 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) by the end of the year .
I arrived at this somewhat startling conclusion by calculating the effect of its decline rate — 38 % at the time and accelerating — on production of 0.77 mbpd in January , down precipitously from its 2.1 mbpd peak in 2003 .
Gregor 's recent data sleuthing on Cantarell found its production in December 2009 was 0.527688 mbpd , just a hair above my estimate .
To update the data on Mexico , it 's now our # 2 source of imported petroleum because Saudi Arabia has fallen from # 2 to # 4 .
As of November 2009 ( the latest data available ) the U.S. imported 1.08 mbpd of crude and finished petroleum products from Mexico .
Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.46 mbpd in 2004 , the same year as its production peaked .
Net exports ( production minus consumption ) fell to 1.06 mbpd in 2008 .

Chart by Chris Nelder .
For the years 2005 - 2008 , Mexico 's exports to the U.S. declined by 0.51 barrels per day .
In 2010 , supply is expected to fall to 2.5 mbpd — nearly half a million barrels per day less than 2009 .
Mexico nationalized its petroleum operations in 1938 in a constitutional amendment and handed over total control to the state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos ( PEMEX ) , with predictable results .
Oil now provides more than 40 % of the country 's revenues , which have been used to pay for a vast array of public services and line the pockets of the oligarchy while starving investment in both upstream activities ( new oil supply ) and downstream ( finished products ) .
Consequently , Mexico's oil reserves have decreased by more than 75 % in two decades ( owing partly to the correction of a previous , ridiculously inflated figure ) , production has begun to decline and exports are falling fast .
It now imports $ 4.5 billion a year worth of gasoline , $ 10 billion a year in petrochemicals , and 25 % of its natural gas , mostly from the U.S.
This despite having nearly 13 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and more than 50 billion barrels of ( unproven ) reserve potential .
Mexico would be in a far better position , were it not for its hostile stance on foreign participation .
PEMEX simply lacks the technical ability to develop its more difficult , remaining resources — particularly deep water .
Venezuela
As of November , the U.S. was importing 0.9 mbpd from Venezuela , making it our # 3 source .
Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.8 mbpd in 1997 , the same year as its production peaked .
Net exports ( production minus consumption ) have fallen 38 % from the 1997 peak of 3.1 mbpd to 1.9 mbpd in 2008 .
Venezuela 's oil exports to the U.S. have been declining markedly since 2004 , after a long period of relative stability .
From 2004 through 2009 , Venezuelan petroleum exports fell 0.7 mbpd .

Chart by Chris Nelder .
Like Mexico , Venezuela is endowed with enormous energy resources and could be producing at a far higher level .
Estimates of its oil reserves range from 153 billion barrels of certified proven ; to 513 billion barrels technically recoverable in the USGS '
January estimate ; to 1.5 trillion barrels in offshore potential , if you believe the effervescent Dr. Marcio Mello of Brazil .
Most of it is heavy oil , a low - grade which must be upgraded to synthetic crude .
And like Mexico , President Hugo Chavez has exiled the Western oil companies who might have made the investment to bring those resources to market .

A Nation in Free Fall
The good times rolled for Chavez in the first years after his election in 1998 .
His socialist programs to rebuild the country and raise its standard of living were popular but expensive , and soon began to fail under the crush of declining energy supply .
Oil revenues make up 90 % of Venezuela 's foreign earnings , so its dependence on oil exports is extreme .
Billions of dollars in profits from the national oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela SA ( PDVSA ) were diverted to welfare programs and into the pockets of oligarchs , while investment in future petroleum and power supply languished .
The precipitous drop in oil prices since mid-2008 only compounded the revenue shortfall .
Oil production has fallen 25 % since Chavez was elected , and a long , devastating drought has cut into its hydropower supply , of which 73 % comes from the massive Guri Dam .
Chavez responded by nationalizing most of its petroleum operations and its grid in 2007 .
In 2009 , another 76 oil services companies on the Maracaibo Lake were taken over .
The projects now sit abandoned , waiting for PDVSA to compensate the displaced operators and put them back into operation .
Almost half a million hectares of land were seized in 2009 with the rationalization that it was underused .
Measures to counter the declining hydro supply have been implemented in a haphazard fashion , resulting in frequent , unscheduled blackouts , including seven national blackouts since 2007 .
Malls and government offices have had their hours of operation cut and water rationing has been imposed .
" Some people sing in the bath for half an hour , '' Chávez cried at a cabinet session in October .
" What kind of communism is that ?
Three minutes is more than enough ! ''
In January , a wave of public protest erupted , prompting Chavez to implement a rapid series of desperate measures .
Rolling blackouts were imposed in the capital city of Caracas .
After a few days of protests , Chavez lifted the blackouts and fired the electricity minister .
Blackouts are expected to be reinstated in an effort to keep hydro reservoir levels from falling to the point of collapse .
A recent report gave the power shortage a paradoxical twist , indicating that power from one of the state refineries may have to be diverted to the grid , cutting distillate output by 200,000 barrels per day — or more .
This will result in less heating oil for China , who will make up the loss by burning more coal .
Chavez devalued Venezuela 's bolivar currency by half ; the president went on to nationalize a chain of French - owned supermarkets over alleged price gouging .
He ordered cutbacks in the operation of state - run steel and aluminum manufacturing operations , which account for up to 20 % of the country 's power demand .
This week he turned to Cuba for help on how to cope with the power shortage , since Cuba has been through similar problems .
The island nation is providing tens of thousands of energy - efficient lightbulbs and cloud - seeding technology to Venezuela .
Last weekend , he forced six television channels off the air for failing to broadcast one of his speeches — up to six hours in length — in a continuation of his campaign for " communicational hegemony . "
Since December , all radio and television networks are required by law to broadcast his speeches live , whenever he chooses to make one .
Nationwide student marches have been met by troops armed with rubber bullets , and at least two deaths have been recorded .
Chavez has said he 's prepared to take " radical measures " should the situation worsen , begging the unsettling question of what could be more radical than what he has already done .
Looking East , Not North
Now Chavez is turning east for help in developing his nation 's oil and gas resources .
Recent agreements include a $ 20 billion joint venture with Russia to develop the Junin 6 field in the Orinoco oil belt , with a potential top production rate of 450,000 barrels per day .
China has agreed to build a refinery and develop the Orinoco heavy oil fields , and Venezuela has guaranteed 560,000 barrels per day to China this year .
Venezuela has launched its first major auction for drilling rights in more than a decade , for access to areas east of the existing operations in the Orinoco .
Developing the leases will be expensive because of their distance from the existing infrastructure , and winning bidders are expected to make offers in the $ 10 billion - plus range including early payments of at least $ 1 billion , financing plans , and commitments to build the necessary roads , pipelines , ports , and upgraders .
Potential bidders include Spain 's Repsol , Japan 's Mitsubishi , the UK's BP , and Chevron .
Given the sheer size of its resources , it 's too soon to declare the end of Venezuela 's glory days in the oil patch .
However , it does seem likely that the new barrels it brings to market will be headed east — not north — and Western producers will have very little stake in the projects .
Chavez will put exports to the U.S. on a short path to zero the first chance he gets .
Oh Imports , Where Art Thou ?
The combined decline in imports from Mexico and Venezuela for 2005 through 2008 is 0.89 mbpd .
If the trend continues in 2009 , then over 1 mbpd will have disappeared from the U.S. import stream in the last five years — a decline of 8 % from 2004 levels .
Since 2007 , the loss of production from Cantarell alone was 0.7 mbpd , but the recession cut U.S. demand by 2 mbpd , effectively masking the decline .
This raises the question : If U.S. demand rises from here , where will those barrels come from ... and how much will they cost ?
The U.S. is not only in first place worldwide in its demand for oil , but in paying the market rate for it .
Nobody else buys 8.5 mbpd of crude at retail .
Drivers in Venezuela are still filling up for 25 cents a gallon , even as their exports decline .
Mexico 's gasoline prices are more on par with the U.S. , but its consumption has been rising steadily since 1997 and continues to cut into exports .
Saudi Arabia 's domestic consumption is currently growing at the rate of 7 % per year , following a trend of more than three decades .
It uses a whopping 1.5 mbpd — 1.8 % of total world oil supply ! — to desalinate water , at the equivalent of 7 cents a gallon .
Before the OPEC cuts of 2009 , its exports to the U.S. had essentially flatlined at 1.5 mbpd since 2004 .
Exports from our # 5 source , Nigeria , have also declined — from 1.17 mbpd in 2005 to 0.98 mbpd in 2008 .
In fact , of the top five oil exporting countries to the U.S. , representing 63 % of our crude imports , only Canada posted an increase ( of 0.2 mbpd ) .
The combined annual net oil exports from our top three exporting countries — Canada , Mexico and Venezuela — illustrate our situation :
Combined Annual Net Oil Exports From Canada , Mexico and Venezuela .

Given the very modest increases from unconventional domestic production and Canada , the decline of imports from Mexico and Venezuela means the U.S. will be increasingly forced to depend on suppliers farther afield — the very same suppliers that China has been buying into in size .
The " collision course with China " that I wrote about in July 2005 has nearly reached the point of impact .
It also means that when oil prices rise again , the pain will be far greater for the U.S. than it is for our top suppliers .
Next time , the spear of declining oil exports will puncture a lung .
The oil export crisis has arrived ...
We just have n't felt it yet .
Production , consumption , and export data herein is the latest available from the EIA .
Until next time ,
Chris

The Lord Chief Justice expressed surprise today at the BCA ’s libel suit against Simon Singh .
Padraig Reidy reports
England ’s most senior judge today said he was “ baffled ” by the British Chiropractic Association ’s ( BCA ) defamation suit against science writer Simon Singh .
Presiding at the appeal court in London today in a pre-trial hearing on the meaning of words in a 2008 article by Singh criticising chiropractic treatments , Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said he was “ troubled ” by the “ artificiality ” of the case .
“ The opportunities to put this right have not been taken , ” Lord Judge said .
He continued : “ At the end of this someone will pay an enormous amount of money , whether it be from Dr Singh ’s funds or the funds of BCA subscribers . ”
He went on to criticise the BCA ’s reluctance to publish evidence to back up claims that chiropractic treatments could treat childhood asthma and other ailments .
“ I ’m just baffled .
If there is reliable evidence , why has n’t someone published it ? ”
However , Lord Judge stressed that his comments would not affect the judgment of the case before the Court of Appeal .
The Lord Chief Justice was presiding at a pre-trial appeal on meaning in the case of BCA v Singh .
Singh is being sued by the organisation for comments in a 2008 article for the Guardian newspaper in which he criticised chiropractic and claimed the BCA promoted “ bogus ” treatments , despite there not being “ a jot ” of evidence of their effectiveness .
Judge is part of a panel which also includes the Master of the Rolls , Lord Neuberger , and Lord Justice Sedley — one of the most high - powered panels of judges ever to preside on a single case .
Adrienne Page QC , representing Simon Singh , said it was wrong of the BCA to claim that Singh implied it “ knowingly ” promoted treatments it knew to be ineffective .
“ The least likely explanation [ of the article ] is that the BCA cynically and dishonestly engaged in peddling remedies it knew were of no value , ” Page told the court .
Representing the BCA , Heather Rogers QC said the organisation is a respectable one that takes its reputation seriously .
Rogers argued that the use of the word “ bogus ” suggested that the BCA knew some of the claims made for chiropractic to be false .
Lord Neuberger asked if it was not the case that Singh had outlined his interpretation of the word “ bogus ” in the original article , where he described how Professor of Complementary Medicine Edzard Ernst had been unable to find any evidence of the effectiveness of chiropractic in over 70 trials .
Rogers conceded that had Singh written that there was “ no reliable evidence ” , the defamation suit might never have happened .
But Lord Justice Sedley suggested “ is n’t the first question as to whether something is evidence that it is reliable ? ”
Earlier in the day , dozens of Singh ’s supporters had gathered outside the court to back the popular author ’s right to free expression .
A date has not been set for delivery of the judges ’ ruling .
An Australian internet rights group has applauded Google ’s possible pull - out from China over censorship issues , drawing a link to Australia ’s proposed plan to block parts of the internet .
“ We ’re certainly happy and supportive that technology companies like Google are asserting that this is a bad idea globally , ” said Electronic Frontiers Australia spokesperson Geordie Guy .
Google ’s surprise announcement that it will no longer comply with Chinese censorship demands and may exit China , comes weeks before a proposed internet - blocking plan will be introduced into parliament in Canberra .
The search - engine giant 's stance brings more global attention on the Australian government 's position on internet filtering .
“ We ’re concerned that Australia is following the sorts of precedents set down by countries like China and Iran that have maintained internet censorship , ” said Mr Guy .

A notebook ’s processor is the brain of the machine , in charge of executing complex calculations .
AMD and Intel , the two major players in this sector , have been battling for the notebook CPU market for years .
Now that battle has moved from mainstream 15 - inch laptops into affordable ultraportables .
To determine which CPU is best for your needs , we tested the $ 699 T135 - S1310 ( 1.3 - GHz Intel Pentium SU4100 with integrated graphics ) and the $ 599 T135D - S1324 ( 1.6 - GHz AMD Turion Neo X2 L625 with discrete graphics ) to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each platform .
Does AMD have what it takes to take down the champ ?
Is Intel worth the $ 100 premium ?
Common Features
Both T135s sport the same glossy coating ( available in black , red , and white ) that commands your attention .
A subtle , houndstooth - esque pattern spreads across the lid onto the deck and palm rest .
Even the touchpad bears this pattern ( although it has a textured finish ) .
Coupled with metal accents on and around the mouse button , the machine looks more expensive than the price tags might suggest .
At 3.8 pounds , the T135 is light and slim enough to hold in one hand , even though the six - cell battery creates a slight bulge at the bottom .
The keyboard leaves an inch of space on either side of the deck and feels a bit cramped .
Although the metal design of the single , narrow mouse button looks sleek , it can feel stiff if you accidentally press the center , as opposed to the left and right edges .
We were impressed by the bright 13.3 - inch , 1366 x 768 - pixel resolution screen , even while surfing unplugged ; YouTube clips at full screen looked sharp .
Viewing angles are wide , but the glossy display did kick back a number of reflections , especially during dark scenes .
We were less impressed by the speakers .
When listening to Curtis Mayfield ’s “ Think ( Instrumental ) , ” we kept wishing for greater volume and extra bass
We like that the USB port on the left lets you charge cell phones and other gadgets when the system is turned off .
Also included is an HDMI port .
VGA video from the 0.3 - megapixel webcam was neither sharp nor vibrant , but the lighting was bright enough .
CPU Performance
The 1.6 - GHz AMD Turion Neo X2 L625 CPU and 4GB of RAM helped power the T135D to a PCMark Vantage score of 2,557 , more than 180 points below the category average .
The Intel version of the T135 , which uses a 1.3 - GHz Intel Pentium SU4100 CPU and 4GB of RAM , notched a higher score of 2,701 .
On both machines , we had no trouble with such everyday tasks as surfing the Web , writing documents , listening to music , and watching videos .
Results were more mixed during our transcoding tests .
The T135D took 12 minutes and 23 seconds to transcode a 114MB MPEG - 4 to AVI using HandBrake ; the Intel - powered T135 finished in just 11:41 .
However , when using Oxelon Media Converter to perform the same task , which uses multithreading , the T135D took 2:11 .
That ’s more than twice as fast as the Intel T135 ( 4:36 ) , and better than the average ( 2:57 ) .
The T135D ’s 5,400 - rpm , 320GB HDD copied a 4.97 GB folder of mixed media at a rate of 18.0 MBps , 1.3 MBps slower than the Intel T135 .
Both models run Windows 7 Home Premium , but the AMD version booted into the operating system in 55 seconds , 6 seconds faster than average , and 20 seconds faster than the Intel version .
Graphics
While the Intel version of the T135 has integrated Intel 4 Series graphics , the AMD version uses the ATI Radeon HD 3200 chipset , which helped the system score 1,048 in 3DMark06 .
That ’s almost 200 points higher than the average ultraportable , and 330 points higher than the Intel T135 ( 718 ) .
When we output a 1080 p Avatar trailer to a 32 - inch Samsung HDTV via HDMI using both systems , video played back smooth as silk .
The AMD T135D deftly handled World of Warcraft — at least on the default settings — moving along at 30 frames per second at 1024 x 768 resolution ; it dipped to just 6 fps at 1366 x 768 with effects set to Ultra .
By comparison , the Intel T135 managed just 23 fps at 1024 x 768 , and 4 fps at its native resolution .
Needless to say , neither version could handle the graphics - intensive Far Cry 2 .
Battery Life
As expected , the Intel - powered T135 lasted longer on the LAPTOP Battery Test , holding out for 7 hours and 23 minutes .
The AMD T135D ’s six - cell battery lasted 5:06 , which is over 2 hours less .
Still , this runtime is among the best we ’ve ever seen from an AMD notebook .
Wi-Fi
Both T135 systems had mixed results on our Wi -Fi test .
At 15 feet from our access point , the AMD system achieved a throughput of 29.1 Mbps , 8.6 Mbps faster than average .
At 50 feet , speeds dropped to a more pedestrian 16.7 Mbps , just a shade under the average of 17.2 Mbps .
However , the Intel notebook fared worse , delivering 23.2 and 15.2 Mbps from the same distances .
Green Testing
Because of its greater power consumption and lower battery life , the AMD T135D did not fare as well on our LAPTOP Battery Efficiency Test , scoring 24.9 to the Intel T135 ’s 16.9 .
The two notebooks straddle the ultraportable average of 19.6 .
Value and Verdict
There ’s a lot to like about both the AMD and Intel versions of the Toshiba Satellite T135 .
While we ’re not enamored with the touchpad buttons , both systems are solid ultraportables .
Which one you opt for depends on your needs .
At $ 599 , the AMD - powered T135D costs $ 100 less and gives you a strong bump in graphics performance .
However , the $ 699 Intel - powered version lasts more than two hours longer on a charge .
In other words , AMD gives you more oomph for less money , but Intel gives you more unplugged time .
Charles Moore - 2009.01.13 - Tip Jar
One of the most vexing software issues associated with running elderly Mac hardware is web browsers , especially as we get drawn more and more into the " cloud " .
Being still stuck with dialup Internet , I resisted switching my email activity to webmail for a long time , but the convenience of Gmail , which works with tolerable ( albeit not scintillating ) speed on dialup so long as you specify " Basic HTML " mode , has gradually roped me in , and it seems that I become more and more dependent upon Google for information retrieval with every passing day .
Web - based productivity software ( e.g. : most online Google apps ) run too sluggishly on dialup to be a practical proposition for me , but once I get broadband ( promised here for later this year ) , I 'll probably begin using them as well .
Anyway , for all of this web work , you need a good browser , and with my slow connection bottleneck , the faster the better .
The problem is that most browsers are freeware ( actually , that 's not really a problem ! ) , so there is little incentive for developers to invest time and energy maintaining backward compatibility for any but current or very recent OS versions and hardware .
Classic Mac
OS holdouts have been struggling with this reality for some time now , and there is no really up - to - date browser available for Macs running OS 9 or earlier .
Browser support is still very good for PowerPC machines running recent versions of OS X , with most major browsers remaining compatible with at least OS X 10.4 " Tiger " - and sometimes even 10.3 " Panther " .
However , support of older version of the Mac OS is not comprehensive - for example , the new indie WebKit based browser Cruz , which features multiple page views within a single browser window or tab and a plugin architecture intended to facilitate easy feature additions , requires a Mac OS X 10.5 " Leopard " .
Firefox Pros and Cons
More subtly , I 've found that Firefox 3.x , which works great with my 17 " PowerBook G4 running OS X 10.5 , even though it nominally supports OS X 10.4 , is not a happy camper on my 550 MHz G4 upgraded Pismo PowerBook , running sluggishly with a lot of hard disk activity , and , worse , seeming to slow down other web applications as well when it 's running .
I can't say what the cause of this is , but the behavior has persisted through several version updates , causing me to revert back to Netscape Navigator 9 , which I 've found very reliable on that system setup .
What I miss when using Navigator 9 is the improved load speed of the later Gecko browser engine versions and " session saving " - remembering what pages you were visiting when you quit and automatically loading them the next time you start - which I 've become addicted to , and which is a major time and aggravation - saver when I reboot .
Camino
One workaround I experimented with was Camino , the Mac-only Cocoa interface browser that also uses Mozilla 's Gecko engine , but which happily does not manifest the slowdown issues that plague Firefox 3 on my old , slow , somewhat memory - challenged Pismo .
The Mac - themed interface is pleasant to work with as well .
The problem with Camino has been that it seems to not be entirely comfortable with dragging text from the OS 9 applications that I still use for production work on that computer ( in OS X Classic Mode ) into web page forms , something that I do a lot of with web posting or , even more tiresome , it 's cranky about answering clicks on its interface windows to bring it forward , especially when coming from Classic Mode applications .
However , I can happily report that these the issues seem to have been improved to a considerable degree in the latest Camino release ( version 1.6.6 ) , enough that I may finally have switched from Navigator 9 .
The functional advantages are that Camino is significantly quicker loading pages and supports session restores .
Camino 1.6.6 , which upgrades to version 1.8.1.19 of the Mozilla Gecko rendering engine and includes several critical security and stability fixes , was released on December 16 , at which time I downloaded it , but I never got around to installing and checking it out until last weekend .
The page clicking issue especially seems significantly improved .
Dragging and dropping in text is still not as well ( or at least quickly ) received as it is in Navigator 9 , but I consider that a tolerable tradeoff for the page speed and not having to manually restore sessions after a reboot .
Cool .
It 's early days yet , but so far I 'm a lot happier with Camino than I was .
Changes in Camino 1.6.6 from version 1.6.5 :
Upgraded to version 1.8.1.19 of the Mozilla Gecko rendering engine , which includes several critical security and stability fixes .
Upgraded the " Block flash animations " code to use Flashblock 1.5.7 .
Improved ad - blocking .

Fill 'er up -- with hydrogen .
It may still sound like science fiction to some .
But Japan is taking a lead in making zero-emissions hydrogen - fueled cars a reality .
It 's part of the country 's aspiration to cut its carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050 ; nearly a quarter of those emissions come from transportation .
And it 's a more urgent task in a country that imports all of its oil .
Japan leads
Asia in early hydrogen - car infrastructure and is a world - beater in emerging fuel cell technologies .
" Hydrogen is still in very , very early days , " cautions Ashvin Chotai , London - based managing director of Intelligence Automotive Asia .
" But in the area of green cars , Japan has been investing a lot further ahead than the Western companies in the last few years , and they have an edge . "
Take Toyota .
Last year they announced they hope to retail an " affordable " fuel - cell car by 2015 .
It would be next step toward what the firm calls the " ultimate eco-car , " after today 's popular hybrids like the Prius , the " plug - in " hybrids that just came on the market , and fully electric vehicles .
Long term , Toyota sees hydrogen - fueled cars as ideal for long - haul driving , with plug - in hybrids better for mid-range driving and electrics best for short - range commuting .
That 's because fuel - cell cars have a much longer range from one fueling : more than 500 miles already , in a test run of a Toyota vehicle last year in Japan , compared to a maximum 125 - mile per charge range with electric vehicles .
Building hydrogen highways
But as with electric vehicles , the biggest hurdle is a lack of power stations .
" Fueling infrastructure is the joker in the whole thing , " says Toyota spokesman Paul Nolasco .
" You can't have fuel cell vehicles without the infrastructure , and you can't have infrastructure without fuel cell vehicles . "
The Japanese government is stepping in to address that chicken - and - egg problem .
It 's subsidizing fuel cell development and collaborating closely with energy and auto companies to build Japan 's " hydrogen highway " of the future .
The government has subsidized 13 hydrogen stations for fuel - cell cars , covering at least half of the $ 5 million to $ 6 million per station cost , according to the Fuel Cell Commercialization Conference of Japan ( energy firms have ponied up the rest ) .
It hopes to build 40 to 50 more by 2015 .
Japanese energy firms are actively working together with the government to build the hydrogen car infrastructure .
Tomohide Satomi , of the Fuel Cell Commercialization Conference of Japan , says such firms are looking into the future and seeing a need to develop new products as gas sales decrease .
" To survive , they have to change the portfolio of their energy supply business , " Mr. Satomi says .
" So they 're looking to the future .
They have to seek new business areas besides gasoline . "
He says Japan 's hydrogen highway efforts are on par with those in the United States ( particularly California ) and Germany , and that it leads Asia , with South Korea close behind .
Not cheap , or 100 percent clean
At one such station in a harbor - side , industrial area of Yokohama City , the Japan Automobile Research Institute 's Hideaki Matsushita showed off a fuel - cell demo model from Toyota .
After a test drive , the car came to rest and a pool of water puddled under the exhaust pipe .
In fuel - cell vehicles , hydrogen fuel and oxygen flow over a fuel cell stack , producing the electricity that runs the motor ; the byproduct is water .
It 's not a 100 percent " clean " energy source : currently one of the cheapest ways to produce hydrogen fuel uses natural gas .
Producing such fuel by " electrolysis " ( combining electricity and water to create hydrogen ) is the Holy Grail of green vehicles , but that 's an exorbitant process for now .
At the Yokohama demo station , it 's clear that fuel - cell vehicles are n't quite ready for prime time .
The ideal customer is a millionaire – and a bodybuilder .
For safety reasons , the pumping of high - pressure hydrogen fuel requires a heavy , rugged case and nozzle .
A mechanical arm helps lift the nozzle to the car for fueling .
And a typical fuel - cell vehicle goes for about $ 1 million , according to Sayaka Shishido , of NEDO , the government 's funding arm for fuel cell and other " new energy " development projects .
Toyota leases its 14 fuel - cell vehicles in Japan for a cool $ 9,000 to $ 11,000 per month , to universities and local governments .
Target year : 2015
Ten years ago , the Japanese government hoped to have five million fuel cell cars on the roads by now .
Satomi said that cost and durability issues were greatly under-estimated .
The new goal is more realistic , with a focus on building the necessary infrastructure for very small - scale commercialization by 2015 .
Aside from infrastructure , other technical hurdles remain .
One focus now is reducing the amount of expensive platinum used in each car .
Many fuel cell vehicles now use around 100 grams ; the goal is to whittle that down to just 10 grams .
Toyota says it 's making progress :
It has doubled the capacity of its hydrogen tanks in the past year , and sharply reduced the platinum it uses per car , to under 50 grams .
NEDO is funding research on reducing costs and improving fuel - cell durability .
And it 's confident about its commercialization targets , because auto and energy companies are on board .
" 2015 – that will be the key year for Japan , " says NEDO 's Ms. Shishido .
" This will be the starting year for utilization of fuel - cell vehicles by the general public . ”
Check out the whopper McCain told the editorial board of the Arizona Republic :
[ T ]he four - term senator says he was misled by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
McCain said the pair assured him that the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program would focus on what was seen as the cause of the financial crisis , the housing meltdown .
" Obviously , that did n't happen , " McCain said ...
" They decided to stabilize the Wall Street institutions , bail out ( insurance giant ) AIG , bail out Chrysler , bail out General Motors ...
What they figured was that if they stabilized Wall Street -- I guess it was trickle - down economics -- that therefore Main Street would be fine . "
Wall Street bailout ?
No one told me it was a Wall Street bailout ?
Now , while it is true that some of the TARP money went to AIG , Chrysler , and G.M .
And that was not part of the original TARP legislation .
But is it possible that John McCain did n't know where the TARP money was going ?
In a word , no .
As TPM reports :
In a speech the following day about improvements he was seeking to what became the TARP legislation , McCain made clear that he knew the measure was targeted at Wall Street , declaring : " No Wall Street executives should profit from taxpayer dollars ...
The senior leaders of any firm that is bailed out should not be making more than the highest paid government official . "
And in a speech the following week , McCain added : " We cannot dedicate more than a trillion dollars to rescue failing institutions , and then go right back to business as usual in Washington . "
Which failing institutions was he referring to , if not the banks ?
It would be bad enough if this were the end of John McCain 's bald - faced lies , but he went further .
Again , from the Arizona Republic :
McCain said Bush called him in off the campaign trail , saying a worldwide economic catastrophe was imminent and that he needed his help .
" I do n't know of any American , when the president of the United States calls you and tells you something like that , who would n't respond , " McCain said .
" And I came back and tried to sit down and work with Republicans and say , ' What can we do ? ' "
So that whole disaster of suspending his campaign was actually Bush 's fault , not McCain's .
Of course , everything reported from that time says the exact opposite .
Next we 'll hear that it was Bush who chose Sarah Palin as McCain 's running mate , it was Bush who gave McCain that catchy little number about bombing Iran and that hilarious joke about Chelsea Clinton .
After all , as John McCain has proven time and time again , " My own ass first " .
That was his campaign motto right ?
Just a reminder ...
From John Schmid at the Journal Sentinel : Unemployment benefits for 1.2 million Americans could expire Sunday
Nearly 1.2 million unemployed Americans ... face an imminent cutoff of government unemployment checks if Congress cannot pass emergency legislation to extend federal benefits before funding expires Sunday .
1.2 million jobless workers will become ineligible for federal unemployment benefits in March unless Congress extends the unemployment safety net programs from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) .
By June , this number will swell to nearly 5 million unemployed workers nationally who will be left without any jobless benefits .
...
Currently , 5.6 million people are accessing one of the federal extensions ( 34 - 53 weeks of Emergency Unemployment Compensation ; 13 - 20 weeks of Extended Benefits , a program normally funded 50 percent by the states ) .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The National Employment Law Project ( NELP ) released a report in early February showing :
The plan had been to pass a 30 day extension , and then pass a 2nd bill in March to extend benefits for a year .
Now apparently the plan is to pass the larger bill this week .
If Congress acts quickly , the impact on the unemployed will be minimal because the benefits will be retroactive to March 1st .
The long term unemployment issue is n't going away any time soon .
The following graph is based on the January employment report and shows the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more ... The blue line is the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
The red line is the same data as a percent of the civilian workforce .
According to the BLS , there are a record 6.31 million workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks ( and still want a job ) .
This is a record 4.1 % of the civilian workforce .
( note : records started in 1948 ) .

Al Qaeda 's hidden weapon .
In the wake of the failed bombing attempt by Nigerian Al Qaeda operative Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , airport security experts are wringing their hands over how to stop the next underwear bomber .
X - ray machines do n’t detect the type of explosive , known as PETN , that Abdulmutallab carried .
Only a careful pat - down around Abdulmutallab ’s crotch , where the explosive had been sewn into his undies , would have detected his deadly cargo .
But Abdulmutallab ’s al Qaeda handlers knew that pat - downs are rare and that social mores make highly intrusive , crotch - fondling searches almost unheard of .
In the wake of the Abdulmutallab episode , however , standards will change .
Pat downs will become more common — and more intrusive .
We may not see the famous vision of the crazed dictator from Woody Allen ’s Bananas — “ Underwear shall be worn on the outside ! ” — but those searches by hand are likely to get a little more , shall we say , intimate .
Even a pat - down thorough enough to simulate foreplay , however , wo n’t protect us completely — not from a threat that sounds even more absurd than an underwear bomb and that is also more alarming : the butt bomb .
The concept is simple .
Rather than sew explosives into his underwear , a terrorist might actually plant a bomb , which can weigh as little as a pound , inside his anal cavity .
Like drug mules , would - be butt bombers could store the explosives inside a condom .
Sound crazy ?
Perhaps .
Disgusting ?
Definitely .
But security experts initially believed that a terrorist ’s derriere nearly killed a top Saudi Arabian counterterrorism official last fall .
Back in August , an Al Qaeda - connected militant named Abdullah Assiri offered to turn himself into Saudi authorities and enlist in a state - run terrorist rehabilitation program .
Exhibiting a healthy skepticism , the Saudis reportedly subjected Assiri to two airport - style X - ray scans and other security checks .
Finding no weapons or explosives on his body , security agents ushered Assiri into the palace of the counterterrorism chief , Prince Muhammad Bin Nayef , who is also the son of a likely heir to the Saudi throne .
Instead of surrendering , however , Assiri exploded .
Nayef survived the blast , but the Saudis were bewildered by this incredible breach of their security .
At first , they were convinced the explosive had been hidden in Assiri ’s anal cavity — a scenario that other security experts did n’t discount .
After further investigation , the Saudis concluded that Assiri did n’t have a butt bomb after all , but rather that he stashed the explosive in his underwear much like Abdulmutallab .
( The device may have been detonated by a text message sent to Assiri ’s cell phone ; exactly how the phone triggered the bomb is unclear .
Like Abdulmutallab , incidentally , Assiri appears to have gotten his assignment and materials in Yemen . )
While a worldwide economic depression is all but certain , the despotism and wars that depressions usually breed are not certain .
My nominees for next year ’s Nobel Peace Prize are Google ’s co-founders Larry Page , president of products , and Sergey Brin , president of technology , and Eric Schmidt who joined Google as chairman and chief executive officer in 2001 .
Last week Google threatened to shut down its Chinese operations over two key issues : censorship of its search results and , even more importantly , a “ highly sophisticated and targeted attack on ( Google ’s ) corporate infrastructure originating from China . ”
The latter seemed to be designed to obtain information on dissidents and journalists and was almost certainly launched by the Chinese government .
Some have argued that Google was never much of a success in China and that they will surrender very little if they pull out of the Chinese market .
On the face of it , these arguments are absurd .
China is , all at once , the world ’s fastest growing major economy and one of the world ’s fastest - growing markets for mobile phones and Internet usage .
With Google ’s expansion of its core business into mobile phones , they will potentially surrender billions of dollars of profits by leaving the Chinese market .
There is an important business reason why Google is willing to risk its Chinese operations in a showdown with the Chinese government .
Google is among those firms who have made a heavy bet on cloud computing .
Cloud computing shifts both software usage and file storage to the Internet .
The widespread adaptation of cloud computing depends upon the perception and reality of security .
No one will trust their files to Google if users perceive that either they are not secure from hackers or that Google will voluntary relinquish files to national security agencies .
The coming years are likely to be terrible times in the world .
As national economies collapse , governments will seek to distract their publics and stifle dissidents and critics .
When citizens fail to unite behind further centralization of government power , blame will be heaped upon the Internet because “ the Internet provides too much freedom to disseminate radical views . ”
Despite the fact that we are only in the very early stages of an economic depression , such nonsense is already being chanted in the United States .
When internal scapegoating fails to assuage their citizens , governments predictably turn to external enemies .
I ’m not capable of predicting who the governments of the United States and China will blame for their coming economic miseries .
One would n’t be surprised if both countries act against their economic self - interest and blame each other .
I say “ one would n’t be surprised ” because politicians place their own political success above the economic well - being of their nation ; and with the recent tariffs placed on Chinese steel , this process is already underway in the USA .
Often , as the socionomics work of Robert Prechter has pointed out , after years of deteriorating social mood and near the bottom of an economic depression , war breaks out .
If you have followed me so far , you understand why Google ’s actions last week are heroic .
In their efforts to crackdown on critics , governments around the world will depend on the cooperation of companies like Google .
If Google is joined by Silicon Valley and other firms who refuse to cooperate , a major weapon disappears in the war of governments against their own citizens .
A vibrant and free Internet community will continue to play a major role in providing alternative views , preventing tyranny , and slowing — and eventually reversing — further centralization of governments .
More importantly , a free Internet community will provide alternative views to the demonization of foreign and domestic “ enemies . ”
By their actions last week , Google may have begun a process that will save the world from the horrors of another world war .
Sometimes an act of courage can change the world .
Stand tall , Google , the world is in your debt !

Is it wrong to want to smash a coffee mug into some woman 's wrist if it 's for her own good ?
Wait , I 'm getting ahead of myself here .
I should provide you with the back story first and then ask you the question .
It all started a long time back when I went out and bought a pair of rollerblades .
I did n't know a damn thing about rollerblading other then it looked somewhat entertaining and seemed a socially acceptable way of getting an adrenaline fix .
Besides , I already did the Halloween , ten story , rappel off of A - dorm with a pumpkin on my head .
I scaled the walls of the lab building to use the science department 's telescope to look at the stars .
I stole the school blueprints in order to navigate the underground tunnels of the campus .
I even broke into the basement of the clock tower in order to have all the time in the world to Jumar up a rope , from the inside , in order to get to the top of it .
No , I needed something more mainstream and more importantly , acceptable to campus security , in order to get my kicks .
So I went to the local sporting goods store and bought myself a pair of rollerblades .
The salesman either took one look at my long hair and figured I knew everything there was to know about rollerblades , or he just did n't give a shit — either way he failed to mention that I should also buy wrist guards .
I took my new purchase home and immediately found my way to the campus tennis courts .
Yeah , yeah , Court , I know , skateboards and roller blades ruin the surface of a tennis court and …. just shut the hell up .
I needed a flat surface to figure those things out without killing myself .
After a while , I got what I " thought " was fairly proficient in stopping , turning etc .
I was ready for the open road .
I put on my rollerblades and made my way down a street that had very little traffic on it .
It was n't so hard , and it was kind of cool but I could definitely see that until I learned all those crazy tricks , I likely would be having more run-ins with Bob ( oh , he 's the head of security — we 're on a first name basis ) .
I passed a sign that said , " road ends around bend 500 feet , " thinking I would just turn around when the road ended I kept going around the bend .
What the sign failed to mention was that not only did the road end there , but apparently the entire world ended there too , and that 500 feet they casually mentioned was actually a 60 degree down slope .
Picking up speed faster than a tweeker left alone inside a meth lab , I applied the oh so handy but completely useless plastic rollerblade brake , leaning back slightly on one foot .
Yeah , that thing worked fine on a tennis court , but it was n't doing shit for me on a 60 degree decline .
Fortunately for me , the side of the road was a nice grassy embankment and instead of quite literally rolling off the face of the earth I decided to aim my body toward the embankment .
I mean what was the worst that could happen ?
I would likely just slam into it and leave a Wiley Coyote / Andrei - shaped impression in the grass .
It seemed like a good plan at the time and everything was going fine except , " OH SHIT , GRAVEL … WAIT WHO THE FUCK WOULD PUT GRAVEL ON THE SIDE OF A ROAD ?! "
Oh right , everyone .
It was believed that the Bible drove out the demons , but what was really medically fascinating was that it actually worked .
When my rollerblades hit the gravel , my feet went flying up in the air and my right hand went back to break my impact with the ground .
Wrist guards .
Fucking lazy ass salesman !
The sound I heard was not unlike the crack of a whip , which is never good , unless you 're into that kind of thing .
I picked myself ( and my pride ) up off the ground and checked things out .
Everything seemed fine … maybe it was just a slight sprain .
I walked the mile back to my off campus apartment and by the time I got back it was clear from the amount of swelling that a trip to the emergency room was in order .
Broken , in three places .
The ulna , the radius , and the scaphoid bone .
For all those non-premed people out there , that is both bones of your arm and a bone in your hand .
Fuck !
It was the start of the summer .
Gone were all the rock climbing trips , gone was my primary mode of transportation around campus ( bike ) , SHIT , gone was my life guarding job and all my money !
I got casted and proceeded with the " summer of shame " as it has now come to be known .
I healed really quickly and gained full mobility back , but there was always this nagging twinge in my wrist from that day forward .
Over time the twinges in my wrist got worse .
And what 's more , I developed this little bump on the back of my hand .
At first it was imperceptible , but after many arguments with myself over whether or not it was growing , it became clear I needed a return trip to the doctor .
He x-rayed my wrist and told me that it healed perfectly , almost too perfectly given the severity of the injury .
I kind of blanked out what he said after that because I was day dreaming about being a superhero with regenerative properties .
Then I was pulled back into reality by the words " Ganglion Cyst . "
Ganglion Cyst ?!
What the fuck is that ?
Apparently , after an injury , your joint can leak fluid through a one - way valve , thus filling a little balloon with thick , viscous joint fluid that applies pressure to nerves and causes discomfort in the way of twinges .
He informed me that there were only two things he could do : drain it or operate on it .
Or I could just leave it alone and live with it .
Well I was n't about to leave it alone because it was starting to look like someone had grafted a small marble under my skin and not only did it hurt , it was fucking gross .
So I opted for draining it .
But apparently " draining it " meant sticking a large bore needle into it and sucking out the fluid without any real anesthetic .
Now " large " bore needle and " fluid " does n't quite accurately describe what happened next .
That doctor took what I can only describe as a straw with a point on it and jabbed it into the bump on the back of my wrist .
I believe my exact words were , " AAGGHHHHH YOU MOTHER FUCKER , THAT ISN'T A NEEDLE , THAT'S A JAVELIN WITH A HOLE THROUGH IT !!! "
He then proceeded to draw the …" fluid " out of it .
Fluid , my ass !
I 'm a scientist and I know the definition of a fluid .
This stuff had the consistency and look of rubber cement , AFTER it hardens .
He then informed me that it would likely return over time due to stress to the joint , and that there are only two real good ways to get rid of them when draining does n't work .
I looked at him sideways and said , " Wait , two ways ?
You failed to mention something other than operating on it . "
He replied that he had told me there were only two things HE could do .
I , on the other hand , had the option of hitting it with a Bible .
WAIT , WHAT THE FUCK ?!
I JUST LET A BIBLE THUMPING WACK JOB STICK A NEEDLE THE SIZE OF A PENCIL IN MY WRIST ?!?
But he was no wack job , dear readers , the man was a genius .
He went on to explain that in the old days this was called a Bible Bump and was believed to be caused by demons ( bear with me here ) .
Apparently , the predominant way to cure it was to WHACK it with the only softbound book in the house that EVERYONE , even the poor , owned : a Bible .
It was believed that the Bible drove out the demons , but what was really medically fascinating was that it actually worked .
Hitting the cyst ruptures the bubble and allows your body to simply reabsorb the fluid , and any other new fluid now has nowhere to collect , causing the cyst to never form again .
Operating does the same thing because they rip up the bubble , but draining it just creates a tiny hole that eventually reseals .
He told me that if it was him , he would hit it .
It was n't something the medical world allows doctors to actually do for their patients ( for obvious reasons ) , but the cysts did eventually come to be known as " Gideon 's Disease " because of the most effective cure known .
I left his office wondering if he was a medical genius and quite the historian , or an all - out Bible - thumping quack ( literally ) .
After some online research I found many testimonies of people having their cysts drained only to have them return , and some who had them operated on only to return in other spots on their hand .
I only found a few references to " whacking it " but no one who actually could bring themselves to do it , so it was often cited as an urban legend .
Time passed and because of the stress I put on my wrists while rock climbing , the cyst reformed bigger than before it was drained .
The idea of operating on it and trading a bump for a scar was n't very appealing , and there was no way I was going to drain it again because that shit hurt like hell and was n't a permanent fix .
So I set my mind to whacking it .
For about a week I had this internal argument with myself .
Andrei for : Just hit it , and be done with it .
Andrei against : Dude , that 's an urban legend and I 'm not going to hit myself with a fucking bible .
Andrei for :
What if it works and goes away ?
Andrei against :
If this was something that actually worked , it would be well known and not complete hear say .
Andrei for :
That 's just because no one is hardcore enough to do it .
Andrei against : I do n't even own a bible , idiot .
Andrei for :
It does n't matter what book it is , it is the medical science of rupturing it .
Use The Joy of Cooking , you fucking pansy !
Andrei against : FINE !
I 'll hit it !
Andrei for : Good , just do it !
Andrei against : Wait , this is the wrist I broke in three places , and you want me to hit it ?!
Andrei for : YES , as hard as you can , without breaking it again .
Andrei against :
No wait , let me think about this some more .
Andrei for :
You 're such a pussy !
Back and forth we / I went until , one day , I was passing by my bookcase and saw The Joy of Cooking .
( What ?
Do n't judge , a man has to eat does n't he ? )
An all - too - familiar voice came into my head : " Just do it before you lose the nerve , you big weenie . "
I snatched that book off the shelf , put my hand on the table and brought that heavy tome down on my wrist like I was playing that hammer game at a circus .
To say that the pain was excruciating would be the understatement of the year , but to tell you the truth I did n't even care because I was more focused on the sound .
What I heard could only be described as a POP followed by a slight warming sensation .
My mind quickly raced as to whether or not I had just re-broken my wrist or popped the cyst .
I felt my wrist and everything seemed to be fine , and then I felt the bump and it was definitely more squishy than before .
Had I done it ?
I mean , it was still there but it was definitely different .
Over the next two weeks that bump got smaller and smaller and eventually disappeared altogether as the " fluid " slowly drained back into the surrounding tissue .
I have n't ever gotten another one since , and I do n't have the same twinges in my wrist anymore .
So apparently the best and least invasive cure for " Gideon 's Disease , " " Bible Bumps , " or " Ganglion Cysts " is to WHACK THAT THING AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN , without breaking your wrist of course .
Urban legend dispelled !
Now on to my real conundrum .
The Starbucks I used to go to every morning was also frequented by this attractive woman that I would see regularly .
I saw her so much that she became one of those people who you see and are eventually obligated to say hello to or smile at , just because you have a place in common with each other .
I noticed that she always drank her coffee out of an actual mug instead of the paper cups supplied by the place .
I also noticed one day that she had this enormous bump on her wrist and she was obviously self - conscious about it because she went to great lengths to cover it up .
What if ?
What if , my dear readers ?
What if I jumped up on to a chair , pinned her arm down on the table and brought her coffee mug down on that fucking thing so hard that the sound would make pigeons scatter in Central Park ?
I would then whisper in her ear as she screamed in pain , " You 'll thank me later , " and leave the place before any of the other customers could finish dialing 911 .
So I ask you , dear readers , is it wrong to want to smash a coffee mug into some woman 's wrist if it 's for her own good ?
9/11 Conspiracy Theorists Go After Glenn Beck
Created : February 22 , 2010 14:57 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Mark Dice , a somewhat well - known 9/11 conspiracy theorists , is launching a campaign against Glenn Beck for his disrespect of the “ truther ” movement .
Beck ’s adroit handling of fringe conservatives — he gets away with a lot on his show , in part , by instituting blanket bans on “ birther ” and “ truther ” distractions — culminated this month in his devastating interview with Debra Medina , a Ron Paul - inspired candidate for Texas governor who choked on a 9/11 question in an interview with the radio and TV talker .
Dice ’s previous career highlight :
Currently , twenty - plus states offer versions of “ Choose Life ” license plates , the sale of which raises money for anti-choice groups and “ crisis pregnancy centers . ”
Virginia is one of those states and so it stood to reason that choice activists would press the state to offer a “ Trust Women / Respect Choice ” license plate for sale which would support organizations that offer reproductive health services .
Both Gov. Bob McDonnell and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli both opposed any effort to send money from such license plates to Planned Parenthood , and now it looks like Virginia legislators have stepped in to make sure that it nevers happens :
In what pro-life advocates are hailing as a brilliant legislative move , Virginia lawmakers stripped Planned Parenthood funding from its own bill to sponsor pro-abortion license plates .
The plate bill now sends the proceeds from sales of the plate to a state fund that actually helps pregnant women .
Money generated from the sales of the “ Trust Women , Respect Choice ” license plates was intended to go to the Planned Parenthood abortion business .
When Democrat Delegate Robert Brink ’s brought up the bill , on the House floor in preparation for today ’s final vote , the legislation said the Virginia League of Planned Parenthood would receive $ 15 of the $ 25 plate fee .
In an interesting turn of events , Delegate Todd Gilbert , a Republican , offered an amendment to the bill to change it so all funding would go to the Virginia Pregnant Women Support Fund — a move that the pro-life Family Forum group describes as a devastating blow to Planned Parenthood .
The Virginia Pregnant Women Support Fund was created in 2007 to “ support women and families who are facing unplanned pregnancy ” and is managed by the Virginia Board of Health .
The goals are far different from Planned Parenthood ’s abortion agenda as it provides funding for ultrasound machines , parenting programs , and other support .
So if you buy the state ’s “ Choose Life ” license plate , a portion of the fee goes to support anti-choice pregnancy centers in the state .
And if you eventually purchase a “ Respect Choice ” plate , a portion of that fee goes to a fund that does pretty much the exact same thing and in no way actually supports choice at all .
Smartphones are providing upward mobility for Oregon software developers .
The gadgets that brought computing to the palmtop also have invigorated young technologists clustered around downtown Portland .
These small firms anticipated the devices ' popularity and leapt into the wide - open market for mobile " apps , " software applications designed specifically for the iPhone or similar gadgets .
Founded

Services
: Software that plugs into other companies ' apps to make it easy to add features , such as " push " notification and purchases within apps .
Funding
: $ 1.1 million from True Ventures ( Bay Area ) and Founders Co-Op ( Seattle )
App development is relatively straightforward , and online app stores relatively egalitarian .
That means even tiny firms from Oregon 's modest software community can compete in the emerging field .
" Urban Airship owns three laptops .
That 's it .
Those are our assets , " said Scott Kveton , whose four - person firm in Portland 's Pearl District designs software tools for app developers .
" We 've bootstrapped this sucker with savings and credit cards , " Kveton said .
Urban Airship gets some breathing room this week .
The company plans to announce today that it 's raised $ 1.1 million in venture capital to add software engineers and services .
The funding is the first of its kind for a mobile app company in Portland , representing a milestone for the city 's fledgling mobile developer community .
That community is small -- maybe 30 firms , all told , employing no more than a dozen developers apiece .
But they 've turned out dozens of apps , including popular titles like the Fieldrunners game and a utility called Air Sharing .
Portland developers also have built apps for Starbucks , The Wall Street Journal , Nike , Intel and many other big companies .
Mobile computing has captured the attention of big tech companies , too .
At a major industry event Monday in Barcelona , Intel announced
with a parallel effort from cell phone maker Nokia .
Microsoft unveiled an overhauled version of its mobile operating system at the same event , adding features Apple and Google popularized .
Other mobile developers in the area
( downtown Portland ) : Games and utilities , including the Air Sharing file storage app .
( Southeast Portland ) : Web site and mobile app contract developer
( downtown Portland ) : Mobile apps for Clearwire and eBay
( Missouri ) : Handmark acquired Southeast Portland 's FreeRange Communications a year ago ; the Portland office continues to manage the company 's mobile publishing business .
Clients include The Wall Street Journal and the Portland Trail Blazers .
( downtown Vancouver ) : Mobile maps
Night & Day Studios ( Southeast Portland ) : Develops apps in - house , and as a contractor

Eventually , the mobile space may suffer the kind of painful shakeout that befell other maturing technologies .
App stores are already crowded as developers from all over the world converge to peddle their wares .
At the moment , though , mobile keeps growing .
Developers anticipate a fresh infusion of app demand when Apple releases its iPad tablet computer next month .
And , with startup costs low , sometimes a good idea is all it takes to thrive .
" That barrier has been brought down so that you have a one - or two - person shop that builds something and gets distribution and can make money , " said Peter Farago , vice president of marketing for Flurry Inc. , a California company that tracks activity in the mobile industry .
The rise of app developers is emblematic of a new direction in Oregon technology , where software historically played a minor role .
While the Silicon Valley and Seattle built large software industries in the 1980s and '90s , Oregon focused on high - tech manufacturing .
Many of those production jobs vanished in the dot - com contraction at the start of the last decade , never to return , as manufacturing shifted overseas .
Fifteen years of job gains were wiped out , sending the state 's high - tech employment back to 1996 levels .
Even as hardware was fading , software development became more open and collaborative , allowing small companies and individual developers to make headway in an industry largely dominated by power players like Microsoft .
With mobile apps , that trend has continued .
" We 're big for an iPhone company , " said Dave Howell , CEO of Avatron Software , which moved its seven employees from Vancouver last month to a new office on the 41st floor of the U.S. Bancorp Tower in downtown Portland .
The company , which makes a variety of utilities and apps for the iPhone , is toying around with ideas for the larger iPad tablet computer .
" We 're thinking about what the demographic is for the iPad , " Howell said who believes the larger screen will be especially inviting for young kids , given its gaming potential .
" The things we 're going to be able to do , technically , are going to be much better than what we were able to do on a tiny screen , " he said .
But even with bigger screens , Portland 's mobile firms may remain small .
Competition is fierce , and today 's independent developers might never grow really big , cautions Mark Beccue , senior analyst for consumer mobility at ABI research .
" It 's not something that a lot of people are going to make a lot of money at , " he said .
That does n't mean these small companies are doomed , though .
" If you 're three guys in a garage , your relative sense of success is going to be smaller , " Beccue said .
On that scale , the app ecosystem plays to Portland 's strength , according to Raven Zachary , a nationally known iPhone developer in Portland .
" It 's a very nice fit for that because most mobile development is coming from independents .
Consolidation has n't happened yet , " said Zachary , whose 18 - month - old firm , Small Society , builds apps for big brands , including Starbucks , Zipcar and Whole Foods .
It 's not at all clear that Portland has a higher concentration of developers than other mobile hotspots -- the San Francisco Bay Area , Seattle and New York City among them .
But Zachary said mobile software does n't demand geographic concentration , and he finds plenty of developer talent here at home .
" So I think there 's an opportunity for this to grow up and stay in Portland , " he said .
Portland has " the right DNA " for an enduring mobile cluster , agrees Jon Maroney , who founded the Portland mobile publishing firm FreeRange Communications .
But , to endure , he said , mobile developers will need to grow .
A Missouri company , Handmark , bought FreeRange last year .
Maroney and his staff stayed on and now run Handmark 's mobile publishing business from Southeast Portland .
His clients include the Portland Trail Blazers and The Wall Street Journal .
Portland 's mobile startups need more big projects like those , Maroney said , and big partnerships .
And he said that while the city 's developers have established an expertise on the iPhone , they 'll eventually need to diversify to other platforms -- such as the Blackberry and phones using Google 's Android operating system .
At the moment , one hot app is enough to sustain a business .
But in Maroney 's view , apps will ultimately be a means to an end , connecting users to a broad range of services , online and off .
" We 're not going to grow an economy here and be successful just by doing iPhone apps , " he said .
" It 's got to be more than that . "

Bloomberg
ACCORDING to Paul Krugman , the winner of a Nobel prize for economics and a columnist for the New York Times , modern America is much like 18th - century Poland .
On his telling , Poland was rendered largely ungovernable by the parliament 's requirement for unanimity , and disappeared as a country for more than a century .
James Fallows , after several years in China as a writer for the Atlantic Monthly , wrote on his return that he found in America a vital and self - renewing culture that attracts the world 's talent and “ a governing system that increasingly looks like a joke ” .
Tom Friedman , another columnist for the New York Times , reported from the annual World Economic Forum in Davos last month that he had never before heard people abroad talking about “ political instability ” in America .
But these days he did .
The growing idea among influential pundits that America is “ ungovernable ” is being driven in large part by Barack Obama 's failure so far to pass some of the main laws he wants to .
And it is , indeed , a puzzle .
Here , after all , is a president who only just over a year ago won a handsome mandate : 53 % of the popular vote and big majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
He bounded into office with a mountainous agenda , including plans to overhaul America 's health - care system and cut its greenhouse emissions .
He seemed until quite recently to be doing reasonably well .
In a folksy December interview with Oprah Winfrey he awarded himself “ a good , solid B - plus ” .
The House passed a cap - and - trade bill last year on greenhouse gases .
By the beginning of this year the House and Senate had each passed a health - reform bill .
But now Mr Obama is suddenly stuck .
Barring a legislative miracle , it looks next to impossible for him to push these bills to the finishing line .
On health , he is making ever - louder pleas to his Republican foes to bail him out .
They have reluctantly accepted his invitation to a bipartisan summit on health reform at the White House next week ( voters do not like the minority party to be entirely obstructive ) .
But with mid-term elections in November , the Republicans have every reason not to throw the floundering Democrats a lifeline .
How did as shrewd a politician as Mr Obama find himself stalemated , if not checkmated , so early in his presidency ?
The answer can be found in the intersection of a rule , an event and a trend .
The rule is Standing Rule XXII of the Senate .
The event was last month 's election in Massachusetts for a successor to the late Senator Ted Kennedy .
And the trend is the relentless polarisation in recent decades not only of American political parties , but also of the American people .
Catch -XXII
Take a deep breath and start with the rule .
For most of the 19th century the majority in the Senate had no way to move to “ cloture ” — ie , end a filibuster and force a vote .
This ( remember Jimmy Stewart in “ Mr Smith Goes to Washington ” ) enabled almost any senator to block almost any measure just by keeping on talking .
In 1917 , prompted by a filibuster against Woodrow Wilson 's wish to take America into the first world war , the Senate adopted Rule XXII , which said that it could move to cloture if two - thirds of senators present voted for it .
Today 's version requires the assent of three - fifths of all senators , in other words 60 out of the 100 .
It may sound arcane , but Rule XXII has big consequences .
It means , in effect , that new legislation can be forced to muster a 60 - vote supermajority in the Senate .
Happily for Mr Obama , a Republican from Pennsylvania , Arlen Specter , decided last April to join the Democrats .
His defection , followed by the ruling that Al Franken had squeaked to victory in Minnesota , eventually gave the Senate Democrats a filibuster - proof supermajority .
This appeared to put health reform — the achievement that eluded Bill Clinton — well within reach .
So Mr Obama seemed to take no risks in making this one of his chief tests of success as a president .
By the beginning of this year , success looked close .
The House passed its version of a health bill in November .
The Senate followed just before Christmas .
All that was required when Congress returned last month was for the two bills to be combined so that a joint version could be passed by each chamber again .
But on January 19th Scott Brown , a Republican , captured the old Kennedy seat in Massachusetts , bumping the Republicans in the Senate up to 41 and destroying the Democratic supermajority at a stroke .
The very next week Mr Obama went to Capitol Hill and pleaded with Congress not to walk away from reform when it had got so close .
But the whole plan may now be dead .
This sequence of events has been miserable for the Democrats .
But why portray it as a crisis of governability ?
The answer is the light it casts on the Senate .
With two senators for each state regardless of population , the Senate reflects the founders ' dread of an over - mighty centre and the states ' determination to entrench their prerogatives .
But to the modern eye the Senate looks perversely non-majoritarian , especially given Rule XXII .
If 41 senators can block a bill , and if they all happen to come from the least - populated states , politicians representing about a tenth of the population can block the work of Congress .
Still , Rule XXII has been on the Senate 's books for almost a century .
Why the fuss about it now ?
Here it is necessary to look at the third point of the legislative Bermuda Triangle into which Mr Obama has sailed : the polarisation of the political parties over the past 20 years .
The supermajority rule would be no bad thing if it forced the majority party to reach out to the other side .
The Democrats themselves have often been glad of it , for example to block some of George Bush junior 's judicial appointments .
And the rule has not prevented Congress from passing far - reaching social legislation in the past .
The creation of Social Security in 1935 and of Medicare in 1965 attracted support from both parties .
But that was when the ideologies of the parties overlapped in the middle and made bipartisanship easier .
Now they have grown more polarised , and in Congress the Republicans in particular have become highly disciplined .
Just how disciplined became clear as health reform moved slowly through Congress last year .
In the House many Democrats defied their leadership and opposed the bill .
But only one House Republican was willing to vote in favour , and none at all in the Senate .
If the Republicans persist in voting the party line , they can now block pretty much whatever Mr Obama and the Democrats want to do .
And with the mid-terms looming , that is a tempting strategy .
“ Congress is not operating as it should , ” despaired Senator Evan Bayh , a conservative Democrat .
Mr Bayh announced this week that he had decided to retire because “ brain - dead partisanship ” was preventing “ the people 's business ” from getting done .
He recommended a wholesale ejection of incumbents in November , and their replacement by people who cared about reforming the system .
A moment , not a pattern
The president cannot fulfil his mandate .
The majority cannot pass its bills .
So , case proven : America is ungovernable .
Well , no .
For a start , the moment of paralysis described above is just that : a moment , not a pattern .
In fact America 's government has been anything but supine of late .
Many Americans , not least the strident “ tea - party ” populists who helped Mr Brown to victory in Massachusetts , complain that Uncle Sam has if anything been hyperactive since the financial crisis of 2008 .
Between the last bit of George Bush 's administration and the beginning of Mr Obama's , the federal government has spent some $ 700 billion to bail out the banks and another $ 787 billion to stimulate the economy .
It has taken an ownership share in parts of the car industry and forced other sectors to reorganise .
Right now , government is one of America 's few growth industries .
Nor is it the case that Congress has stymied the whole of Mr Obama 's agenda .
On most fronts the president has so far had his way .
This applies not only to the usual presidential preserve of foreign affairs —
Mr Obama has withdrawn troops from Iraq and , controversially , sent more to Afghanistan — but to domestic policy as well .
Norman Ornstein is a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute and the co-author of a book ( “ The Broken Branch ” ) that laments the decline of Congress .
So it is striking that he of all people argued in the Washington Post recently that the present Congress is set to be “ one of the most productive ” since the momentous 89th Congress of 1965 - 66 , during which Lyndon Johnson pushed through the scores of bills that created his “ great society ” .
In fairness , Mr Ornstein reaches this verdict by taking a very upbeat view of the stimulus package .
This , he notes , included $ 288 billion in tax cuts , “ one of the largest tax cuts in history ” , with credits for energy conservation and renewable - energy production as well as home - buying and college tuition .
The package promised $ 19 billion for health - information technology , and more than $ 1 billion to test the effectiveness of health - care treatments .
Stimulus money found its way into school reform , a smart grid for electricity and expanded access to broadband internet .
Had any Congress passed all these measures separately , Mr Ornstein says , it would be considered enormously productive .
This Congress did it all in one bill , and also enacted other big measures , such as an expansion of children 's health insurance and a broad land - conservation law .
This is not the record of a paralysed administration .
But then again , much of the present talk about ungovernability relates not to the recent past but to the immediate future .
Of course Mr Obama could get things done when he had a supermajority , and the stimulus even passed without one .
But he was voted into office for four years , and has been stopped in his tracks after only one .
If the Republicans do well in the mid-terms , Mr Ornstein fears , they will try even harder to cripple Mr Obama by opposing all the Democrats ' initiatives .
Perhaps they will — though the Republicans might injure their own chances if they become only the “ party of no ” .
But even if Mr Ornstein 's fears are realised , a president who cannot legislate has other ways to get things done .
He can , for example , use executive authority .
Even before the setback in Massachusetts , Mr Obama saw this as one way to cut carbon emissions if the Senate failed to pass a cap - and - trade bill .
On the day the Copenhagen summit started last December , the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that greenhouse gases were a threat to public health .
In principle this gives the agency wide authority to create new rules curbing the carbon emissions of cars and factories .
Since Massachusetts , the White House 's interest in governing by regulation has grown .
Rahm Emanuel , Mr Obama 's chief of staff , told the New York Times last week that the administration was reviewing a list of presidential orders and directives “ to get the job done across a front of issues ” .
One example is the habit Senate Republicans have made of holding up staff appointments to the administration , often for tactical reasons unrelated to the merits of the candidates .
But the president has a countervailing power : he can make “ recess appointments ” when Congress is not sitting .
As soon as the White House threatened recently to do just this , the Republicans confirmed a score of posts they had previously blocked .
In short , a president blocked in Congress is not without resources .
It is not that long , after all , since commentators were panicking not about the impotence of the presidency but about Mr Bush 's war on terrorism invigorating an “ imperial presidency ” at the expense of Congress , civil liberties and the courts .
War and economic crisis have always augmented the powers of the White House , and for the foreseeable future Mr Obama will continue to enjoy the dubious “ benefits ” of both .
The questionable mandate
There is , besides , a deeper question to be asked of those who sum up the present deadlock in terms of Congress blocking Mr Obama 's mandate .
In November 2008 Americans preferred him over John McCain .
They got the president they wanted .
But that does not mean that they intended to give him a blank cheque .
On the contrary , a case can be made that most Americans were always cool towards some of the policies that Mr Obama and the Democratic leadership chose to turn into their tests of success .
In early 2009 Pietro Nivola , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , trawled the opinion polls to discover whether the public was leaning left or right on the dominant policy questions as the Bush presidency ended and Mr Obama 's began .
They showed that Americans had tilted towards the Democrats only on some matters .
They supported the financial bail - out and the stimulus package , but only by slender majorities .
As for the environment , support for the government “ doing more ” to tackle global warming evaporated when respondents were asked less abstract questions , such as whether they were willing to pay more for electricity .
Mr Nivola 's essay , published in April last year , warned Democratic policymakers to be wary of following too radical an agenda .
Much of the public was doubtful about the ability of government to meet the nation 's challenges .
The governing party , he argued , was therefore operating “ with precious little margin for error ” .
As for health care , a difficult subject the world over ( see article ) , voters were likelier to prefer marginal adjustments of the system to a fundamental restructuring .
Even in the recession , Mr Nivola observed , nine out of ten workers continued to have jobs , and most had health insurance .
The warning was prescient .
By the time Massachusetts cost Mr Obama his supermajority , support for health reform had dropped away ( see chart ) .
Indeed , polls taken after the vote confirmed that worries about the costs of reform helped Mr Brown to win .
Whatever the objective merits of the plan , Mr Obama has so far failed to sell it .
To that extent , the Republicans are reflecting the popular will , not obstructing it .
Far from being broken , it could be argued , American democracy is working with exquisite sensitivity , allowing the administration to advance where it has the people 's support but checking it when it overreaches .
Needless to say , the people are not always well - informed , let alone right or consistent in their wants .
In America special - interest groups spend vast sums shaping both legislation and broader public attitudes .
The non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics reported on February 12th that companies and other organisations spent a record $ 3.5 billion on lobbying in 2009 , much of it targeted on the administration 's health and energy bills .
And this , notes James Thurber of American University 's Centre for Congressional and Presidential Studies , includes only what is recorded by registered lobbyists , not money spent for grassroots organising , coalition - building , advertising and advocacy on the internet .
On some estimates , Mr Thurber says , the total spent on lobbying in Washington is closer to $ 9 billion a year .
Even before he became president , Mr Obama vowed to cut the lobbyists down to size .
He promised to “ change how Washington works ” , declaring that lobbyists would not be allowed to run the party or the White House or “ drown out the voice of the American people ” .
That makes it tempting for him to blame his embarrassment now not only on Republican obstruction but also on the resistance of vested interests , such as health insurers .
And yet it is not primarily the special - interest groups that have blocked his plans for health reform .
For all his high - toned talk about changing Washington 's ways , Mr Obama was careful to co-opt the most powerful interest groups in advance .
The health - insurance industry was broadly supportive , given that reform promised tens of millions of new customers .
The pharmaceutical industry lobbied on the administration 's side — once it was told its interests would be protected .
Most of the opposition appears to have bubbled up from ordinary people who did not like or understand what was being proposed .
And Mr Obama did too little to persuade them or to shape the debate in Congress .
How much government ?
If he falls short , millions of Americans will feel bitter disappointment .
But the failure of any president to realise such large goals in his first year does not discredit the whole system .
In the end , the question of whether a country is governable turns on how much government you think it needs .
America 's founders injected suspicion of government not only into the constitution but also into the political DNA of its people .
And even in the teeth of today 's economic woes , at least as many Americans seem to think that what ails them is too much government , not too little .
EPA
But there is a catch .
However much Americans say they want a small government , they seem wedded to the expensive benefits of the big one they actually have , such as Social Security , health care for the elderly and a strong national defence .
With deficits running at $ 1 trillion a year , and in order to stay solvent , they will have at some point to cut spending , pay more taxes , or both .
Last month the Senate blocked a proposal for a bipartisan commission on deficit reduction : the yeas outnumbered the nays by 53 to 46 , but failed to reach a supermajority .
Mr Obama is now creating a commission by executive order , but its powers are unclear .
To balance the books , politicians have sometimes to do things the people themselves oppose — even in America .
That will be the true test of whether the country is governable .

People who live around Sun Life Stadium in Miami -- where Super Bowl XLIV will be played a week from Sunday -- have received this advisory -- watch your kids , because Pete Townshend of The Who fame is coming to town .
Townshend became a registered sex offender after being arrested in 2003 in a pedophilia sting in the UK .
Townshend was not convicted but placed on a sex offenders list .
The Who is playing the halftime show at the Super Bowl and several child abuse organizations have sent postcards to 1500 homes and several schools close to the stadium , warning that Townshend will be in town .
A new report from the Pew foundation delves into " Women , Men , and the New Economics of Marriage , " but judging from media reactions to the data , it really should have been titled " The Rise of the Sugar Mama . "

Many of the stories discuss the net benefit to men having a solvent spouse and how it can improve quality of life overall .
An article from the Associated Press hones in on the area of the Pew study that explains how the changing trends in marriage impact household incomes :
One barometer is median household income - which rose 60 percent between 1970 and 2007 for married men , married women and unmarried women , but only 16 percent for unmarried men , according to the Pew data .

NPR looks at the data from the angle of working through some of the shifts in cultural expectations that can place strains on marriages .
After demonstrating the historical changes ( like how up until 1964 , it was legal to fire a woman if she got married ) , the article refers to how some men feel shameful dipping into their wives ' money , or feel as though they are failing as men if their spouse is the breadwinner for the household .
The piece also contains an interesting supplement to the main article :
Black wives have long been more likely than whites to be in the labor force .
Already in 1970 , black women faced a marriage gap :
Those with college degrees were more likely to be married .
That remains true today .
But as the Pew report notes , marriage overall has declined more sharply among African - Americans than the population as a whole .

What NPR turns into a footnote , the New York Times flips into a trend piece .
While the Pew Study is about men marrying women who are higher earners and higher educated , the New York Times put its piece squarely in familiar territory - the single , high earning professional female who can't find a man .
Ms. Zielinski , the fashion stylist , said her best friend , a man , told her once : " ‘ You are confident , have good credit , own your own business , travel around the world and are self - sufficient .
What man is going to want you ? '
He laughed , but I found that pretty depressing . "

The spin on this one can't be any clearer :
An analysis of census data to be released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that she and countless women like her are victims of a role reversal that is profoundly affecting the pool of potential marriage partners .

The Washington Post provides perspectives from female journalists in two different articles on the research .
Donna St. George tackles the Pew findings , and pays careful attention to an assertion that wives are the higher income spouses .
In two separate paragraphs , she stresses how women are not out earning their spouses .
Men are still the major contributors of household income — with 78 percent making at least as much or more than their wives — but the percentage of women whose income has outpaced their husband 's has more than quadrupled , jumping from just 4 percent in 1970 to 22 percent now .
Men still out - earn women , but the gap is narrowing .
In 2007 , full - year women workers had median earnings of about $ 33,000 , which was 71 percent of men's median earnings of about $ 46,000 .
Back in 1970 , women 's earnings were 52 percent of men's .
Advertisement
It 's true that more and more women are becoming the main breadwinners in the household but tremendous gains do n't necessarily translate to paycheck parity .
Petula Dvorak , writing for the Washington Post also looks at the underside of the data in her column , noting : " It continues to be a man 's world , only a little more comfy these days . "
Dvorak explains that while marriage becomes a sweeter deal for men , studies about women report increasing levels of unhappiness ; she zeroes in on one of the major issues of discord - that although women 's roles in the workplace have changed , they are still expected to pick up the slack at home .
We are a generation of working women trapped between two extremes .
There is the 1950s uber -mom , with the apron , the after - school cookies , the costumes sewn for the school play and the tucking in with a kiss every night .
She could n't be a career woman , that just was n't done .
And then there 's the 1980s power - mom , who was taught never to bring baked goods into the office , wore the woman - suit with the floppy bow tie , carried the briefcase and the tied the house key around the kid 's neck with scratchy yarn .
No need for a pot roast in the oven — they 'd just invented the microwave !
So millennial mom is now expected to be both .

MILAN / ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian judge sentenced 23 Americans to up to eight years in prison on Wednesday for the abduction of a Muslim cleric , in a symbolic condemnation of the CIA “ rendition ” flights used by the former U.S. government .
The Americans were all tried in absentia because the United States refused to extradite them .
The U.S. State Department expressed its disappointment with the verdict , the first of its kind , but campaigners who have long complained that the renditions policy violated basic human rights said the ruling set an important precedent .
“ This decision sends a clear message to all governments that even in the fight against terrorism you can’t forsake the basic rights of our democracies , ” said prosecutor Armando Spataro .
Judge Oscar Magi handed down the convictions for the abduction of Egyptian - born cleric Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr , snatched off a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation .
The heaviest sentence -- eight years in prison -- was handed down to the former head of the CIA ’s Milan station , Robert Seldon Lady , while 21 other former agents got five years each .
U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Romano was also sentenced to five years , despite a request from the Pentagon that the case should be tried by U.S. courts .
Magi dropped the case against three Americans , including a former CIA Rome station chief , because of diplomatic immunity .
Charges were also dropped against five Italians , including the former head of the Sismi military intelligence service , Nicolo Pollari , because evidence against them violated state secrecy rules .
However , the judge sentenced two more junior Sismi agents to three years in prison as accomplices , indicating Italian authorities were aware of the abduction .
“ LIKE A SLAUGHTERED SHEEP ”
The judge ruled that those convicted should pay 1 million euros in damages to Nasr , better known as Abu Omar , and 500,000 euros to his wife .
Abu Omar , under surveillance by Italian police at the time of his abduction on suspicion of recruiting militants for Iraq , was secretly flown from Aviano airbase in northeast Italy via Ramstein base in Germany to Egypt , where he says he was tortured and held until 2007 without charge .
“ I was hung up like a slaughtered sheep and given electric shocks , ” Abu Omar has told Human Rights Watch .
It is the first case to contest the practice of “ extraordinary rendition ” under the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush , in which terrorism suspects were captured in one country and taken for questioning in another , where interrogation techniques were tougher .
The trial , which began in 2007 , tested U.S. - Italian relations .
It moved slowly because successive Italian governments , including Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s conservative administration , refused to seek the extradition of the U.S. defendants .

The Tactical Shotgun
Scattergun Technologies " Professional " Model Remington 870
Introduction
The repeating 12 ga . combat shotgun has been a law enforcement weapon for 100 years now , starting with the introduction of the Winchester 1897 pump shotgun .
And , while it 's reputation as a manstopper is legendary , unfortunately little has changed in the past 100 years .
If you consider the pump shotguns currently in use by law enforcement agencies , most are still pump action , bead sighted , cylinder bore , 4 - 6 shot weapons .
Other than the exposed hammer , the Winchester 1897 could be used today and do just as adequately as many of the shotguns we currently have available .
This does n't mean that there is n't room for improvement .
Indeed there is .
The way in which we 've viewed , and been using , shotguns for the past century has been much like someone who owns a high performance automobile , but never takes it past second gear .
The shotgun is capable of doing much more .
But , until very recently no one has had the interest or taken the time and effort to see just how far the performance envelope of the shotgun could be pushed .
Most of the credit for bringing the shotgun out of the 19th century and into the 21st century goes to Jeff Cooper and the staff of the Gunsite Training Center , who continue his work .
In the 1980's Col . Cooper and his staff took a long hard look at combat shotguns with the goal of improving the weapons themselves and the manner in which they are handled , fired , and employed in gunfights .
They were successful and the result of their efforts is the tactical shotgun concept .
Basically this is a more modern and realistic approach to the shotgun as a Close Quarters Battle ( CQB ) weapon along with a series of modifications which take the shotgun to previously unreachable performance levels .
No longer is this weapon considered a mere point and fire " alley sweeper " good only for extremely close confrontations .
Nor is 50 yards ever again going to be considered the maximum effective range for slugs with this weapon .
With a properly configured tactical shotgun you have the most powerful and effective close range shoulder fired weapon in existence as well as a weapon that is capable of delivering accurate solid projectile fire out to 125 + yards .
It 's also a weapon capable of employing less lethal specialty impact munitions , barricade penetrating gas rounds , lockbuster rounds , aerial burst distraction devices , flares and any number of unusual lethal force specialty rounds .
In short it 's extremely effective and versatile .
Fortunately , some of the shotgun manufacturers have started to pay attention and are now making shotguns that are capable of tactical shotgun performance .
But an understanding of the specific attributes of the tactical shotgun design is needed in order to make a truly informed choice .
What I intend to do with this presentation is to discuss the attributes of the tactical shotgun , and in doing so , dispel some of the myths and misconceptions of the shotgun that have halted it 's development .
In the end , hopefully , you 'll have a greater understanding and appreciation of the weapon .
Attributes of the tactical shotgun
Base gun
There are quite a few shotgun manufacturers out there and nearly all of them produce some type of combat type shotgun .
Most are 14 " - 20 " barreled guns with magazine capacities ranging from 4 to 8 rounds .
Assuming the gun is well made and from a reputable manufacturer any of these guns are a good platform to start from .
But , as with anything , some companies make a better product than others .
For pump shotguns , Remington and Mossberg make the best product .
Of the two , Remington has better overall quality .
But , they 've been extremely slow in improving their design and it's still very much the same gun as when it was introduced in the 1950's .
Mossberg guns are n't as slick or smooth as the Remingtons .
But , they 've been more inclined to improve their products and incorporate useful design features to improve the performance of their shotguns .
The nice thing about Mossberg is that you can actually buy an affordable tactical shotgun right over the counter , whereas the Remington is going to involve some gunsmithing to get the same design features .
In the end the Remington will be nicer , but your wallet will be thinner too .
Mossberg 590a1
As for autoloaders , Remington , Mossberg , H&K / Benelli , and Beretta all make very good base guns .
None are true tactical shotguns out of the box and all will require some enhancements to improve performance .

Pump vs. autoloader
I should start by stating , for the record , that I prefer pump action shotguns over autoloaders .
And , I have a few good reasons for this .
To begin with , given a properly trained operator , pump guns are much more reliable than autoloaders .
Autoloading designs are better than they used to be , but they still malfunction with much greater frequency than pump guns .
Especially in adverse conditions .
Autoloaders are faster than pump guns .
But not as much as you might think .
With a little training a pump user can keep up quite well .
The speed advantage just is n't so great as to make me want to accept the increased malfunction rate of the autoloader as a compromise .
Being either gas or inertia operated , autoloaders are ammunition sensitive and , generally , incapable of reliably cycling reduced recoil " tactical " buck or slugs .
Nor , will they cycle special purpose ammunition such as specialty impact munitions , gas rounds , lock buster rounds , distraction devices , etc .
This limits their usefulness and versatility as a tactical team weapon .
The pump guns will fire anything you can get it to chamber .
Thus are more versatile in the long run .
Pump guns are much simpler to operate than autoloaders .
It is n't rocket science , but autoloaders are more difficult and demanding to operate .
I prefer simplicity myself .
And lastly is the issue of price .
Autoloaders cost much more than pump guns .
In some cases , well over twice as much .
Taken altogether auto loaders are ; expensive , ammunition sensitive , less versatile , more complicated , and more prone to malfunction than pump guns .
Their only selling point is that they 're faster than pump guns .
But again , not by much .
There is one design worth considering , though , that gives you the best of both worlds .
That design is the Benelli M - 3 .
This is a combination pump / autoloader which allows you , with a simple " flick of a switch " , to use the gun as a rapid fire auto loader , or a pump capable of firing specialty ammunition .
And , it manages to do this without unnecessary bulk , unlike previous designs such as the Franchi SPAS - 12 .
The only downside is cost .
These , like all Benelli shotguns , are expensive .
But they 're well worth it .

Sights
The bead sight is absolutely the worst sight choice for a combat shotgun .
Bead sights are fast and adequate for general torso area shot placement at very short ranges .
But , due to their spherical shape and the lack of a rear sight for reference , precise shot placement is extremely difficult at extended ranges .
The only reason they 've continued to be used is due to the misconception that the combat shotgun is a close range only weapon .
The deer sight is a bit of an improvement .
But , the design is seriously flawed .
With the deer sight you have an open notch rear sight that is generally very small .
Even worse is it 's placement well forward on the barrel .
This results in a sight radius scarcely longer than that of a six inch revolver .
This sight makes longer shots possible , but difficult .
The single greatest improvement you can make towards extending the capability of the shotgun to hit with slugs at long distance is the addition of a receiver mounted ghost ring sight system .
With the ghost ring you have a large aperture peep sight mounted back on the receiver where a rear sight is supposed to be .
This gives a proper sight radius coupled with a design that 's quickly and easily acquired at any range .
At 100 + yards center mass shots are easily accomplished with this sight .
Yes , 100 yard shots can be made with a bead sight .
But , only by very skilled shooters .
And , even then , they are n't done very quickly .
Give a ghost ring equipped shotgun to that same skilled shooter and see what happens .
Another benefit of ghost ring sights is the ability to precisely place shot patterns at close ranges .
Within 3 - 5 yards the shot pattern on most cylinder bore guns is still very tight and seldom larger than 6 inches .
At these ranges , because of the small shot pattern , the shotgun is fired like a rifle .
With ghost ring sights you can precisely place that shot pattern exactly where you want it to go , to include hostage taker shots .
With the bead sight , just like at the extended ranges , this again is n't easily done , nor does it tend to be as precise as with the ghost ring sights .
If , after all of this , you 're still sold on the bead sight , just ask yourself ; when was the last time you saw a new production tactical carbine or SMG made with a bead sight .
This ancient design needs to be done away with and put in the grave with blackpowder muskets .
As for the best after market ghost ring sight to purchase for your weapon , MMC currently makes the best unit around .
The rear sight rests in a solid steel base which has large protective " wings " on each side .
This sight is very rugged and is built to withstand a lot of abuse .
Quite a bit of thought and development went into this sight .
One area in particular is in the sight adjustment screw .
The slot is nice and wide and adjustments are easily made with the extractor rim of a 12 ga .
shotgun shell .
Very convenient .
MMC rear sight
Another popular ghost ring sight is the Trac - Lock from Scattergun Technologies .
This was the first mass production ghost ring sight aimed specifically at the shotgun market .
It 's a good sight .
But , it lacks any form of protection for the sight , unlike the MMC .
When you have your ghost ring sights installed , the front sight will obviously need to be replaced .
When it is , make sure you have it permanently attached by either having it pinned or soldered to the barrel .
Using epoxy , no matter how advanced the formula is , wo n't guarantee the sight will stay on the barrel .
And , Murphy 's Law says that if your front sight is going to fall off it'll happen right in the middle of a gun fight .
Make sure that does n't become a possibility .
As for the best factory ghost ring sights , Benelli and Mossberg both offer good units for their guns .
While not as well done as the MMC , they 're good designs nonetheless .
The worst , though , is the new Remington design .
I have no idea why they did this , other than the " it was n't invented here , so it must not be any good , therefore we will put our own spin on it " mentality .
The rear sight is fairly decent .
But , for the front sight they use a bead mounted on a square post !
So , basically you still have a bead sighted gun , just with a better rear sight .
The sight picture is atrocious !
They really need to re-think that design .

Barrel choking system
In law enforcement gunfights we have to account for every round we fire .
This leads to a real problem in the general use of buckshot .
While 00 buckshot is a tremendously effective manstopper , with cylinder bore shotguns it just simply can't be used for targets beyond 12 to 18 yards , depending on the gun and the shooter .
Targets beyond the effective range of your buckshot require a transition to a slug in order to ensure you do n't have stray pellets going past your attacker .
What 's needed is a barrel choking system that will tighten your pattern and extend the useful range of your shotgun with buckshot .
While we 're on the subject of patterning , let me tell you this ; ALL shotguns pattern differently and their patterns change depending on the load .
DO NOT take this lightly .
You must pattern YOUR shotgun with a given load , and stay with the load that patterns best in YOUR GUN .
The old rule of thumb that states that 00 Buckshot spreads at a rate of 1 inch per yard traveled is a very general rule indeed .
I can put four identical shotguns from the same production run , with consecutive serial numbers even , on the firing line at 7 yards and get patterns measuring from 4 " to 10 " .
Then I can switch loads and watch the patterns change from good to bad and vice versa .
Even worse , some shotguns will produce " doughnut " patterns .
In this case the shot will strike in a circular pattern leaving an absence of shot in the middle of the pattern .
As the ranges increase , the likelihood of the pattern passing completely around your intended target increases .
Fortunately , a simple change in load can sometimes fix this .
But , you need to know , BEFORE THE GUNFIGHT , what your gun will do and how far out it will do it .
The reasons for shotgun barrels acting this way has a lot to do with the buying public 's expectations of performance .
Super tight buckshot patterns just have n't been an expectation with the police shotgun buying public in the past .
After all , they 've considered the shotgun to be a close range weapon and thus have n't placed a big demand for tight quality control on barrel production .
I guarantee you those variances in sniper rifles would n't be tolerated .
But with shotguns they are .
So , they continue to churn out barrels with the thought that so long as they 're fairly round and fairly straight they 're good enough for government work .
Well , they 're not good enough and they need to be better .
Fortunately , a recent development in choke design was discovered that re-wrote the performance envelope for tactical shotguns .
It was developed by Hans Vang and is called the Vang Comp Choke System .
The Vang Comp Choke System is an internal modification of the shotgun barrel in which the forcing cone is relieved and the barrel is back bored so that it 's the same diameter from the chamber up to a point several inches from the muzzle .
At that point the barrel tapers inward thus choking the shot while retaining the original cylinder bore diameter .
With this system you can still safely shoot slugs , unlike other choke systems .
It 's also a permanent system which adds no length to the gun and has no screw in devices to fly off and end up down range .
As for performance , I can honestly say it 's phenomenal .
I 've seen guns with this modification go as far out as 35 yards and still keep all 9 pellets of a 00 buckshot load in the torso of a man -sized target .
And , at standard confrontation ranges of 5 - 7 yards this choke system makes buckshot patterns so tight I would have no problem using it for hostage rescue work , with ghost ring sights of course .
It 's amazing !
Right now it 's the only choke system I can endorse and I endorse it fully .
The Vang Comp choke can be applied to any tactical shotgun barrel rather inexpensively , except for the Benelli's and others with chrome lined barrels .
Those guns must be de-chromed before the machine work can be done , which costs a bit more .
Otherwise , the modification is affordable and the turn around time is generally quick .
As for factory tactical shotgun choking systems , Mossberg is the only manufacturer , I know of , that offers a tactical shotgun with an internal choke system .
I have n't tested one yet , but I 've heard it 's very good .
Everyone else seems content to stay with poorly made cylinder bore barrels .
Magazines
Factory magazine capacities for shotguns range anywhere from a low of 4 to a high of 8 .
In many cases magazine capacity can be easily increased with the addition of an extended magazine kit .
Whether this is a worthy modification , or not , is up for debate .
I get by just fine with a four shot magazine tube on my entry gun .
Extending it , though , is out of the question since my barrel is only 13 " long .
But , had I gone with a 14 " barrel I could have added a one shot extender that would have been flush with the end of the muzzle .
But , following the doctrine of " load one , shoot one or load what you shoot " , it 's surprisingly easy for me to keep my shotgun topped off and fully loaded throughout just about any course of fire .
So I 'm not real concerned .
Of the extended magazine kits out there , the best are the Tac - Star , Choate , and Remington factory kits .
The nod for the best made would have to go to Tac - Star .
It 's solid steel and built for punishment .
The Choate and Remington designs are similar and well made , they 're just not as stout as the Tac - Star .
Related to magazines are two issues you need to be aware of .
First , if your gun has one of those flimsy plastic followers , replace it with a good solid one .
I 've seen the Remington followers break and they will jam up the gun quite badly .
So , it behooves you to head Mr. Murphy off at the pass and eliminate this possibility .
Second is magazine spring set .
This is especially critical with the extended magazine kit springs .
The rule is ; the longer the spring the greater likelihood of spring set .
So , as a practice , keep your shotguns downloaded by at least one round with the four shot mags and two with the extended mags .
This will lessen the possibility of spring set somewhat .
I also recommend annual replacement of magazine springs for all shotguns .
At approx .
$ 5.00 a spring , it 's cheap insurance .
One other benefit of downloading your mags , especially if you live in a warm climate , is to eliminate what we in central California call " shell slag " .
This is what happens when you load a black shotgun to full capacity with plastic shells , that are packed with styrofoam buffer material , then place the gun on the dash board of a car in the summertime .
All you need to do then is leave the gun in this condition with the windows rolled up for awhile and let the inside temperature of the car reach about 150 + degrees .
What sometimes happens is the shells heat to the point of becoming pliable , then the spring pressure bears down on the softened shells causing them to expand within the magazine .
Should you need the shotgun in a hurry , life gets real complicated , real fast .
Your shotgun , unfortunately , has now become a playdough fun factory and the shells tend to be a bit sluggish on the feed , if they feed at all .
Not good .
But you can diminish this effect by downloading to reduce spring pressure .
I 'd rather have three that work in the tube than four that wo n't .
On gun spare ammunition carrier
Carrying spare ammunition on the shotgun is a good idea and there are several ways to do it .
The most common way is through the use of an elastic buttstock shell carrier .
These are a very inexpensive way to pack 6 spare rounds on the buttstock .
Using this method , though , interferes with your ability to shoot from the offside and shells will sometimes fall out of the holder .
But , in all , it 's not a bad system for the price .
A more advanced version of this is the Speedfeed stock .
This is a replacement stock which holds two shells internally on each side of the stock in spring loaded tubes .
It 's a lot more expensive than an elastic buttstock shell carrier .
But , you can shoot the gun from either side .
The downside is that it 's a very slow system and it too will drop shells out .
This happens when a tube only has one round in it .
Under recoil the round will move back against the spring just enough to move past the shell stop and gravity does the rest .
The worst set up is the sling which holds 20 - 25 shells .
Next time you get a chance , pick up a box of 25 shells .
Now , imagine that box swinging beneath your gun like a pendulum .
It definitely tends to spoil your aim .
Stay away from these .
The best means of carrying spare ammunition on the shotgun is the Tac - Star Sidesaddle .
This unit attaches to the left side of your gun and holds 6 rounds in a perfect position to extract them , move about two inches and feed them into the gun .
This is the neatest piece of gear I 've ever seen and I 'm so impressed with it that I have one on all of my shotguns and I 'll have one on every shotgun I ever own .
Tac Star sidesaddle shell carrier
A couple notes of caution on this unit , though .
They secure to the weapon by means of replacing the receiver pin(s ) with screws that go through the receiver pin holes and secure the shell carrier from the other side .
Some shooters have put these on and overtightened the screws to the point that they have pinched the receivers .
This will void your warranty right away not to mention you may damage the gun to the point of needing repair .
When you put these on , turn the screws down to the point where you feel them snug up .
Then give the screw just a slight 1/16 turn to snug it further and leave it alone .
I do this and I 've never had the screws back out .
Secondly , the shell holder attaches to the mount plate by means of six little allen head screws .
When you get your Sidesaddle , or if you have one already , take all six of the screws out and put some loc - tite on the threads .
If you do n't , they 'll eventually back out during extended firing sessions and they 're so small you 'll ruin your eyesight trying to find them on the ground .
Dedicated light mount
As with any tactical / defensive weapon , a light mount is a must .
A tactical team gun , in particular , without a light mount is like a car without headlights .
You can still get around but you 're not going to be very effective or safe once it gets dark .
For most weapons , you can get by with a handheld flashlight , but shotguns , especially pumps , are extremely difficult to shoot with a handheld light .
Fortunately , Sure Fire makes a dedicated replacement fore end light mount / housing for all of the popular shotguns .
If they do n't make one for your gun they make great universal mounts that will fit just about any shotgun .
If you 're not already familiar with Sure Fire products , take my word for it , they make great gear .
I have a Sure Fire light unit on my entry gun that 's been subjected to an amzing amount of abuse without any problems .
Currently the light housing I 'm most fond of is a new design which incorporates a steady on / off switch on the left side of the unit in addition to the momentary switch on the right side .
This is a good option to have .
Sling
All tactical long guns must have slings .
That is a serious rule .
A long gun without a sling is like a handgun without a holster .
When your weapon stops working , whether it be a malfunction or you 've simply run out of ammo , your first response should always be to get rid of that weapon and immediately transition to your backup sidearm .
You do n't have time to fool around trying to reload or clear a malfunction when people are trying to kill you , or your active coverage of an area of responsibility is critical to the safety of a fellow team member .
A tactical sling on a weapon allows you to simply " let it hang " while you go for your back up .
Buttstocks
The biggest complaint about shotguns is their recoil .
And , yes , they do recoil quite a bit .
But , this recoil can be managed to a surprising degree through proper training in recoil management .
However , no amount of training will help if the buttstock is n't properly configured to the shooter .
You do n't hear it discussed much , but for a large majority of shooters a simple adjustment to the length of pull on the shotgun will drastically reduce felt recoil and improve their ability to better handle the weapon .
Currently , nearly all shotgun manufacturers produce shotguns with buttstocks designed to fit the typical six foot tall North American man .
But , not everyone fits that profile .
And if you do n't in order to mount the weapon and acquire the sights the buttstock must be moved out of the proper shoulder pocket and usually comes to rest right on top of the radial nerve .
This is a very bad place for any buttstock to be , but especially bad for one of the heaviest recoiling weapons to be .
When the weapon is fired the shooter experiences PAIN .
Shooters who 've had this happen to them tend to shy away from the shotgun from that point on .
However , simply having the buttstock shortened will eliminate this problem and allow you to place the buttstock of the shotgun into the proper shoulder pocket .
And you 'll find afterwards that the recoil really is n't that bad .
You 'll also discover that it 's much easier to manipulate the weapon , thus making you much faster on the gun .
This is truly a worthy modification to consider .
It 's also a fantastic idea to have a nice , thick , well design recoil pad attached to the buttstock .
This will definitely dampen the felt recoil to a manageable level .
One very worthy modification to this area is to round off the heel ( top ) of the buttpad .
Having this rounded will keep the buttpad from snagging your clothing when mounting the gun to your shoulder .
As for buttstock designs you have a choice of traditional full stocks , pistol grip full stocks , ( Such as the Choate after market , and the Benelli ) , folding stocks , and pistol grip only .
For most shooters the factory traditional stocks will do just fine and are easy to modify length of pull on .
Of the pistol grip full stocks , I very much like the Choate model , but because they 're hollow , adjusting the length of pull is n't easily done .
The Benelli version is just as difficult to adjust and , unfortunately , they apparently designed these to fit Vikings because I have yet to find an average shooter that these fit .
Fitting can be done , but your gunsmith will curse you and charge you commensurably .
As for the folding stocks , I do n't recommend these unless you have an extreme storage problem .
They do nothing to make the weapon more compact in actual use , since you 'll be unfolding the stock to fire the weapon .
What they WILL do is increase felt recoil , especially the factory Remington top folder .
They 'll also get wobbly and wiggly as they begin to wear out , which wo n't contribute much to accuracy .
As for pistol grips only , I can't think of one good reason for these .
Shooting from the hip with a full stocked gun is iffy , but at least the buttstock gives you some reference point .
But , with the pistol grip you have no reference point at all .
But , you will have a nicely bent wrist to absorb all of the recoil , which wo n't feel good at all .
The only way to fire these beasts is to bring them up to eye level and shoot them like a big pistol .
This is slow , inaccurate , and painful for the shooter .
Stay away from these altogether .
If you 're looking for a more compact shotgun , the 14 " barreled Remington 870 w/ full stock is much more practical than the folding stocked 870
The folder is only compact when it 's folded .
When it 's opened , and it must be to shoot it properly , it 's just as long as a standard length 870
Conclusion
Hopefully you now have a better understanding of the shotgun as a tactical weapon along with greater knowledge of what the shotgun is capable of doing once properly modified .
No other weapon benefits more dynamically from modification than the tactical shotgun .
Fortunately , the cost involved is n't that great .
If you shopped wisely you could have a state of the art tactical shotgun built for less than $ 750.00 .
And , in the end you 'll have the most powerful and effective close range shoulder fired weapon currently made .
Not bad !

OTTAWA — The Conservatives will have effective control in both houses of Parliament and greater sway over the legislative agenda after Prime Minister Stephen Harper names five new senators Friday .
The appointment of the new Conservative senators will end years of Liberal domination in the Upper Chamber and leave the Conservatives just two seats shy of a majority there .
The power shift could help clear the way for Harper ’s plans to reform the Senate itself .
Harper is poised to appoint two senators from Ontario and one each in Quebec , New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador .
In Quebec , victim ’s right activist Pierre - Hughes Boisvenu is expected to be named to the Senate .
“ I ’ve concluded that if the opportunity presented itself , it would be an opportunity to serve the country and to promote the ideas I ’ve defended in the areas of justice and public security in Canada , ” Boisvenu told Sherbrooke ’s Tribune newspaper Wednesday , saying he had not heard from Harper at that point .
Other names circulating include former fisheries minister Loyola Sullivan from Newfoundland , Margaret - Ann Blaney , a former minister in the New Brunswick government or Bernard Valcourt , a former member of the Mulroney cabinet and former Ontario provincial minister Bob Runciman .
Runciman has long - standing ties to Harper ’s side of the Conservative family .
He supported the Canadian Alliance in its early days .
Filling the vacancies in the Senate and reconstituting Senate committees to reflect the new Conservative numbers was one of the driving forces behind Harper ’s controversial decision to prorogue Parliament .
Control of the Senate floor as well as bulked up numbers on Senate committees should mean a smoother ride for government bills through the legislative process .
More importantly , Harper has said he would like to push ahead with his stalled efforts to make changes to the Senate , such as eight - year term limits and an initial stab at Senate elections in the provinces .
Those changes would n’t necessarily require the provincial consent called for in the Constitution .
For instance , provinces could hold their own elections for vacant Senate positions and Harper could appoint the victor to the Upper House .
But the prime minister knows that the fundamental Senate reform he has championed is impossible without a constitutional amendment and several provinces have said they would not provide the unanimous agreement required to make those changes .
MP Peter Stoffer , one of the most energetic critics of the Senate , says the appointments are another example of the government doing precisely what they said they would n’t while in opposition .
Harper ’s last set of appointments included former party operations director Doug Finley and former press secretary Carolyn Stewart - Olsen , the kind of nominations that he railed against in the past .
“ He ’s not using the Senate for reform , he ’s using it for power , ” said Stoffer .
“ We can save $ 90 million a year with one word : abolition . ”
Roger Gibbins , president of think tank Canada West Foundation , says that this next round of appointments is not likely to rankle Conservative supporters in the party ’s heartland because they accept it ’s necessary for reform .
But Gibbins said the patience with Harper might be strained if they do n’t get a sense soon of the master plan .
“ It ’s becoming increasingly unclear just what the longer term vision of the prime minister is in terms of Senate reform , ” said Gibbins .
“ People approve of the tactics , but they ’re not quite sure anymore what the strategy and what the goal is . ”
Would you dare to offer a used item as a gift to someone ?
Some 27 % of Canadians say they have done so in the past year !
“ This is an extremely interesting change in trend compared to studies done 20 years ago , ” comments Fabien Durif of the Observatoire de la consommation responsable and co-author of the 2017 report of the Kijijiji Index of the Second Hand Economy .
Long reserved for people with lower incomes , the user is now popular in all income groups .
Moreover , contrary to what one might think , people do not buy and sell more used goods when the economy is in bad shape .
In fact , the better the economy goes , the more they find takers !
According to the report , if monthly incomes increase by $ 100 , each person acquires or abandons 10 more items in the second - hand economy .
Conversely , fewer goods change hands as unemployment increases .
The used car market is therefore evolving like the new goods market .
Brands adapt
Faced with consumers ’ enthusiasm for used goods , some large companies sniffed out a good deal .
“ In Europe , IKEA stores buy back the company ’s second - hand furniture and sell it , ” says Durif .
The same goes for Habitat , which is the equivalent of Maison Corbeil here .
The company created a Habitat 1964 brand .
She buys the goods from consumers and sells them in a vintage shop .
It ’s also a way to control their brand . ”
In Canada , it has not yet identified similar brand initiatives .
However , he expects to see some .
“ In Quebec , we are seeing a renewal of traditional clothing stores , collaborative tools and specialized platforms , ” says Durif .
It is obvious that major brands will also start to make in the second hand . ”
Save money
Even if consumers at all income levels turn to the user , the prospect of saving remains their main reason .
And their budget benefits more and more !

The value of second - hand transactions in Canada in 2016 was $ 29 billion .
“ The ecological aspect remains the second main motivation for consumers to abandon , ” says Durif .
It ’s the third one to buy .
There is a desire to have an impact on environmental protection . ”
They will be happy to know that 1.9 billion goods were given a second life in the country last year !
Regional differences
However , the enthusiasm varies across the country .
Ontario and the western provinces have the most dynamic second - hand economies with “ intensity rates ” exceeding 80 in each .
The champion is Alberta with 91 .
In Quebec , it stagnated at 67 while the Maritimes rose to 60 .
Contrary to popular belief , the report also notes that the market for used goods is not an urban phenomenon .
In fact , it is more vigorous in medium - sized and small cities and rural areas .
Nevertheless , Montréal is among the three most active cities in the country behind Calgary and Edmonton .
Curiously , Quebec City is among the cities with the lowest score !
Second - hand practices have even dropped since last year .
For Fabien Durif , the mystery remains intact for the moment .
He hoped to be able to clarify it , at least in part , in his next report .
U.S. Navy combat ship Freedom ( LCS 1 ) .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
In the U.S. the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) is planning to introduce unmanned frigates for long missions shadowing diesel - electric submarines .
The vessels , dubbed Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessels or ACTUVs , are designed to be unmanned , with only intermittent communication from operators on shore or on a ship , and to require no maintenance for months .
They will also obey navigational rules and be able to avoid collisions at sea .
The three main objectives of the program are to build an “ X - ship ” that operates without anyone stepping aboard at any point in its operating cycle , secondly to demonstrate the technical viability of the system under “ sparse remote supervisory control ” , and thirdly to demonstrate the anti-submarine capability of the vessel and its “ novel suite of sensors ” .
The ACTUV is unlike other unmanned vessels in that it is designed for global , independent deployment for months at a time .
Proponents claim crewless vessels would save the U.S. Navy money and free the expensive crewed ships from the routine work of continuously cruising the oceans shadowing submarines .
The unmanned frigates would locate a submarine by “ pinging ’ with active sonar to detect the submarine ’s echoes , which means those on the submarine would know they have been detected .
While nuclear submarines may be fast enough to escape the stalking frigate , fast and quiet diesel - electric submarines would not .
Other unmanned vessels are already in use , with Israel deploying Unmanned Surface Vehicles ( USVs ) , mainly for surveillance purposes , and the U.S. Navy deploying unmanned drones from its submarines .
DARPA is the research and development section of the U.S. Department of Defense , which is charged with the job of maintaining the U.S. military ’s technological superiority and avoiding technological surprises that could threaten the nation ’s security .
It will host an unclassified “ Industry Day ” conference on the ACTUV program at the Liberty Conference Center in Arlington , Virginia on February 16 to discuss the program and address any questions .

The defense - spending bill written by Congress ignores cuts to several high - profile Pentagon programs proposed by the Obama administration .
The bill , which is expected to come to the House floor this week , includes money for the General Electric - Rolls - Royce alternative engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter and for 10 additional Boeing C - 17 cargo planes .
ADVERTISEMENT
It also includes a lifeline of sorts for the VH - 71 presidential helicopter , which the administration has canceled due to cost concerns .
The Pentagon did not ask for money to continue any of these programs .
The funding for the three programs makes up about $ 3.1 billion in the $ 636.3 billion Pentagon - spending bill agreed to by congressional negotiators .
The massive bill also includes $ 128.3 billion in war funds .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates in October told Reps. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) and Bill Young ( R - Fla . ) , the chairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee , that he would recommend Obama veto the defense - spending bill if it included money for the VH - 71 and if funds for the F - 35 alternate engine threaten to “ seriously ” disrupt the overall fighter program .
Gates also told the Senate that he strongly opposed the $ 2.5 billion for 10 additional C - 17s .
The House included three additional C - 17s in its version of the bill , but negotiators agreed on 10 for the final bill — the number included in the original Senate version of the measure .
But Democrats are also looking to the defense bill as a vehicle to raise the country ’s debt ceiling and to extend unemployment benefits and healthcare insurance subsidies for the long - term jobless .
So it is unlikely that Obama will end up vetoing the bill , despite the previous threats .
Obama earlier this year had personally promised to veto any defense bills that contained funds for Lockheed Martin ’s F - 22 fighter jet .
On that issue , the president appears to have won the day .
Obama did not personally threaten a veto if his recommendations on the other three high - profile programs were not followed .
The veto threats came in the form of recommendations from administration officials .
House and Senate defense appropriators agreed on $ 465 million for the F - 35 alternate engine made by a team of GE and Rolls - Royce , according to an appropriations aide .
Pratt &
Whitney , which makes the primary engine , and the GE - Rolls - Royce team have battled over the funding in a high - profile public - relations and lobbying campaign .
The defense appropriations bill contains about $ 30 million for termination costs of the VH - 71 program .
And it would give $ 100 million to Lockheed Martin to continue some work on the already - built helicopters to preserve the technology development .
“ This funding will save about 250 jobs in Owego that would have been lost without it , ” said Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) , a defense appropriator whose district includes the Lockheed plant .
The Senate and House appropriators funded nine additional Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets .
They did not allocate any money to close the military prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , the aide said .
The House looks to vote on a defense - spending bill by midweek , but the picture is less clear in the Senate , which is also trying to strike an accord on healthcare .
There is still a possibility that appropriators will have to craft another continuing resolution to fund the Defense Department until the Senate can agree on a time to vote on the bill .
The Pentagon is currently funded through a continuing resolution that expires Dec. 18 .
But Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) , the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , told The Hill that he want the bill through the Senate as soon as possible .
“ I want to go home for Christmas , ” Inouye said .
Republicans , meanwhile , are criticizing the move by Democratic leaders to attach the debt ceiling to the bill .
A group of 174 House Republicans expressed their strong opposition to the decision in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) on Monday .

Like other cap - and - trade bills under consideration , the Cantwell - Collins measure would force industries to hold carbon permits that companies could trade to meet their emissions targets .

But it would focus on the “ upstream ” fuel producers , such as oil and coal companies , and not utilities .
It would also auction off the credits instead of giving them away as allowances during an early phase - in , as would the cap - and - trade bills that passed the full House and one Senate committee .
Only those entities covered by the bill could buy and sell the emissions credits , leaving Wall Street no access to a likely lucrative secondary trading market .
Some environmental groups prefer the Cantwell - Collins bill to the broader economy - wide cap - and - trade bills that have dominated discussion so far .
One advantage , supporters argue , is that the Cantwell - Collins bill is easier to understand .
It is only 39 pages long .
The House bill was well over 1,000 .
Supporters see fewer goodies to fossil - fuel industries in the Cantwell - Collins bill .
Frank O’Donnell of Clean Air Watch called it a “ more climate - friendly and consumer - friendly ” bill .
The measure returns 75 percent of the proceeds from an auction of pollution credits directly to consumers .
Ted Glick , policy director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network , said the bill was more transparent and would lead to more emission reductions because it does n’t rely on offsets .
But environmental groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund were more critical .
EDF said the bill “ discards too many cost - effective ” ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
Scott Segal , a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani , said the Cantwell - Collins bill shows that members of both parties are n’t sold on cap - and - trade proposals that have dominated the debate thus far .
“ You might say that an economy - wide cap - and - trade bill is still in the lead , but only marginally so , ” Segal said .
“ It ’s an important development in the debate because there is some mistrust of an economy - wide cap - and - trade program that sets up a $ 1 trillion securities trading market . ”

I strongly suspect that many of the people who have lately been showing up at the Museum of Modern Art are somewhat surprised to find themselves there .
The occasion of their visit is the drawings , paintings and sundry paraphernalia of the filmmaker Tim Burton , not to mention props that others have created for inclusion in his films .
In a recent visit to MoMA , on a sleepy Wednesday afternoon , I found the magisterial Bauhaus exhibition ( now closed ) to be nearly empty ; but in the far more modest ...
A recent CNN report on women 's substantial participation in the Israeli army had one U.S. servicewoman feeling somewhat envious .
" Maybe I should 've been a soldier in Israel 's army , " she wrote .
Is she right ?
And is it a fair comparison ?

Catherine Ross , blogging at The New York Times 's Home Fires , served in Civil Affairs in Iraq .
She notes that " While it may be a D.O.D. policy to keep women out of combat , the reality does n't match the policy , " and looks to Israel , where it was decreed a decade ago that " the right of women to serve in any role in the [ Israeli Defense Forces ] is equal to the right of men . "
In practice , that means women can be deployed to about 90 percent of IDF positions , according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Women have been active participants in the IDF since before the state was established , and currently make up about a third of the force .
In theory , army service is compulsory for all Israelis — two years for women , three for men — but there are certain exemptions , including for being religious or for married women .

There are some crucial differences between the two country 's experiences : Israel 's army conscripts so widely because it has to in order to survive ; the U.S. has a voluntary army .
Accordingly , military life is both woven into the fabric of daily life for both men and women , and seen as a patriotic duty .
Those who evade it — the ultra-Orthodox , Bar Refaeli — are pilloried .
Supermodel Refaeli's wriggling out of her service for what 's widely seen in Israel as a sham marriage continues to roil Israel — one general even suggested boycotting the products she endorses .
Meanwhile , fellow Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition mode Esti Ginzburg ( pictured ) very pointedly joined , taking on a public relations - like role .

The consciousness of an existential threat creates a social pressure , where doing one 's part becomes more important than gender .
The same logic applies to the acceptance of gays and lesbians , who have served openly in Israel for almost two decades .
Israel 's ultra-religious , down to the army 's chief rabbi still oppose women in combat , and sometimes women in the army in general .
Women still only make up 3.5 percent of combat roles , but if they qualify and volunteer , there 's nothing to stop them .

And so far , no one credibly argues the Israeli army is the worse for it .

The buzz is already well underway for the next Ultimate Fighting Championship video game .
UFC Undisputed 2010 is just a few months away with a scheduled May 25 , 2010 release date .
One of the designers from THQ recently revealed a ton of news and details about the upcoming MMA video game .
As great as the first UFC Undisputed video game was , if even half of these changes and improvements live up to expectations , this game could go down as one of the greatest video games of all time .
Other than my countless hours spent playing Madden 2010 , I have probably wasted more hours over the last several months playing UFC Undisputed 2009 .
Needless to say for a big MMA fan like myself , the game provided me with hours of fun and excitement .
However , like every critic I also found myself frustrated and disappointed by many aspects of the game .
Back in January I wrote a wish list for the next edition of UFC Undisputed .
By the sounds of a recent interview on Gamespot.com , THQ not only listened to me but listened to thousands of critics on game and MMA message boards when it came to a wish list of game improvements .
[ ad #336 r ]
One of the UFC Undisputed 2010 designers , Omar Kendall was n’t shy in talking about the new game in his recent interview .
Here are just a few UFC Undisputed 2010 highlights and tidbits revealed by Omar Kendall to Gamespot.com .
– Brock Lesnar will be the UFC Undisputed 2010 cover fighter .
Last year ’s American cover fighter Forrest Griffin went 1 - 1 since the release of the game , thus I do n’t see the cover as a curse .
Lesnar is a curious name though .
For one , Lesnar has only been a part of the UFC for a few years .
This is quite a reward for someone who just jumped into the UFC not too long ago .
Two , Lesnar has n’t fought since last July .
While there are tons of rumors regarding Lesnar ’s return to action , nothing has been officially announced .
Three , this only solidifies Lesnar ’s MMA stardom .
Lesnar is not very popular with hardcore MMA fans , yet even his biggest critics can’t objectively deny his recognition with the spot .
Let ’s just hope as a cover fighter he can get a little more love than the 88 rating in last year ’s game .
– The game will put more of an emphasis on cage technique .
The cage is a big part of MMA , and not being able to use the cage to your advantage in UFC Undisputed 2009 was a big disappointment .
The new edition will feature more cage work and give a fighter a slight advantage when he is dominating a cage battle .
– UFC Undisputed 2010 will feature a tournament mode .
Hallelujah !
I ’d say out of everything on my wish list going into the 2010 edition of the game , this was tops .
My biggest gripe with the game was that it got old fast .
Once you complete a career mode , there are only so many matches you can make .
It is nice to get your fix in with a match , but it is too open ended for my tastes .
With a tournament mode , the game will never get old .
There will also be more of a reward for exhibition play rather than a win and done .
THQ had to know that EA Sports would include a tournament in their MMA game since most EA games have some kind of tournament mode .
I love it !
– Since we are talking about the best news , let ’s talk about the biggest disappointment .
Unfortunately the submission controls wo n’t get much of a facelift .
If there is anything most UFC Undisputed gamers can agree on , it is that the submission controls suck !
The idea of simply turning your stick to get out of a submission or mash buttons is just ridiculous for a game of technique .
To give THQ credit , they are dropping the mashable button escapes .
THQ will also skew the ability to escape towards your stamina , sub skills , etc .
I just do n’t think that really matters at the end of the day .
I am quite surprised at the lack improvement here , as I think it is universally agreed that the submission controls stink .
– The career mode will get more intuitive .
According to Kendall , the game will keep track of past victories , sparring partners , camps , and skills .
As your career progresses , the commentators will reference all of these facts during your fight .
That is nice on paper , but I do n’t think that will matter much as your career progresses .
Kendall reveals a lot more improvements to the career mode , specifically a new style of camps , as well some enhancements to the Create - A - Fighter mode , additional skill sets , online fighting , and more .
Kendall ’s candidness was refreshing in this era of secrecy when it comes to video game releases .
So far , pretty good when it comes to UFC Undisputed 2010 tweaks , additions , and advancements .
Other than the submission controls , it seems as if THQ is intent on trying to make this as real of a MMA fighting game as possible .
If these improvements and additions live up to expectations , EA Sports is going to have a really hard time getting millions of people to spend another $ 50 on a video game featuring B - level fighters and subpar graphics .

The US military began its largest war games in the Pacific region Monday — an annual training exercise with troops from Thailand , Japan , Indonesia and Singapore , now joined by South Korea .
At the opening ceremony in the eastern Thai province of Rayong , US Ambassador Eric G. John said that the “ Cobra Gold ” exercise , now in its 29th year , had become a “ multinational showcase event ” .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The US continues to view this exercise , which is our premier training event in Thailand , as an important symbol of US military commitment to maintaining peace and security in Asia , ” he told the audience .
John welcomed South Korea ’s participation in the event , which runs until February 11 and will see soldiers , sailors , marines and airmen from the six countries taking part in operations across Thailand .
He said the focus of the exercise was on joint peacekeeping operations and humanitarian and disaster responses , for which it offered “ unparalleled ” preparation , citing the 2004 tsunami relief operation as an example .
“ It ’s imperative that our separate militaries learn to work with each other — together — and rehearse for the day their services are needed to answer that call for help , ” he said .
“ As Cobra Gold is the US military ’s largest exercise in the Pacific region — and indeed , the largest exercise of its kind in Asia — we welcome the contributions of all the nations who will participate in the coming days , ” he said .

In total representatives from more than 20 countries will participate , observe or support , he added .
Thailand and the United States are long - time allies , but a large sum of US military assistance to the Southeast Asian nation was suspended after a Thai coup in 2006 .
The aid was resumed after elections in December 2007 .
The New York City Police Department needs to be restrained .
The nonstop humiliation of young black and Hispanic New Yorkers , including children , by police officers who feel no obligation to treat them fairly or with any respect at all is an abomination .
That many of the officers engaged in the mistreatment are black or Latino themselves is shameful .
Statistics will be out shortly about the total number of people who were stopped and frisked by the police in 2009 .
We already have the data for the first three - quarters of the year , and they are staggering .
During that period , more than 450,000 people were stopped by the cops , an increase of 13 percent over the same period in 2008 .
An overwhelming 84 percent of the stops in the first three - quarters of 2009 were of black or Hispanic New Yorkers .
It is incredible how few of the stops yielded any law enforcement benefit .
Contraband , which usually means drugs , was found in only 1.6 percent of the stops of black New Yorkers .
For Hispanics , it was just 1.5 percent .
For whites , who are stopped far less frequently , contraband was found 2.2 percent of the time .
The percentages of stops that yielded weapons were even smaller .
Weapons were found on just 1.1 percent of the blacks stopped , 1.4 percent of the Hispanics , and 1.7 percent of the whites .
Only about 6 percent of stops result in an arrest for any reason .
My earlier blog post about the improved Differential Debugging feature of BinNavi 3.0 generated a lot of interest so I have decided to write a follow - up post .
Unlike last time I want you to be able to see what BinNavi can do and not just read about it .
I have therefore created a short Flash video that shows how to find important code in disassembled files using the BinNavi debugger and its trace mode which is the core of Differential Debugging .
In the video I start with a disassembled IDB file of Pidgin ’s liboscar.dll .
The first step is to import the data from the IDB file into a BinNavi MySQL database .
Afterwards I open the call graph of liboscar.dll and put the BinNavi Win32 debugger into function trace mode .
In this mode trace events are generated every time a function of liboscar.dll is executed .
This allows me to find the functions responsible for sending messages in just a few seconds .
You can find the video here .
( 5 MB Flash video with a resolution of 1280 x 1024 )
Now this video shows only the most primitive use case of Differential Debugging .
Nevertheless , this use case is already incredibly powerful .
Finding out what code is responsible for what functionality of a program in just a few seconds is incredibly useful , no matter what you are trying to do .
However , there are situations where this simple use case is not enough .
Maybe you are analyzing a daemon process where you ca n’t just click on some GUI element to isolate events .
For these situations we provide more advanced features , like the ability to compare and connect recorded traces using set operations I mentioned in my earlier post .

The 620 MW Kleen Energy plant was due to come online in the summer
A huge explosion has rocked a power plant in the US state of Connecticut , killing at least five people and injuring 12 , the local mayor has said .
Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said it was caused by a gas explosion .
People living up to 50 km ( 30 miles ) away reported that their homes were shaken by the blast at the Kleen Energy plant , being built outside Middletown .
There are reports of people trapped under the remains of a plant building , and a rescue operation is under way .
Search experts and specialist dog teams were at the site combing through the wreckage , the mayor said .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Speaking at a news conference on Sunday evening , Mr Giuliano said that the identities of the dead had not yet been released as some of the victim 's families had not yet been informed .
Mr Giuliano said the plant , which was only 95 % complete and due to open fully in the summer , was undergoing a series of gas tests when the explosion occurred .
He said between 100 and 200 people worked on the massive site , and were employed by multiple contracting companies .
" How many people were here today - that 's the number they can't really nail down .
They were purging gas lines all night long , most people were evacuated from the building when they ran the tests , " Mr Giuliano said .
The plant is located to the south of the town , on the Connecticut River .
Earlier , deputy fire marshall Al Santostefano said there were some 50 construction workers on the site at the time of the explosion .
It really shook the house and everybody was scared and the kids started to cry
Lynn Townsend
At least 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and it had taken them an hour to contain the fire caused by the blast , he said .
Officials say there is no further danger to the public , and have not evacuated the area .
The plant , however , remains cordoned off .
The nearby Middlesex Hospital told the Associated Press it had received 11 victims , while the hospital in the state capital , Hartford , has treated three others .
' Gas line test '
Mr Santostefano said a natural gas pipeline running near the plant had exploded at 1117 ( 1617 GMT ) sending a shockwave that one local resident compared to an earthquake .

" We heard such a loud explosion and the dog was outside and I heard her bark .
And then when we went outside we saw a very big explosion of bright orange flame between the two smoke stacks , " Lynn Townsend told the Associated Press .
" It really shook the house and everybody was scared and the kids started to cry because they did not know if the house was going to catch fire . "
Fighting through tears , plant worker Paul Venti said : " It 's just horrible .
All I know is I lost some union brothers .
They are some close close personal friends .
It 's horrible .
They were working .
They were testing . "
" I just heard there was a gas explosion and I 'm getting all kinds of phone calls from union brothers .
We got some people up there they got little kids that are at home and we lost them . "

* Unemployment hits highest level since March 2005
* Civil servants to join Feb. 24 private sector strike
* Brussels may seek more cutbacks under bailout plan
( adds unemployment data , details )
By Renee Maltezou and Lefteris Papadimas
ATHENS , Feb 11 ( Reuters ) - Greek unemployment hit its highest rate in nearly five years on Thursday and civil servants said they were stepping up strike action against the government ’s austerity measures .
Greece ’s unadjusted unemployment rate jumped to 10.6 percent in November from 7.8 percent a year earlier , reaching its highest level since March 2005 , the national statistics service ( NSS ) said .
It was the largest year - on - year increase in unemployment since records began in 2004 .
The jobless rate was particularly high among the young -- a factor in fuelling street protests in recent years -- with 27.8 percent of 15 - 24 year - olds unemployed .
Economists said the rise was fuelled by uncertainty surrounding last October ’s general elections and the financial crisis enveloping Greece , which had stalled private and public sector investment .
“ We had an improvement in business expectations until October but after that month we had a decline because of the financial crisis , ” said Dimitris Maroulis , economist at Alpha Bank .
The data came as European Union leaders gathered in Brussels laid the foundations for a financial bailout for Greece , which was expected to demand deep fiscal and economic adjustments from Athens in the face of strong union opposition [ ID : nLDE61A0W2 ] .
MORE STRIKES
Greece ’s powerful ADEDY public sector union , which held a 24 - hour strike on Wednesday [ ID : nLDE6190NM ] , said it would join another one - day stoppage by the private sector union GSEE on Feb. 24 in protest at wage and pension freezes and job cuts announced earlier this week .
The two unions , which together group half of Greece ’s 5 million - strong workforce , say it is the poorest who will suffer from a government package designed to bring down the budget deficit from 12.7 percent of GDP last year -- the highest in the euro zone .
“ After the announcement of the measures , civil servants decided to escalate their struggle , declaring they should not pay for the crisis , ” said ADEDY Vice President Ilias Vrettakos .
“ We will move to a 24 - hour strike , joining the private sector on Feb. 24 . ”
Civil servants walked off the job on Wednesday to protest against the government ’s deficit - cutting plan , but their march to parliament was thinly attended , offering hope Athens can push through measures to tackle a debt mountain due to top 120 percent of GDP this year .
Alpha Bank ’s Maroulis said he expected unemployment to stabilise in 2010 and then start falling when private and public sector investment picks up .
But Diego Iscaro of IHS Global Insight struck a grimmer tone .
“ The outlook for the labour market is extremely challenging , ” he said .
“ We believe that higher unemployment , combined with significantly tighter fiscal conditions , will hit private consumption , which represents around 70 percent of GDP . ”

More cat owners ' have degrees ' than dog- lovers
What do you prefer ?
Dogs , cats ... or maybe both People who own a cat are more likely to have a university degree than those with a pet dog , a study by Bristol University suggests .
A poll of 2,524 households found that 47.2 % of those with a cat had at least one person educated to degree level , compared with 38.4 % of homes with dogs .
The study said longer hours , possibly associated with better qualified jobs , may make owning a dog impractical .
It also found that UK pet ownership was much higher than previously thought .
Cat and dog numbers were last estimated in a scientific peer - reviewed journal in 1989 , which said there were 6.2 million and 6.4 million respectively in the UK .
Our best guess is that it's to do with working hours and perhaps commuting to work , meaning people have a less suitable lifestyle for a dog
Dr Jane Murray
University of Bristol But according to Bristol 's Department of Clinical Veterinary Science , the populations today are likely to be about 10.3 million and 10.5 million .
Overall , it estimated that 26 % of UK households owned cats and 31 % owned dogs .
The study , published in Veterinary Record , suggested a number of other characteristics , aside from education level , were associated with either cat or dog ownership .
Of those surveyed , dog - lovers were more likely to be male , living in rural areas and under the age of 55 .
Age of children
But cat owners were more likely to be female and living in smaller or single - person households .
The age of children in a family also appeared to make a difference , with cats being more common than dogs in homes with children under the age of 10 .
However Dr Jane Murray , a lecturer in feline epidemiology at Bristol University , said the variation in education level between owners was the most striking difference .
" We do n't know why there is this discrepancy , " she told the BBC News website .
" We did look at average household income but that was n't significant .
" Our best guess is that it's to do with working hours and perhaps commuting to work , meaning people have a less suitable lifestyle for a dog .
" It 's really just a hunch though . "
Dr Murray , whose post is funded by the Cats Protection charity , said researchers hoped to repeat the study using the results of the 2011 census to get a clearer idea of trends in UK pet ownership .

Dean Henderson ’s career with FedEx ended abruptly when a reckless driver plowed into his company truck and mangled his leg .
His doctor will decide this week if it needs to be amputated .
No longer able to drive , stripped of value in our commodity culture , he was tossed aside by the company .
He became human refuse .
He spends most of his days , because of the swelling and the pain , with his leg raised on a recliner in the tiny apartment in Fairfax , Va. , he shares with his stepsister .
He struggles without an income and medical insurance , and he fears his future .
Henderson is not alone .
Workers in our corporate state earn little when they work —
Henderson made $ 18 an hour — and they are abandoned when they can no longer contribute to corporate profits .
It is the ethic of the free market .
It is the cost of unfettered capitalism .
And it is plunging tens of millions of discarded workers into a collective misery and rage that is beginning to manifest itself in a dangerous right - wing backlash .
“ This happened while I was wearing their uniform and driving one of their company vehicles , ” Henderson , a 40 - year - old military veteran , told me .
“ My foot is destroyed .
I have a fused ankle .
I have had over a dozen surgeries .
It hurts to wear a sock .
I was limping pretty badly , but in the spring of 2008 FedEx said I had to come back to work and sit in a chair .
It saved them money on workers ’ compensation payments .
I worked a call center job and answered telephones .
I did that for three months .
I had my ankle fused in January 2009 , and then FedEx fired me .
I was discarded .
They washed their hands of me and none of this was my fault . ”
Our destitute working class is beginning to grasp that Barack Obama and other elected officials in Washington , who speak in a cloying feel - your - pain language , are liars .
They are not attempting to prevent wages from sinking , unemployment from mounting , foreclosures from ripping apart communities , banks from looting the U.S. Treasury or jobs from being exported .
The gap between our stark reality and the happy illusions peddled by smarmy television news personalities and fatuous academic and financial experts , as well as oily bureaucrats and politicians , is becoming too wide to ignore .
Those cast aside are reaching out to anyone , no matter how buffoonish or ignorant , who promises that the parasites and courtiers who serve the corporate state will disappear .
Right - wing rage is being fused with right - wing populism .
And once this takes hold , a protofascism will sweep across our blighted landscape fueled by a mounting personal and economic despair .
Take a look at Sinclair Lewis ’
“ It Ca n’t Happen Here . ”
It is a good window into what awaits us .
“ One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past forty years by black and brown Americans , and by homosexuals , will be wiped out , ” the philosopher Richard Rorty warns in his book “ Achieving Our Country . ”
“ Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion .
The words ‘ nigger ’ and ‘ kike ’ will once again be heard in the workplace .
All the sadism which the academic Left has tried to make unacceptable to its students will come flooding back .
All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet . ”
Whoever rides to power on the back of this rage will swiftly broker a deal with corporations and corporate overlords .
But by then it will be too late .
Dissent will become a form of treason .
The security state will be quickly cemented in place .
The bankrupt liberal class , which abandoned the working class and the fight for basic civil liberties , will be reviled , discredited and impotent .
America will develop its own peculiar form of Christian fascism .
Obama , entranced with power and prestige , is more interested in courting the elite than saving the disenfranchised .
The president , when asked to name a business executive he admires , cited Frederick Smith of FedEx , although Smith is a union - busting Republican .
Smith , who was a member of Yale ’s secret Skull & Bones Society along with George W. Bush , served as John McCain ’s finance chair .
I guess Obama is hoping for some cash .
And Smith has a lot of it .
He founded FedEx in 1971 , and the company had more than $ 35 billion in revenue in the fiscal year that ended in May .
Smith is rich and powerful , but there is no ethical system , religious or secular , that would hold him up as a man worthy of emulation .
Those who make vast profits at the expense of workers and the common good are not moral .
They are not worthy of adulation .
They build fortunes and little monuments to themselves off the pain and suffering of people like Henderson .
Jesus called them “ vipers . ”
“ He ’s an example of somebody who is thinking long term , ” the president said of Smith in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek , adding that he “ really enjoyed talking ” with him at a Feb .
4 White House luncheon .
Smith does think in the long term .
His company lavished money on members of Congress in 1996 so they would vote for an ad hoc change in the law banning the Teamsters Union from organizing workers at Federal Express .
A few stalwarts in the Senate , including Edward Kennedy ( in a speech reprinted in the Congressional Record on Oct. 1 , 1996 ) and his then - colleague Paul Simon , denounced the obvious .
The company had bought its legislative exemption .
Most members of Congress , then as now , had become corporate employees .
“ I think we have to honestly ask ourselves , why is Federal Express being given preferential treatment in this body now ? ” Sen .
Simon said at the time .
“ I think the honest answer is Federal Express has been very generous in their campaign contributions . ”
Following the Senate vote , a company spokesman was quoted as saying , “ We played political hardball , and we won . ”
What happened to our historical memory ?
How did we forget that those who built our democracy and protected American workers were not men like Smith , who use power and money to further the parochial and selfish interests of the elite , but the legions of embattled strikers in the coal fields , on factory floors and in steel mills that gave us unions , decent wages and the 40 - hour workweek .
How was it possible in 1947 to pass the Taft - Hartley Labor Act , which , in one deft move , emasculated the labor movement ?
How is it possible that it remains in force ?
Union workers , who at times paid with their lives , halted the country ’s enslavement to the rich and the greedy .
And now that unions have been broken , rapacious corporations like FedEx and toadies in Congress and the White House are turning workers into serfs .
UPS is unionized .
It is the largest employer of the Teamsters .
Labor costs , because of the union , account for almost two - thirds of its operating expenses .
But Smith spends only a third of his costs on labor .
There is something very wrong with a country that leaves a worker like Henderson sitting most of the day in a tiny apartment in excruciating pain and fighting off depression while his billionaire former boss is feted as a man of vision and invited to lunch at the White House .
A country that stops taking care of its own , that loses the capacity for empathy and compassion , that crumples up human beings and throws them away when it is done with them , feeds dark ideological monsters that inevitably rise to devour the body politic .
FedEx is busy making sure Congress keeps unions out of its shops .
It has lavished $ 17 million , double its 2008 total , on Congress to fight off an effort by UPS and the Teamsters to revoke Smith ’s tailor - made ban on unions .
Smith , again thinking “ long term , ” plans to continue to hire thousands of full - time employees and list them as independent contractors .
If his workers are listed as independent contractors he does not have to pay Social Security , Medicare and unemployment insurance taxes .
And when they get sick or injured or old he can push them onto the street .
Henderson says FedEx treats its equipment as shabbily as its employees .
There ’s no difference between trucks and people to corporations that view everything as a commodity .
Corporations exploit human beings and equipment and natural resources until exhaustion or collapse .
They are cannibals .
“ The trucks are a liability , ” Henderson said .
“ They are junk .
The tires are bald .
The engines cut out .
There are a lot of mechanical problems .
The roofs leak .
They wobble and pull to one side or the other .
The heating does not work .
And the company pushes its employees in the same way .
The first Christmas I was there I worked 13 hours without a break and without anything to eat .
It is dangerous .
I could have fallen asleep at the wheel and injured someone . ”
If you have to send packages do not be a scab .
Send it with UPS or the U.S. Postal Service .
They have unions .
Every step , however tiny , we take to thwart the corporate rape of the country and protect workers counts .
We would have to do more , much more , but this would be a small start .
Like Smith , our politicians have sold their souls .
They will not help us .
We must help ourselves .
And the longer we stand by and permit the Democrats and the Republicans to strip American workers of their jobs and their dignity the less we will have to say when the day of angry retribution arrives .
Sana , Yemen
I took part in a “ qat chew ” the other day at the home of a Yemeni official .
Never done that before .
Qat is the mildly hallucinogenic leaf drug that Yemeni men stuff in their cheek after work  and sometimes during .
My hosts insisted that qat actually makes your senses sharper and that you could chew and chisel the top of a mosque minaret at the same time .
I quit after 15 minutes , but the Yemeni officials , lawmakers and businessmen I was with chewed on for three hours  and they made a lot of sense along the way .
Most had been educated in America or had kids studying there , and they were all bemoaning how the decline of the Yemeni education system , the proliferation of exclusively religious schools here and the falloff in scholarships for Yemeni kids to study in America were producing a very different Yemeni generation than their own .
They spoke fondly of U.S. schools that were based on merit , taught them to think freely and prepared them with the skills to thrive .
So here is my new rule of thumb :
For every Predator missile we fire at an Al Qaeda target here , we should help Yemen build 50 new modern schools that teach science and math and critical thinking  to boys and girls .
If we stick to something close to that ratio of targeted killings to targeted kindergartens , we have a chance to prevent Yemen from becoming an Al Qaeda breeding ground .
Because right now there are some 300,000 college - educated Yemenis out of work  partly because of poor training and partly because there are no jobs  15,000 schoolchildren not attending any classes , 65 percent of teachers with only high school degrees and thousands of kids learning little more than religious doctrines .
Corey Fienhage was a 3rd round draft pick ( # 81 overall ) of the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 entry draft .
Fienhage is a defenseman for the North Dakota Fighting Sioux on the WCHA .
He played in only nine games as a freshman but this season , his sophomore campaign , he has played in 21 games and has become a regular on the Sioux blueline .
Fienhage fits the profile of a fan favorite in Buffalo .
He is a big body defenseman ( 6'3 " - 215 lbs. ) that is n't afraid to play a physical style .
I had an opportunity to catch up with him this week and talk about his season and his future in the Sabres organization .
Let 's begin by talking about this season at North Dakota .
It has been kind of an up and down season for the team .
Why do you think the team as been so inconsistent ?
We are playing really well now .
We lost our captain early on in the season and it was tough to get going without him .
At first goals were tough to come by but now we are scoring goals and it's all about the effort now .
Tell me about playing in the WCHA .
It seems there is never an easy weekend in that conference .
Does it ever get overwhelming knowing that every weekend you are playing against a top 10 team ?
The mentality is that we are going to win every game .
It is a tough conference but that is what is exciting about it .
Do you think playing a difficult regular season schedule helps the team in the long run and when you play out of conference games ?
The East Coast teams are pretty good as well .
Playing in the WCHA is a lot of fun but there are good teams in the east as well .
You chose to take the NCAA route by attending North Dakota .
Was NCAA hockey always your first choice or did you consider playing Canadian major junior hockey ?
That was always what I wanted to do .
I first started playing hockey in Alabama because I lived in Tennessee .
Since I moved to Minnesota and started playing high school hockey , I wanted to play NCAA and I wanted to play in the WCHA .
After your final high school hockey season concluded you finished out the season by playing in the USHL .
How do you think that helped your development ?
The speed mostly .
High school hockey in Minnesota is pretty good but the speed in the USHL was overwhelming at first .
It helped me when I came in here ( North Dakota ) to have a few games under my belt .
Of course the speed increased again when I got here and it took some time to get adjusted but the USHL really helped me to realize the speed and how hard players play .
It 's a huge difference between playing high school hockey and playing college hockey at North Dakota .
In high school it was easier for you to add offense to your game but in your second season at North Dakota you are still looking for your first goal .
Does that every weigh on your mind while your playing ?
Obviously I would like to get my first goal , that would be a fun one but I look forward to improving the defensive side of my game .
I would like to add more offense but I take pride in the defensive side of my game .
I try to focus on the easy things like getting the puck out of the zone and make the first pass but it would be nice to get my first goal .
You 're now in your second season at North Dakota .
In looking back , what do you think is the biggest improvement in your game from when you stepped on campus until today ?
I really think confidence .
When I was a freshman , I was a little overwhelmed and not as talkative as I should be .
This year I have stepped in their and I 'm making the aggressive play and being able to see the first pass a lot clearer , the game is starting to slow down for me .
Sabres fans love a player with size and at 6 ' 3 " and 215 pounds , you would qualify as a big body .
Ho would you describe yourself as a player to Sabres fans that might not know a lot about you ?
I 'm a simple player .
I try not to do too much with the puck , a defensive player and I take pride in not getting scored on .
I try to be big in front of the net , moving people , using the body when necessary and hitting people in the corners .
I really just try to get the puck out of the zone and move it up to the forwards .
You have had an opportunity to attend the Sabres summer prospect camp .
What do you take away from that experience as a player ?
It was a great experience getting to meet the coaches and the strength coaches and making a relationship with them .
It 's great getting to meet the guys and playing with Tyler Myers .
The coaches help you out with footwork and explain the things they do in their system .
I also got to see Justin Jokinen from Mankato , he is also a Sabres draft pick and I know him from Minnesota so it 's always good to catch up with him .
What type of interaction do you have with the Sabres organization throughout your season ?
We talk occasionally on the phone , they just check up on me and tell me what I need to work on still .
I seen you were also honorable mention all - conference as a football player in high school , what position did you play in football ?
I was a strong safety and our system was a 3 - 4 so I was basically an outside linebacker .
I also played defensive end at the end of the season and that was fun getting off the edge and blindsiding quarterbacks .
I just liked getting out there and hitting people and that is pretty much why I played .
Hockey players are famous for being superstitious .
Do you have any superstitions that are a must on game day ?
Not really .
I try to put my equipment on starting with my right leg starting with my right sock and my right shin pad etc .
It 's just something I started doing this year but not really many superstitions .
Nicknames are another staple of hockey players , do you have any nicknames we should know about ?
Not really .
They just call me Corey here and Finnags , nothing too big as far as nicknames .
Thanks for taking the time to answer these questions and good luck with your season .
No problem , anytime .
I want to offer tanks to Corey for taking the time to talk to us , Jaysen Hajdu the Director of Athletic Media Relations at North Dakota and also a special thanks to Derek Zona of The Copper & Blue for helping to set up this interview .
We ’ve got some breaking news , folks : Intel and Nokia have just announced a partnership in which they will merge Maemo and Moblin into a new product called “ MeeGo “ , aimed at just about any type of device you can imagine .

SPOILER ALERT !
I am going to reference a bunch of junk that happens in the episode .
So if you are waiting to see it , do n’t get mad at me if you read this anyway and I ruin your surprise .
I also plead innocent to inadvertently ruining any other surprises in this blog .
Like the ending to “ The Usual Suspects ” or how babies are made ( stork ) .
[ ED . NOTE : I thought his name was “ Jake ” instead of “ Jack ” .
Rather than change it I thought I would just admit I did n’t know the main characters name and leave the original post as is .
Recap : Jake = Jack . ]
Before I get started in my interpretation , I have to say I knew we were in for a treat when the opening had a handsome guy ( named Jake ) on a plane then immediately took us into the ocean where there was an ancient ruin shaped like a foot .
Dramatic music played .
Cut to commercial .
I immediately raised an eyebrow in confusion .
Of course it was never referenced again in the episode so maybe I am not alone in wondering what that was all about .
As an aside , there was a village with a playground at the bottom of the ocean .
And I mean pretty deep in the ocean .
Are we to believe that an ancient culture had a playground or someone poked a hole in an island and it sank to the bottom of the ocean ?
No really .
That was n’t rhetorical , I do n’t know which it is supposed to be .
Overall What is Happening
Apparently an H - bomb went off , but everyone survived INCLUDING the woman who detonated it from 1 foot away .
There are ghosts .
Some ghosts are good , some are bad .
A guy named Jake leads a gang of protagonists .
The protagonist gang prioritized saving a blonde woman over an Indian man ( just sayin ’ ) and both died .
A guy named Richard leads a rival gang to the Jake Gang ( it ’s like Twilight ! omgz ! ) .
Both those gangs pale in comparison to the pretentious Asian gang by the temple .
There is a monster on the island ( other than the pretentious asian .
ZING ! ) that is really just the sad raincloud that follows you around on bad days .
Apparently the sad raincloud hates it when you stand in a circle of black dust .
What makes the pretentious Asian redeeming is that he tricks you into thinking he can save your half dead friend and then drowns him .
I wish that was true , but the guy came to life so I guess he has some sort of secret hot tub that saves lives .
I ’m also under the impression two planes crashed and survivors of both ended up on this island .
But I ’m not sure .
So that is one part of the episode .
The other episode feels like a Jake commercial that takes place on an airplane .
This guy does it all .
Gets free booze from the stewardess , makes friends with a middle aged interracial couple , saves a hobbit from choking on condom drugs ; he even befriends a bald guy in a wheelchair in baggage services !
Nothing really to report here .
Some girl in handcuffs escapes a guy in a suit .
This seems like an awful way to transport a prisoner .
I want to see the airplane sequence but with the “ Jake ” of the people who died in the crash .
Ya know , the guy who interacted with a bunch of people except they did n’t make it to the island .
More Detailed Episode Recap
These people are stuck on an island .
They tried detonating a bomb to disrupt a space time continuum , which is 100 times better than using a boat when trying to get somewhere .
The bombing did n’t work ( or did it ?!?!?! it did n’t . ) so now everyone is dying left and right and everyone is mad at Jake because his plan did n’t work .
Juliette is trapped under a bunch of steel .
How ’d she get there ?
She fell down a hole , survived , and then beat an H - bomb ( according to my cable TV episode guide ) with a rock til it blew up .
Sawyer seems pretty grouchy about the whole thing .
Juliette dies .
Meanwhile , the Indian guy got shot but they just ignored him even though he was coughing up blood and still had a chance to live .
I guess they figured since Juliette was at the center of a bomb detonation , they had less time to save her .
This island also has ghosts of people who died in Westside Storyesque knifefights ( Jacob ) or bald people ( John ) .
The ghosts are of differing helpfulness .
The Jacob ghost tells the fat guy to take the dead Indian to a hole in a temple and not to forget the guitar case .
That sounds like the beginning of a joke or one of those sentences that contains every letter of the alphabet .
The John ghost turns out to be “ the monster ” according to the weinery guy .
The monster starts busting skulls on some henchmen who come in to find Jacob .
The Jake Gang takes the shot dude to a temple via VW Van .
There , an Asian guy who hates English so much he wo n’t speak it busts open a cross to get a love note .
When the Jake Gang finds out it says they ’re all in trouble if the Indian dude dies , everyone in the Jake Gang gets a look on their face that says “ Uh oh .
Maybe we should have paid attention to him instead of spending 8 hours getting Juliette out from the rubble . ”
Do n’t worry though , the Asian guy just drowns him in a hot tub , sets off a firework , and low and behold , the Indian guy is good as new .
The end .
You ’ll notice I did n’t recap the plane stuff because there is n’t much more to what is above .
Thoughts I Have
Everyone seems unfairly angry at Jake .
If you pitched an idea to me that involved setting off an H - bomb on an island , you ’d have to have A LOT of factual support for me to go along with it .
And if it did n’t work , well , I do n’t think I have much right to point the finger .
Where ’d all these modern amenities come from ?
They used flashlights that I assume use D batteries .
I have a hard time finding those in a major city .
Also , they have beer .
I ca n’t get over the fact that they ignored the Indian dude and let him die .
For a deserted island there are an awful lot of people .
Bloody kisses are gross .
If I was Sawyer I would have killed time until Juliette died so I would n’t have to swap platelets .
While on the Sawyer topic , why is he helping a fugitive escape the TSA ?
Everyone is pretty well kept for having been on an island .
Even Richard looks like he has his supply of eyeliner .
When the plane landed I was expecting a cut shot to an autistic kid playing with an island snow globe .
That ’s it for Episode 1 of the final season of LOST .
No , not that kind of feminism .
Not the theory of women 's equality or the history of suffrage or the First Wave or the Third Wave or 18 million tiny cracks in the glass ceiling .
I 'm talking about FeminismTM , as in the largest feminist advocacy organizations in the country raising millions of dollars to fight on behalf of women .
And I 'm wondering if FeminismTM is really such a good investment .
You know those emails ?
The ones from NOW and NARAL and Emily 's List that declare , with great urgency and lots of ALL CAPS and exclamation marks , that you must give money right now ?
Stop this bill !
Block this nominee !
Protect Roe !
Save the Supreme Court !
And give , give , give !!!
And since you often agree -- why yes , I do want to stop this bill ; why no , I do not want that nominee confirmed -- you click and give .
It wo n't stop this bill or block that nominee , but you will get another email at the next crisis .
And it 's always a crisis .
Even under a Democratic president , with a Democratic supermajority in Congress , the nation 's biggest feminist organizations are in crisis mode , raising money but unable to deliver results .
They 're just as effective as they were under Bush .
Which is to say , Not. At. All .
The one legislative accomplishment we 've seen in recent years was the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act .
Good legislation , certainly , and better than nothing , but that 's it .
Still , you can bet that come Fall , the Democrats and the feminist organizations that support them will be reminding us , ad nauseum , that at least they did that one good thing .
Sure , ladies , we sold you out on reproductive health care -- again -- but hey !
You get to sue your boss when you find out he 's paying you less than your male counterparts .
You 're welcome !
Do n't forget to vote Democrat to protect women .
And give , give , give !!!
In the last decade , we 've seen more restrictions on women ’s reproductive health , more government - funded sex ( mis ) education , and budget cuts everywhere -- for after school and early education programs , for employment and training programs , for programs to fight domestic violence -- all of which directly and disproportionately impact women .
And at every step backwards , the major feminist organizations have been powerless to stop it .
Or just plain absent .
Look at how Emily 's List tried " stop Stupak . "
Despite Bart Stupak ’s July letter announcing his ( and eighteen co-signers ’ ) intent to submit an amendment to health care reform further restricting American women ’s reproductive rights , Village insider Ellen Malcolm waited until [ November 14 ] to sound the alarm , while list - building and fundraising on a purported petition to Harry Reid to " Stop Stupak . "
In other words , Emily 's List did n't bother to raise awareness of the threat to reproductive rights when it might have mattered .
You know , before Congress voted on the Stupak Amendment .
Over the summer , while members of Congress were speaking with their constituents about what should and should n't be included in the health care bill , where were the feminist organizations ?
They were n't mobilizing the millions of women across the country who would have been only too glad to raise their voices in opposition .
Guess it just was n't a good time .
No , they were busy sitting on their hands , apparently waiting for the eleventh hour , waiting for it to be a crisis .
Meanwhile , the nation watched wall - to - wall coverage of teabaggers screaming nonsense about socialist death panels .
And that tiny fringe of teabaggers , with their signs and their slogans and their stunts , was so effective that they actually succeeded in killing the part of the bill they found objectionable .
Score ?
Teabaggers : 1 , Feminists : Big , fat zero .
In the Senate , it was worse .
It was an embarrassment .
Senators Boxer and Murray , who went to the Senate in 1992 with huge support from these very same feminist organizations , both fought for the Nelson " compromise . "
They did n't care that all of these organizations lined up against the Nelson Amendment .
And they certainly did n't care about stopping any further restrictions on access to reproductive health .
See , Boxer and Murray are from two blue , liberal , pro-choice states that probably wo n't opt out of abortion coverage .
So Senators Boxer and Murray know they wo n’t be receiving calls from their constituents .
Nah , let the senators from the virulently anti-choice states deal with the fallout when their constituents get screwed .
Besides , what are the feminist organizations going to do -- send urgent emails to raise money to take a stand against that awful enemy of women , Barbara Boxer ?
After all , if women ca n’t trust Barbara Boxer , just where are they supposed to go ?
Maybe it 's a good thing Ellen Malcolm , President of Emily 's List , just announced her retirement .
Better to jump from the sinking ship and save herself than have to answer to all the women who were completely taken by surprise when the Democrats tossed them under the bus in the name of health care reform because , well , Emily 's List , among others , could n't be bothered to lift a finger until after the fact .
This is the pattern we 've watched for years -- too little , too late , with nothing to show for it .
Wanna guess what these same feminist organizations consider one of their biggest accomplishments during the Bush years ?
A march .
Yep , a march .
Like the March for Women ’s Lives in 1986 .
And 1989 .
And half a dozen other marches where women carried the same signs and chanted the same slogans that have n't won any converts in a generation .
In fact , last year ’s Pew Research Center showed support for abortion rights has actually decreased in recent years .
Yet organizers called the march an " overwhelming success , " claiming to have sent a powerful message of " No more " to the president .
No more ?
Try four more years .
Bush was re-elected later that year -- with greater support from women than he received in 2000 .
Another few decades of " overwhelming successes " like that , and we 'll all be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen , wistfully remembering the old days when they used to let us vote and own property .
So much for " No more . "
But here , have another urgent email .
Donate another ten bucks .
It wo n’t stop a damn thing , but maybe it ’ll make you feel a little better .
And hey , it 's great for the bottom line of FeminismTM .
And maybe the bottom line is what matters .
Remember way back in the fall of 2008 , when one clever person decided to donate to Planned Parenthood in " honor " of Sarah Palin ?
" Make a donation to Planned Parenthood , " the anonymous e-mail message urged .
" Of any amount .
In Sarah Palin ’s name . "
The message , which began circulating widely on the Internet last week , had one more instruction : request that the personalized thank - you card from Planned Parenthood be sent to Ms. Palin , the Republican vice - presidential nominee and a vocal opponent of abortion , at the McCain - Palin campaign headquarters in Virginia .
So far , the scheme seems to be getting a strong response .
As of Friday , Planned Parenthood had taken in $ 802,678 in donations from 31,313 people , said a spokesman for the organization , Tait Sye .
More than two - thirds of the individuals are first - time donors to Planned Parenthood , Mr. Sye said , and money came in from all 50 states .
Nearly a million dollars raised for women 's health care , not by any of these organizations asking for money , but by one anonymous email .
If it really is about the bottom line , if feminist advocacy has been reduced to how much money can be raised , what purpose do these organizations serve that can't be achieved by one person with a good idea and dial - up ?
Perhaps it is time for women to examine whether the largest organizations that claim to represent them are really delivering on their promises .
They ’ve failed to organize the millions of supporters they have into a coherent and powerful movement .
' Cause when your movement looks like an amateur mess compared with the " keep your government hands off my Medicare " teabaggers , you 're doing something wrong .
They ’ve failed to frame the debate and influence how we talk about issues that affect women ’s lives .
While they 're still arguing about " choice " -- a word that persuades no one and narrowly focuses the conversation on abortion instead of the full spectrum of reproductive health -- opponents are thinking up clever new phrases to use incessantly and force into the public consciousness until they become law .
" Partial birth abortion . "
" Rights of the preborn . " " Culture of life . "
They ’ve failed to make women ’s rights a legislative priority for the very representatives they help send to Congress .
And if their supposed allies do n't worry about losing support of the feminist organizations , certainly their opponents do n't lose a lot of sleep over invoking the almighty wrath of the feminists .
What 's the worst they can do ?
Organize another march ?
Hey , that might actually be great news for Republicans !
They ’ve failed to adapt their movement and their message to a new era and a new generation of would - be feminists .
Where are the bumper sticker slogans , the tactics , the refreshed , revised 21st century approach to a problem as old as time ?
Are they using the internet for anything more than urgent emails and processing donations ?
Where are the clever YouTube videos by a new generation of feminists talking about how this or that bill affects them ?
Where is the television presence ?
Where are the bloggers ?
( Oh , there are plenty of feminist bloggers out there , but they ’re not being supported or promoted or elevated by the feminist organizations , who still think the internet is primarily for sending email .
For example , guess who the " featured blogger " on Emily 's List is ?
Why , it 's Ellen Malcolm , the president . )
They ’ve failed –- time and again , in any number of ways , under Republican and Democratic administrations .
And if they do n't figure that out , and figure out how to change it , they will become irrelevant .
We already know how to raise money with the internet , and we do n't need Ellen Malcolm , or her successor , or any of her FeminismTM counterparts to do it .
We know all of this .
Apparently , they do n't .
But if they do n't find a way to start delivering on those promises and offering something in exchange for the donations given in moments of crisis , eventually , women wo n't respond to those urgent emails with more money .
Instead , they 'll just demand a refund .
Devil 's Tuning
Fork is a first - person exploration / puzzle game in which the player must navigate an unknown world using visual sound waves .
Inspired by M.C. Escher ’s classic optical illusion and the echolocation of dolphins , The Devil ’s Tuning Fork allows the player to explore a new mode of perception through sound visualization .
As a mysterious epidemic causes children everywhere to fall into comas , one child wakes up in an alternate reality .
It is up to this child , the player , to determine the cause of the epidemic and save the other children trapped here .
By way of the devil 's tuning fork , a magical instrument that allows the player to perceive sound waves , the player must find all the children and successfully escape this alternate reality , thereby waking up from the coma .
The game was developed by student from depaul university and was announced as the winner of the IGF Student Showcase !
The game is not available for android platform but you can download similar games from this blog .
Yesterday , we invited NBC to answer a few simple questions about why it is ruining the Olympics for millions of Americans by refusing to show events live and instead saving everything for a stale evening highlight reel .
So far , this invitation has been greeted with deafening silence .
The answer , almost certainly , is " money , " but we are actually interested in the details .
Why is it to NBC 's benefit to ruin the Olympics for millions ?
Why not just show the events live on subsidiary networks and then show them AGAIN on the puffy highlight reel ?
And inasmuch as NBC seems intent on ruining the Olympics regardless of how much we and others scream , why not explain to America why it is choosing to do this ?
The answer can't be that appalling , can it ?
Presumably it 's all about trying to get the biggest possible evening audience for those precious sponsors , never mind that half the evening Olympics audience is so bored or angry that they 're doing something else or wishing they could throw their remotes through their TVs .
Inquiring minds want to know why , in the Internet age , when Olympics results are available in real time everywhere , including on NBC's Olympics web site , NBC is refusing to explain its coverage decisions to America .
And as NBC sits in its polished silence , the pressure is building on the network to say something .
Every day , we get emails from Canadians crowing about how awesome their TV coverage is .
Every day , we watch the Twitter stream cursing NBC for its tone - deafness .
Every day we get steamed emails from Americans furious that a greedy corporation is coming between them and their favorite events .
And every evening , as we sit in the same room as a TV showing the highlights of events we knew the results of hours earlier ( occasionally glancing up from our laptops to see whether the replay is remotely interesting ) , we also shake our heads at the lengths NBC goes to create the impression that all these replays are actually happening now .
" And now let 's go back to Grouse Mountain for the thrilling conclusion of the Women 's Snowboardcross ! " the once - authentic - seeming Bob Costas will gush , as he sits in some studio with a fake fire flickering in the background .
And the broadcast will cut away to a tape from hours earlier , of an event that everyone who has visited a news site or listened to a radio or talked to a friend that afternoon has known the outcome of for , seemingly , forever .
It 's just so fake .
( Or inauthentic , to use a popular Internet word . )
In today 's Internet world , people HATE fake .
It has gotten so bad that readers of the New York Times ( and , presumably , other news organizations ) have taken to begging the organizations to stop reporting the Olympics results because they are so sick of having the Olympics ruined for them .
Well , fat chance that 's going to happen .
Because even if you could muzzle the New York Times , you could n't shut down Twitter .
And in the age of Twitter , any monopoly on information companies like the New York Times ( and NBC ) once held has long since evaporated .
NBC is run by reasonable people .
Why is it so much to ask for them to explain to the country why they are ruining a sporting event that they brag so much about being associated with that happens only every four years ?
Why , NBC ?
Why ?
We await your answer .

During the summer of 2009 , I devoted six weeks to photographing the amazing mountains and fjords of Norway .
I traveled more than 8500 km ( 5300 miles ) , from the capital city of Oslo in the south , as far north as the Lofoten Islands and Tromsø , above the Arctic Circle .
In between I saw some of the most unique and impressive peaks in the world , often with some very dynamic weather conditions .
The country is very photogenic , especially given the summertime luxury of 24 - hour light , with very long sunsets and sunrises , and just the brilliant dusk in between .
Please see my blog , which I updated along the way , for more info and stories about my travels in Norway .
As East Coast residents battled the cold and snow , President Obama and Sarah Palin heated up a political debate that will help define this year 's congressional elections , and beyond .
Their speeches Saturday had different purposes .
Obama tried to buck up Democratic Party members depressed about election reversals ; Palin sought to fire up Tea Party activists who are confident of conservative prospects .
" We knew from the beginning that this would not be easy , " Obama told the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee .
" Change never is .
But that 's especially true in these times , when we face an array of challenges as tough as any we have seen in generations . "
But if the party follows through on issues such as jobs and health care , Obama added , " we will once again be the party that turns around the economy and moves this country forward , and secures the American Dream for another generation . "
Palin , speaking on Fox News Sunday about her appearance at the Tea Party convention in Nashville , said , " we have lost millions and millions and millions of jobs as we have incurred greater and greater debt and deficit , debt that I believe is immoral because we 're handing the bill to our children "
She also said , " what 's coming from the White House is just a fundamental difference from a lot of conservatives in our belief that government is not the answer . "
And Palin said she would not " close the door " on the possibility of her own presidential bid in 2012 .
The weekend appearances by Obama and Palin featured basic messages that will heard in the months to come .
Obama 's message :
We took tough actions to save the country from depression , including help for banks that was unfortunate but necessary .
The stimulus bill is producing jobs and righting the economy .
Now we 're looking for long - term fixes , including education , alternative energy sources , and -- yes -- health care reform .
We 're also tending to national security , while improving foreign relations that collapsed under George W. Bush .
Palin's pitch : Obama is spending money that government does n't have , at least not without massive tax hikes .
His health care , energy , and education plans will only increase the government bureaucracy , at the expense of private enterprise .
The health care plan in particular amounts to a government takeover .
And Obama is weak on terrorism and national defense .
Here are some highlights from their appearances .
First , Obama on :
His overall approach :
Everything we 've done over the past year has been not only to right our economy , to break the back of this recession , but also to restore some of the security middle - class families have felt slipping away for over a decade now .
The Republicans :
Some of the steps we took were done without the help of the other party , which made a political decision all too often to jump in the backseat , let us do the driving and then critique whether we were taking the right turns .
That 's okay .
That 's part of what it means to govern .
On Washington :
Folks are out there working hard every day , trying to meet their responsibilities .
But all around them during this last , " lost " decade , what they 've seen is a wave of irresponsibility from Wall Street to Washington -- they see a capital city where every day is treated like Election Day , and every act , every comment , every gesture passes through a political filter .
They 've seen the out sized influence of lobbyists and special interests , who too often hijack the agenda by leveraging campaign money and connections .
On reports that he 's prepared to accept defeat on health care :
So just in case there 's any confusion out there , let me be clear .
I am not going to walk away from health insurance reform .
On national security :
We have begun to leave Iraq to its own people .
We 've charted a new way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and made good progress in taking the fight to al Qaeda across the globe .
And here 's Palin ( from her Nashville appearance ) on :
The Obama agenda :
How 's that hope -y , change -y stuff workin ' out for you ?
The Tea Party movement :
This is about the people , and it 's bigger than any one king or queen of a tea party , and it 's a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter .
On national security :
Treating this like a mere law enforcement matter places our country at great risk because that 's not how radical Islamic extremists are looking at this .
They know we 're at war , and to win that war we need a commander in chief , not a professor of law standing at the lectern .
Her own future :
My plan is quite simple .
To support those who support the foundation of our country when it comes to the economy .
It is free market principles that reward hard work and personal responsibility .
On Obama and recent Democratic election losses in Massachusetts , Virginia , and New Jersey :
When you 're 0 - 3 you 'd better stop lecturing and start listening .
Other activity on this snowy weekend in Washington :
On NBC's Meet The Press , Obama counter - terrorism adviser John Brennan said he briefed Republican leaders in Congress on Christmas Day about the arrest of bomb plot suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner defended the U.S. bond rating on ABC's This Week .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told new host Candy Crowley on CNN's State of the Union that the administration 's diplomatic engagement has helped rally the world against Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Bob Schieffer of CBS ' Face
The Nation drew tough duty this Sunday : He traveled to South Florida for the Super Bowl to interview NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell .
Enjoy the game , or at least the party .
And stay warm .
( Posted by David Jackson )
Minority Leader John Boehner has been out for months calling on President Obama to televise all meeting on health care reform .
But now that President Obama has House Republicans coming to a health care summit to actually discuss the policy he seems to have soured on the whole live TV cameras idea .
He ’s worried that the actual discussion of the two parties health care policies might be embarrassing or be a “ set - up . ”
The Federal Government has ramped up warnings about Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer , which has come under attack from hackers .
The Government is warning that people risk having their computers infiltrated and passwords stolen unless they install temporary fixes from Microsoft or use alternative browsers .
The Government says Microsoft has acknowledged all recent versions of the program are vulnerable .
It also says people should remember to regularly update their security software and change passwords frequently .
The French and German governments have warned internet users in Europe to avoid Microsoft 's popular web browser .
The concern follows revelations that hackers used a crack in Internet Explorer to mount an attack on Google and a number of other companies .
Senior lecturer in network engineering at Melbourne 's RMIT University , Mark Gregory , says industry and governments are not prepared for the changing threats to cyberspace .
" The digital network is like the wild west .
It is unregulated , " he said .
" It is being used in ways that it was n't meant to be used and we need to get organisations , companies and governments ... focused on taking action to make the digital network more secure for the general public . "
Bill Caelli , from the Information Security Institute at the Queensland University of Technology , says the Government and regulators must step in to protect internet users .
" How many builders have put smoke detectors in the new homes and houses ?
How many people have put fences around their pools to protect children ? " he said .
" So safety and security has never , ever been market - driven .
It 's always been driven by regulatory [ sic ] , by society itself , and that 's the role of government . "
The Government says Microsoft has not solved the security glitch and Australians should use alternative browsers .
Dr Gregory says it is good advice .
" There are other browsers that are available that appear to be being targeted less by the hackers and by these organisations than what Internet Explorer is being targeted , " he said .
" I do n't think there was any inference in what they said that Internet Explorer was any more deficient in terms of security than any of the other browsers , just that it was being targeted more .
" On that basis you 'd have to argue that if security was a principal concern then using another browser would be wise until the incidence is reduced . "
Editor 's note ( 19 January 2010 ) :
This story has been amended to reflect the fact that web users can install temporary fixes from Microsoft to reduce their risk .
( AP ) -- Microsoft says a security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser played a role in the recent computer attacks against Google and at least 20 other companies .
In a Thursday alert confirming the weakness , Microsoft said the security hole can be closed by setting browser 's Internet security zone to " high . "
The world 's largest software maker may also issue an update to fix the problem .
Microsoft pinpointed the trouble spot after Google announced earlier this week that hackers in China had pried into the e-mail accounts of human rights activists opposing the Chinese government 's policies .
The attack outraged Google .
It plans to leave China unless the government backs off rules requiring Google 's Chinese search engine to censor some results .

Glenn :
I ’m under the impression that you consider the science behind global warming to be inaccurate , and that the efforts to promote it include hiding truth .
A grand conspiracy , of sorts .
On your TV show in November , 2009 , you said :
Count them .
There ’s Jones , Mike , Keith , Gene and Caspar , whoever they are .
Potentially deleting emails supposedly about supposed science .
So why all the secrecy ?
You went on :
“ Deleting emails .
Hiding declines .
Incorrect Data .
Inadequate systems .
Redefining scientific peer reviews for their own uses .
This is what appears to be going on behind the scenes .
And literally trillions of dollars of policy decisions are being based on what these guys are telling us .
If your gut said “ wait a minute , this global warming thing , it sounds like a scam ” – well , I think you ’re seeing it now ”
The whole story sounds like a massive conspiracy to give the government an excuse to pass cap and trade , to impose restrictions on business and individual choice , to aggrandize themselves with more money and power .
It would n’t really surprise me .
That is what government does in the United States .
In fact , it ’s things like this that made me realize that neither Democrats or Republicans in D.C. had any respect for your freedom or for the Constitution .
That was a driving force behind launching the Tenth Amendment Center , which I founded in mid-2006 .
But , you know what ?
I ’m not a detective , and I do n’t have time to study the science , the clues , the mystery behind global warming or the global warming swindle as many people call it .
So , if you had me on your TV show ( sorry I was n’t available when your producers asked last year , but I think my recommendation for a substitute worked out great ! ) , and asked me :
“ Michael – do you believe in this global warming scam , do you believe what the mainstream scientists are telling us about global warming – yes or no ! ? ”
I ’d have to answer this way :
“ I ’ve heard a lot of reports from reputable people on both sides of that issue .
There are some very good arguments , and I think the American people have not seen all of the evidence there , so I have not taken a position on that .
What I do know is this , I do n’t trust the government to tell me the truth . ”
In response , would you then say that you ’re “ writing me off ” and “ writing the Tenth Amendment Center off ” because I have n’t taken a position on this – and that a better source for state sovereignty information is now the Huffington Post ? ”
Well , that ’s basically what you did with Debra Medina on your program this week .
The one person in the Texas campaign who ’s had the courage to speak out about the Constitution , about nullification and interposition , about the founders , about the principles of liberty that this country was founded upon .
That one person is “ written off ” by you because she has n’t “ taken a position on ” a conspiracy theory that may or may not be of interest to her or her campaign ?
Wow .
Obviously the Constitution is n’t very important to you .
A person ’s stance on a conspiracy theory is .
Or maybe this is just your way of trying to marginalize one of the few candidates in the entire country running their whole campaign on the original view of the Constitution .
Is that it , Glenn ?
Because it sure seems that way .
Maybe the real conspiracy is n’t 9 - 11 or Global Warming or anything of the sort .
Maybe it ’s all about the establishment media , and people like yourself – is this your way of letting the hardcore constitutionalists out here know that you really prefer the establishment candidates ?
What should be more important is a person ’s stance on the Constitution .
In fact , that ’s ALL that voters should care about .
Not their race , their background , their religious views , their positions on conspiracies or anything else .
People are elected to follow the constitution – and nothing more .
What ’s more important to you , Glenn – a person ’s stance on the Constitution or their view of a conspiracy theory ?
Do n’t bother answering .
You already have .

Jenny the pug has taken puppy love to a whole new level , after taking to pushing toy dogs around in a pushchair .
Jenny ’s owner , Ellen Zessin , a children ’s book artist from Portland , Oregon , US , explains : “ Jenny loved the little stuffed pugs we got for her right from the beginning and was forever picking them up in her mouth and mothering them .
We thought pugs were meant to be docile , yet Jenny was so full of love and energy . ”
Determined their dog should make the most of her boundless energy Ellen and husband Mark took Jenny to dog agility classes where she quickly excelled .
With the classes over , Jenny was determined to show her precious pugs they had n’t been forgotten and kept putting her babies into an old pink toy pushchair .
“ She looked so sweet an idea hit me , ” Ellen remembers .
“ Jenny had been so good at dog agility maybe I could get her to push the stroller around . ”
Jenny needed no encouragement and quickly got the hang of it .
She showed such a knack for it that Ellen asked their vet if it was okay for Jenny to walk on her hind legs for a few seconds .
When he gave the thumbs up Ellen and Mark decided to let Jenny have some pushchair fun .
Early one morning they took Jenny down to walk the streets of Portland and filmed the experience for their son Steve who is away at university in Florida .
Ellen says : “ We always send Steve a video letter every month of what me , Mark and Jenny have been up to , and we knew he ’d love to see Jenny ’s latest skills . ”
The family video ended up on the video - sharing website and overnight became an Internet sensation .
“ We had so many lovely messages from people around the world – it was incredible , ” says Ellen .
Now the pug ’s a star in her own right since she appeared on local TV news and accompanying poster billboards .
“ Jenny ’s a real celebrity , ” Ellen says .
“ But it ’s her babies that come first . ”
Now Jenny ’s next trick is learning to surf and unsurprisingly she ’s mastered it with only one request – that her babies ride along next to her !?
Yemen ’s Most Wanted
Nasir al - Wuhayshi
Rap sheet :
As leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , Wuhayshi has proven to be both a skilled politician and an innovative , often brutal , adversary .
Once Osama bin Laden ’s secretary , Wuhayshi is a member of the younger and more radical generation of Yemen ’s al Qaeda cadres .
In 2006 , he broke out of a maximum - security prison , along with 22 other militants , in Yemen ’s capital city of Sanaa .
In January 2009 , he spearheaded the unification of al Qaeda ’s Yemeni and Saudi branches under his control .
Why he ’s a target : Wuhayshi is the head of al Qaeda in the region — that alone is enough to put him at the top of any U.S. hit list .
Since last year ’s merger , he has released a number of videos calling on Muslims to rebel against Arab regimes , notably the government of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the Saudi royal family .
He has also proved to be a prodigious writer , penning three articles in the latest issue of the jihadi group ’s magazine , Sada al - Malahim ( Arabic for “ Echo of the Battles ” ) .
But Wuhayshi’s efforts have gone beyond propaganda and recruitment .
Under his leadership , AQAP attempted to assassinate Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , the Saudi deputy interior minister in charge of the kingdom ’s counterterrorism efforts , last August .
More recently , the media wing of AQAP issued a statement taking credit for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ’s plot to blow up Northwest Flight 253 in the United States on Christmas Day .
The organization claimed the attack was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on al Qaeda targets in Yemen .
Anwar al - Awlaki
Rap sheet : Awlaki is ethnically Yemeni , but actually hails from New Mexico .
As an imam , he preached in mosques throughout the United States , including in San Diego ; Fort Collins , Colorado ; and Washington , D.C. ( While in San Diego , he was also arrested for soliciting prostitutes . )
Technologically savvy , he also has a reputation as an “ e- imam , ” having created a popular website where he doled out advice and posted “ sermons ” to spread his radical views .
Awlaki ’s fluency in English gives him a unique reach in reaching a non-Arabic - speaking audience .
He returned to Yemen in 2004 , and was arrested by the Yemeni government for his links to al Qaeda in 2006 .
He spent 18 months in prison , but , following his release , his current whereabouts in Yemen are unknown .
Most likely , he resides near his ancestral home in the southern province of Shabwa .
Why he ’s a target : During his years of proselytizing , Awlaki has contributed to the radicalization of an extensive list of prominent terrorists .
When he was preaching in San Diego and Falls Church , Virginia , his sermons were attended by three of the Sept. 11 hijackers .
Most famously , he had long - running email correspondence with Maj.
Nidal Malik Hasan , the U.S. Army psychiatrist who went on a religiously motivated shooting spree at the Foot Hood military base last November , killing 13 people .
“ Nidal Hasan is a hero , ” Awlaki stated after the attacks .
“ The fact that fighting against the U.S. Army is an Islamic duty today cannot be disputed .
Nidal has killed soldiers who were about to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in order to kill Muslims . ”
He also appears to have had contact with Abdulmutallab .
“ He ’s not just a cleric , ” noted White House counterterrorism advisor John Brennan last Sunday .
“ He is in fact trying to instigate terrorism . ”
Said al - Shehri
Rap sheet : Shehri , a Saudi , was captured in December 2001 in Pakistan , where he claimed to be providing humanitarian relief for Muslim refugees .
He was subsequently transferred to the Guantánamo Bay detention facility , where the U.S. charges against him included “ participat[ing ] in military operations against the United States and its coalition partners , ” as well as plotting to assassinate an unnamed writer .
Shehri was transferred to Saudi custody in November 2007 .
While in Saudi Arabia , he spent six to 10 weeks in Saudi Arabia ’s largest rehabilitation program , the Prince Mohammed bin Nayef Centre for Care and Counseling .
His release from U.S. custody was perhaps influenced by his claim , recorded in his official Guantánamo docket , that if released “ he would like to return to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , wherein he would reunite with his family … he would attempt to work at his family ’s used furniture store if it ’s still in business . ”
Why he ’s a target :
Soon after leaving the Saudi rehabilitation program , he surfaced by Wuhayshi ’s side in the January 2009 video marking the merger of al Qaeda ’s Yemeni and Saudi wings .
As the second in command , he is one of the most influential Saudi figures within AQAP — and an embarrassment to Saudi Arabia , which proudly touts its rehabilitation program ’s ability to “ cure ” Islamist militants .
U.S. officials have accused him of involvement in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa last September , which killed 16 people .
He has also recorded a cell - phone video urging Saudis to donate to AQAP and , in an article for Sada al - Malahim , the jihadi online magazine , called for more targeted assassination attempts like the attack on Prince Mohammed bin Nayef .
Qasim al - Raymi
Rap sheet : Raymi has been associated with al Qaeda in Yemen since well before the creation of AQAP , previously serving as deputy to Wuhayshi for its predecessor group al Qaeda in Yemen .
In February 2006 , he escaped prison as part of the same jailbreak that freed Wuhayshi .
On June 21 , 2007 , Raymi released the audio statement that announced the formal re-establishment of al Qaeda in Yemen with Wuhayshi at its head .
He has successfully evaded authorities ever since , most recently escaping a raid designed to capture him in the southern Abyan province last December .
He also appears to have a healthy appetite for risk .
In 2008 , observers were surprised to spot him mingling for nearly two hours at a funeral in Sanaa — apparently unafraid of being apprehended by Yemeni security services .
Why he ’s a target :
As one of Wuhayshi ’s closest accomplices and the current military commander of AQAP , Raymi has left a long line of victims in his wake .
In late June 2007 , he released two statements , one of which was a warning to Saleh ’s government .
Then , on July 2 , al Qaeda launched a suicide attack on a convoy of Spanish tourists in Mareb province , killing 10 people .
The Yemeni government has accused Raymi of being part of the terrorist cell responsible for the attack .
Hizam Mujali
Rap sheet :
The Sanaa - born Mujali hails from a family of al Qaeda members :
His younger brothers Arif and Yahya are also active in terrorist circles .
Hizam Mujali was stopped at a checkpoint in 2003 and , while resisting arrest , shot and killed a Yemeni police officer .
He was also part of the infamous 2006 prison break .
However , he eventually turned himself back in to the Yemeni government , striking a deal that would allow him to keep his freedom on the condition that he did not rejoin al Qaeda .
That condition appears to have recently been broken :
The government targeted him in a raid it launched in Arhab Province this past December .
Although they captured his brother Arif , Hizam managed to escape .
Why he ’s a target : Mujali ’s involvement in terrorism dates back to al Qaeda in Yemen ’s attacks under the leadership of Abu Ali al - Harithi , who was killed by a CIA drone strike on Nov. 3 , 2002 .
Mujali was tried in a Yemeni court for his involvement in the 15 - man cell that launched an attack on the French oil tanker Limburg on Oct. 6 , 2002 .
In an attack that echoed the USS Cole bombing in 2000 , a dinghy laden with explosives detonated beside the Limburg , killing one crew member .
More recently , the Yemeni military has claimed that Mujali has reconnected with Qassem al - Raymi , with whom he fled after the military ’s raid in Arhab last December .
We ’re waiting to hear back from SPD for an update of what group was behind a series of assaults on the Hill Saturday night that left at least one person battered and bruised and put cops on the hunt for the roving gang into early Sunday morning .
UPDATE 9:50 AM :
According to spokesperson Mark Jamieson , SPD does believe the incidents are related and involve the same group of suspects believed to be as many as six to eight black males in their late teens .
Note :
We are calling the group of men a ‘ gang ’ but Jamieson could not confirm SPD is investigating this with its gang unit .
Jamieson confirmed the details of the three incidents reported here and the details from one of the victim ’s friends — though Jamieson did n’t have the umbrella info in his reports .
More details from SPD added to the post below .
Jamieson said anybody who encountered the group or with additional information should contact SPD at ( 206 ) 625-5011 .
****
According to police radio reports broadcast the night of the assaults , the suspects were described as five black males wearing hoodies and dark clothing .
UPDATE : SPD says that as many as eight suspects may have been involved and that they were all wearing dark raincoats .
In the most brutal attack we ’ve received information about , a man was jumped by a group of four to five six to eight men near 15th Ave and Madison around midnight .
According to a friend of the victim , the group began following the man after he left a building not far from the attack .
As he noticed the group following him , he headed toward CC Attle ’s and moved to the middle of the street .
The men attacked and tackled the man to the pavement as they kicked and punched .
The force of the blow busted the man ’s umbrella which we ’re told he then wielded to scare off his attackers and thwarted the robbery .
An emergency crew and police responded to the attempted robbery and the man was treated for facial injuries .
UPDATE : The man was treated for a two - inch laceration on his forehead .
About 10 minutes later , another assault involving a group of black males with similar descriptions was reported at 19th and Marion .
In that attack , a woman was hit in the head with an unknown object .
UPDATE : SPD says the woman was jumped as she got out of her car and was about to go inside her home .
One of the men ran at her shouting “ Here I come ” and struck her in the head with a broomstick .
She was taken to the hospital and treated for a 1 - inch cut on her head .
There was also a report of an incident that caused damage to a car at 21st and Jefferson possibly involving the same group .
UPDATE : SPD confirms that this was likely the work of the same group .
A woman reported that a group of males busted out the windshield and back window of a car with a heavy rock or brick .
A court has ruled against a police officer who claims he was wrongfully fired from the NYPD after he unknowingly ate marijuana - laced meatballs .
A state appeals court upheld the dismissal of Anthony Chiofalo , a 22 - year veteran of the NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force , who says he only failed a random drug test because his wife had laced his meatballs with weed in an attempt to get him fired so he would n't be killed at work .
Chiofalo contested the original verdict and sued in December 2007 , but a panel of judges agreed that the high levels of marijuana found in his hair samples could n't have been caused by accidental ingestion or second - hand smoke , the Daily News reports .
They also dismissed his claims that the NYPD 's contract with the police union does n't allow the use of hair - sample drug tests .

Adopting a Shelter Dog
Do you think of yourself as a true dog lover and someone who has time and patience to dedicate to consider adopting a shelter dog ?
If you do , consider making a positive contribution by adopting a puppy or a dog from your local animal shelter where there are so many animals in need of loving homes and caring owners .
Quite often people have preconceived ideas about shelter animals and their initial negative thoughts may put them off adopting .
This closed mind attitude could mean a dog which would otherwise make a great pet with a little attention and training , is put to sleep as a home cannot be found for the animal .
Are you becoming interested ?
Although I am hardly likely to convince you overnight , I am sure with a little gentle persuasion you could open your heart and mind to the dog waiting for you at the local animal shelter in need of your loving care .
But first of all , I would like to give you some advice about the questions you will need to ask and the way in which to approach the staff when you visit the animal shelter to have a look at the dogs available for adoption .
Check with the shelter that the dogs have received at least the minimal medical treatment necessary to make the journey home with you .
Although most of the shelters will have done this , there are a few who may not have fully adhered to the strict medical guidelines .
Things to Look Out For At The Shelter
There should be a vet on duty at all times and he or she should be licensed .
The work of the vet in the shelter is to vaccinate animals against hepatitis and distemper , along with taking care of any other health concerns .
Consult with the vet or another member of the shelter staff and find out if the animal you have your eye on has had a blood test for heart worms and that the skin is free from fleas and other kinds of parasites .
When adopting a dog from a shelter these are the basics to find out about .
There are , of course , occasions when you have to dig a little deeper to find out everything you need to know .
An example of this is if the dog you would like to take home with you has suffered some kind of injury and is still going through the healing process .
You will need to know exactly what happened , what treatment the animal received , what kind of medication the dog is taking at the present time and whether or not any future treatment will be required .
One more thing - you need to be aware of any known information about the nature of the dog you intend to take into your home and to feel confident that the animal will successfully fit in with your family setting .
Some dogs don´t like the pitter patter of tiny feet , for example , whilst others just love to have a good chase after a cyclist or a car driver .
Is the dog passive or dominant , does the dog show aggression ( and if so what are the trigger points ) , and how will he or she react as far as territory protection is concerned ?
Quite often these details are displayed on the front of the pen where the dog is kept in the shelter and it will help you to determine whether or not the dog is right for you .
Remember - ask as many questions as you feel necessary .
The vet will appreciate you doing so and it´s the best way forward for you when adopting a shelter dog .

The venerable GNU Image Manipulation Program ( GIMP ) is undergoing a significant transformation .
The next major release , version 2.8 , will introduce an improved user interface with an optional single - window mode .
Although this update is still under heavy development , users can get an early look by compiling the latest source code of the development version from the GIMP 's version control repository .
The GIMP is an open source software application for editing raster graphics .
It is intended to serve as a free and open alternative to high - end image editing programs for a professional audience .
Although the GIMP still has some limitations relative to industry - leading commercial products like Photoshop , it is becoming an increasingly viable solution for professional artists and photographers .
A general lack of usability is often highlighted as one of the GIMP 's most significant weaknesses .
A common grievance is that the program tends to spawn a confusing assortment of windows and floating tool panels that can be difficult to navigate and organize .
In an effort to solve such problems and boost ease of use , the program 's developers are rethinking its user interface .
This broad effort has involved extensive analysis , expert evaluations , and community brainstorming .
All of that careful planning resulted in the production of detailed technical specifications that describe specific changes that will be made to the GIMP .
Some of these changes , such as the empty window view , have already been partially implemented and are available in 2.6 , the current stable version .
The 2.7 series , which is the active development version , provides a glimpse at what is coming next .
One of the most radical and highly - anticipated changes that is documented in the specifications is a new single - window mode , an optional view that brings together all of the floating windows and converges them into a single cohesive user interface .
To get a hands - on look at this feature , I compiled GIMP 2.7.1 and its core dependencies — GEGL and Babl — from source code , which can be obtained from the GNOME git repository .
The GIMP in single - window mode
Testing single - window mode
The single - window mode can be toggled from a checkbox in the Windows menu .
When it is activated , the floating docks will snap into place on the left and right side of the windows .
When they are locked into the user interface in this manner , the individual tool panels can still be moved around and snapped out .
You can , for example , move the Brushes panel into the same group as the Layers panel or break it out of the user interface entirely into a floating window while everything else remains docked .
You can dock panels in parallel , placing as many as you want along the right and left sides of the window .
These are separated by a draggable splitter that will allow you to horizontally resize the panels .
The only panel that cannot be moved is the main tool palette , which is locked into the top - right docking position .
In the following screenshot , you can see a configuration where several horizontal rows of palettes have been placed along the left edge of the window .
Several sets of panels along the left - hand side of the window
In order to eliminate the need for separate content windows , the single - window mode has a tabbed multidocument interface .
A set of tabs is displayed along the top edge of the window with a thumbnail of each image that you have opened in the program .
You can click an individual tab to interact with the associated image .
The thumbnails in the tabs are updated in real time as you edit the images .
The image navigation strip has all of the same functionality as any conventional tabbed interface in the GNOME environment .
You can roll your scrollwheel over it to quickly rotate through the items , for example .
Although the navigation strip works relatively well , there are still a few obvious bugs that showed up during testing .
The tab strip has no overflow behavior , so you can't scroll the tabs left or right when there are too many to fit in the interface .
The ones that do n't fit become inaccessible or partially obscured by the right - hand tool windows .
The image navigation tabs collide with the side tool panel
The single - window mode has a lot of advantages , including simplicity and ease of use , but it also currently has some limitations .
You can't move or resize the navigation strip and individual tabs can't be reordered or snapped out into separate windows .
The application has some rather eccentric behaviors in single - window mode that erode its predictability .
A minor example is that the bottom - right corner of the content pane has a handle for resizing the window even though it is n't an actual window corner when single - window mode is enabled .
Another example is that the close button in the window titlebar will only close the active image rather than the entire program .
If you have multiple images open and you want to close the entire window , you have to select Quit from the File menu .
These features are still under active development , so the lack of seamlessness in the single - window mode is understandable at this stage .
Some of the issues that I encountered will be resolved as development continues , others are concious design decisions on the part of the developers .
Professional interaction designer Peter Sikking wrote about some of the challenges and advantages of the single - window mode in a blog entry last year when development on the project began .
He contends that the ability to snap tabs out into a separate windows or split the main window into multiple views to enable side - by - side editing is undesirable because such functionality would create serious inconsistencies in the program 's behavior .
He suggests a novel alternative that he describes as " polaroid " windows , hovering image snapshots that can be used to see parts of other images while you are working .
For a programmer 's perspective on the redesign , I recommend reading the blog of Martin Nordholts , a GIMP developer .
He has discussed several aspects of the new user interface , including changes to the docked panels and single - window mode .
Improvements to multiwindow mode
It 's important to understand that the single - window mode is entirely optional and is n't going to replace the multi- window mode .
Users will be able to choose which one best meets their needs .
Alongside the effort to introduce the single - window mode the developers have continued to improve the multiwindow mode and enhance its usability .
The multiwindow mode has benefited from some of the improvements that were made for the single - window mode , such as support for horizontal docking .
You can now dock multiple panels alongside each other in a floating window in the multiwindow mode .
Floating horizontal panels
GEGL and other improvements
The user interface changes are n't the only new features introduced in the 2.7 release .
A number of other significant improvements have arrived , too .
The text tool , which allows you to overlay text on top of images , no longer requires the user to edit the text content in a separate popup window — you can now edit the text directly on the image canvas .
The developers have abstracted out some of the functionality of image saving into a separate export feature .
There are also a number of improvements to the brush system .
You can find a more complete overview of recent changes in the 2.7 release notes .
The Generic Graphical Library ( GEGL ) is an image processing framework that is being developed to serve as the new core of the GIMP .
It has been an ongoing project for almost a decade , but has only now reached a level of maturity where it can be adopted in the GIMP .
It was initially integrated in version 2.6 and is used for several of GIMP 's feature .
The GIMP 's code for layer composition has been rebased on GEGL in version 2.7 .
Additional GEGL integration work will continue after the completion of the current user interface overhaul .
GEGL is extremely significant because it will boost GIMP 's support for non-destructive editing and high bit - depth images — critical functionality that is needed in order to make the GIMP a competitive solution for professional image editing .
The schedule for GIMP 2.8
Much like GNOME , GIMP has even - numbered stable releases and odd - numbered development releases .
GIMP 2.7 is a development version , which means that it 's basically a snapshot of the source tree and is not intended for regular users .
GIMP 2.8 will be the first official stable release to include the new single - window mode .
The GIMP developers recently announced that they are tentatively planning to release GIMP 2.8 in December 2010 .
This release date , which is almost a year from now , is only a loose approximation of when they think that the program will be ready .
They caution that the schedule is not set in stone .
The GIMP is an impressive application that illuminates the potential of the of the open source software community to build free and open desktop applications that nearly rival some of the best high - end commercial software tools .
The recent improvements reflect the vibrance of the GIMP project and demonstrate some of the benefits of enlisting professional usability experts to contribute to open source application design .
Users who want to test the new functionality can obtain the source code from the GNOME git repository .
Additional details are available from the GIMP Development website .

Bored on an airplane from Phoenix to San Diego by way of Salt Lake City ( what ? )
I opened my laptop to do a little musical messing around and got distracted by a folder filled with old ideas .
I ’ve learned the hard way that when I get a little nugget of something that might be a song , it ’s important to capture it before I forget it .
At a certain point song ideas are like dreams – they ’re in my short term memory and they feel pretty solid , but they ’re really not stored anywhere permanent .
Let a couple of hours go by and they completely disappear .
So I ’ve gotten in the habit of opening the laptop and hitting record .
Some of you might find these interesting from a ( pardon me ) “ historical perspective . ”
The quality is terrible , they are extremely raw and not meant to be listened to , they ’re recorded in Ableton Live through the laptop mic , and often I can’t actually play them correctly .
But generally they ’re the very beginning stages of my process , when I ’ve got a line or two maybe , a guitar part I like , a chord change I want to use , etc .
You can hear the lyric technique I use at this point , which is to sing nonsense syllables as I ’m figuring out the melody ( and sometimes what the song is about ) .
Some of these ideas get completely blown apart along the way and reworked into something else , some of them stick pretty much as they are .
It ’s funny for me to go back and listen to them because a few of them changed quite a bit – it ’s like bizarro world , where all the songs turned out just a little different .
A Talk with George
Pre-Song : A Talk with George
The file for this one is called “ sad irish , ” not sure what that means exactly .
I do n’t think I was planning on writing a song about a sad Irish person , probably I was referring to the style , though it is n’t particularly Irish at all actually .
You can hear me reminding myself how to play it in the beginning .
The verse melody is mostly there , but different .
No bridge yet , no Plimpton either .
This version floated around until I connected it with the Plimpton idea and started fleshing out actual lyrics .
Usually deciding on a subject or a point of view helps cure the melody , makes it settle down and decide what it ’s going to be – there are certain choices you have to make once you ’re using actual words .
The guitar part in the second half of the verse is mostly complete at this point , that stuck pretty well through to the finished song .
I wish I had a record of the lyric - writing process on this one .
For the longest time it was third person – George did this , George did that – and I hated it .
It felt very gimmicky .
And then somewhere in there I switched it to the second person , as if George was giving you advice .
That softened the “ wikipedia ” feel of listing George ’s accomplishments , and gave it depth enough to be about something more complicated .
Big Bad World One
Pre-Song : Big Bad World One 1
There are three clips here .
The first one starts with what eventually became the pre-chorus , and as you can hear it started as a much sadder song – the title of the file is “ What If . ” I ca n’t play it properly yet at this point .
I ’m glad I ditched the second part of this one , it seems to just kind of wander aimlessly .
Pre-Song : Big Bad World One 2
The second clip was part of a different thread , the one that became the song .
It ’s the verse and the chorus but I have n’t yet decided to steal from clip 1 for the pre-chorus .
The last line of the chorus is there , a couple other hints of where the lyrics were headed .
I think it ’s safe to say that at this point I had just figured out what I was writing about – that last line pretty much sums it all up .
Pre-Song : Big Bad World One 3
The third clip has more worked - out lyrics , plus I ’ve put the two pieces together .
It ’s out of order , the pre-chorus lyrics here actually ended up in the third verse , but you can see how they evolved from the original “ What If ” idea .
This is the point in the process when writing gets easiest – there ’s a pretty well - formed point of view , a verse , a chorus , both with lyrics .
I think of this as having “ broken the back ” of the song .
From here on out it ’s just a question of filling in the details .
Blue Sunny Day
Pre-Song : Blue Sunny Day 1
The first clip is from a song I was calling “ My Nemesis , ” not sure exactly what it ’s about , and I may come back to that idea someday .
The second section is the chord progression and melody that would eventually become the pre-chorus of Blue Sunny Day .
There ’s also an idea for a bridge , which now sounds boring enough for me to wonder why I bothered capturing it .
Pre-Song : Blue Sunny Day 2
The second clip has a great intro guitar part , which I ’m glad to have come across again because I still may want to use it somewhere .
You may recognize a little figure near the end of that intro section , which is a little picky thing on a G13 chord that now happens between halves of the verse in BSD .
The verse chords are there with a completely different melody , and I ’ve also figured out the modulation that happens between verse and the pre-chorus section stolen from clip 1 .
Have n’t yet figured out the modulation back that happens shortly after .
I remember that this chord progression floated around in my brain for months , I would just sit and play it waiting for it to take me in some direction .
At that point it ’s usually time to pick a subject and push it through , because I can dither around with a musical idea until I am bored to death and start to hate it .
At some point I would find the line “ blue sunny day , ” and that was the bit that made me decide it was about a sad vampire , much to my chagrin .
Hilariously , there is a file called “ Nemesis 3 ” that I just listened to , and it is me playing an acoustic version of “ Never Gonna Give You Up . ”
So yes , I just rickrolled myself .
No idea .
Drinking With You
Pre-Song : Drinking with You
Chords and melody mostly there , you can hear me mushmouthing around trying to figure out a lyric / melody combination that works .
I have the last line , “ nice to go out drinking with you , ” so I definitely know what the song is about .
And I ca n’t play it AT ALL ( and still can ’t ) .
I ’m a little sorry I lost the turnaround and repetition of the line at the end , which refers back to that dissonant chord in the prechorus ( “ I know this place that ’s near here ” ) .
It ’s nice , but of course it also just repeats earlier material , so all in all I think it ’s better without it .
This is another great example of a song that started out as chords .
Like Blue Sunny
Day above , I would play these chords and sing along , and somewhere in there found “ nice to go out drinking with you . ”
Once I have a line like that , I just need to figure out who ’s saying it and why , and then the rest of the song falls in line from there .
Lady Aberlin ’s Muu-Muu
Pre-Song : Lady Aberlin ’s Muu-Muu
I wrote this song while on vacation with my family in Cape Cod .
We rented a house that had this amazing organ , the old fashioned wooden cabinet kind with two rows of keys , an arpeggiator , a bunch of built - in beats , a bench filled with song books that show you how to play “ Lady of Spain ” with one finger .
I was messing around with Bossanova 2 or something like that when I found these chords , and I had been thinking about Lady Aberlin and the idea of a guy sweetly but weirdly obsessed with this one blue dress she wore ( definitely not me ) .
I was hoping to use this organ in the actual recording , so this clip is assembled from a number of takes that I edited together in Abelton Live .
But the tempo was all over the place and I am not a great pianist .
And anyway it took me months to write the third verse because the form and the rhyme scheme is really tight and constraining .
One of the things that made it hard to play was that I could n’t do it in C because all the D keys were broken .
Keep in mind , this organ was old technology , a lot of wires and tubes and hamsters on wheels .
Somewhere in there the D - inator had gone bad , so that every D key on all the keyboards and the bass pedals made no sound .
UNLESS you turned on all the effects and sat on it for 15 seconds , then it would make this incredible growling whooshy noise , like a war of angels in an underwater gymnasium .
I wish I had thought to record that sound because it was amazing , but I also kind of like that it faded out of existence when vacation was over .
LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MAKE BELIEVE ITSELF .
That ’s all for now , I ’ll post some more when I have a chance .
Work­ing mem­o­ry is our abil­i­ty to store and manip­u­late infor­ma­tion for a brief time .
It is typ­i­cal­ly mea­sured by dual - tasks , where the indi­vid­ual has to remem­ber an item while simul­ta­ne­ous­ly pro­cess­ing a some­times unre­lat­ed piece of infor­ma­tion .
A wide­ly used work­ing mem­o­ry task is the read­ing span task where the indi­vid­ual reads a sen­tence , ver­i­fies it , and then recalls the final word .
Indi­vid­ual dif­fer­ences in work­ing mem­o­ry per­for­mance are close­ly relat­ed to a range of aca­d­e­m­ic skills such as read­ing , spelling , com­pre­hen­sion , and math­e­mat­ics .
Cru­cial­ly , there is emerg­ing research that work­ing mem­o­ry pre­dicts learn­ing out­comes inde­pen­dent­ly of IQ .
One expla­na­tion for the impor­tance of work­ing mem­o­ry in aca­d­e­m­ic attain­ment is that because it appears to be rel­a­tive­ly unaf­fect­ed by envi­ron­men­tal influ­ences , such as parental edu­ca­tion­al lev­el and finan­cial back­ground , it mea­sures a student ’s capac­i­ty to acquire knowl­edge rather than what they have already learned .
How­ev­er lit­tle is known about the con­se­quences of low work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty per se , inde­pen­dent of oth­er asso­ci­at­ed learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties .
In par­tic­u­lar , it is not known either what pro­por­tion of stu­dents with low work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ties has sig­nif­i­cant learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties or what their behav­ioral char­ac­ter­is­tics are .
The aim of a recent study pub­lished in Child Devel­op­ment ( ref­er­ence below ) was to pro­vide the first sys­tem­at­ic large - scale exam­i­na­tion of the cog­ni­tive and behav­ioral char­ac­ter­is­tics of school - aged stu­dents who have been iden­ti­fied sole­ly on the basis of very low work­ing mem­o­ry scores .
In screen­ing of over 3000 school - aged stu­dents in main­stream schools , 1 in 10 was iden­ti­fied as hav­ing work­ing mem­o­ry dif­fi­cul­ties .
There were sev­er­al key find­ings regard­ing their cog­ni­tive skills .
The first is that the major­i­ty of them per­formed below age - expect­ed lev­els in read­ing and math­e­mat­ics .
This sug­gests that low work­ing mem­o­ry skills con­sti­tute a high risk fac­tor for edu­ca­tion­al under­achieve­ment for stu­dents .
This cor­re­sponds with evi­dence that work­ing mem­o­ry impacts all areas of learn­ing from kinder­garten to col­lege .
It is a basic cog­ni­tive skill that we need to per­form a vari­ety of activ­i­ties , and we use it in core sub­jects like read­ing and maths , as well as gen­er­al top­ics like Art and Music .
Cru­cial­ly , this pat­tern of poor per­for­mance in learn­ing out­comes remains even when stu­dents ’
IQ is sta­tis­ti­cal­ly account­ed .
This fits well with evi­dence sug­gest­ing that work­ing mem­o­ry is even more impor­tant to learn­ing than oth­er cog­ni­tive skills such as IQ .
For exam­ple , in typ­i­cal­ly devel­op­ing stu­dents , I found that their work­ing mem­o­ry skills , rather than IQ , at 5 years old were the best pre­dic­tor of pre­dic­tor of read­ing , spelling , and math out­comes six years lat­er .
The next major find­ing from the stud­ies of stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry dif­fi­cul­ties is that teach­ers typ­i­cal­ly judged the stu­dents to be high­ly inat­ten­tive , and have short poor atten­tion spans and high lev­els of dis­tractibil­i­ty .
They were also com­mon­ly described as for­get­ting what they are cur­rent­ly doing and things they have learned , fail­ing to remem­ber instruc­tions , and fail­ing to com­plete tasks .
In every­day class­room activ­i­ties , they often made care­less mis­takes , par­tic­u­lar­ly in writ­ing , and had dif­fi­cul­ty in solv­ing prob­lems .
In con­trast , rel­a­tive­ly few of the stu­dents were judged to exhib­it the high lev­els of hyper­ac­tive and impul­sive behav­iors .
The final key find­ing is that stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry dif­fi­cul­ties take a much longer time to process infor­ma­tion .
They are unable to cope with timed activ­i­ties and fast pre­sen­ta­tion of infor­ma­tion .
As a result , they often end up aban­don­ing the activ­i­ties all togeth­er out of frus­tra­tion .
One way to over­come this dif­fi­cul­ty is to pro­vide them with a short­er activ­i­ty and to allow for more time dur­ing tests .
Stud­ies such as these demon­strate that stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry dif­fi­cul­ties have an extreme­ly high risk of mak­ing poor aca­d­e­m­ic progress and are rel­a­tive­ly com­mon in the class­room — they rep­re­sent approx­i­mate­ly 10 % of their age group in main­stream school­ing .
With­out ear­ly inter­ven­tion , work­ing mem­o­ry deficits can­not be made up over time and will con­tin­ue to com­pro­mise a child ’s like­li­hood of aca­d­e­m­ic suc­cess .
How can we sup­port stu­dents ’ learn­ing ?
The first cru­cial step in sup­port­ing stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry impair­ments is prop­er diag­no­sis , which can be con­duct­ed by a school psy­chol­o­gist .
How­ev­er , at present work­ing mem­o­ry prob­lems often go unde­tect­ed in stu­dents or are mis­di­ag­nosed as atten­tion­al prob­lems .
There are sev­er­al test bat­ter­ies that can be used to assess work­ing mem­o­ry , includ­ing the Work­ing Mem­o­ry Index in the WISC .
How­ev­er , most assess­ment instru­ments that are cur­rent­ly avail­able require con­sid­er­able expe­ri­ence in the admin­is­tra­tion , scor­ing and inter­pre­ta­tion of cog­ni­tive tests .
One use­ful tool to iden­ti­fy and sup­port stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry impair­ments is the Auto­mat­ed Work­ing Mem­o­ry Assess­ment ( AWMA ; Alloway , 2007 pub­lished by Pear­son ) .
The ben­e­fit of the AWMA is that it is designed to pro­vide a prac­ti­cal and con­ve­nient way for non-expert asses­sors such as teach­ers to screen their pupils for sig­nif­i­cant work­ing mem­o­ry prob­lems , with a user - friend­ly inter­face .
The auto­mat­ed pre­sen­ta­tion and scor­ing of tasks pro­vide con­sis­ten­cy in pre­sen­ta­tion of stim­uli across par­tic­i­pants , thus reduc­ing exper­i­menter error .
The AWMA was used in the study described here , as well as in numer­ous peer - reviewed jour­nal arti­cles on the role of work­ing mem­o­ry in learn­ing , anx­i­ety , and devel­op­ment in typ­i­cal and clin­i­cal pop­u­la­tions .
The main goal of this arti­cle was to explore the link between work­ing mem­o­ry and aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance .
On the basis of a large - scale screen­ing study of over 3000 stu­dent , 10 % were found to have work­ing mem­o­ry impair­ments that jeop­ar­dize their chance of aca­d­e­m­ic suc­cess .
The major­i­ty per­form below age - expect­ed lev­els in all areas of learn­ing and strug­gle to fol­low sim­ple instruc­tions in the class­room .
These dif­fi­cul­ties high­light the need for ear­ly assess­ment to iden­ti­fy those at risk .
In a future arti­cle , I will dis­cuss ways to help stu­dents with work­ing mem­o­ry prob­lems , includ­ing clin­i­cal tri­als demon­strat­ing suc­cess­ful trans­fer of cog­ni­tive train­ing to aca­d­e­m­ic attain­ments .

Frogger For Atari
Larry Isaacs
A number of arcade games have been converted for home computers .
Frogger has now joined these ranks .
We Atari 400/800 owners are fortunate to receive another excellent conversion .
This game is sold by Sierra On - Line , Inc. , under license from Sega , the same folks who made the original arcade version .
The Atari version is credited to John Harris .
Frogger is available on disk ( requires 32 K ) or cassette .
For those who do not frequent the arcade game rooms , a detailed description of the game follows .
But first , there are a couple of options that may be set .
Once the game has finished loading , you may choose between two speeds , FAST and SLOW , and whether you want the accompanying music on or off .
The OPTION switch toggles the game speed between FAST and SLOW , with FAST being the initial setting .
So far , the SLOW speed has been plenty hard enough for me .
The music option is controlled by the SELECT switch .
By the way , this music is some of the best I 've heard on any game so far .
The music option is available only on the disk version .
I also appreciate the fact that you are not required to listen to 10 to 20 seconds of music before you can start the game .
You start or restart the game by pressing START .
Even after the game has begun , you may still change speeds or toggle the music using the appropriate key .
Once the game gets underway , you face the challenge of Frogger .
The primary task is to hop frogs , one at a time , across a highway and a river into one of the five " homes " on the far side .
On the display , this journey starts at the bottom of the screen and ends at the top .
You control the movement of each frog with the joystick .
Each frog is able to hop forward , backward , left , and right , but not at any of the 45 - degree angles .
To make it hop , you push the joystick in the desired direction .
To make it hop again , you must return the stick to the neutral position and push it again in the desired direction .
Rest On The River Bank
The first obstacle is the highway .
This involves crossing four lanes of traffic .
To make this phase less than simple , the direction of traffic alternates with each lane , and the speed of each lane is different .
Once you have made it past the highway , you can rest on the river bank before tackling the river .
The river contains five " lanes . "
The first and fourth lanes contain turtles swimming upstream ( i.e. , to the left as you face the screen ) .
The second , third , and fifth lanes contain logs which are floating down - stream ( i.e. , to the right ) .
Naturally , these lanes move at different speeds .
You cross the river by hopping on top of the turtles and logs to go from lane to lane .
On the far side of the river , there is a wall with five little arches which represent the frogs ' homes .
You must hop directly from the last lane of logs into the arch to reach home .
The object of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible until you lose five frogs .
The frogs may be lost in a number of different ways .
The two most common ways : they are struck by a vehicle on the highway , or they fall into the river ( swept away by the current , I assume ) .
One feature that makes the river slightly more difficult to cross is that some of the turtles will submerge , taking your frog into the water with them .
You also lose the frog if it misses the arch and hits the wall instead .
Finally , there is a time limit within which the frog must reach home .
Each frog gets 120 counts which amounts to about 32 seconds .
The " clock " appears as an orange bar at the bottom of the screen , and it shortens as the time runs out .
When a frog is lost , a skull and crossbones appears briefly at the frog 's last position .
In addition to the " bleep " when the frog hops , there are appropriate sound effects when a frog is lost .
Points are accumulated in a number of ways .
First , you receive 10 points for each forward jump your frog makes and 50 points for each frog that arrives home .
Second , when a frog reaches home , you get 5 points for each count remaining on the time clock .
In addition , there are a couple of ways to earn bonus points .
From time to time an insect will appear in one of the unoccupied homes .
If your frog can pounce on this insect , you receive 200 bonus points .
Alligators , Snakes , And Otters
A typical game consists of a sequence of rounds , once you can get past the first .
A round is completed by maneuvering a frog into each of the five homes .
There is a 1000 - point bonus for completing a round , and you get to move on to the next round .
Naturally , the level of difficulty increases for each successive round .
First of all , the traffic pattern on the highway changes : the amount of traffic increases , and the pattern requires more maneuvering to get across .
The pattern of turtles and logs in the river also changes .
Fewer logs appear in the third lane , and some of the logs in the last lane are replaced by alligators .
You may hop on the backs of the alligators , but if you come too close to an alligator 's mouth , the frog is eaten .
Occasionally , an alligator will appear in one of the unoccupied homes for a brief period .
You can wait for the alligator to leave or choose a different home .
When you reach the third round , the difficulty is increased further by two additional predators : snakes and otters .
The snakes will appear on the logs in the third lane of the river , and on the river bank between the river and the highway .
If a snake appears , it will slither back and forth on the log .
It is relatively safe to hop onto a log patrolled by a snake , since the snake will not chase the frog .
However , if you let the snake slither into the frog , the frog is eaten .
On the river bank , the snake will make only one pass along the bank , but another may appear from either direction a short time later .
An important point is that you can hop away from a snake , but you can not hop over one .
The otters also are dangerously hungry , and can appear anywhere in the river , swimming between logs or between groups of turtles .
The otters appear only on the disk version of the game .
Speeding cars , turtles , and logs whiz by in the official Atari version of
After playing Frogger for quite a few hours , I would have to rate it as among the best games available for the Atari .
It has very good graphics with lots of motion .
In spite of all the motion , there is no noticeable jitter .
Joystick response is very quick and quite sensitive .
At first I found the joystick too sensitive .
It was very easy to hop once too often or hop in the wrong direction .
However , as your skill increases , this sensitivity becomes more and more valuable .
One of the best features of the game is the rate at which the level of difficulty increases with each round .
The increased difficulty noticeably adds to the challenge , but is not so great as to cause undue frustration while trying to reach the higher levels .
With the music thrown in for good measure , the game is a sure winner .
The Atari version of Frogger is very close to the real arcade game .
There are only a few differences .
First , there is twice the number of counts in the time limit to get the frog home .
Along with this change , you receive only five bonus points for each count remaining on the clock .
The only other significant difference is that the Atari version allows only one player .

Another year , another round of nonsense about a link between
abortion and breast cancer .
It ’s
an interesting question to ask if anti-choicers are
misunderstanding a recent report on abortion and breast cancer because they
want to or if it ’s because they really are n’t sharp enough as a rule to
understand it ( my sense is a combination of both factors ) , but one thing we
know for sure is that there is no such thing as evidence conclusive enough
disproving their claims that they will accept it .
The pseudo - scientific nonsense about abortion and breast
cancer has grown so out of control that even pro-science folks with huge
hang - ups about abortion have had to come out and denounce the anti-choicers
spreading this myth .
All this going round and round on the actual facts at hand
is all very interesting , but between my links to Amie Newman and David Gorski
on this issue , I think the facts at hand are covered .
But what has always fascinated me — what generally
fascinates me when it comes to issues of pseudo - scientific hysteria — is the
question of why .
Why do
anti-choicers continue to flog this myth about breast cancer , even when they ’re
shown time and again that there ’s no link ?
Why do they continue to insist that you ’ll get breast cancer
if you get an abortion , even though the few , problem - laden studies that suggested a link showed a slight one at best ?
At first , the answer seems obvious :
They spread this
misinformation because they want to scare women off having abortions and
intimidate them into giving birth against their will .
But if you think about this for a moment , it does n’t really
make sense .
Choosing an abortion
is n’t like refusing to wear sunscreen — most women who have abortions are
deeply invested in the choice not to have a baby right then , and a slightly
elevated risk of breast cancer ( which does n’t even exist ! ) will not deter them
from having to make a choice they feel they must make .
People make choices that elevate their
cancer risk that they do n’t need to make all the time — we drink , we smoke , we
eat crappy food , and we go out in the sun without protection .
Some times we elevate our cancer risk a
lot for no good reason .
A slight
to nonexistent cancer risk associated with something that a woman feels she
must do for her immediate health , safety , and well - being is simply not going to
make a difference .
To hear anti-choicers carry on , abortion must be risk - free
in order to be an acceptable and legal choice , and since it is not risk - free ,
it should be shoved underground and the risks attendant to it should be
multiplied .
Their reason for this
is presumably that they care about women .
Care about women so much that they want to drive them to illegal
abortion and / or drive them to bear children against their will , which is much
riskier than having an abortion , since pregnancy and childbirth raise your
blood pressure , your risk of diabetes , and of course there ’s all the dangers of
giving birth .
Their “ care ” for
women is very narrowly defined — it only pops up when it ’s a politically
convenient cover story to excuse what is an assault on women ’s fundamental
rights .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

With all this in mind , I ’m forced to conclude that the
reason those anti-choicers — a group of people that is almost unilaterally
religious and uses their “ faith ” as a political tool — enjoy trotting out the
breast cancer myth is because it ’s an unsubtle way to threaten women who get
abortions .
In other words , they ’re
telling you that if you get an abortion , God will punish you .
And he ’ll do so in a highly misogynistic
way , going after a symbol of your womanhood , your breasts .
Of course , telling someone God will punish her is basically
a way to punish her , but hiding behind God .
The God of the fundamentalists seems like a really awful
guy : he punishes gays
for not hating themselves , Haiti
for throwing off the bonds of slavery and colonialism , and America for valuing liberty and
equality .
Telling women
they ’ll get breast cancer if they get abortions falls into this habit .
It ’s just a way to heap pain on women ,
probably because Roe v.
Wade has made
it hard to just toss them in jail for the crime of being jezebels .
The problem , of course , is that many women who get abortions
have absorbed cultural misogyny and sex-phobia .
We all have low moments , moments of grief and sadness and
despair in our lives .
And some of
us are inclined to wonder , at those moments , if we ’re being punished for doing
something wrong .
It ’s in those
moments that being told that God will punish you for having an abortion will
creep into your mind , to make your sadness worse and your suffering more
profound .
And that , I think , is the true purpose of spreading this
myth — not to prevent abortions , but to make sure that women who get them
suffer for it , wallow in self - hatred , and otherwise are punished .
Not by God , of course , but by
anti-choicers .
And of course , the
jackpot for the folks spreading this myth is that a percentage of women who
have abortions — as well as a percentage that do n’t — will inevitably develop
breast cancer .
And the hope is
that in that moment of pain and weakness , when a woman most needs to be able to
buck up her strength and carry on , that her abortion will come back and she’ll
be further wracked with pain and guilt and misery .
For having the gall , when she was younger , to care about
herself and take care of her own business .
But they are doing this to you because they “ care ” .
Yesterday morning , Joseph Andrew Stack flew his single - engine plane into the Echelon building in North Austin , Texas .
He left Georgetown airfield and flew directly to the location – low and at full speed – before crashing into the building .
It was quickly confirmed that this was intentional , a controlled flight into a building which housed an IRS centre with almost 200 employees .
The impact of the plane was described as an earthquake or an explosion .
Thirteen employees were treated for injuries related to the resulting fire , with two admitted into hospital .
The remains of three people have been found in the building .
Stack owned the plane , a Piper Cherokee Dakota , a single - engine , four - seater plane similar to the one pictured .
The Dakota has four fuel tanks and holds 84 US gallons ( 318 litres ) of fuel .
He could have easily reached his destination with only one tank of AVgas , thus it is possible that the other three tanks could have held liquid accelerants in order to keep the fires burning .
Although Stack ’s webpage has been removed , copies of his suicide manifesto which was posted to his company website that day , are available all over the Internet .
At six pages , it is long and detailed – some say rambling – but makes it clear that the building he flew into was very carefully chosen .
Stack explains , in abstract terms , the issues he has had with the IRS over the years .
Yahoo !
News offers some detail .
“ According to California state records , Stack had a troubled business history , twice starting software companies in California that ultimately were suspended by the state ’s tax board , one in 2000 , the other in 2004 .
Also , his first wife filed for bankruptcy in 1999 , listing a debt to the IRS of nearly $ 126,000 . ”
Certainly it is clear that Stack felt he had been treated unfairly and in his manifesto he comes to the conclusion that “ violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer . ”
The Manifesto Of Austin Texas Crash Pilot Joseph Andrew Stack
I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different .
I am finally ready to stop this insanity .
Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let ’s try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well .
Earlier that day , Stack appears to have set his house on fire .
Austin paper the Statesman reports :
Neighbors said they heard a loud noise that sounded like a car crash at about 9:15 a.m. and soon saw flames coming from house .
Neighbor Elbert Hutchins said he ran to the house while calling 911 and saw flames coming out of an upstairs window .
Soon he saw a woman and a girl drive up in a car .
Neighbors believe that was Stack ’s wife and daughter , who is about 12 years old .
His neighbour , Chuck Watkins , filmed the flames :
Stack then went to Georgetown airfield to his plane .
Many news reports have cited that he did not have a flight plan – I ’m not sure why you would want to notify the FAA of your intentions to fly into a building or quite how that flight plan would look .
However , it ’s worth understanding that there is no reason to fly a flightplan for a local VFR flight – it would have been more surprising if he had filed one .
12160.ORG state that this recording is the final transmissions to Georgetown Tower from N2889D , in MP3 format .
The pilot was cleared for take - off and then stated he was heading southbound from Georgetown .
The controller approved a frequency change and the pilot signed off .
There ’s been no information that he spoke to Austin control after this point .
Local news station KXAN have put footage of the scene on YouTube for viewing .
The National Transportation Safety Board are expected to announce a press briefing today .
‘ We ’re sick of all the f*** ing fags in the neighborhood , ’ cops allegedly told gay man
Miami Beach has long had a reputation for being a refuge for gay Americans , but if the ACLU ’s allegations against the city prove true , people in the LGBT community may want to think twice about retiring to the vibrant little community just off the coast of southern Florida .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ACLU ’s Florida chapter says it plans to sue the Miami Beach Police Department after a gay visitor to the city was beaten and arrested by police when he tried to call 911 to report the police beating of another gay man .
According to the NBC affiliate in Miami , Harold Strickland says he was harassed , verbally assaulted and wrongfully arrested in March , 2009 , when he called 911 after witnessing two police officers kicking a handcuffed gay man in Miami Beach ’s Flamingo Park .
Strickland says the officers , identified as Frankly Forte and Elliot Hazzi , were kicking the suspect “ like his head was a football . ”
When the officers saw Strickland making a call on a nearby pay phone , Strickland says one officer came up to him and said , “ We know what you ’re doing here .
We ’re sick of all the fucking fags in the neighborhood . ”
The officers arrested Strickland and continued to barrage him with homophobic epithets , NBC Miami reports .
“ Often , police target gay men walking near Flamingo Park for nothing more than looking ‘ too gay ’ , ” Robert Rosenwald , director of the Florida ACLU ’s LGBT Advocacy Project , said in a statement .
“ When police officers become the problem rather than the solution , the City needs to take action . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In a letter ( PDF ) sent to Miami Beach Mayor Matti Harrera Bower on Wednesday , the ACLU said Miami Beach police “ also have an alarming history of arresting individuals , particularly African - American men and women , who witness police misconduct . ”
The ACLU says it has received reports of Miami Beach officers threatening to arrest witnesses of police misconduct and even tearing out cellphone SIM cards belonging to people who photographed police arrests .
“ All people have a clear constitutional right and a civic duty to report police misconduct , ” said Ray Taseff , an attorney working with the ACLU .
“ When police start arresting people for reporting police misconduct , the public ’s faith in law enforcement suffers . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Carlos Santoscoy at OnTopMag , the officers who arrested Strickland claimed in their police report that Strickland had been “ prowling ” Flamingo Park and approached their squad car before fleeing when he realized there was an officer inside .
But Santoscoy reports that Strickland ’s recorded 911 call “ conflicts ” with the arresting officers ’ claims , as the officers can be heard on the 911 call confronting Strickland after he had reported what he had allegedly seen .

The ACLU is calling on Mayor Bower to discipline the two officers involved .

Last year , when the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the latest projections for our population growth , the numbers jolted the population issue into the light of public discussion .
On The 7.30 Report , last week , Kerry O’Brien has just given it top billing .
His timing could scarcely have been better for those who would like to see the population debate go global .
Last February , on the initiative of one John Feeney from Boulder , Colorado , hundreds of environmental scientists and other concerned individuals held a “ Global Population Speak Out ” .
The intention was to break down the taboo against discussing human numbers in the context of environmental wellbeing .
You might not have noticed the event but the Washington - based Population Institute was so impressed by its success that they are organising a repeat performance next month .
Advertisement
Do n’t expect to see crowds marching in lab - coats and waving placards .
This protest will be considered a resounding success if a few hundred respected scientists and other influential figures manage to have their messages delivered through the popular media during the same month .
As one who has been banging on about the subject for decades , I believe I have the measure of the whole phenomenon .
Broadly , in terms of public understanding , there are three obstacles to be overcome in linking people - pressure with environmental deterioration .
For a start , “ the environment ” is a term covering so many different concerns - from polar bears to urban sprawl - that muddled arguments prevail and the underlying connections tend to be missed in the shouting .
Tree huggers , frustrated motorists and waterless farmers could find they had more in common than they realised if they got together and thought beyond their immediate problems .
Second , scientific facts alone have never been enough to bring the crowds out ; it ’s the way we feel about the facts , the emotions they stir , that gets us out on to the street .
Feelings of right and wrong are particularly important .
There is nothing like moral outrage for bringing law - abiding folk into conflict with the riot police , especially if there is a clear target for blame .
Some quite diffuse targets are commonly regarded as fair game - big business , governments , the system - but the collective human footprint does not meet the requirements at all .
Not only is it too broad ( we cannot even exclude ourselves ) but it might also be misinterpreted .
It might be thought that there is a particular , unspoken target , such as women , or the poor , or religious groups who oppose birth control .
Better steer clear of it altogether .
Before I come to the third and crucial point , I should dismiss the idea that numbers do n’t matter , that it ’s only what we do that makes a difference to our environment , not the number of people doing it .
This is such nonsense that it insults one ’s intelligence and yet we hear it time and again .
In reality , even the simplest lifestyles can multiply to deliver a hefty wallop to the natural world .
In Africa I have seen landscapes devastated by people just trying to follow the humble way of life that supported their ancestors , in much smaller numbers , for centuries .
At the other end of the scale , Australians are among the worst carbon polluters in the world and yet our global contribution to greenhouse gases is only 1.4 per cent - a peanut ’s depth in a metre of sea level rise .
It ’s all in the numbers .
The entire output of Australia ’s greenhouse gases would be exceeded merely by the belching of India ’s livestock if only India ’s herds were not so hard - pressed to find enough decent pasture .
Over vast regions of Asia the groundwater is being used by hundreds of millions of irrigators faster than it can possibly be replenished even with no climate change .
Of course numbers matter , and at every level of existence .
So , now to that third point .
A lot of people make money out of population growth so in their view the more consumers the better and the more pressure on land the greater the rise in its value .
That ’s the simple reality , but it has an emotive component that is less obvious .
Somehow , the promoters of population growth have fostered the idea , deep in the human psyche , that they hold the moral high ground ; that nice people can only ever want more people .
Those who disagree are suspect .
They must hate motherhood , or migrants , or both , and are probably closet racists .

Politicians loathe being asked about population policy .
Green NGOs keep it off their manifestos for fear of losing support .
Public figures in conversation quickly change the subject .
In Copenhagen the impact of human numbers was officially invisible , despite the best efforts of Sustainable Population Australia and Britain ’s Optimum Population Trust .
All this plays back into the hands of the population profiteers .
Misinformation is easy to maintain when those who know better prefer to keep quiet .
How many Australians , for instance , have been led to believe that with a fertility rate below the replacement level our population would be declining without immigration ?
It is n’t true .
Parents do not generally drop dead as soon as children are born .
With a fertility rate of 1.8 Australia ’s population would continue to increase for several decades before stabilising .
Only then would we need a total fertility rate of slightly more than 2.0 to prevent a slow decline .
At present rates plus immigration there could be twice as many Australians by the time today ’s infants are middle - aged .
The USA will grow by more than a hundred million people over the same period .
This , then , is what the participants in the Global Population Speak Out are attempting to overcome .
Not the misinterpretation of facts and figures but the taboo that inhibits public discussion and prevents proper understanding .
My guess is that their task will become easier as the climate becomes more worrisome .
Taboos can be swept away in nature ’s storms .
It happens all over the world .
Just look what AIDS did for the open discussion of safe sex .
China Mobile has a custom build of Android on devices they call OPhones and their custom platform – again , based on Android – is named the Open Mobile System .
But in a recent press release , the carrier announced that their Android Phones will have support for Windows Mobile API .
What in the… ???
Here is the press release :
BEIJING , Feb 02 , 2010 ( SinoCast Daily Business Beat via COMTEX ) —
China Mobile Ltd. ( SEHK : 0941 ; NYSE : CHL ) has upgraded its OMS ( Open Mobile System ) to 2.0 version , which is compatible with technologies such as SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) , Windows Mobile
API , and voice recognition and generation .
OMS is a proprietary smartphone operating system developed by China Mobile using source codes of Google Inc. ( Nasdaq : GOOG | Quote | Chart | News | PowerRating ) ’s Android platform .
It is regarded as a secondary development on the basis of Android .
Mobile phones based on OMS are called OPhones .
Android has had many different versions after it was created in 2008 .
As a result , OMS has been upgrading itself since its release , trying to catch up the pace of Android .
Because Android ’s codes are open to all developers , the R&D team of OMS embedded China Mobile ’s services like instant messaging and messengers client Fetion into OMS while making changes to Android .
The latest version of OMS is able to provide support for the next - generation mobile Internet and communications technologies and stronger and more efficient technology R&D for family services .
Nobody knows what the heck that really means , but most people are suggesting that it will act as an emulator of sorts so that Android can run Windows Mobile apps from within an app .
Or something .
Who really knows but this will be interesting to follow .

Notion Ink Adam hands - on
We first told you about Notion Ink and their Adam tablet back in December , and since then they ’ve captured plenty of attention at CES 2010 for including NVIDIA ’s new Tegra 2 chipset and being the first use of a Pixel Qi display .
We caught up with Notion Ink , company founder Rohan Shravan and the Adam prototype today for an extended discussion , not only about the hardware but exclusively about the company ’s plans and expectations for content and usage models .
Check out our exclusive photos and never - before - seen video after the cut .
Since it ’s a prototype the Adam ’s casing here is not what the final design will be ; in fact this was hand - made especially for showing the tablet at CES .
The eventual hardware will be 14 mm thick ( Rohan said they could even get it down to around 12 mm ) with a reasonably minimal bezel , packed with the 10.1 - inch Pixel Qi transflective display , a capacitive touchscreen eventually capable of recognizing six simultaneous points of contact , integrated WiFi and 3G .
Thanks to Tegra 2 the Adam is 1080 p capable , with an HDMI port to output to an HDTV or projector , and while the OS they ’re showing today is bare Android they ’ve a new UI in the works complete with a replacement on - screen keyboard more ergonomically designed for large - touchscreen use .
Pixel Qi’s technology means you can operate the display in two different modes : as full color LCD for use indoors or in a low - power reflective mode that actually gets brighter the more direct sunlight falls upon it .
This latter mode is comparable to E Ink in its appearance , but Pixel Qi can still show smooth , responsive video ( and slightly muted colors ) .
Users will be able to manually switch the backlighting on or off , or leave it set to automatic and have the Adam toggle it itself .
Notion
Ink also offered to take the Adam out into direct sunlight so SlashGear could exclusively see the screen performance there .
So far so good , but what other sites have n’t been able to show you is the digital magazine dynamic content that will be a centerpoint of the Notion Ink experience when the Adam tablet launches .
Notion
Ink are working with various content producers – including some big - name blogs – to “ reinvent ” magazines and newspapers , and while they would n’t share any partner names they did show us some initial concepts .
Bear in mind that what you see in here are the company ’s earlier working concepts , some of which date back to 2007 ; Notion Ink will be showing off functional versions at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona come February 2010 .
As well as touch control the tablet will respond to accelerometer movement in all directions , whether that ’s for navigating through pages or controlling movement in games .
The Adam will work as a window on one huge desktop , a UI which Notion Ink codenamed Enigma ( there ’s a concept shot of it in the gallery below ) , with the view moving as you tilt , shake and flip the tablet around .
They ’ve also developed motion - based gestures for common tasks – often tricky on touchscreens – like selecting , cutting and copying text and images .
You may also have read that Notion Ink have a new 3 - megapixel camera with a patented swivel action , and we ’re excited to be able to show you the first live pictures of that .
Where in other photos we ’ve seen the company discretely covering the assembly with their hand , or even showing a second prototype without it installed , here you can see the rotating camera barrel which allows you to flip the camera from front to back .
The design means you can both use the Adam for video calling and for regular photography , and saves the cost and bulk of two sets of optics .
On the back there ’s also a trackpad used – like we ’ve seen in a far smaller way on the Motorola Backflip – to navigate without leaving smudges on the display .
Initially the trackpad is 1:1 mapped to the screen , so you can tap and have the cursor show up exactly in the region you want it to ; then it works as a regular trackpad , scrolling the cursor around and tapping to select .
The Pixel Qi display and the frugal Tegra 2 chipset mean that despite the HD video capabilities , the Adam should excel in battery life , too .
NVIDIA are saying tablets with regular displays ( consuming around 2W ) using Tegra 2 will last for around 16 hours of Full HD video with a standard 3 - cell battery ; Rohan says that , because their display uses just 0.2W in its electrophoretic reflective mode , with that 3 - cell battery you ’ll potentially see up to 160 hours use .
Remember , that ’s not just 160 hours of static E Ink style text , but the potential for video playback and digital content reading in color .
Rohan also threw out a quick teaser about some unannounced upcoming features : if Tegra 2 has 12 - megapixel camera support , what might you use that support for on a tablet ?
We ’re stumped right now , but we reckon SlashGear readers might have some suggestions .
If you ca n’t tell already , we ’re really excited about what Notion Ink have achieved in the three years its taken them to develop the Adam .
Right now , due to bandwidth constraints , the current video is lower - res than we ’d like ; we ’ll replace it with an HD version as soon as we can .
By Mobile World Congress they ’re expecting to have optimized Android to shave boot - up time down to around three seconds , as well as making some announcements about pricing ( “ you ’ll be very happy ” was all a grinning Rohan would say ) and availability ; we ’re already planning our meeting with them there .

The discovery of a single gene which controls gender could pave the way for simpler treatment of trans people .
Researchers at the National Institute for Medical Research discovered that just one gene prevents females from developing male physical characteristics such as facial hair and testes .
The study in adult mice showed that when the gene , known as FOXL2 , was artificially switched off , the ovaries of female mice began developing into testes and they produced male amounts of testosterone .
Previously , it was thought that gender was controlled by X chromosomes and Y chromosomes .
Men typically have XY , while women have XX .
This study refutes the consensus that gender is fixed at birth and that embryos are female unless they possess a male - determining gene .
The paper was published today in journal Cell .
Co-author Robin Lovell - Badge said : “ We take it for granted that we maintain the sex we are born with , including whether we have testes or ovaries .
But this work shows that the activity of a single gene , FOXL2 , is all that prevents adult ovary cells turning into cells found in testes . ”
According to the Independent , he added : “ If it is possible to make these changes in adult humans , it may eventually remove the need for surgery in gender - reassignment treatment .
“ If this does become possible , it ’s likely that while treated individuals would make the right hormones for their new sex , fertility would be lost .
“ It ’s still very speculative , but it ’s possible that this approach could produce an alternative to surgery and the removal of gonads – ovaries and testes .
It ’s a little more natural , but of course anyone undergoing such a sex change would be infertile . ”
Professor Mathias Treier of the University of Cologne in Germany described the results as “ spectacular ” , saying that researchers had only expected the female mice to stop ovulating .
Although the outward appearance of the mice did not change during the experiment ’s timescale , Treier said the ovary cells began changing within 48 hours after the gene was switched off .
The new testes did not produce sperm but the presence of testosterone suggests that in humans , this could lead to facial hair , a deeper voice and increased muscular mass .
Although research in humans is a long way off , researchers believe this could eventually spell a end to lengthy gender reassignment treatment which currently uses hormones .

Other possible applications for the findings include treatment for early menopause in women .
The net 's most powerful company has had a difficult relationship with America 's intelligence agencies - but the threat of Chinese interference means it is now choosing sides
We all know that conflicts can produce some unlikely bedfellows , but as Google continues its battle with the Chinese authorities , it appears that another unlikely alliance is being forged .
According to this report in the Washington Post , Google has now turned to one of its fiercest enemies - America 's National Security Agency - to try and protect itself from interference .
The NSA - the group charged with conducting surveillance and codebreaking for the US government - is said to be working with Google to help it understand and analyse recent attacks by hackers said to be based in China .
On the surface , this might not seem like a big deal - after all , American companies have not been shy about asking the government for help over the last couple of years .
But in truth , it marks a sharp turnaround in Google 's often tense relationship with the Washington over surveillance issues .
In 2006 , the search engine 's boss , Eric Schmidt , criticised the US government for invading people 's privacy when it tried to gain access to records that detailed the online habits of millions of people .
While other search engines capitulated to the request , Google refused and took the issue to court - eventually getting a federal judge to rule that the request was illegal .
" This was a complete violation of our users ' rights , " said Schmidt later that year , during a talk in San Francisco that felt very clearly like he was flexing his muscles .
" We , as a society , came to a rational outcome - and if we do n't like it , we can replace the people who pass those laws . "
The NSA 's recent history has been inglorious : warrantless wiretapping scandal still continues , as well as allegations that it monitored internet use by customers of America 's biggest telecoms company , AT&T .
While safeguards are apparently being put in place to prevent the NSA from accessing private data during its work with Google - the Washington Post story says that " the alliance is being designed to allow the two organizations to share critical information without violating Google 's policies or laws that protect the privacy of Americans ' online communications " - the antagonism between the two organisations has been palpable in the past .
But today 's reports show a different approach to relations between the NSA and Google .
Why ?
The first - and most obvious - difference may simply be one of politics .
The White House then was ruled by George Bush and Dick Cheney ; these days it is Obama who runs the show .
Schmidt 's close links to the president are well - known ( he acted first as a campaign adviser and is now a member of the president 's science and technology committee ) and perhaps he does not feel the same antipathy any more .
If that 's true , it could be misplaced : the American intelligence agencies - like Britain 's civil service - change little between administrations , and are often accused of following their own agenda despite ultimately reporting to the Oval Office .
Secondly , it is possible that working with the NSA may help Google in other areas , such as putting the dampener on possible antitrust investigations .
Schmidt already stepped down from a directorship at Apple amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest , but that did not stop regulators from continuing their investigation .
The third reason , however , is much more pragmatic : simply that Google is now under threat from an entity more powerful than it bargained for .
For all the company 's huffing and puffing recently , the Chinese government is a beast that cannot seem to be cajoled or controlled .
And though there is talk of Google as a nation in its own right - the logical end point of corporate capitalism , perhaps - it 's still clear that some things are beyond the reach of companies , however rich and powerful they may feel .
By turning to the US government , Google appears to have weighed up its options and decided that protecting itself is better than engaging in a vendetta with Washington .
In many ways , it is a tip of the hat to Hillary Clinton , who gave tacit support for Google during a speech on internet foreign policy a couple of weeks ago .
" New technologies do not take sides , " she said .
" But the United States does . "
Now it looks like Google is doing the same .
Rheinland - Pfalz 23 - Jähriger tötet Lehrer in Ludwigshafener Schule
Schock in Ludwigshafen : Ein 23 - Jähriger hat an einer Berufsschule einen Lehrer getötet - mehrere andere soll er angegriffen haben .

“ … Sweeping aside a century - old understanding and overruling two important precedents , a bitterly divided Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections . ”
Dear Supreme Court ,
I ’m highly impressed with your recent decision to vaporize limits on corporate political spending .
It ’s the kind of campaign finance reform our ailing res publica needs .
In fact , I found it so inspirational , here ’s an even better idea .
Let ’s give corporations the right to vote .
One share , one vote .
The logic ?
It ’s simple .
Corporations are people ; all people are created equal ; ergo , corporations must have equal rights — and no right is more important than the right to vote .
( Well , maybe the right to buy fully automatic machine guns , but that ’s another story ) .
Goldman Sachs , for example , has 514,080,000 shares outstanding — so they ’d get 514 millon votes ( in fact , maybe we should give them more , because they ’re so smart ) .
Ford has 3.31 billion shares outstanding , so they ’d get approximately 2.8 billion more votes than Goldman .
I ’ve discussed this with several other economists , and we all agree : it ’s the most efficient solution .
Why , it should save hundreds of millions in lobbying alone .
Who needs K Street when corporations can simply , quickly , easily vote in the candidate of their choice ?
As a bonus , political scientists agree that the increasing polarization between left and right would quickly disappear , too .
Human people — with their perpetual squabbling — would be simply outvoted by corporate people , who know what ’s good for everyone .
But the most lucrative upside is this .
The money that ’s saved can then be invested in the high - value products and services which our publicly traded corporations , the Goliaths of the global economy , excel at — like toxic CDOs , bigger burgers , and mega bonuses .
And if we ’ve learned anything over the last 30 years , it ’s this : everyone ’s better off when the benefits of more mass - produced stuff trickle down to the average ( lazy , shiftless ) Joe .
It ’s time to save our democracy , Justices — through a better kind of democracy .
I call it “ corpocracy ” : power to the people who matter most , corporations .
Democracy 2.0 : it ’s the next stage in the evolution of the American Dream .
It ’s not just humans who are people .
We ’ve been discriminating against corporate people for too long , and it ’s unethical .
Are you with me , Justices ?
Its time to liberate corporations from human oppression .
Here ’s hoping it ’s your legacy .
NB — Mockery aside , here ’s Larry Lessig ’s masterful take on the subject .
Like I said on Twitter today — America ’s institutionally self - destructing .
What would happen if solar panels were free ?
What if it were possible to know everything about the world — not the Internet , but the living , physical world — in real time ?
What if doctors could forecast a disease years before it strikes ?
This is the promise of the World Changing Idea : a vision so simple yet so ambitious that its full impact is impossible to predict .
Scientific American ’s editorial and advisory boards have chosen projects in five general categories — Energy , Transportation , Environment , Electronics and Robotics , and Health and Medicine — that highlight the power of science and technology to improve the world .
Some are in use now ; others are emerging from the lab .
But all of them show that innovation is the most promising elixir for what ails us .

An eclectic synthesis of psychedelic grunge and classic rock ,
Dubbed " rock n’ roll classicists " and " an eclectic synthesis of psychedelic grunge and classic rock " by Chicago press Model Stranger ’s sound and unique look has pleased rock and roll purists , indie rock fans , and casual listeners all the same .
Their variety of sonic influences covers ground of which fans have described as ranging from Tom Petty and David Bowie to Pearl Jam and Muse .
Model Stranger ’s sound has been described as “ akin to an off beat conversation between a deprived Thom Yorke and an angry John Lennon dissecting the modern challenges of the human condition . ”
While taking a break from the road , Model Stranger has been in the studio working on songs and additional material for their follow up to their debut full length release “ Dreams & Bones ” .
This next effort is proving to be a more focused studio project which contrasts to the approach taken on their first record .
Priding themselves on their live sound they recently released “ Live at the Double Door ” which showcases their strength as a live band .
The band will be releasing first listens and sneak peeks of their new material throughout the Winter / Spring of 2012 .
Taking a live performance driven approach into the studio on " Dreams & Bones " , the band completed a record that exhibited a raw and authentic quality in part thanks to an analog recording process .
The record charted on CMJ charts across the country following its release in April 2010 .
While maintaining a dedicated following in Chicago , Model Stranger continued making fans around the greater Midwest and extended markets by remaining arduous to the road performing over 150 dates in their first 18 months as a band .
To add to the collection of videos online from their growing fan base , the band recently released a video for the live and radio favored “ Where Do We Go From Here ? ” Model Stranger - made up of Stephen Francis ( vocals / guitar ) , Kevin James ( Bass ) and Vincent Joseph ( Drums ) is the epitome of a DIY band .
This rock trio has worked the Midwest scene very diligently with an impressive list of successful regional tours .
In addition to sharing the stage with popular national acts such as Our Lady Peace , Local H , Sister Hazel , and Neon Trees , Model Stranger has performed at famous Chicago clubs and festivals such as ; The Metro , Congress Theater , Double Door , and Cubby Bear .
Model Stranger also co-headlined the 2009 I AM FEST , and played at the 2009 , 2010 Taste of Chicago festival , and Taste of Lincoln Festival 2010 , 2011 .
While the band will not be abandoning life on the road entirely in 2012 , the majority of their focus will be new songs that will be used for an unscheduled release this year .
Beyond their recording prowess and sonic diversity , Model Stranger has really begun to build a reputation based on their energetic and magnetic live performances .
Jay Madey of popular Chicago blog " The Steam Engine " had this to say about the band ’s live show :
“ Model Stranger have really had my attention lately .
Live , they really kick it up a notch ( multiple notches are kicked actually ) and the songs get Mark McGwire ’d with this power that ’s quite remarkable . ”
“ [ Model Stranger ] has technical prowess and front man Stephen Francis appears to be progressing into a unique and passionate song writer that is inspired by more than just love and heartbreak .
It ’s refreshing and exciting and I cannot wait to see what they do next . ”

Many people ask , " But how in the world could a laissez - faire society deal with aggression by foreign nations , since it would have no government to protect it ? "
Behind this question are two unrealized assumptions : first , that government is some sort of extra-societal entity with resources of its own — resources which can only be tapped for defense by the action of government — and , second , that government does , in fact , defend its citizens .
In reality , government must draw all its resources from the society over which it rules .
When a governmentally controlled society takes defensive action against an aggression by a foreign power , where does it get the resources necessary to take that action ?
The men who fight are private individuals , usually conscripted into government service .
The armaments are produced by private individuals working at their jobs .
The money to pay for these armaments and the pittance doled out to the conscripts , as well as the money to pay the salaries of that small minority comprising the other members of the armed forces , is confiscated from private individuals by means of taxation .
Government 's only contribution is to organize the whole effort by the use of force — the force of the draft , taxation , and other , more minor coercions , such as rationing , wage and price ceilings , travel restrictions , etc .
So , to maintain that government is necessary to defend a society from foreign aggression is to maintain that it is necessary to use domestic aggression against the citizens in order to protect them from foreign aggression .
In spite of the obvious immorality of forcing men to protect themselves against force , some people still maintain that a coerced defense is more efficient than a willing one and is , therefore , permissible or even necessary in an emergency situation such as war .
A brief examination will show the fallacy of this variation of the moral / practical dichotomy .
The success of any endeavor , including war , depends on the amount of thought and effort put into it by those involved .
Under the pressure of force , a man may be induced to put forth a great deal of effort and even a little thought , but his reluctant , fear - driven exertions can't compare in efficiency and productivity with the ambitious and tireless efforts of a free man striving to accomplish something he really wants to get done .
The man who works enthusiastically not only works more efficiently , he also uses his mind to discover new and better ways of reaching the goal , and such innovation is the key to success .
Furthermore , a system of force is always wasteful of resources , because the more unwilling is the victim of the force , the more energy must be diverted to keeping him in line and the less is left to accomplish the task .
Men who are forced to do what they do n't want to ( or not to do what they do want to ) are amazingly good at devising devious and complicated ways to cheat on the system which enslaves them .
This is why even the most totalitarian of governments find that they cannot wage war without huge propaganda efforts aimed at convincing their own people of the justice and necessity of the war .
Freedom is not only as moral as governmental slavery is immoral , it is as practical as government is impractical .
It is foolish to suppose that men would not organize to defend themselves , and do so very effectively , if they were not forced to .
Men are not so blind that they can't grasp the value of freedom , nor so indifferent to life that they will not defend their values .
Nor are they so stupid that they need politicians , bureaucrats , and Pentagon generals to tell them how to organize and what to do .
The freer people are , the more efficiently they will perform .
This being true , a free - market system of defense against foreign aggression can be expected to be very effective , in contrast to a governmental system of comparable size , resources , and maturity .
The belief that society could n't be defended without a government also assumes that government does , indeed , protect the society over which it rules .
But when it is realized that government really has nothing except what it takes by force from its citizens , it becomes obvious that the government can't possibly protect the people , because it does n't have the resources to do so .
In fact , government , without the citizens on whom it parasitizes , could n't even protect itself !
Throughout history , people have been talked into submitting to the tyrannies of their governments because , they were told , their government was vitally necessary to protect them from the even more terrible depredations of other governments .
The governments , having put over this bit of propaganda , then proceeded to cajole and coerce their citizens into protecting them !
Governments never defend their citizens ; they can't .
What they do is make the citizens defend them , usually after their stupid and imperialistic policies have aggravated or threatened another government to the point of armed conflict .
Governmental protection against foreign aggression is a myth ( but a myth which , sad to say , most people actually believe in ) .
Government can't defend its citizens , and it is foolish and sacrificial for the citizens to defend a coercive monopoly which not only enslaves them but makes a practice of provoking conflicts with other coercive monopolies — i.e. , with other governments .
In the matter of foreign aggression , government is far more of a liability than an asset , and people would be much better off with a free - market system of defense .
The free - market means of defense against foreign aggression would differ in scope and intensity , but not in principle from the free - market means of defense against domestic aggression ( such as a gang of local hoodlums ) .
In either case , the principle involved is that each man has both the liberty and the responsibility to defend his own values to the extent he considers it to be in his own self - interest .
Morally , no man may be prevented from defending himself and his values , nor may he be forced to defend them if he does n't want to do so .
If some of the people in an area feel that one of their neighbors is not " carrying his fair share of the defense burden , " they are free to use rational persuasion to attempt to convince him that it would be in his interest to assume his own responsibility of self - defense .
They may not , however , extort his compliance by any use or threat of force …even if they are clearly in the majority .
Nor would it be practical for them to do so .
A man who is coerced into defending his neighbors against a foreign aggressor may decide to spend part of his efforts on defending himself against his coercive neighbors instead .
In a laissez - faire society , defense against foreign aggression would be offered for sale on the free market , just as would any other type of defense .
Because of the close natural connection between insurance companies and defense agencies , it would probably be most feasible to sell defense against foreign aggression in the form of insurance policies .
That is , insurance companies would sell policies agreeing to protect their insureds against foreign aggression and to indemnify them for losses resulting from such aggression ( the contract to be void , of course , if the insured provoked the conflict by his own aggressive actions ) .
The insurance companies would see to it that whatever defenses were necessary to prevent the losses were provided , and they would make sure that a very efficient job of defense was done , since any losses would cost them large sums of money .
Critics have questioned whether insurance companies could afford to pay off all the claims caused by the widespread destruction of a modern war , should their defenses be overpowered .
If the war were lost , of course , neither the insurance company personnel , nor their insureds , nor anyone else would be in a position to carry on normal financial dealings .
If it were won , the insurance companies would have to either pay off or go out of business .
In determining whether an insurance company would be financially able to pay , there are two important considerations — the extent and intensity of the damage , and the extent of the insurance company 's assets .
The amount of damage is impossible to predict in advance of the actual situation , but there is no reason to assume that it would necessarily be so severe as to include the total destruction of all major cities .
Governments usually launch wars of destruction only against areas which , because of the actions of their own governments , pose a threat to the attacker .
A laissez - faire society , having no government to make imperialistic threats , would be unlikely to become the object of a war of destruction .
A foreign government might decide to enrich itself by annexing the free territory , but it would attempt to do so by a war of conquest rather than by a war of destruction .
Wars of conquest are much less devastating and call for the restrained use of conventional weapons rather than the use of nuclear weapons .
The simple reason for this is that the conqueror stands to reap a great deal less profit from rubble and corpses than he does from factories and slaves .
Another reason to assume that a war against a laissez - faire society would not be totally destructive of that society is that effective defenses against modern warfare undoubtedly can be devised .
The fact that governments have not yet devised such defenses only proves that governments are both profoundly inefficient and more interested in imperialistic power grabs than in defending their citizens .
Given the efficiency of the free market and the incentive of the profit motive ( because people would be willing to pay for effective defense " hardware " if they were allowed to buy it ) , innovators would doubtless come up with many defensive devices far superior to the military war machine now imposed upon us .
" Government can't defend its citizens , and it is foolish and sacrificial for the citizens to defend a coercive monopoly which not only enslaves them but makes a practice of provoking conflicts with other coercive monopolies — i.e. , with other governments . "
The second consideration in determining insurance companies ' ability to pay claims arising from foreign aggression is the extent of their assets .
Even in our society , where they are hamstrung by governmental regulations , insurance companies manage to hold vast and varied assets , spread over wide financial and geographic areas .
They also make a practice of dividing large risks among various companies so that a sudden , extensive amount of destruction can be paid for without bankrupting any of them .
This is the reason that insurance companies can pay out the millions of dollars in claims which arise from major hurricanes , tornadoes , earthquakes , etc. , and can do so again and again without being driven out of business .
In a laissez - faire society , insurance companies should be even better based financially than they are in our governmentally crippled economy .
This means that an attacker would have to succeed in wiping out a large portion of the assets of the whole society in order to put the insurance companies out of business .
But there is no reason to assume that a foreign government would attack the whole free area at once ( since , without a government , it would n't be a single political entity ) or that it would succeed in destroying most of it if it did .
Although there is no absolute guarantee that insurance companies would be financially able to pay off the claims arising from an attack by a foreign power , the chances that they would are very good .
The actual defense of a laissez - faire society would be furnished by defense companies ( both independent ones and those which were subsidiaries of insurance companies ) .
These defenses would consist of whatever military personnel and materiel were necessary to defeat the forces of any nation threatening ( or potentially threatening ) the insureds .
Such defenses would vary in size and type according to the threat posed , and they could include anything from spies and foot soldiers to radar networks and defensive missiles .
Since the development and maintenance of modern weaponry is quite expensive , all but the largest insurance companies would probably pool their efforts and resources under competitive pressure to provide the best possible protection at the lowest cost .
For the same reasons of efficiency , they would tend to purchase all their foreign aggression defense needs from a few outstanding companies which could cooperate closely with each other .
Competition between the defense companies to get such profitable business would foster the development of the most powerful and efficient defense system rationally warranted .
Technological innovations which are at present unforeseeable would constantly upgrade its safety and effectiveness .
No governmental system , with its miles of red tape and built - in politicking , pork barreling , wire pulling , and power grabbing could even remotely approximate the potency and efficiency naturally generated by the free - market forces ( which are always moving to meet demand ) .
Those who doubt that " the private sector " of the economy could sustain the expense of a free enterprise defense system would do well to consider two facts .
First , " the public sector " gets its money from the same source as does " the private sector " — the wealth produced by individuals .
The difference is that " the public sector " takes this wealth by force ( which is legal robbery ) — but it does not thereby have access to a larger pool of resources .
On the contrary , by draining the economy by taxation and hobbling it with restrictions , the government actually diminishes the total supply of available resources .
Second , government , because of what it is , makes defense far more expensive than it ought to be .
The gross inefficiency and waste common to a coercive monopoly , which gathers its revenues by force and fears no competition , skyrocket costs .
Furthermore , the insatiable desire of politicians and bureaucrats to exercise power in every remote corner of the world multiplies expensive armies , whose main effect is to commit aggressions and provoke wars .
The question is not whether " the private sector " can afford the cost of defending individuals but how much longer individuals can afford the fearsome and dangerous cost of coerced governmental " defense " ( which is , in reality , defense of the government , for the government … by the citizens ) .
A major portion of the cost of defense against foreign aggression in a laissez - faire society would be borne originally by business and industry , as owners of industrial plants obviously have a much greater investment to defend than do owners of little houses in suburbia .
If there were any real threat of aggression by a foreign power , businessmen would all be strongly motivated to buy insurance against that aggression , for the same reason that they buy fire insurance , even though they could save money in the short run by not doing so .
An interesting result of this fact is that the cost of defense would ultimately tend to be spread among the whole population , since defense costs , along with overhead and other such costs , would have to be included in the prices paid for goods by consumers .
So , the concern that " free riders " might get along without paying for their own defense by parasitically depending on the defenses paid for by their neighbors is groundless .
It is based on a misconception of how the free - market system would operate .
The role of business and industry as major consumers of foreign - aggression insurance would operate to unify the free area in the face of any aggression .
An auto plant in Michigan , for example , might well have a vital source of raw materials in Montana , a parts plant in Ontario , a branch plant in California , warehouses in Texas , and outlets all over North America .
Every one of these facilities is important to some degree to the management of that Michigan factory , so it will want to have them defended , each to the extent of its importance .
Add to this the concern of the owners and managers of these facilities for their own businesses and for all the other businesses on which they , in turn , depend , and a vast , multiple network of interlocking defense systems emerges .
The involvement of the insurance companies , with their diversified financial holdings and their far - flung markets would immeasurably strengthen this defensive network .
Such a multiple network of interlocking defense systems is a far cry from the common but erroneous picture of small cities , businesses , and individuals , unprotected by a government , falling one by one before an advancing enemy horde .
Note , however , that such a defense network would not obligate any individual to contribute money or effort to any defensive action in which his values were not threatened .
Under the present governmental system of collectivistic defense within arbitrary boundaries , a Californian would be forced to sacrifice his values and possibly his life in order to defend the State of Maine , even though he had no interest at all in the matter .
At the same time , a man a few miles away in Quebec , because he was on the other side of a particular river , would have to sit idly by unless his own government decided to take some action .
This is because governmental defense , like any other governmental action , is and must be collectivistic in nature .
With a free - market defense system , each man acts to defend his own values to the extent he wishes to have them defended , regardless of what piece of real estate he happens to be occupying .
No man is forced to sacrifice for the defense of the collective system of a coercive gang called government .
A free - market defense system would also make it very difficult for an attacker to obtain a surrender .
Just as a laissez - faire society would have no government to start a war , it would have no government to capitulate .
The defenders would fight as long , and only as long , as they believed was in their self - interest .
Even the insurance companies and defense agencies could n't negotiate a surrender , because their agreements could bind no one but the persons who actually signed them .
It is interesting to speculate on what an aggressive foreign nation would do if confronted with such a situation .
" With a free - market defense system , each man acts to defend his own values to the extent he wishes to have them defended , regardless of what piece of real estate he happens to be occupying . "
In a free - market defense system , the size of the armies and the expenditures for armaments would be automatically regulated according to the need for them .
Consumers , kept informed of the world situation by the news media and by insurance advertising , would buy more insurance when aggression threatened , and less when the tensions eased .
This would be particularly true of the big businesses and industries constituting the largest single insurance customers .
They would be very foresighted in their purchase of foreign aggression insurance , just as they must be foresighted in all their other dealings .
Furthermore , competition would force defense costs to be held down , so that all armaments would have to be either engaged in necessary defensive uses or disposed of , as idle armaments would not be worth their keep .
No army could grow beyond what the market would support , and the market would never support an army larger than was actually necessary for defense , because force is a nonproductive expenditure of energy .
This automatic responsiveness of arms to world situation , with a built - in arms limitation , would offer several important advantages .
First , it would avoid the economic drain of maintaining standing armies larger than necessary , yet still allow for quick increase in arms when needed .
Second , it would put an end to the dangerous irritations and provocations to foreign nations which are always incident to maintaining large , imperialistic armies around the world and , thus , would remove a major source of hostility and tension .
Third , it would prevent all the various meddlings , aggressions , and " brushfire wars " which result from trying to play " world policeman " and regulate the affairs of everyone on the globe .
And fourth , it would guarantee that an overgrown military machine could never be seized by a would - be dictator and used against the people of the laissez - faire society themselves ( a guarantee which no constitution can possibly make ) .
A free - market defense system would also permanently end the danger that some careless or power mad politician might " push the button " and bring down on the hapless citizens all the retaliatory violence of " the other side . "
A free - market business would n't gain power by " pushing the button ; " it would lose a tremendous amount of assets .
Consequently , any military action by the free - market protection agencies would be strictly defensive , and undertaken only when all other means of meeting the threat had failed .
And , along with all its other advantages , a free - market defense system would put a permanent end to the blood - spattered immorality of the draft .
The professional , voluntary defense forces of the market would be far superior to governmental conscript forces .
Conscript armies are terribly expensive to maintain because of the constant need for training new conscripts to fill the places of that great and sensible majority who leave as soon as their term is up .
Furthermore , conscripts are notably ineffective and unwilling fighters as compared with volunteers , for obvious reasons .
Once again , it is the moral approach which is practical .
Many prophets of doom have cried that there can be no defense against modern missile warfare .
In fact , the danger of such a war is one of the chief arguments advanced in favor of a strong government .
It is said that only by maintaining a strong government can we hope to deter an enemy attack or successfully meet it when it comes .
And , since hundreds of missiles are already aimed at various parts of the globe and do n't seem likely to be dismantled in the foreseeable future , we are told that we had better plan on keeping that government strong for a long time to come and not dream of experimenting with radical ways to improve our society , such as freedom .
Since life does n't give any automatic guarantees of safety and success , it is true that even a strong free - market defense system might be overpowered by an all - out atomic - biological - chemical attack , should such an attack be launched .
But so might a governmental " defense " system , so this statement does n't really say anything about the relative merits of free - market defense vs. governmental " defense . "
An examination of governmental " defense " shows that it depends on the use of initiated force against its own citizens and on much propaganda about government - fabricated foreign " dangers , " and it requires citizens to sacrifice themselves for whatever government officials deem to be the good of the " public . "
The free market permits each man to defend his own values , uses no initiated force against and requires no sacrifice from customers , and penalizes those who refuse to live noncoercive lives .
Governmental " defense " is unavoidably wasteful and a drain on the resources of the society .
It is also ineffective in protecting the citizen against modern warfare and is likely to stay that way , because without competition and the profit motive it lacks sufficient incentive to innovate effectively .
In the free market , competition forces businesses to cut costs and eliminate waste , and it also brings about continual improvements in effectiveness through technological innovation as businesses struggle to " keep ahead of the competition . "
But worse than its waste and ineffectiveness , governmental " defense " is actually little more than an excuse for imperialism .
The more government " defends " its citizens , the more it provokes tensions and wars , as unnecessary armies wallow carelessly about in distant lands and government functionaries , from the highest to the lowest , throw their weight around in endless , provocating power grabs .
The war machine established by government is dangerous to both foreigners and its own citizens , and this machine can operate indefinitely without any effective check other than the attack of a foreign nation .
If such a war machine is unopposed by the armies of other nations , it is almost inevitably used to promote rampant imperialism .
But if it is opposed by a war machine of equal strength and deadliness , then a balance of terror ensues , with the constant threat of a holocaust .
Businesses in a free market can't spare the cash for such perilous follies , because they gain customers by offering values to free men rather than by threatening force against disarmed subjects .
Governments do n't really defend their citizen - subjects at all .
Instead , they provoke wars , and then they force the citizens to sacrifice their money , their freedom , and often their lives to defend the government Such " defense " is worse than no defense at all !
It is true that the missiles , the deadly chemicals , and the plagues of modern warfare constitute a very real threat .
But these implements of mass destruction were ordered to be constructed by governments , and these same governments are continually bringing new and more deadly weapons into existence .
To say that we must have a government to protect us as long as these products of government are around is like saying that a man should keep his cancerous tumor until sometime in the future when he gets better , because it would be too dangerous to remove it now !
If collectivism has proved itself inefficient , wasteful , and dangerous in such areas as transportation and medicine , surely the worst place of all to have it is in the vital area of defense against foreign aggression .
Wars and many other , less destructive kinds of human conflicts are the natural consequence of institutionalizing man-made violence in the form of governments !

In the press release announcing her deal with Fox News , Sarah Palin wasted no time in parroting the company line .
Palin said , “ It ’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news . ”
Interestingly , the Palin deal is not exclusive , and would free her up for a presidential run in 2012 .
Fox News Executive VP of Programming Bill Shine said , “ Governor Palin has captivated everyone on both sides of the political spectrum and we are excited to add her dynamic voice to the FOX News lineup . ”
As a contributor , Palin will provide political commentary and analysis for FOX News Channel ( FNC ) , FOX Business Network ( FBN ) , FOXNews.com , and FOX News - produced special event political programming for FOX Broadcasting . ”
Palin demonstrated her ability to regurgitate FNC propaganda likely before the ink was dry on the contract , “ I am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at FOX News .
It ’s wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news . ”

The fact that Palin does not have her own show on at very least the struggling Fox Business screams out that she is looking to keep her options open for 2012 .
Sarah Palin ’s deal does n’t commit her to Fox News as anything other than a contributor .
It is the same kind of deal as Pat Buchanan had with CNN .
These types of deals usually contain an out clause which would let the contributor leave in order to run for office .
This deal is perfect for Palin .
She gets a presence on television .
She can speak directly to her audience .
She gets pain , and leaves the door open for a potential presidential run in 2012 .
Her deal is effective immediately , so no one should be surprised if she pops up on The O’Reilly Factor tonight or tomorrow .
As far as her political future goes , I do n’t see how going on Fox News is going to help her shake her reputation as an intellectual light weight .
In fact , going into the media business could kill any existing perception of her as a serious politician , assuming that any non Palinite stills views her as such .
Her deal with Fox News makes it obvious that she is likely to run in 2012 , and if she fails , she now has her fallback position , which is her gig at Fox News .
Sarah has made her millions and now she still has a bit of the spotlight , but it has yet to be seen if she is serious about politics .

The bright and very young star HR 8799 , about 130 light - years away from Earth , hosts a planetary system that looks like a scaled - up model of our own Solar System .
3 giant planetary companions have been detected so far , with masses between 7 and 10 times that of Jupiter and being between 20 and 70 times as far from their host star than the Earth is from the Sun ; the system also includes two belts of smaller objects , similar to our asteroid and Kuiper belts .
This NACO image shows the star and the middle planet ( marked ) .
For the first time , astronomers have directly detected thelight signature of a planet orbiting an almost sun-like star .
This signaturecan tell scientists the chemical makeup of the planet , which can help themunderstand how it formed .
in the future these signatures could be used to lookfor signs of ? life on other planets .
The planet is a giant , about 10 times as massive as Jupiter , and it orbits between two other giants around a star similar to our sun in ascaled - up version of ourown solar system .
The three giant companions were detected in 2008 and rangein mass from seven to 10 times that of Jupiter , with orbits between 20 and 70 times as far from their host star as Earth is from the sun .
The system alsofeatures two belts of smaller objects , similar to the asteroid and Kuiper beltsaround our sun .
The system 's star is about 1.5 times as massive as thesun .
Previously , scientists have taken the spectra of stars ?
orthe signature of the amount of light they reflect and radiate at differentwavelengths ?
by watching an " exoplanetary eclipse " with a spacetelescope .
As the exoplanet passes directly behind its host star from the perspectiveof Earth , the light that comes only from the planet can be subtracted out fromthat that comes from the star .
But , this method can only be used on the small fraction ofexoplanets that have the right kind of orientation with respect to the Earth .
The team of astronomers that observed the giant planet wereable to do so without looking for an eclipse , instead detecting the planet ' slight directly with a ground - based telescope : the European SouthernObservatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile .
" After more than five hours of exposure time , we wereable to tease out the planet 's spectrum from the host star 's much brighterlight , " said team member Carolina Bergfors .
Picking out the planet 's light is tricky because the hoststar is several thousand times brighter than the planet .
" It 's like trying to see what a candle is made of , byobserving it from a distance of two kilometers [ 1.2 miles ] when it 's next to ablindingly bright 300 Watt lamp , " said team member Markus Janson of the University of Toronto .
The light spectrum of the planet can show what theatmosphere of the world is like , though in this case it reveals that theatmosphere is still poorly understood , not matching up to any current models .
Eventually , though , scientists hope to be able to moreeasily detect chemical signs of life on other worlds by their signatures inlight spectra .
Certain molecules that are important to life or a potential signof it that havebeen found are carbon dioxide , water vapor , silicate minerals and sodium .
The team hopes to use the same methods to get the spectra ofthe other two giant planets in the system , to do a comparison between them .
" This will surely shed new light on the processes thatlead to the formation of planetary system like our own , " Janson said .
The team 's findings are detailed in the AstrophysicalJournal .
Text Compression with the Burrows - Wheeler Transform
Text compression is an important and interesting computer application .
If you master the program given on this page you 'll become familiar with several common ideas in compression , and become acquainted with an amazing and elegant algorithm : the Burrows - Wheeler Transform .
This is not my algorithm ( I wish ! ) , though the source code implementation and some of the details are mine .
You can compile this source and get a genuine compressor and decompressor .
It will be slower than gzip ( though fast enough for most use ) and have a slightly inferior compression ratio , but just getting in the same ``ballpark ' ' as gzip is already remarkable , given the simple ( and unoptimized ) nature of this code .
The heart of this compression method is something called the ``Burrows - Wheeler Transform ( BWT ) ' ' which is one of those remarkable inventions that makes the study of algorithms a pleasure .
The BWT was discovered many years ago but has never been widely publicized .
Perhaps a certain major technology company could never quite find a use for it , but did n't want competitors to share the secret .
If so I can sympathize with the inventors thus denied their due fame .
( Perhaps Burrows or Wheeler would care to comment . )
The main source reference to the Burrows - Wheeler Transform appears to be ``A Block -- sorting Lossless Data Compression Algorithm '' ( SRC Research Report 124 ) by M. Burrows and D. J. Wheeler .
The BWT can be defined with an example .
Consider the 51 - character text fragment : in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you
Let 's build a 51 x 51 array with all possible rotations of that string : in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you n the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you i the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in he jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in t e jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in th jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the ingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the j ngle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the ji gle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jin le jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jing e jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingl jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle angle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle j ngle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle ja gle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jan le morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jang e morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangl morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle orning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle m rning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mo ning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mor ing I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morn ng I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morni g I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mornin I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I ll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I ' l go following you in the jingle jangle morning I'l go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll o following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll g following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go ollowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go f llowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go fo lowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go fol owing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go foll wing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go follo ing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go follow ng you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go followi g you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go followin you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following ou in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following y u in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following yo in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you
Now let 's reorder the rows so they are in sorted order : I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morning angle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle j e jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingl e jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in th e morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangl following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go g I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mornin g you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go followin gle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jin gle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jan go following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll he jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in t in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you ing I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morn ing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go follow ingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the j jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the l go following you in the jingle jangle morning I'l le jangle morning I 'll go following you in the jing le morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jang ll go following you in the jingle jangle morning I ' llowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go fo lowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go fol morning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle n the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you i ng I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle morni ng you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go followi ngle jangle morning I 'll go following you in the ji ngle morning I 'll go following you in the jingle ja ning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mor o following you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll g ollowing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go f orning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle m ou in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following y owing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go foll rning I 'll go following you in the jingle jangle mo the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you in u in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following yo wing you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go follo you in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following
Each row of this array has as much information as the entire array and ( if accompanied by a small integer telling us which rotation to use ) provides the original text string .
Each column contains the same 51 characters as each row , but they seem to be in a scrambled useless order .
Let 's show the first , middle and last columns of this sorted array , left - to - right instead of top - to - bottom :
First column : ' Iaeeefggggghiiiijjllllllmnnnnnnooooortuwy
Middle column : gjnolgg htlf 'nlneowiIi g ll ie j nilgouneyoao rnm
Final column : golueeengI jlhl nnnn t nwj lgg'ol iiiiargfmylo oo
The first column contains the 51 characters but they are ``clumped . ''
The way we constructed the array they will always be maximally clumped .
Clumped data can be compressed better than unclumped data , but this sequence of the 51 characters wo n't tell us much : the original string could be any of its permutations .
The middle column does n't exhibit clumping .
It almost seems like a random permutation of the 51 letters ( although of course it is n't really random at all ) .
The final column does exhibit clumping -- notice the four consecutive n's and four consecutive i's -- though not nearly as much as the first column .
This clumping was n't forced by the sorting , but arises from the repetition of digraphs in English .
The clumps of n's and i's arise from ng and in digraphs in the words in , jingle , jangle , morning , and following .
The key idea of the Burrows - Wheeler invention is this : knowledge of just this final column allows us to reconstruct the entire 51 x 51 array ( and hence the original text string ) .
Thus the Burrows - Wheeler Transform will replace the string in the jingle jangle morning I 'll go following you with ( 22 , golueeengI jlhl nnnn t nwj lgg'ol iiiiargfmylo oo )
( The 22 tells the decompressor to output the 22nd row of the reconstructed sorted array . )
In the source code below , I use a 32768 x 32768 array instead of 51 x 51 .
This array would be far too big of course , but the preceding discussion was just conceptual and the software need not actually build such an array physically .
To prove that this transform is reversible , and thus useful for compression , we must display an inverse coding procedure .
You can undo the transform step by step and finish with an impossibly expensive nest of sorting steps ; however Burrows and Wheeler also discovered a straightforward , if non-obvious , procedure to invert the transform in almost linear time .
Referring to the example again , the compressor replaced a 51 - character string with 52 characters ( the index 22 must be transmitted also ) .
There 's no compression yet , but the BWT will be just the first of several steps in the compression : once the characters are ``clumped '' we can apply other compression techniques .
Next let 's replace each character with an integer index .
poppy for example might become ( 16 , 15 , 16 , 16 , 25 ) since p is the 16 'th letter of the alphabet and so on .
( We 'll suppose that space is the ``0 'th letter . '')
We apply a simple idea called Move to Front ( MTF ) , where each character is moved , as it is encountered , to the front of the indexing table , and hence given an index of zero ( which will then increase slowly as other characters are moved to the front ) .
Now poppy becomes ( 16 , 16 , 1 , 0 , 25 ) .
The first p is still 16 since we start with default indexes .
The o is now 16 instead of 15 since p was moved in front of it .
The second p is 1 ( not 0 , because o was just moved in front of it ) , but that moves p to the very front again so the third p is 0 .
We still have n't achieved compression , but at least many of these indexes will be very small integers now .
In fact , since we applied the BWT earlier , many of the indexes will be zero .
The next compression step is called Zero Running ( ZR ) .
Each non -zero number is now preceded with a count of preceding zeros .
With this step , our example ( 16 , 16 , 1 , 0 , 25 ) will become ( 0 , 16 , 0 , 16 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 25 ) .
Our five numbers , four of which were non-zero , have been replaced with eight numbers , two for each non-zero .
( For clarity I show the zero run-counts in an alternate color . )
If this looks like bad compression , remember that fifty numbers , only four of which are non-zero , would also map to an eight - number output .
Finally , we want to output the list of these numbers to the compressed file .
Most of the numbers will be very small so we want to use a code which represents them with few bits .
A Huffman code would be appropriate , but even simpler and almost as good is to use a standard regular pattern .
We 'll use Elias 's ``gamma code , '' a popular and elegant device which goes by many names .
Perhaps the simplest definition of this code is :
Elias 's gamma code maps the positive integer K to K's binary representation with just enough leading zeros to put the first one in the exact middle of the code output .
9 , for example , is represented 9 = 0001001 .
The gamma code handles positive integers , but we need to handle zero as well .
Simply add 1 before the encode , and subtract 1 after the decode .
That sums up our compression algorithm , and the source code should be pretty self - explanatory .
( That the marvelous Burrows - Wheeler decoding algorithm works may not be obvious at first glance ! )
Much of the code just deals with the tedium of actually reading or writing bits to / from a disk or pipe .
The code is followed by remarks on a few implemenatation details .
For your convenience if you want to download this software , I have arranged the code into a single source file ( and without the HTML `` < '' strings that would cause trouble ) .

Miscellaneous remarks .
The ZR encoding only outputs for non-zero numbers , but the last number encoded might be zero ( i.e. , part of an ``unfinished run ' ' ) .
So we encode an arbitrary non-zero number , as a sort of ``placeholder , '' at the end ( and remember to throw it away during decode ) .
We do this not just at EOF , but whenever we need to insert non -ZR data into the code stream .
Fortunately that is infrequent in this software so compression is n't degraded by these extra non-zeros .
( Other solutions are possible if such degradation became an issue , but are more complicated . )
A slight variation of the Elias gamma ( EG ) code is used for the positive MTF codes ; this yielded a 3 % compression improvement .
( x/2 is submitted to the gamma code instead of x and the LSB of x is sent ``as is . '')
We also use a variation of the gamma code for the zero-run codes , though this yielded only a further 1 % improvement .
One bit is spent indicating whether the run-length is zero ; if not , the positive run-length is gamma coded normally .
ptcomp ( ) could simply invoke memcmp ( ) , but I found it significantly faster in my Linux environment to do the simple memcmp - like loop in - line .
Here memcmp ( ) will usually miscompare on an early character so in - line speed is n't surprising , but in my experience it 's usually possible to outperform even large - sized memcpy ( ) 's , just with the well - known device of partially ``unrolling '' the loop .
It seems so worthwhile and important to optimize the library memcpy ( ) and memcmp ( ) routines that you may find it odd that vendors do n't , but in my experience these routines have been consistently suboptimal .
As just one example , I found I could get dramatic improvement on an imaging program for the Sun - 3 workstation ( 68020 chip ) by writing my own memcpy ( ) : on investigation I found that the Sun - 3's memcpy ( ) routine had been optimized for the obsolete Sun - 2 ( 68010 chip ) .
( A related , and even more astounding , example is integer - multiply on Sun - 4 workstations , where the library routine can be sped up by a large factor -- though surely Sun 's fixed this by now ! ?.)
In my experiments I found some other ways to improve this code , but I did not incorporate them because the improvements were modest and I wanted to keep this example simple .
Nevertheless I will mention two of them :
ptcomp ( ) can be partially unrolled for speed : if ( c = p1 [ 0 ] - ( int ) p2[0 ] ) return c ; else if ( c = p1 [ 1 ] - ( int ) p2 [ 1 ] ) return c ; else if ( c = p 1 [ 2 ] - ( int ) p2 [ 2 ] ) return c ; . . .
( In the qsort ( ) invocation I detect if Leng is below some minimum and if so use an unenhanced ptcomp ( ) .)
can be partially unrolled for speed : ( In the invocation I detect if is below some minimum and if so use an unenhanced . )
The policy of moving each character encountered to the very front of the MTF list is too aggressive , although repeated characters must always be encoded with the best index ( 0 ) .
Instead an update like newindex = oldindex < 5 ?
0 : oldindex * 0.4 - 1 ; worked well .
Added code is used to detect repeated characters and encode them as zero .
The actual index ( previndex ) of that character is also remembered so the encoded index can be adjusted : if ( oldindex == previndex ) encodee = 0 ; else if ( oldindex < previndex ) encodee = oldindex +
1 ; else encodee = oldindex ; previndex = newindex ;

The company once known for its " do n't be evil " motto is now in bed with the spy agency known for the mass surveillance of American citizens .
The National Security Agency is widely understood to have the government 's biggest and smartest collection of geeks – the guys that are more skilled at network warfare than just about anyone on the planet .
So , in a sense , it 's only natural that Google would turn to the NSA after the company was hit by an ultrasophisticated hack attack .
After all , the military has basically done the same thing , putting the NSA in charge of its new " Cyber Command . "
The Department of Homeland Security is leaning heavily on the NSA to secure .gov networks .
But there 's a problem .
The NSA and its predecessors also have a long history of spying on huge numbers of people , both at home and abroad .
During the Cold War , the agency worked with companies like Western Union to intercept and read millions of telegrams .
During the war on terror years , the NSA teamed up with the telecommunications companies to eavesdrop on customers ' phone calls and internet traffic right from the telcos ' switching stations .
And even after the agency pledged to clean up its act – and was given wide new latitude to spy on whom they liked – the NSA was still caught " overcollecting " on U.S. citizens .
According to The New York Times , the agency even " tried to wiretap a member of Congress without a warrant . "
All of which makes the NSA a particularly untrustworthy partner for a company that is almost wholly reliant on its customers ' trust and goodwill .
We all know that Google automatically reads our Gmail and scans our Google Calendars and dives into our Google searches , all in an attempt to put the most relevant ads in front of us .
But we 've tolerated the automated intrusions , because Google 's products are so good , and we believed that the company was sincere in its " do n't be evil " mantra .
That 's a lot harder to swallow , when Google starts working cheek - to - jowl with the overcollectors .
The company pinkie - swears that its agreement with the NSA wo n't violate the company 's privacy policies or compromise user data .
Those promises are a little hard to believe , given the NSA 's track record of getting private enterprises to cooperate , and Google 's willingness to take this first step .
Google may need help in fighting off these hacks .
But turning to Ft. Meade could wind up permanently damaging the company 's image – and the foundation of its incredible success .
Already , the Russian press are talking about Google 's decision to spy with NSA , for instance .
Hackers might be able to compromise some of Google 's services , for a little while .
The association with the NSA could permanently cripple the company .
The telegram companies and the old - school telcos were virtually monopolies ; customers had nowhere to turn , if they wanted private communications .
Bing and Yahoo Mail are just a click away .

It 's the spiritual question we all want answered .
You can take your " Why are we here ? " , your " Is there a God ? " , even your " What happens when we die ? "
The real question that so many of us have lain awake at night pondering is " What are the pope 's favourite albums ? "
That may still be one to ponder , but L'Osservatore Romano , the Vatican newspaper , has revealed its top 10 .
A " semi-serious " guide to quality , Church - approved , formerly devil 's music .
Here it is :
1. Revolver by the Beatles
2. If I Could Only Remember My Name by David Crosby
3. The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd
4. Rumours by Fleetwood Mac
5 . The Nightfly by Donald Fagen
6. Thriller by Michael Jackson
7. Graceland by Paul Simon
8. Achtung Baby by U2
9 . ( What 's the Story ) Morning Glory by Oasis
10 . Supernatural by Carlos Santana
The paper justified itself thus : " A little handbook of musical resistance could be useful during this time of the year in which , in addition to having put up with the rigours of winter , we have to endure a rising tide of musical festivals . "
Ah , yes , how frustrating it must be for the pope to look at his diary and realise that Glastonbury 's not too far around the corner .
" Dear Lord and Father , show me the way – Latitude or Bestival ? "
It turns out that Satan does n't have all the best tunes after all , because it 's actually rather a good list : nothing outrageously shit , nothing too fleeting and no ghastly attempts to be down with the kids .
I own all but one of the albums on the list .
And strangely , that does n't trouble me .
Unlike when David Cameron revealed that The Queen is Dead is his favourite album , and I did a cry .
I 'm developing a fondness for L'Osservatore Romano on the back of this .
They 've overlooked some pretty frownonable stuff that the artists involved have done .
Revolver is one of the Beatles ' trippiest albums , there 's all sorts of ungodly stuff on Thriller ( though it 's not a patch on Off the Wall ) , and if you made a family tree of intra-Fleetwood Mac dalliances Christine McVie would turn out to be her own grandmother .
But what makes me really happy is the presence on the list of If I Could Only Remember My Name by David Crosby .
Apart from the fact that it 's unexpected and a splendid album , Crosby has fathered children for a lesbian couple , written a song about being on an acid trip in Winchester Cathedral , and taken a heroic quantity of head - changey things ( immortalised in one of the finest ever Simpsons jokes – Barney : David Crosby ?
You 're my hero !
David Crosby : Oh , you like my music ?
Barney : You 're a musician ? ) .
Well done the Vatican , for being a bit liberal on something that does n't really matter .
I 'm going to be optimistic and see it as a first step .
As L'Osservatore Romano admitted , identifying the 10 best albums in the history of pop music was not " easy " and inevitably the choice might seem " partial " .
Next step , I feel , is making some other positive choices that might not seem easy – allowing people to use condoms , perhaps , or letting priests marry , or presenting a cosmology in which people are n't regarded as intrinsically evil .
As anyone who 's ever sat up late into the night deciding between Rocky Mountain High and Poems , Prayers and Promises over a bottle of whisky , compiling a top 10 albums list is significantly tougher than any of those choices .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
The floors were concrete and the windows were broken .
There was no electricity or running water .
Lunch looked like watery grits .
Beds were fashioned from sheets of cardboard .
And the only toilet did not work .
But the Foyer of Patience here is like hundreds of places that pass as orphanages for thousands of children in the poorest country in the hemisphere .
Many are barely habitable , much less licensed .
They have no means to provide real schooling or basic medical care , so children spend their days engaged in mindless activities , and many die from treatable illnesses .
Haiti ’s child welfare system was broken before the earthquake struck .
But as the quake shattered homes and drove hundreds of thousands of people into the streets , the number of children needing care grew exponentially .
Chronic problems  like inadequate services , overwhelming poverty and shady orphanages  have only intensified , while the authorities fear that some of the less scrupulous orphanages are taking advantage of the chaos to round up children in crisis and offer them for sale as servants and sex slaves .

What ’s wrong with your vagina ?
If you answered “ nothing , ” you ’re probably wrong .
According to the beauty - industrial complex , it ’s ugly , and it smells bad .
But do n’t worry — there ’s nothing that money can’t fix .
1. Problem : Your Vagina Smells Bad
Solution : Vaginal Deodorant
In the seventies , Massengill tried to marry feminism and its vaginal deodorant spray ( “ With Hexachlorophene ” ) in an ad that declared the product to be “ The Freedom Spray . ”
It was “ … the better way to be free to enjoy being a woman .
Free from worry about external vaginal odor . ”
Because you ’re going to need that time you used to spend worrying about your vaginal odor to flirt your way through the glass ceiling .
Oh , and Hexachlorophene ?
It ’s a disinfectant that can be lethal when absorbed through the skin .
In 1972 , it was added to baby powder in France due to a manufacturing error and killed thirty - six children .
In case you think vaginal deodorant is a relic of the past , just take a trip to the drug store .
( I did , and I took notes .
The staff of my local Walgreens is convinced that I ’m both very thorough and that my vagina smells really bad . )
There are several kinds of vaginal deodorants still for sale ( Walgreens even manufactures a generic version ) .
You can buy scented vaginal suppositories called Norforms in Island Escape and Summer ’s Eve Deodorant Spray in Island Splash .
( Norforms contain something called Benzethonium chloride , which is also used as a hard surface disinfectant for fruit and classified as a poison in Switzerland .
Exotic ! )
And you can buy FDS ( Feminine , Discreet , Sensual ) Spray ( “ For the woman who cares . ” ) in a myriad of scents including Sheer Tropics and Fresh Island Breeze .
Because if you really cared , you ’d make your vagina smell like a poisonous island .
2. Problem : Your Vagina Is Dirty
Solution : Douching
Douching , the act of forcing a mixture of fluids up into the vagina with a tube and pump , was first promoted as a form of birth control ( it does n’t work ) and has continued to be used for vaguely medical reasons : to prevent STIs ( sexually transmitted infections ) , to clean the vagina after menstruation and , of course , to rid it of that disgusting vagina smell .
Douching has been repeatedly discouraged by the medical community , which not only does n’t attribute any health benefits to the act , but believes that it can actually harm women .
A government Web site run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services discourages douching by answering a series of hypothetical questions , one of which is : “ My vagina has a terrible odor , can douching help ? ”
The answer : No .
Get thee to a doctor .
Despite health concerns , manufacturers still churn out vaginal douches .
Pick up a box of Summer ’s Eve Douche , and you ’ll find warnings that douching has been associated with PID ( Pelvic Inflamatory Disease ) , ectopic pregnancy and infertility .
Right next to the suggestion that women douche after their menstrual period , after using contraceptive jellies and creams and to “ clear out any vaginal secretions . ”
So basically , any time your vagina is n’t as dry as a British sitcom .
3. Problem : Your Vagina Is Too Loose
Solution : Vaginal Rejuvenation
Let ’s face it .
Nature really screwed up when it made the vagina .
Never mind that that it accommodates the birth of a child or that it ’s fundamentally better designed than male genitalia .
( Who wants to carry their most sensitive reproductive organs on the outside ? )
While nature was busy dishing out things like multiple orgasms , it forgot to make vaginas vice - tight .
Luckily , plastic surgeons have stepped in to put an end to womankind ’s collective suffering .
Laser Vaginal Rejuvenation is a trademarked phrase that refers to a practice developed and popularized by Dr. David Matlock , who ’s made several appearances on the E !
channel ’s plastic surgery reality show , Dr.90210 .
Matlock and other doctors who carry out LVR claim that the $ 4,000 to $ 20,000 procedure makes women ’s vaginas tighter , thus increasing sexual pleasure .
But many doctors disagree .
The American Urogynocology Society wo n’t endorse it .
And the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cautioned in a 2007 statement that women seeking “ designer vaginas ” should be “ informed about the lack of data supporting the efficacy of these procedures and their potential complications , including infection , altered sensation , dyspareunia , adhesions , and scarring . ”
Sexy !
4. Problem : Your Vagina Is Ugly
Solution : Labiaplasty
If your vagina is tight enough ( and let ’s face it , it ’s probably not ) you ’ve still got to deal with the labia .
And by “ deal with , ” I mean remove .
Labiaplasty drastically reduces the labia , the protruding lips that surround the opening of the vagina .
Why would you want to do this ?
Because your labia are “ unequal , ” “ elongated , ” “ large , ” “ irregular , ” “ floppy , ” and “ unfeminine . ”
These are just some of the unflattering adjectives bandied about on the Web sites of surgeons who offer this procedure .
Luckily , with the use of lasers and scalpels , your vagina can be made “ prettier , ” “ better proportioned , ” “ youthful , ” and achieve “ the true Playboy aesthetic look . ”
How much will it cost you to make your labia proportional and feminine ?
About $ 5,000 or more .
5. Problem : Your Vagina Tastes Bad
Solution : Vagina Mints
If your partner is reluctant to give you oral sex , it ’s not because of pervasive cultural belief that cunnilingus is complicated to the point of being impossible and that vaginas are inherently icky ( thus the need to uncomplicate them and un-ickify them with , oh , say , labiaplasty ) it ’s because your vagina tastes bad .
Enter the Linger Internal Vaginal Flavoring , or Altoids for your vagina .
Linger assumes you already feel bad about your nether regions , stating on its
Web site that the mint - flavored pill “ decreases self - consciousness ” and tosses out the unattributed statistic that 72 percent of women feel self conscious about their taste and odor .
Dubious marketing practices aside , the Linger mint is n’t just a harmless , if asinine , oddity .
Mother Jones magazine did some digging into the origins of Linger and discovered that the vagina mint is no different from a regular mint .
In other words , it ’s made out of sugar .
And putting sugar - based mint directly into your vagina is a recipe for a mint - flavored yeast infection .
6. Problem : Your Vagina Is the Wrong Color
Solution : Vaginal Bleaching and Dying
Many women are under the impression that it ’s OK to have a vagina colored vagina .
They ’re wrong , of course .
They should be pink , and exceptionally so .
What ’s a woman with a vagina colored vagina to do ?
Bleach it .
Accomoclitic Laser and Wax Studio in Lakewood , Colorado , purveyors of an anal bleaching product called “ Pink Wink , ” also sell something called Bleach Babe , a cream that promises to do away with the “ natural discoloration surrounding the exterior of the vagina . ”
Bleach Babe contains Kojic acid , the same ingredient that keeps salmon meat pink .
South Beach Solutions sells a similar lightening product with Sodium hydroxide , which can also be found in drain decloggers and septic tank cleansers .
If bleaching fails to render your vagina the color of a Barbie Dream House , you can try My New Pink Button , billed as a “ Genital Cosmetic Colorant that restores the “ Pink ” back to woman ’s genitals . ”
Because vaginas that are n’t vibrantly pink are old and sad .
My New Pink Button is meant to be painted onto the vagina ( it comes in powder form and must be scooped up with a moist Q - tip like device ) and lasts 48 to 72 hours .
After which , one supposes , users must reapply in order to maintain the youthful status of their genitals .
In announcing its $ 19.0 billion FY 2011 NASA budget today , the Obama Administration has made it very clear that it intends to attempt a paradigm shift in the way that America explores and utilizes space .
The current plan NASA is following will be cancelled .
But the intent to explore will remain and will be reconfigured into a new plan that openly taps private sector creativity while making certain that the taxpaying public is involved in an unprecedented fashion .
This plan for change comes with additional funds - to the tune of an additional $ 6 billion over FY 2011 to FY 2015 when compared to what the FY 2010 budget anticipated - approximately $ 700 million of which will appear in FY 2011 .
That means that NASA will get $ 100 billion over the next 5 years according to the White House 's plans .
In so doing , the White House is hoping to make a clean break with much of the old way of doing things at NASA .
As they do , NASA will be pushed to broaden its vision , seek new partnerships , and transform its way of doing things .
This will be unsettling to many people .
However , that break begins with some hard choices - most notably , the outright cancellation of The Constellation Program .
Started shortly after President Bush announced his " Vision for Space Exploration " in 2004 , Constellation was the umbrella activity for what eventually became development activities for the Ares launch vehicle family , the Orion crew module , and the Altair lunar lander .
All of this now comes to a halt .
Plagued with insufficient budget resources , an overly ambitious schedule , uneven management , and lingering technical problems , Constellation soon became untenable in the eyes of the Presidential review commission charted to evaluate the program .
After spending between $ 8 and 9 billion on Constellation , the agency will now be directed to begin its orderly shutdown .
An additional $ 2.5 billion ( $ 1.9 billion in FY 2011 and $ 600 million in FY 2012 ) will be needed to facilitate the closeout of the program and any additional costs to the Space Shuttle program as it also winds down - without Constellation to serve as a buttress .
What do we get for this $ 8 - 9 billion ?
Launch of a cobbled together one of a kind rocket , a human - rated launcher design that never seemed to be ready for prime time , a crew transport that suffered as an innocent bystander as its launcher 's capabilities shrank , and a heavy launch vehicle inexorably linked to a smaller rocket that would never pass muster .
But we also witnessed a rekindling of overt exploration thinking at NASA with an almost Apollo era fervor at times .
NASA 's " Desert RATS " tried out new mobility concepts in harsh terrains - and even showed them off in the Inaugural parade in 2009 .
NASA spent a lot of brain power on how we 'd visit the Moon and what we'd do once we got there .
Astrobiologists and astrogeologists worked through the questions they 'd ask as they explored these new places , and ... for half a decade , school children were told that they 'd soon witness humans walking upon another world before their eyes in an ultra-virtual , web - centric way .
It is this aspect of the agency 's exploration activities that will now be built upon .
Alas , many of us think that we have unfinished business on the Moon and that this shift in policy is tantamount to ignoring this amazing world and potential resource .
Perhaps .
Perhaps not .
What NASA 's " Flexible Path " eventually becomes will make that determination .
Either way , all of this is on hold - but not for long - and only in terms of hardware , not intent .
America is going to pause , marshall its resources , divert from dead - end , 20th century approaches , and embrace new , 21st century compliant plans for the exploration and utilization of space .
The next generation of space explorers will not be disappointed .
It would seem that the focus is now shifting and widening - from visiting one world - to visiting many worlds and places and establishing the infrastructure to allow choices to be made in a more pragmatic and flexible fashion .
Curiously , the approach that the Obama Administration is now about to take is very similar to the pragmatic , out of the box , " let a thousand flowers bloom " thinking that characterized NASA in the year or so after President Bush announced his plans for NASA .
This short era of pragmatism came to a swift halt with the departure of Sean O'Keefe and Craig Steidle and the arrival of Mike Griffin , Doc Horowitz , and the ill - fated and myopic " Apollo on Steroids " approach to exploration .
The big question lingering in everyone 's mind is where will NASA go ?
Well , the large scale Bush - era plans for lunar exploration are no longer in play .
That said , human visits to the Moon are not excluded either .
While it has yet to be defined , the " Flexible Path that the Augustine Committee put forth ( now called " FlexPath " by some ) seeks to visit Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) , and perhaps the moons of Mars as a precursor to visits to Mars itself .
Sortie visits to the Moon - perhaps as part of an international collaboration - are also under consideration .
But the issue at hand is not where NASA goes as much as it is how NASA goes there .
NASA is now walking away from the old , government - mandated approach that Mike Griffin put into place .
During the 5 year space ahead , NASA will spend $ 7.8 billion on a new technology demonstration program that will look at advanced exploration capabilities .
It will also spend $ 3.1 billion on R&D that looks into new propulsion systems and $ 3 billion on robotic precursors to scout ahead of future human crews .
In order to enhance the body of knowledge needed to support humans on long duration missions , NASA will increase the International Space Station 's Human Research Program by 42 % over the next 5 years - and extend the lifetime of the ISS from 2016 to at east 2020 .
This increase will amount to $ 463 million more than the enacted FY 2010 budget and a total of $ 2 billion over the following 4 years when compared to what had been projected in the FY 2010 budget .
Specifically , NASA will invest in critical technology demonstrations to the tune of $ 7.822 billion between FY 2011 and FY 2015 .
This will include " Flagship demonstration programs " which will be funded at the level of $ 400 million to $ 1 billion over short periods ( less than 5 years ) and demonstrate critical technologies including in - orbit propellant transfer , inflatable modules , automated rendezvous and docking , and closed loop life support systems - all the things NASA will need to explore and utilize the inner solar system .
In addition enabling technologies such as in situ resource utilization and advanced deep space propulsion will also be investigated .
NASA will continue to purse robotic precursor missions - " precursor " meaning that these missions seek to identify hazards and trail blaze new technologies that will eventually enable humans to follow in their tracks .
NASA hopes that these missions will visit the Moon , Mars , asteroids , and LaGrange points and that they will serve to identify hazards and resources that will " determine the future course of the expansion of human civilization into space " ( words NASA is using once again ) .
Suggested missions could include a robotic lander / rover on the moon that is teleoperated from Earth and a demonstration mission that processes lunar or asteroidal materials for use in various exploration scenarios .
To those who are paying close attention , you will soon see overt similarities in NASA 's new plans to explore and utilize cis-lunar and inner solar system locations with ideas and concepts proposed by Craig Steidle , Gary Martin 's NEXT team , Sally Ride 's old Office of Exploration , and even the National Commission on Space .
Good ideas from decades past often come back , fresh and new , given enough time - just like Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek have done recently .
However , the prime paradigm shift that NASA is being directed to make involves how people and cargo get into space - to the ISS and eventually , other locations .
Between FY 2011 and FY 2015 NASA will spend $ 5.8 billion on commercial crew services and add $ 312 million in FY 2011 for additional commercial cargo support .
NASA will use commercial solicitations to seek private sector solutions to NASA launch needs .
Existing and new launch systems will need to comply with NASA human rating requirements .
Spacecraft that carry humans will , ideally , be capable of flying on multiple launch systems .
With the demise of Ares 1 comes the demise of its big sister Ares V. NASA is now going to look to the private sector to propose solutions to the agency 's heavy lift requirements .
But NASA will continue to study technologies that can serve to shorten development and reduce cost .
These will include advanced propulsion , in - space technologies , and will seek to utilize a broad array of partnerships between governmental , academic , commercial and international participants .
Contrary to various Internet rumors , NASA has not selected a preferred Shuttle - derived launch system to replace Ares 1 and Ares V - i.e , the Shuttle " Sidemount " , In - line , or " DIRECT " concepts .
While thoroughly vetted and evaluated , are of these concepts all government - driven designs and are thus part of the old way of doing business .
Future heavy lift solutions will be solicited from the private sector .
Given that the Space Shuttle needs to be able to be phased out after its 5 remaining flights without any support from Constellation , NASA will put an additional $ 600 million into the FY 2011 budget .
This will support the program even if the last flights eventually happen in early CY 2011 .
Shuttle managers have privately shared their concerns that it may be very difficult to keep the entire team together to fly out these remaining 5 missions now that the news of Constellation 's cancellation has been announced .
And with the looming privatization / commercialization of human access to space for Americans , unanswered questions remain as to what to do with the workforce at JSC ( and elsewhere ) that has been built up over decades to support government - operated human spaceflight .
What do you do with more than a hundred astronauts and the infrastructure that supports them ?
The toll on KSC is not going to be insignificant either .
There is no escaping that .
Part of the $ 600 million for shuttle operations will be used to support transition activities that once sought to move some people over to Constellation and others to jobs outside of NASA .
In addition , NASA will now seek to spend $ 1.929 billion between FY 2011 and FY 2015 to transform KSC into a " 21st Century Launch Complex " .
In so doing , NASA intends to increase the effectiveness of KSC 's range , clean up remaining environmental issues , alter the facilities layout and perimeter so as to enhance increased access , and improve the overall ability for KSC to process payloads .
With Constellation coancelled , it is not clear what people will be doing in Huntsville either .
NASA will be looking into inesting in areas other than Space Shuttle and the International Space Station however .
In the area of space technology , NASA will spend $ 3.968 billion between FY 2011 and FY 2014 on so - called " next generation technologies " which will serve to enhance America 's overall technological leadership in spaceflight .
The intent is to start to really think outside the box and involve a wider array of partnerships in the private , non-profit , and educational sectors .
This research will span a wide array of things from robotics to propulsion and new materials NASA will expand upon its current use of prizes and competitions to help spur innovation .
Over the past decade , NASA 's focus on Earth Science has faltered as it has across the Federal government .
This will be rectified with a hefty budget that will increase the enacted FY 2010 budget by $ 382 million and then go on to add an additional $ 1.8 billion between FY 2011 and 2014 .
In addition to re-flying the Orbiting Carbon Observatory , NASA will seek to accelerate the development of new satellites to observe Earth as well as support the existing flotilla of Earth observation spacecraft .
Planetary science will see much less of an increase than other parts of NASA .
Its budget will ramp up from $ 1.486 billion in FY 2001 to $ 1.650 billion in FY 2015 .
Astrophysics will go from $ 1.076 billion in FY 2011 to $ 1.132 billion in FY 2015 , and Heliophysics will go from $ 542 million in FY 2011 to $ 751 million in FY 2015 .
Some of the notable increases in space and planetary science , albeit small , include adding $ 16 million per year for the next 5 years to Near Earth Object ( NEO ) detection , restarting Plutonium - 238 production with the Department of Energy for radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) construction , plans for a 2011 launch of Mars Science Laboratory , bringing the Mars 2016 mission into formulation , funding of James Webb Space Telescope at a 70 % confidence level for a 2014 launch , and initiation of Solar Probe " Plus " mission .
Aeronautics , now referred to by NASA as " Aeronautics and Green Aviation " , often the forgotten sibling at NASA , will get a $ 73 million increase over the enacted FY 2010 budget and will get an additional $ 300 million between FY 2011 to FY 2014 compared to the FY 2010 budget .
Specific increases will focus on $ 20 million annually for an aeronautics grant program for environmentally responsible aviation ; $ 20 million annually for software to operate in the national airspace infrastructure ; and $ 30 million annually to look into use of unmanned aircraft systems .
In addition to all of the discipline area expenditures , NASA needs to work on its own supportive infrastructure .
The focus over the next 5 years will be on maintaining NASA 's 9 field centers and to find efficiencies while driving down operating costs and eliminating redundancies .
Cross agency budgets will hover at around $ 3 billion per year will total $ 16.4 billion over 5 years while Construction and Environmental Compliance will stay at just under $ 400 million a year will total $ 1.921 billion over the same period .
After all is said and done with the science and technology , there is one more thing that the Obama Administration wants to focus on - education .
Long a back water for personnel reassignment and a grab bag for earmarks , as well as suffering from a near total lack of attention under Mike Griffin , the White House is refocusing the agency 's attention on Education .
This will be done by enhancing the NASA education budget from a projected annual level of around $ 126 million in the last budget to $ 146 million per year over the next 5 years .
That 's an increase of $ 100 million over 5 years when compared to last year 's projections .
In addition to the recently announced " Summer of Innovation " , a $ 20 million project that will focus on STEM education over the next 3 years , NASA will be expanding its horizons when it comes to novel partnerships as and new ways of inspiring the next generation of space explorers .
You can expect to see a focus on education weaved throughout all that NASA does as well as an enhanced focus on what has come to be called " participatory exploration " i.e. an overt attempt to greatly expand the ability of people in all walks of life to experience and actually participate in NASA 's various programs of research and exploration .
This plan is not without its perils .
Congress has a lot invested in the status quo - and they are not at all shy of reminding everyone of that .
Press releases will soon start to fly back and forth .
In contrast to the 2004 VSE rollout , little advance preparation was done internally , and potential external allies and " stakeholders " were left in the dark - as was everyone else - until the last minute .
As such , antibodies to this proposed overhaul of NASA will form the instant it is released .
People do not like to be surprised like this .
This paradigm shift will be unsettling .
It puts a lot people out of work and it rattles an endless number of cages and stove pipes and shifts sand out of almost everyone 's sandbox .
But it also seeks to spark new ways of thinking that could inevitably lead to an expanding commercial and industrial base - not only on this planet - but above and beyond it .
NASA 's hardest task will not be building these new spacecraft or planning these new missions , but rather it will come on the form of convincing everyone inside and outside of the agency - that this is the way to go .

Every single game ever made wants your character dead .
Well , unless it ’s got dancing babies on its box or it ’s trying to lose you weight by forcing you to swing your arms around like a twat .
With that in mind , we thought it might be helpful to give you a guide on how to spot impending video game danger .
After you ’ve brushed up on our exhaustive guide , which covers every sure - fire sign of peril from ominous music to evil facial hair , you ’ll be dodging video game death like a pro .
Oh , and we guarantee you ’ll never look at a pile of leaves the same way again .
You reach a save point in front of some massive , ominous door
Yeah , never a good sign this .
Games which force you to save manually – Resi , God of War etc. – are rarely charitable .
So when they casually suggest you should maybe protect your progress with this form of safety net , you better bloody do so .
Because you can be sure of two things about that door : A ) There ’s something behind it that almost definitely wants to rip your face off and B )
There ’s no way in Hell you ’re beating the bastard first time .
Above : Hmmmm , it ’s probably the second one , right ?
The game gives you every weapon it has for apparently no reason
Wow , cheers Mr. Game that ’s been a total dick to me for the last 10 hours .
You ’re really giving me every death laser , rusty , infected chainsaw and Arnie - shaming mini - gun with maxed out ammo , with absolutely no strings attached ?
Shucks , you ’re too kind .
Wait , where did this army of tooled - up to the teeth aliens / flesh - eating mutants / military insurgents suddenly spring from ?
Dang .
There 's any sign of blood
Blood is bad , pure and simple .
See even a drop of it in a game and you can be sure whatever did the stabbing , shooting or ingesting to cause said plasma spillage is still in the area .
Be it trails , pools or disturbing messages written in the red stuff ; the presence of the claret of life means someone has suffered hugely .
And , chances are , your character ’s about to as well .

* Chavez popularity could suffer after devaluation
* Venezuelans rush to shops anticipating price hikes
* Inflation will jump this year ( Recasts with color , adds details , background )
By Frank Jack Daniel and Eyanir Chinea
CARACAS , Jan 9 ( Reuters ) - Venezuelans rushed to the shops on Saturday , fearful of price rises after a currency devaluation that will let President Hugo Chavez boost government spending ahead of an election but feeds opposition charges of economic mismanagement .
In a bid to jump - start the recession - hit economy of South America ’s top oil exporter , Chavez on Friday announced a dual system for the fixed rate bolivar .
It devalues the currency to 4.3 and 2.6 against the dollar , from a rate of 2.15 per dollar in place since 2005 , giving the better rate for basic goods in an attempt to limit the impact of the measure on consumer prices .
The opposition seized on fears that prices for imported goods will double as shoppers formed lines of more than a hundred people outside some stores in the capital Caracas .
“ It was a Black Friday , tinted red , ” said sales executive Diana Sevillana in reference to the crimson color of Chavez ’s socialist party .
She stood in a line of 30 people outside an electrical goods store in a middle class neighborhood .
The socialist Chavez believes the state should have a weighty role in managing the economy .
During his 11 years in office he has nationalized most heavy industry , and business and finance are tightly regulated .
The devaluation is politically risky but means every dollar of oil revenue puts more bolivars in government coffers .
That allows Chavez to lavish cash on social projects and fund salary increases ahead of parliamentary elections in September .
Opponents were quick to criticize the socialist , who a year ago promised the global financial crisis would not touch “ a hair ” of Venezuela ’s economy .
He announced the devaluation on Friday night during an important baseball game .
“ By establishing the exchange rate at 4.3 bolivars per dollar , the quality of life for Venezuelans is automatically devalued since we now have half the money we had before , ” said Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma , a Chavez opponent .
BLACKOUTS , WATER SHORTAGES
Opposition parties , emboldened by public dissatisfaction at frequent blackouts and water shortages and a 2.9 percent economic contraction in 2009 , hope to strip Chavez of his legislative majority in September .
The devaluation is embarrassing for Chavez , who resisted calls from economists and many government allies to make the move last year when oil prices were at their lowest and elections a long way off .
“ Venezuela ’s decision to devalue the Bolivar culminates an event that the market has been anticipating for a long time , ” said Walter Molano , an analyst at BCP Securities .
“ It helps alleviate the country ’s fiscal woes and puts it on a sounder macroeconomic footing . ”
The measure is a relief for state oil company PDVSA , which has struggled to pay service providers and meet requirements to fund social projects since crude prices dropped sharply last year .
It also makes Venezuelan businesses more competitive .
Holders of Venezuela ’s foreign debt are also pleased , since the devaluation improves government finances and lessens the need to issue more bonds .
However , Chavez risks taking a blow to his popularity ratings , which are about 50 percent , as prices for many products inevitably will rise in the country of 28 million people , which relies on imports for much of its consumption .
Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez said the devaluation will add 3 percent to 5 percent to inflation , already the highest in the Americas at 25 percent last year .
“ The popularity of the government is obviously going to be sharply and negatively affected , ” said economist Pedro Palma .
“ The inflationary impact of the measure diminishes the real income of people .
People can consume less . ”
The new two - tiered exchange system offers the 2.6 / dollar rate for goods deemed essential including food , medicine and industrial machinery .
Other products , including cars and telephones , will be imported at the higher 4.3 rate .
Last month , BMO Capital Markets cut ratings on Colgate - Palmolive Co CL.N , Avon Products Inc AVP.N and Kimberly - Clark Corp KMB.N to " market perform " saying a possible devaluation in Venezuela could hurt the U.S. consumer goods makers ' profits .
Economist Pavel Gomez of the IESA economic school said the new system will increase opportunities for graft in a country that already is corruption - ridden .
“ Multiple exchange schemes are incentives for corruption , more so if they are applied in the Venezuela way , ” he said .
“ Those who have good contacts can buy at 2.6 and sell at 4.3 . ”
Chavez , whose popularity usually rises in correlation with public spending , also said on Friday that the Central Bank had transferred $ 7 billion of foreign reserves to a development fund used to finance investment projects .
Back in 2004 , CBS rejected an ad from the United Church of Christ , declaring that “ it was against our policy of accepting advocacy advertising , ” which made CBS ’s decision to run Focus on the Family ’s anti-choice ad during the Super Bowl such a surprise .
But now we find out that it really should n’t have come as much of a surprise at all , because the network had been working closely with Focus on the Family for months to help them craft that ad :
You really can be bored to death , scientists discover
Tedium : People with dull jobs must find outside interests , experts warn
Boredom could be shaving years off your life , scientists have found .
Researchers say that people who complain of boredom are more likely to die young , and that those who experienced ' high levels ' of tedium are more than two - and - a - half times as likely to die from heart disease or stroke than those satisfied with their lot .
More than 7,000 civil servants were studied over 25 years - and those who said they were bored were nearly 40 per cent more likely to have died by the end of study than those who did not .
The scientists said this could be a result of those unhappy with their lives turning to such unhealthy habits as smoking or drinking , which would cut their life expectancy .
Specialists from the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London , looked at data from 7,524 civil servants aged between 35 and 55 who were interviewed between 1985 and 1988 about their levels of boredom .
They then found out whether they had died by April last year .
Researcher Martin Shipley , who co-wrote the report to be published in the International Journal of Epidemiology this week , said : ' The findings on heart disease show there was sufficient evidence to say there is a link with boredom .
' It is important that people who have dull jobs find outside interests to keep boredom at bay , rather than turn to drinking or smoking . '
Psychologist Graham Price added : ' It is important to distinguish between cause and effect .
Are these people turning to drink and drugs because they are bored or because they have certain characteristics ?
' For many people who are unmotivated or uninspired by life , or maybe have a tendency towards depression , the way out of it is to change their focus away from themselves and on to other people .
' From being all me , me , me , they should be thinking , what can I do for my family , my friends , my colleagues , even my boss . '
The original survey found that one in ten civil servants had been bored within the past month , with women more than twice as likely than men to suffer .
Younger employees and those with more menial jobs were also found to be more prone to boredom .
Those who reported feeling a great deal of boredom were 37 per cent more likely to have died by the end of the study .
They have n't had sex in some 30 million years , but some very small invertebrates named bdelloid rotifers are still shocking biologists -- they should have gone extinct long ago .
Cornell researchers have discovered the secret to their evolutionary longevity : these rotifers are microscopic escape artists .
When facing pathogens , they dry up and are promptly gone with the wind .
" These animals have evolved a way to avoid parasites and pathogens by drying up and blowing away , " said Paul Sherman , Cornell professor of neurobiology and behavior , who wrote the paper with lead author Chris Wilson , a Cornell doctoral candidate in Sherman 's lab .
After drying up , bdelloids come back to life when re-exposed to fresh water .
The Cornell study is featured on the cover of the Jan. 29 issue of Science .
Bdelloid rotifers ( pronounced DELL -- oyd ROW - tiff - ers ) are tiny , freshwater invertebrates that have long puzzled scientists because , as completely asexual animals , they should have been extinguished by parasites and pathogens long ago in evolutionary time .
Instead , the bdelloids have proliferated into more than 450 species .
Asexual animals like rotifers reproduce by cloning and this makes for a fixed gene pool .
Many scientists believe that the function of sex itself is to shuffle genes around .
They theorize that the fresh genetic combinations that which sex provides allow sexual animals to fend off relentlessly evolving parasites and pathogens .
The discovery that bdelloids can desiccate and wisp away with the wind helps resolve the mystery of their ancient asexuality and success .
" It also helps answer one of the deepest puzzles in evolutionary biology -- why sex is nearly ubiquitous , " said Wilson .
To study the bdelloids ' adaptations , Wilson infected populations of rotifers with deadly fungi and found that they all died within a few weeks .
He then tried drying out other infected populations for varying lengths of time before rehydrating them .
He found that the fungi were far more sensitive to dehydration than the rotifers .
The longer the infected populations remained dried out , the more successful they were at completely ridding themselves of fungi and eluding death .
In a second wave of experiments , Wilson placed dried , fungus - infected rotifers in a wind chamber .
The scientists observed that the rotifers were able to disperse without the fungi and establish parasite - free populations .
After just seven days of blowing around , there were as many fungus - free rotifer populations as there were after three weeks of dehydration without wind .
So , by drying and drifting passively on the wind -- sometimes for hundreds of miles -- bdelloids can continually establish new , uninfected populations .
" These animals are essentially playing an evolutionary game of hide and seek , " said Sherman .
" They can drift on the wind to colonize parasite - free habitat patches where they reproduce rapidly and depart again before their enemies catch up .
This effectively enables them to evade biotic enemies without sex , using mechanisms that no other known animals can duplicate . "
The study was supported by Sigma Xi , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Cornell and Cornell 's Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellowship Fund .

IPCC AR4 reported :
The Netherlands is an example of a country highly susceptible to both sea - level rise and river flooding because 55 % of its territory is below sea level where 60 % of its population lives and 65 % of its Gross National Product ( GNP ) is produced .
Dutch newspaper Vrij Nederland reported today ( Google translation ) :
In its last Assessment Report on the impacts of climate change shows that 55 % of Netherlands is below sea level in this area and that 65 % of the gross national product is produced .
These figures are far too high .
The Central Bureau of Statistics ( CBS ) is only one fifth of the Netherlands below sea level and there are only 19 % instead of 65 % of the GDP generated .
Not that 20 % is something to be ignored if that ’s what they think .
But the percentage below sea level is the sort of thing that primary school geography classes should be able to get right .
CHICAGO – A group of African American youth and community organizers who gathered to watch President Obama deliver his State of the Union address were most interested in what the president had to say about jobs .
“ I ’m hoping he can touch on what he said during the campaign – helping out the poorer classes , jobs – the change ( Obama campaigned on ) , ” said Deandrae Manuel , 27 , one of the group who watched the speech at the Peace Corner on Chicago ’s West Side last week .
“ The unemployment here is real bad , 60 percent among the youth I know and my family , ” Manuel said .
The Peace Corner is a storefront youth center in the Austin neighborhood .
Like other African American communities , it has been devastated by unemployment .
The area had the nation ’s seventh - highest unemployment rate in 2008 , 20.9 perent , even before the recession hit .
Obama ’s emphasis on jobs creation comes as a new report by the Center for Labor Market Studies shows teenage and young adult unemployment in Chicago at Great Depression levels , after having dropped precipitously over the decade leading up to the current economic crisis .
The “ Lost Decade ” study shows 85 percent of African American youth , 70 percent of Latino youth and 67 percent of white youth 16 - 19 years old were not working .
Seventy - two percent of teens were not working statewide .
Sixty - six percent of African Americans aged 20 - 24 were unemployed in Illinois , along with 33 percent of Latino youth and 35 percent of white youth of the same age .
A staggering 23 percent of African Americans 16 - 24 were both out of school and out of work in 2008 .
Job losses over the last 10 years suggest this economic crisis is different and a cyclical rebound wo n’t address the problems .
Special measures need to be taken to create jobs for teenagers and young adults , many are saying .
“ I wanted to hear more about jobs for me and the people going through what I ’m going through , said Leroy Clay , 25 , a youth counselor at the Peace Corner .
Clay described the Austin community as struggling with poverty , violence and drug problems .
Speaking of the future , he said , “ I ’m kind of scared .
I do want to be involved in my community , especially helping the kids . ”
Clay said there is a need for people to join together and even protest , to show “ we ’re trying and pushing for change . ”
Elce Redmond , a community organizer with the South Austin Coalition , said he was hoping President Obama would “ institute a national jobs program to put the most vulnerable to work , the ex-offenders , youth and the chronically unemployed .
“ There has to be some bill in place that puts people back to work , ” said Redmond .
“ Something that will put 3.5 million back to work over the next five - year period to jumpstart the economy . ”
Redmond says there is plenty to do in the Austin community including retrofitting and rebuilding schools , fixing streets , rehabbing abandoned buildings , weatherizing homes and hiring social service workers and community organizers .
Redmond ’s group , the South Austin Coalition , is one of many organizations that Chicago Jobs with Justice called together ron Jan. 25 to begin mapping out a campaign to win massive jobs creation and stepped up government intervention to get the country out of the economic crisis .
The local effort is part of Jobs for America Now , a rapidly growing coalition of over 80 national labor , civil rights and community organizations .
Lionel Carter , 25 , an intern at the Peace Center and a graduate student where he is working toward a Master ’s degree in social work , said the president had great ideas , “ but it seems to leave out certain populations , ” especially people who have been in jail , and immigrants . ”
He said he saw Congress as “ a major hold up . ”
Change has to be a collaborative effort – the president , Congress and “ average people , ” he said .
The Peace Corner is run by a not - for - profit organization led by Father Maurizio Binaghi .
It has developed successful programs for youth who have been ensnared in the criminal justice system .
Its programs include GED and computer literacy classes , tutoring and legal counseling .
A jobs program in collaboration with the Community Investment Corporation acquires abandoned buildings in the neighborhood and rehabs them .
The youth get valuable skills in the construction trades and many have gone on to get jobs in the industry .
Over 100 youth have gotten jobs in the last seven years .
“ I liked what ( Obama ) said , ” commented Father Binaghi .
“ But I was expecting something different .
There is a lot of emphasis on tax breaks and the middle class .
But what about the poor ?
A lot about tax breaks for small business and corporations but what about resources for not - for - profits like ours that are doing good work ? ”
“ This is such a needed program especially in an area like this where there are no jobs , and for youth who are considered unemployable because of mistakes they have made in the past , ” said Binaghi .
The Peace Corner would benefit from the Put America to Work Act of 2009 introduced by Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) .
HR 4268 would create 1 million jobs by granting $ 40 billion to local governments to create jobs in the public or non-profit sector and small businesses that provide public services .
Obama proposed to make available funds for community banks to lend to small businesses .
Unfortunately , it comes too late for the one community bank in the neighborhood , Park National .
The bank was healthy and gave 27 percent of its profits to local charitable projects , but was taken over by the FDIC then handed over to US Bank , one of the nation ’s largest .

PEOPLE who download the latest TV shows , films and games are at risk of prosecution as major distributors use new forensic technology to target individuals who illegally file - share on the internet .
The technology claimed its first scalp last week when Queenslander James Burt , 24 , was ordered by the Federal Court to pay $ 1.5 million in damages for copying and uploading a Nintendo game .
Nintendo managing director Rose Lappin said it had '' no other choice ' ' than to go after Burt when he uploaded a copy of a new Super Mario Bros game that was yet to be released worldwide , resulting in 50,000 downloads of the game within six days .
'' We will go to any lengths to stop piracy , including going after the individual , '' Ms Lappin said .
She would not go into detail about the technology used to track Burt but said it was now highly advanced .
She said serial uploaders were under surveillance .
President Obama took Sen. John Barrasso to school during the Health Care Summit on why health savings accounts wo n't work for those who are not wealthy enough already to put some savings aside .
From TPM -- Obama Takes Dr. Barrasso To Medical School :
" Would you be satisfied if every member of Congress just had catastrophic care -- you think we'd be better health care purchasers ? "
Obama asked Barrasso .
" I mean , is that a change you think we should make ? "
" I think actually we would , " Barrasso responded .
" We 'd really focus on it .
We 'd have more , as you say , skin in the game .
And especially if they had a savings account - - a health savings account -- they could put their money into that , and they'd be spending the money out of that . "
Obama 's retort left Barrasso speechless : " Would you feel the same way if you were making $ 40,000 .
Or if that was your income .
Because that 's the reality for a lot of folks , " Obama said .
As usual , the Republicans ' great ideas for health care " reform " is for everyone to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps , even if those bootstraps are nonexistent .
Families USA has a great list of articles as to why these health savings accounts are a really bad idea for anyone who is not already wealthy .
HSA's : Shop While You Drop ?:
Health Savings Accounts ( HSAs ) are being promoted by President Bush and conservatives in Congress as a way to bring down spiraling health care costs .
Only if consumers have " skin in the game , " they argue , will Americans start to shop around for cheaper health care .
HSAs are tax sheltered savings accounts coupled with high - deductible health insurance policies , and they have serious drawbacks .
For many health consumers , HSAs will increase out - of - pocket costs — and complexity .
And here 's what they wo n't do :
They wo n't bring down health care costs and they wo n't make a dent in the number of Americans without health insurance .
This resource center pulls together a range of materials looking at the limitations of Health Savings Accounts .

The Gucci Group announced on Thursday that it would continue to produce fashion collections and accessories under the Alexander McQueen label after the suicide of the avant - garde designer last week .
Robert Polet , the chief executive , speaking at an annual meeting of Gucci ’s parent company , PPR , said that the company would continue to finance the brand .
He also said in a statement released soon afterward that a McQueen collection would be shown during Paris Fashion Week in March .
Mr. McQueen was widely reported to have completed at least part of a fall 2010 collection before his death , leading to speculation as to whether it would be shown posthumously in tribute .
The designer , known for his thought - provoking and sometimes shocking collections , was found dead in his London home on Feb. 11 at age 40 .
An officer of the Westminster Coroner ’s Court in London said during proceedings this week that the cause of death was asphyxia and hanging .
The Gucci Group ’s announcement did not make clear what the company ’s strategy for future designs would be , but a spokeswoman said that Mr. Polet was meeting with Mr. McQueen ’s staff to formulate a plan .
The fall collection will be shown to small groups of editors on March 9 and 10 , but not on a runway , as are most Fashion Week collections .
Heineken , Dos Equis brew a $ 7.6 billion deal
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Heineken announced plans Monday to buy the beer operations of Mexico's Fomento Económico Mexicano ( Femsa ) for about $ 7.6 billion , as the Dutch brewer moves to expand its operations in the Western Hemisphere .
The deal will give Heineken , which brews Amstel and other beers , control of Femsa 's key export brands , including Dos Equis , Tecate and Sol .
The companies said the all - stock deal includes about $ 2.1 billion in debt and pension obligations .
" The acquisition strengthens considerably our position within the global beer market , " Jean - François van Boxmeer , chairman and chief executive of Heineken , said in a statement .
" [ It ] expands our portfolio of leading international brands and enhances our leading position in the U.S. import market . "
Under the terms of the deal , Femsa will gain a 20 % economic interest in the Heineken Group , and will have the right to appoint two non-executive representatives to Heineken 's board .
" Heineken presented us with the most compelling opportunity to transform our brewing assets , " José Antonio Fernández Carbajal , chairman of the board and CEO of FEMSA , said in a statement .
" In the context of the reconfiguration of the global brewing landscape , scale and geographic diversification are more important than ever , " Carbajal said .
" And this transaction responds to that imperative . "
The deal , which is subject to shareholder approval , is expected to close in the second quarter .
Heineken ( HINKY ) expects to see cost savings of more than $ 200 million by 2013 as a result of the merger .

Everyone agrees you can still enjoy a steak A bitter row has broken out between members of the British meat industry and the World Cancer Research Fund over whether red meat increases the risk of bowel cancer .
What do we know about this link ?
The WCRF says the evidence that red and processed meats increase the risk of colorectal cancer is " convincing " , and since 2007 - when it published a major report on lifestyle and cancer - has urged the public to limit their consumption of steak and sausages .
These conclusions , claim an array of organisations representing meat producers , are flawed .
They point to a number of independent scientists who have questioned the conviction with which the link between red meat and cancer was presented in the report .
The WCRF has published a list of " minor errors " with the report - some relating to the findings on red meat and bowel cancer - but says it has no intention of altering the conclusions based on an expert panel 's review of the scientific literature .
According to the recommendations , red meat should be consumed in modest amounts , and salami and ham should almost always be avoided .
Veggies ' risk
This latest spat is driven by the fact that the government 's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition cited the WCRF report in draft conclusions on the impact of cutting red meat on the nation 's iron levels .
The WCRF findings , argues the lobby group for the English beef and lamb industry - EBLEX , should not be used as a " point of reference " .
It 's an enigma - nobody knows the truth
Professor Tim Key
Oxford University
But there have already been clashes within the pages of the leading scientific journal on diet and disease .
In a letter last year to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , Professor Stewart Truswell of the University of Sydney questioned why several large studies which found no link had been discarded by the panel , and also pinpointed errors in the reporting of data .
In response , the WCRF explained that a series of studies on meat had been omitted because they did not report on red meat specifically , but it did accept some mistakes in the reporting of the data .
This did not however " change the overall picture " , it stressed .
Many in the scientific community were however taken aback by the findings of a large study into the relationship between diet and cancer , published in the same nutrition journal last year .
Looking at all the research , the evidence linking red and processed meat and bowel cancer is overwhelming
Professor Martin Wiseman
WCRF The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition - Oxford ( EPIC - Oxford ) , which followed 65,000 people during the 1990s , found that far from being protected from bowel cancer as anticipated , vegetarians in fact displayed a slightly higher incidence of this form of the disease .
It ran counter to the the findings of a previous arm of the EPIC study which suggested that very high levels of red and processed meat consumption - more than two pork chops every day - was associated with a 35 % higher risk of bowel cancer when compared with those who rarely ate red meat .
" Our findings did come as something of a surprise .
At the simplest level if meat causes colorectal cancer you would expect to see lower rates in the vegetarians , and we didn't , " says Professor Tim Key , the epidemiologist who led the Oxford study .
" It 's definitely a really tricky area .
It 's an enigma - nobody knows the truth .
We can be much clearer on the relationship between obesity and cancer , or alcohol and cancer , because it 's relatively easy to measure these things .
Understanding the exact role specific foods play is much harder to quantify .
" There is a lot of evidence for meat , but it 's not completely compelling . "
It 's not no The WCRF says the Oxford findings on vegetarians could be explained by chance , noting there were only 28,000 non-meat eaters in the study .
Vegetarians , it said , may consume fewer dairy products - " and our report found that milk probably reduces risk of bowel cancer " .
RED MEAT CONTENT
Medium steak : 145g Pork chop : 75g Spaghetti bolognese with beef : 140g Serving of roast beef : 90g " We are in the process of reviewing the evidence on meat and bowel cancer and that is expected to be published later this year , " says Professor Martin Wiseman , the project director .
" But no research has been published since our report to make us question the finding that there is convincing evidence red and processed meat increase risk of bowel cancer . "
" It is easy for anyone to find an individual study to support almost any view they wish to hold .
But looking at all the research , the evidence linking red and processed meat and bowel cancer is overwhelming . "
The WRCF does not in any event advocate a vegetarian diet , or a complete abstention from red meat .
In fact its recommendations that people keep within 500g a week - the equivalent of a fair serving of roast beef on five of those days - is not far off average consumption .
Nell Barrie , Cancer Research UK 's science information officer , said : " Two of the world 's largest studies on diet and cancer have found that people are more likely to develop some cancers , such as bowel cancer , if they eat too much red or processed meat .
" Cutting down on these foods can help to reduce the risk of developing cancer . "
But cancer specialist Professor Karol Sikora said those who enjoyed eating red meat should continue to do so .
" We have created a nightmare situation of confusing messages based on very little evidence .
Eating red meat in the context of a balanced diet should really not be viewed as a problem .
" Yes , avoid a high calorie , high fat diet - but by all means enjoy that steak . "

The benefits of marijuana in tempering or reversing the effects of Alzheimer 's disease have been challenged in a new study by researchers at the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute .
The findings , published in the current issue of the journal Current Alzheimer Research , could lower expectations about the benefits of medical marijuana in combating various cognitive diseases and help redirect future research to more promising therapeutics .
Previous studies using animal models showed that HU210 , a synthetic form of the compounds found in marijuana , reduced the toxicity of plaques and promoted the growth of new neurons .
Those studies used rats carrying amyloid protein , the toxin that forms plaques in the brains of Alzheimer 's victims .
The new study , led by Dr. Weihong Song , Canada Research Chair in Alzheimer 's Disease and a professor of psychiatry in the UBC Faculty of Medicine , was the first to test those findings using mice carrying human genetic mutations that cause Alzheimer 's disease - widely considered to be a more accurate model for the disease in humans .
" As scientists , we begin every study hoping to be able to confirm beneficial effects of potential therapies , and we hoped to confirm this for the use of medical marijuana in treating Alzheimer 's disease , " says Song , a member of the Brain Research Centre at UBC and VCH Research Institute and Director of Townsend Family Laboratories at UBC .
" But we did n't see any benefit at all .
Instead , our study pointed to some detrimental effects . "
Over a period of several weeks , some of the Alzheimer 's - afflicted mice were given varying doses of HU210 - also known as cannabinoids - which is 100 to 800 times more potent than the marijuana compounds .
Their memory was then tested .
The mice treated with HU210 did no better than untreated mice , with those given low doses of HU210 performing the worst .
The researchers also found that HU210 - treated mice had just as much plaque formation and the same density of neurons as the control group .
The group given higher doses actually had fewer brain cells .
" Our study shows that HU210 has no biological or behavioural effect on the established Alzheimer 's disease model , " says Song , the Jack Brown and Family Professor and Chair in Alzheimer 's Disease .
" More studies should be done before we place much hope in marijuana 's benefits for Alzheimer 's patients . "

Alzheimer 's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration and is the most common form of dementia .
The Alzheimer Society of Canada estimates that the disease affects close to 300,000 Canadians and accounts for two - thirds of all cases of dementia .
Approximately $ 5.5 billion per year is spent caring for persons with Alzheimer 's and related dementias in Canada .
By 2031 , about 750,000 Canadians will suffer from Alzheimer 's and related dementias .
The Alzheimer 's Association in the U.S. estimates there are approximately 500,000 Americans younger than 65 with Alzheimer 's or other dementia .
The research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the Jack Brown and Family Alzheimer 's Research Foundation , the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research and a donation from the David Townsend Family .
Townsend Family Laboratories was established at The University of British Columbia with a donation of $ 7.5 million from the David Townsend Family .
The research centre is dedicated to integrating the basic and clinical research for finding the underlying mechanism and novel diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer 's Disease and developing interventions to prevent and treat this devastating disease .
The UBC Faculty of Medicine provides innovative programs in the health and life sciences , teaching students at the undergraduate , graduate and postgraduate levels , and generates more than $ 200 million in research funding each year .
In 2007 /08 , out of the total UBC research endeavour , 53 per cent , or $ 247 million , came from academic and clinical teams in the Faculty of Medicine .

With the official opening statements on the overhaul of NASA ’s future expected “ soon ” , the realignment of NASA ’s future goals will create a Human Space Flight path that will likely stretch out for decades .
The end goal remains footsteps on Mars , but the approach may involve the use of deep space and Phobos as the precursor for a manned mission to the Red Planet .
NASA Short to Mid Term :
It is still uncertain as to how much of the future plan will be outlined by – or via – President Obama , with some media noting the possibility of some form of a public announcement as soon as next week , or as late as the summer .
However , it is known what some selected NASA managers are working on , which in turn is providing some level of information on what NASA will be undertaking in the coming years – pending the big question of NASA ’s future budget support .
Despite what can only be described as politically - driven armwaving from the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel ( ASAP ) , very few people of power are taking any stock in their recommendations , notably to continue to focus on the Program Of Record ( POR ) based around Ares I , and their continued distain at the evaluations to extend the shuttle program past 2010 .
While Ares I is suffering from death throes , NASA managers have openly noted on documentation that they are evaluating commercial crew launch options for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in four to five years time .
Current favorite for providing this role is the Atlas V - Heavy .
ASAP ’s negativity surrounding extension of the shuttle program centers around a minimum requirement to recertify the vehicles in the event of additional missions – which is the second time such a reference has been made , and the second time Space Shuttle Manager John Shannon has reacting by dismissing their comments .
“ The ASAP Report has been released .
Read it so you can be informed .
This report did not mention the certification / verification work done by the SSP since 2005 , ” Mr Shannon noted on the latest Shuttle Standup / Integration report – available on L2 – before citing an example of just how well the vehicles are performing .
“ As proof of how well the technicians are maintaining the vehicles and equipment , during the STS - 129 / ULF3 mission , there were only two IFAs ( In Flight Anomalies ) : 1 ) a clogged urine filter ; and 2 ) a burned - out lightbulb .
This performance indicates how well the team is doing in putting together an outstanding vehicle that performs well in flight . ”
However , with only one major effort to extend the program at the political level remaining , the possibility of extending shuttle is become less likely by the month .
Mr Shannon also appeared to accept extension is n’t going to happen .
“ The State of the Union address from President Obama is January 27 .
The FY10 budget rollout will be February 1 .
There are no changes anticipated to the Shuttle plan for this year , ” he added on the Standup report .
“ We know what we have to do , and how to do it .
( Mr. Shannon ) expressed his pride in the SSP Team and all of the hard work it performs on a daily basis . ”
With the three superstar vehicles now contemplating a retirement of being poked and prodded by tourists , no one will miss their house calls more than the ISS , which will have to survive on the rations of the Russian Progress , the European ATV , the Japanese HTV and the Commercial Resupply Services ( CRS ) partners – all of which will not come close to the upmass and downmass capability of the shuttle .
Ironically , the ISS is likely to be extended to 2020 , despite losing its main lifeline , along with thousands upon thousands of dedicated and world class engineers .
However , there may be a silver lining in the near and distant future , as NASA is refocused away from Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) , with a new Heavy Lift Launcher ( HLV ) as its centrepiece .
“ Emphasis is being placed on a Shuttle - derived in - line activity that is looking at a Block 1 concept that will utilize existing Shuttle assets after the end of the SSP , ” noted a Standup report last week .
“ The goal is to put some flights together and to determine a timeline and a prospective budget . ”
As reported by NASASpaceflight.com , a “ special team ” was set up by NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden to evaluate all the Heavy Lifter options and alternatives to Ares V .
Their findings have since been presented , with the Sidemount HLV losing out to the In - Line Shuttle Derived HLV , which sources claim is based on a Jupiter - 241 Stretched Heavy .
Members of the “ Direct ” effort met again with NASA ’s top management at NASA HQ just this week .
As a result , the SSP has changed its main focus away from the Sidemount HLV to the In - Line concept , as noted in this week ’s standup report .
“ Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle ( HLV ) ( NASA / JSC ) : The Shuttle - derived in - line activity is proceeding well .
A review of how much of the MPS ( Main Propulsion System ) components can be utilized has been held and the results look promising .
“ There will be a review of how to apply Shuttle flight software to the HLV on Friday .
Options for performing an early demonstration will be discussed with Mr. Shannon . ”
While timelines and schedules for the HLV are n’t likely to be known for some time , the roles this vehicle will be used for – past NASA ’s involvement with the ISS – remains the main question .
Early indications of how NASA ’s forward path would be refined showed support for visiting a Near Earth Object ( NEO ) as a deep space mission – and as noted on NASA ’s internal “ Flexible Path ” evaluation presentation .
This may remain the case , although very little has been heard since its section in the aforementioned presentation , bar a few documented mentions that this could be pushed back until after a Mars mission .
What has received a large amount of political and NASA attention over recent weeks is one of the other options outlined in the presentation – for manned missions to construct a giant telescope in Geostationary orbit ( GEO ) , and possibly as far as the region of Earth - Moon L1 , before being carried to their operational location at SE L2 ( Sun-Earth L2 ) .
Both the Telescopes and NEO missions would utilize Orion , a Hab / Servicing Node , and ride with a Centaur Upper Stage .
Specific mission evaluations have already started at NASA , with support at the Senate level ( request was made not to name the NASA managers in this article ) .
However , it remains uncertain if such an approach would come before , after , or even replace a mission to a NEO – although NASA ’s internal findings also support the priority of working towards the construction of telescopes as a priority on the roadmap .
“ Deep - space telescope - assembly missions described in this package are ‘ even easier ’ and more incremental than NEO exploration , so they may provide options for a gentler and quicker start than envisioned by the Augustine Committee . ”
Notably , all references towards the initial exploration goal of President Bush ’s Vision for Space Exploration ( VSE ) – landing on the moon and setting up a lunar base – have vanished , and threaten to disappear completely from NASA ’s ambitions .

Mars Orbit / Phobos Landing :
The big prize always has been – and continues to be – Mars .
The roadmap , however , to achieve a Neil Armstrong - style footstep on the surface of the Red Planet is set to change if the Flexible Path approach is confirmed , with the preferred choice to send a human expedition into the orbit of Mars – without landing – before heading to its nearby moon of Phobos .
“ A human Mars Orbit / Phobos Mission represents an intermediate step between human exploration missions in near - Earth space and human missions to explore the surface of Mars , ” opened the expansive section on the manned missions to Mars / Phobos in the 65 page NASA internal “ Flexible Path ” presentation ( available to download on L2 ) .
“ Key features could include demonstration of in - space hardware elements designed for Mars missions while accomplishing scientific and exploration objectives both at Mars and on Phobos . ”
Citing an example mission , NASA managers outlined how they would approach the mission duration for the crew – which would be up to 650 days based on a short stay mission .
“ This example mission uses an ‘ short stay ’ trajectory ( ‘ opposition class ’ ) .
Total mission durations for the short - stay missions range from 550 - 650 days , with 30 to 40 days in the vicinity of Mars .
Over 95 percent of the total mission time is spent in the deep - space interplanetary environment with the balance spent in the vicinity of Mars .
“ Duration of the transit legs ranges from a minimum of 190 days and maximum in excess of 400 days .
Conjunction - class missions ( about 20 - 40 percent longer in total but with over 12 x the staytime ) are also feasible for a Phobos mission . ”
As to when such a mission would be viable to launch is unknown .
However , it would involve a large ramp up in the use of the HLV – with up to 15 launches of the heavy lifter to send all the elements of the Mars Transport Vehicle ( MTV ) into LEO for assembly .
For the purpose of the presentation ’s example , Ares V and Ares I are illustrated – although neither are cited by name in the presentation – along with a MTV that is made up of numerous propulsive stages , a large Hab Module ( CTV ) and Orion .
“ The mission begins with the launch of the Crew Transfer Vehicle ( CTV ) .
Propulsive stages for the major in - space maneuvers are launched next .
Due to the wide variability of the short stay class trajectories the number of propulsive stages varies with opportunity , as will the number of HLV launches , ” added the presentation .
“ Assuming hydrogen - oxygen in - space propulsion , the number of HLV launches varies between 10 and 15 .
Once all of the in - space propulsive stages are assembled in LEO , the crew is launched via Orion and the crew departs for Mars . ”
Incidentally , the example mission involves a fly - by of Venus on the return leg – and the closest man has ever been to the Sun – along with possible flybys of several asteroids .
“ On arrival at Mars the crew propulsively captures into orbit and eventually maneuvers to Phobos rendezvous .
After a 40 day stay in the vicinity of Mars , the crew departs for Earth return .
The return leg is targeted for a Venus flyby to reduce the propulsive requirement .
“ Since this leg likely passes inside the orbit of Venus , such a mission would include the closest approach to the Sun by a human crew .
Small asteroid flyby opportunities may also exist on such trajectories .
The crew can participate in science investigation of flyby objects from a unique perspective .
“ The Orion used to launch and board the crew is also used to return them to Earth via direct entry .
The Crew Transfer Vehicle is targeted to flyby Earth and is expended in deep space . ”
The NASA authors then focus on why they approached Mars via a “ Phobos - First ” mission , noting it was first suggested by the Augustine Committee .
“ Our choice to include a short - stay human visit to Phobos as an example step toward humans - on - Mars is outside the framework of missions extensively analyzed by recent agency Mars mission planning , which have focused on Mars surface missions themselves .
“ Such a mission is suggested by the Augustine Committee as a possible element of a Flexible Path strategy , so it bears examination .
“ Assessment of the value of such a mission compared to the risk of sending crew on a multi- year , deep - space mission is a function not only of the potential science return , inter-operation with parallel robotic Mars surface missions , and direct feed - forward to human Mars surface missions , but also of the unique technical challenges and risks it would impose , and also how ‘ fast ’ the program intends to get to the surface of Mars . ”
In fact , the presentation goes on to support the idea of targeting a landing on Phobos prior to a manned mission to the surface of Mars , citing formidable challenges with the latter .
“ Augustine Committee advocated a trip to orbit Mars and / or rendezvous with its moons prior to a trip to land on Mars .
Such a trip nominally lasts three years , but could be made shorter with significant delta V penalty .
“ 2 - yr mission ( 30 - 45 days at Mars , all - chemical propulsion ) requires ~ 10 - 15 HLVs and a Venus flyby .
3 - yr mission ( 1.5 years at Mars , all - chemical propulsion ) requires ~5 HLVs .
~3 HLVs if nuclear thermal propulsion ( see image left ) .
“ On the first trip to Mars , why go all that way but not land ?
Formidable challenges of EDL ( Entry , Descent , Landing ) and ISRU ( in situ resource utilization ) , and expense of surface systems , add to an already formidable list of other challenges .
“ However , landing reduces radiation and may provide gravity reconditioning .
A shorter visit orbiting Mars ( e.g. , a 2 - year Phobos mission ) avoids the ‘ high bar ’ of a surface mission while also minimizing radiation and microgravity exposure , at the cost of more Earth launches . ”
Interest in Phobos / Aiding Mars Mission :
Further comments are made to support a Phobos mission as a precursor to a manned mission to Mars , primarily from two standpoints ; a learning curve for a future mission to Mars , and the Mars science that can be gained from Phobos .
“ The mystery of the origin of Phobos can be resolved , and its evolution since formation can be investigated by field geologists on site in contact with a larger team back on Earth .
As a possible D - type ( organics - rich with possible interior ice ) asteroid , it offers science beyond what is readily available in the NEO population , and can shed light on the objects that delivered the initial inventory of water and organics to the surfaces of Earth and Mars , ” the presentation continued .
“ Returned samples would contain a record frozen very early in the formation of the solar system .
The work would benefit significantly from a conjunction - class mission ( 540 days vs. 40 days at the target ) , since Phobos is a large and diverse body .
“ Phobos has been a collector of ejected Martian surface material for billions of years .
That material is a record of the history of early Mars that may not even be preserved on Mars itself due to weathering .
Martian material should be readily recognizable by color for collection .
These samples would be an important supplement to samples collected directly from the surface of Mars . ”
Supported by robotic companions such as Rovers , the astronauts would focus on collecting science samples for return to Earth and search for water ice – all whilst in the shadow of the Red Planet .
“ Operation of Mars rovers from Earth is limited by the light time and communication opportunities to once - per - sol driving and articulation commands .
From Phobos , a landing site would be visible about twice per sol for four hours each time , so on the order of four hours per sol during daylight .
“ Two rovers with sufficient longitudinal separation could be operated by a single astronaut during a reasonable workday .
The almost zero latency would permit vastly more efficient field work and sample collection on Mars than possible if they are operated from Earth .
Even joy - sticked driving would be feasible , allowing the rovers to cover much greater distances .
“ The ability to interact with the environment in real time would significantly improve our understanding of the geology and our ability to select samples that best reveal the physical and biological history of Mars .
Samples can be launched into orbit for pickup by the crew , or for later pickup by robotic return orbiters .
This work would also benefit significantly from a conjunction - class mission .
“ The low density of Phobos and its D - type spectrum suggests the possibility of large amounts of interior ice .
Accessible ice would be a tremendous boon to later crewed Mars missions if it enables refueling in Mars orbit . ”
Regardless , Phobos presents a number of Mars - like challenges to a manned mission , and certainly is n’t an easy route .
However , the benefit of taking on Phobos would allow NASA engineers and astronauts to learn how to approach a subsequent Mars mission by proxy .
“ One of the significant advantages a Phobos mission would be to demonstrate many of the technical and operational approaches needed for Mars missions without yet having all the required systems , or committing the crew to a full - duration surface stay .
A Phobos mission could drive and demonstrate solutions of these items .
Such challenges mainly relate to the safety of the crew – which in turn would focus engineering efforts via the design of the MTV / CTV and Orion .
“ Passing closer than 1 AU distance to the Sun poses significant mission , vehicle design and human health issues which the mission approach must be designed for , ” added the presentation .
“ Radiation Shielding : Additional shielding mass to protect from solar flares during solar maximum .
Since the strength of the radiation dose is inversely proportional to / or dose to the crew .
Potential risks are higher risk of carcinogenesis , acute syndromes , CNS ( central nervous system ) effects and degenerative effects due to longer transits .
“ Thermal Control : Vehicle heat load increases with closer perihelion passage .
Deployable sun shades are probably required for short - stay missions to shadow critical vehicle components and areas .
Deployable radiators and additional active cooling loops may be required .
“ Vehicle Orientation :
Due to the increased thermal and solar influence , vehicle systems including solar arrays and sunshades must be positioned relative to the sun with tighter control in order to prevent overheating .
“ Launch vehicle campaign :
The shorter total duration of opposition - class missions comes at the expense of higher total delta V , and this varies significantly with opportunity .
The net result is a need to launch more in - space propulsion elements , compared to the longer , long - stay conjunction - class missions .
“ In addition , spending an entire Mars mission in microgravity ( rather than interleaving a 500 + day stay in the 3/8 g environment of the Mars surface ) would be far outside current human micro-g experience envelope ( n = 1 @ 14 months ) no matter which trajectory option is used .
“ Mitigation might be based on a modified exercise and pharmaceutical program , or artificial - g vehicle design ; both are unprecedented .
Unique costs and benefits of missions similar to the example would need to be evaluated in the context of overall Flexible Path objectives . ”
Several additional elements surrounding the technical aspect of comparing a mission to Phobos and Mars are also outlined , prior to a supportive conclusion that outlines Phobos as the best “ legacy ” for a Mars mission .
“ A human Mars Orbit / Phobos Mission represents an intermediate step between human exploration missions in near Earth space and human missions to explore the surface of Mars .
Key features could include demonstration of inspace hardware elements designed for Mars missions while accomplishing scientific and exploration objectives both at Mars and on Phobos .
“ At the completion of this mission , design solutions for and demonstrations of in - space hardware elements designed for human Mars surface mission will have been accomplished , as will significant scientific and exploration objectives at Mars and Phobos .
Significant such objectives include gathering and preliminary analysis of samples from both Mars and Phobos , including samples from candidate landing site for future human crews .
“ This mission could build on prior deep space missions by human crews in Earth - Moon space and to NEOs .
It would leave a legacy of better understanding of both Mars and Phobos , along with a foundation for human missions to the surface of Mars .
“ Achieving that legacy through such a mission would require meeting some unique challenges not needed for subsequent Mars surface missions .
Key Accomplishments : Human round trip to Mars orbit .
Phobos and Mars sample return for analysis in terrestrial laboratories .
“ Key Mission Legacy : In - space portion of future Mars missions demonstrated .
Ground ops and hardware processing .
Deep - space crew operations .
High - bandwidth communication .
Planetary protection and sample analysis protocols .
Some Phobos - unique challenges . ”

Ireland 's police colluded with the Catholic church in covering up clerical child abuse in Dublin on a huge scale , according to a damning report on decades of sex crimes committed by priests .
The devastating report on the sexual and physical abuse of children by the clergy in Ireland 's capital from 1975 to 2004 accuses four former archbishops , a host of clergy and senior members of the Garda Síochána of a cover-up .
The three - volume report found that the " maintenance of secrecy , the avoidance of scandal , the protection of the reputation of the church and the preservation of its assets " was more important than justice for the victims .
Four former archbishops in Dublin – John Charles McQuaid , who died in 1973 , Dermot Ryan , who died in 1984 , Kevin McNamara , who died in 1987 , and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell – were found to have failed to report their knowledge of child sexual abuse to the Garda from the 1960s to the 1980s .
But the report added that all the archbishops of the diocese in the period were aware of complaints .
The report , launched today by the Irish justice minister , Dermot Ahern , also concluded that the vast majority of priests turned a " blind eye " to abuse , although some individuals did bring complaints to superiors , which were not acted upon .
The report , commissioned by the government , strongly criticises the Garda and says senior members of the force regarded priests as being outside their investigative remit .
The relationship between some senior gardai and priests and bishops in Dublin was described as " inappropriate " .
Rather than investigate complaints from children , gardai simply reported the matter to the Dublin Catholic diocese , the report says .
The Garda Síochána is accused of connivance with the church in stifling at least one complaint of abuse and letting the alleged perpetrator flee the country .
Ahern said there should be no hiding place for abusers .
" The persons who committed these dreadful crimes will continue to be pursued .
They must come to know that there is no hiding place .
That justice – even where it may have been delayed – will not be denied , " he said .
He told a press conference : " I read the report as justice minister .
But on a human level – as a father and as a member of this community – I felt a growing sense of revulsion and anger at the horrible , evil acts committed against children . "
The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre welcomed the report , saying it was " another acknowledgment of the abject failure of our society to take care of our children " .
The report states that senior clerical figures covered up the abuse over nearly 30 years and that the structures and rules of the church facilitated that cover - up .
It says that state authorities facilitated the cover - up by allowing the church to be beyond the reach of the law .
The Murphy Commission of Inquiry into the abuse of children in Dublin identified 320 people who complained of child sexual abuse between 1975 and 2004 .
It also stated that since May 2004 , 130 complaints against priests operating in the Dublin archdiocese had been made .
The report details the cases of 46 priests guilty of abuse as a representative sample of 102 priests within its remit .
But it concludes that there was no evidence of an organised paedophile ring in the Dublin archdiocese , although it says there were worrying connections .
One priest admitted abusing more than 100 children .
Another said he had committed abuse every two weeks for more than 25 years .
The report highlights the case of a Father Carney and Father McCarthy who it claims in one case both abused the same child .
The abuse by Carney often occurred at swimming pools , sometimes when he was accompanied by another priest .
The report states that it was not until 1995 that the archdiocese began to notify civil authorities of complaints of abuse .
The commission concludes that in the light of this and other facts , every bishop 's primary loyalty was to the church itself .
A move by the archdiocese to take out insurance against potential compensation claims arising from abuse , according to the report , proved knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost .
The Garda Síochána 's current commissioner , Fachtna Murphy , said the report made for " difficult and disturbing reading , detailing many instances of sexual abuse and failure … to protect victims . "
Pope Benedict was urged today to go to Ireland and apologise for his clergy 's behaviour .
John Kelly , of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse , said only a papal visit would exonerate the worldwide church in the abuse scandals .
Abuse reports
• October 2005 the Ferns report detailed extensive child abuse and the cover -up of paedophile activity in the south - east of Ireland .
• November 2005 Judge Yvonne Murphy was appointed to head a commission of investigation into clerical child abuse in the Dublin diocese , which concluded today .
• May 2009 the Ryan report detailing abuse at orphanages and industrial schools run by Catholic religious orders across the state was published .

The fact that some Intel very high up executives were trying to force what was obviously an inferior solution on the people in Intel who actually do the work has does n't mean Intel was helping Microsoft " gang up " on Linux .
Those executives were n't trying to force everyone ELSE to use Linux .
Sorry PJ .
That 's not what 's going on .
This is Microsoft trying to get Intel to stay away from Linux usage for chip design because of their " Jihad " ( what better word for it : thanks for the quote , Bill , you jackass ) .
On the other hand , so do I , so perhaps that is just me getting even more grumpy .
Another contributor who has often castigated Microsoft to their face for their shortcomings reported that Microsoft 's 2009 Professional Developers Conference did not have the ' buzz and vibe ' of previous years .
He thought it might have been because of the recession or because it was too close to the previous conference .
I like to think that the excitement of working with the bad boy of IT has been overtaken by the ennui and despair of suppressing what they know of the company 's activities .
Being friends with a bully grows old .
It is time to raise the level of positive discrimination , once more .
I notice that the UK PCPRO magazine , which is a good guide on Windows PCs and networking , continues to pour scorn on things we say .
I do n't mind .
With the depth of commitment and immersion in the Windows environment , our views would seem rather kaftan and sandals .
However , in the latest issue , I notice that one contributor said that Microsoft will encourage PC and laptop manufacturers to bundle Office Starter on their PCs rather than the previous limited Microsoft Office trial .
He said 'by " encourage " , you can imagine pretty much anything you want ' .
It 's a clear acknowledgement of Microsoft 's methods .
If you enter a trade agreement with manufacturers for their products only to work with your product and not with your competitors ' products , is that ' Restraint of Trade ' ?
If you have a legal monopoly on your product , does that also constitute abuse of monopoly ?
I will not make a difference .
I will , however , redouble my effort to only use programs available on Linux .
I do n't mind if they also run on Windows , but only running on Windows is a reason not to purchase .
Well , other than antivirus programs , of course .
Microsoft had to get real software on to their Windows GUI manager to give it any credibility at all as a professional foundation for computing work .
Windows was only a window manager on top of the Microsoft Disk Operating System and it was a pretty rubbishy one , at that .
Once Microsoft got key professional software migrated to Windows , they obviously salted the ground behind the manufacturers for Unix and Linux .
How did they get the manufacturers to drop other operating systems ?
Let me count the Comes ways .
New research refutes the idea that compounds in marijuana may reduce toxic brain plaques associated with Alzheimer ’s disease .
In fact , the new study points to potential detrimental effects from marijuana use .
According to the authors , the findings could lower expectations about the benefits of medical marijuana in combating various cognitive diseases and help redirect future research to more promising therapeutics .
Previous studies using animal models showed that HU210 , a synthetic form of the compounds found in marijuana , reduced the toxicity of plaques and promoted the growth of new neurons .
Those studies used rats carrying amyloid protein , the toxin that forms plaques in the brains of Alzheimer ’s victims .
The new study , led by Dr. Weihong Song , Canada Research Chair in Alzheimer ’s Disease , was the first to test those findings using mice carrying human genetic mutations that cause Alzheimer ’s disease — widely considered to be a more accurate model for the disease in humans .
The study is found in current issue of the journal Current Alzheimer Research .
“ As scientists , we begin every study hoping to be able to confirm beneficial effects of potential therapies , and we hoped to confirm this for the use of medical marijuana in treating Alzheimer ’s disease , ” says Song , a member of the Brain Research Centre at UBC and VCH Research Institute and Director of Townsend Family Laboratories at UBC .
“ But we did n’t see any benefit at all .
Instead , our study pointed to some detrimental effects . ”
Over a period of several weeks , some of the Alzheimer ’s - afflicted mice were given varying doses of HU210 — also known as cannabinoids — which were 100 to 800 times more potent than the marijuana compounds .
Their memory was then tested .
The mice treated with HU210 did no better than untreated mice , with those given low doses of HU210 performing the worst .
The researchers also found that HU210 - treated mice had just as much plaque formation and the same density of neurons as the control group .
The group given higher doses actually had fewer brain cells .
“ Our study shows that HU210 has no biological or behavioral effect on the established Alzheimer ’s disease model , ” says Song , the Jack Brown and Family Professor and Chair in Alzheimer ’s Disease .
“ More studies should be done before we place much hope in marijuana ’s benefits for Alzheimer ’s patients . ”

New Study Finds Marijuana Does Not Slow Alzheimer’s
Here is a quote from Tim Pawlenty ’s Esquire interview :
ESQUIRE : Was spending going too far and government growing too big before Obama became president ?
Tim Pawlenty :
It certainly was , but he has pushed the gas pedal to the metal and exploded it in ways that were previously unheard - of .
I mean , he ’s taken the national deficit in one year and tripled it .
So we now have a $ 1.4 trillion deficit just in the past year .
Sounds familiar , does n’t it ?
Let ’s revisit that comment from the random commenter at Reason - :
Obama could have avoided all of this by governing more like Clinton .
He could have permanently painted the Republicans as the party of fiscal irresponsibility after record half - trillion - dollar deficits under Bush .
Instead he tripled them .
They make shit up , their supporters and the am radio crews and the hacks from the Koch funded “ think tanks ” repeat it over and over again , an uncritical media then reifies it , and before you know it , it is the new conventional wisdom .
It is what it is .
Back to Pawlenty ’s interview , because this was particularly laughable :
For example , instead of spending $ 800 billion in a stimulus package , I think we would have gotten much more bang for the buck if we would have done two simple things : focused on tax cuts that would have put cash immediately into the average citizen ’s pocket , and two , put money into bread - and - butter infrastructure projects like roads and bridges that could be done quickly .
Of the $ 800 billion stimulus package , only about $ 50 billion , give or take , actually went into roads and bridges .
It was a paltry amount compared to the overall size of the bill .
This is funny for so many reasons .
First , a good bit of the stimulus was tax cuts – 275 billion , to be exact .
Second , when you have massive unemployment , as we do , tax cuts do n’t benefit unemployed people ( if there has been anything positive out of the last year , we know definitively that tax cuts are worthless as stimulus– not that will stop blue dogs and Republicans from proposing them as a cure - all for everything that ails you ) .
Third , a large chunk of the bill was , as stated before , to provide relief to states .
And here is where it gets really good .
Pawlenty on infrastructure projects .
First off , I agree with him .
In fact , I would love to have a bill pass the house and Senate right now for half a trillion dollars that is spent on nothing but infrastructure - rail , roads , bridges , sanitation and waste management , improving the power grid - all the things the American Society of Civil Engineers say we need to fix .
But what Pawlenty does not note is that it ca n’t happen because the Republicans and the blue dogs they have so terrified will never let it happen .
They screamed that the existing infrastructure portion of the stimulus bill was just pork :
Republicans cry foul over $ 8 billion for high - speed rail Alleging the money is for an Anaheim - Las Vegas rail project , they accuse Sen .
Harry Reid of putting an earmark in the stimulus package .
They also screamed that it was just pork because it was not stimulus unless it happened immediately , and I blame Obama and company for the assist on that , making everything be “ shovel - ready . ”
Finally , the best part of Pawlenty ’s claim about support for infrastructure is the following question -
If it is such a good thing for the country as a whole , why was is infrastructure spending not good enough for his own state :
In the past two years , Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota twice vetoed legislation to raise the state ’s gas tax to pay for transportation needs .
Now , with at least five people dead in the collapse of the Interstate 35 W bridge here , Mr. Pawlenty , a Republican , appears to have had a change of heart .
“ He ’s open to that , ” Brian McClung , a spokesman for the governor , said Monday of a higher gas tax .
“ He believes we need to do everything we can to address this situation and the extraordinary costs . ”
Maybe Pawlenty found religion when it comes to the value of infrastructure spending .
Or maybe he is just full of shit .
I know which option I am choosing .
And if Pawlenty is serious about running for the GOP nomination , he better stop talking about spending hundreds of billions on things other than tax cuts for the rich and bombing muslim countries , or he will get teabagged before you can say fiscal conservative .

This obviously is not the case with the IPCC , which is stuffed with money , and in agreement with the UN politics , which are dominated by greens and misanthropic fanaticism .
During the past six years , the President of the United States devoted nearly $ 29 billion to climate research , leading the world with its unparalleled financial commitment ( The White House 2007 ) .
This was about $ 5 billion per year , more than twice the amount spent on the Apollo Program ( $ 2.3 billionper year ) , which in 1969 put man on the Moon .
A side - effect of this situation , and of politicizing the climate issue , was described by meteorologist Piers Corbyn in the Weather Action Bulletin , December 2000 : “ The problem we are faced with is that the meteorological establishment and the global warming lobby research bodies which receive large funding are now apparently so corrupted by the largesse they receive that the scientists in them have sold their integrity .
” We thus find ourselves in the situation that the entire theory of man-made global warming — with its repercussions in science , and its important consequences for politics and the global economy – is based on ice core studies that provided a false picture of the atmospheric CO2 levels .
Meanwhile , more than 90,000 direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere , carried out in America , Asia , and Europe between 1812 and 1961 , with excellent chemical methods ( accuracy better than 3 % ) , were arbitrarily rejected .
These measurements had been published in 175 technical papers .
For the past three decades , these well - known direct CO2 measurements , recently compiled and analyzed by Ernst - Georg Beck ( Beck 2006a , Beck 2006 b , Beck 2007 ) , were completely ignored by climatologists — and not because they were wrong .
Indeed , these measurements were made by several Nobel Prize winners , using the techniques that are standard textbook procedures in chemistry , biochemistry , botany , hygiene , medicine , nutrition , and ecology .
The only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic climatic warming .
I regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time .

Read this poll analysis from Public Policy Polling …
The vast majority of opposition to health care and allowing gays to serve openly in the military is coming from people who already say there ’s no chance they ’ll vote Democratic this fall .
That ’s an indication of minimal fallout for Congressional Democrats by acting on these issues .
37 % of Americans say they will definitely not vote Democratic for Congress this year .
34 % say they definitely will and that leaves roughly 30 % of the country up for grabs .
Right now 50 % of voters say they oppose President Obama ’s health care plan to just 39 % in support .
Digging a little deeper on those numbers though 64 % of respondents planning or open to voting Democratic this fall support it with only 22 % opposed .
The overall numbers are negative only because of 94/1 opposition among folks who have said there is no way they ’ll vote Democratic this fall .
Some ACORN dude registered Mickey Mouse to vote , which is so much worse than this :

House speaker , an ex-lawmaker and eight aides Thursday became the latest — and the first Republicans — to be charged in a three - year - old investigation into the diversion of public resources and employees to legislative campaigns .
Attorney General Tom Corbett said that individuals within the House GOP caucus spent millions of taxpayer dollars on computer technology to gain an upper hand in campaigns , and that investigators can prove that some high - ranking officials and their employees tried to cover up their part .
AG Corbett , by the way , is a Republican .
The charges of theft , conspiracy , conflict of interest and obstruction of justice , and an accompanying 188 - page grand jury report , were released Thursday , and the defendants were scheduled to turn themselves in today at a Dauphin County district judge ’s office .
The most prominent defendant is state Rep. John M. Perzel , R - Philadelphia , who served as speaker for nearly four years and as majority leader for nearly a decade before that .
How much did these Republicans steal from the public for their own nefarious purposes ?
The grand jury calculated that the House Republican caucus spent more than $ 20 million between 2000 and 2007 to help its candidates prevail .
The state should make the Pennsylvania GOP pay this money back .
GRAND RAPIDS -- Brad May is coming to the Grand Rapids Griffins after all .
The Griffins announced Wednesday night that the 38 - year - old NHL veteran is expected to practice with the team Tuesday morning and could make his American Hockey League debut March 4 at Peoria .
The parent club Detroit Red Wings placed May on waivers Feb. 12 .
He cleared , but the Red Wings gave him time during the Winter Olympics break to
.
After Wednesday night 's 3 - 2 loss to San Antonio , Grand Rapids coach Curt Fraser said he " absolutely " is looking forward to adding May to his roster .
" We need something in that locker room . "
Fraser said .
" Our leadership has been pretty good and they 've done a nice job of trying to steer the ship in the right direction , but they need help .
I think he will add a lot . "
May still could rejoin the Red Wings for the playoffs , when salary cap and roster restrictions wo n't be an issue .
" We want Brad May to finish the year in the AHL , " Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" We think he 's going to be a good role model for Grand Rapids .
He 's a good , veteran player to be around our kids . ''
May has spent his entire professional career in the NHL , a resume that spans 19 years and 1,041 games .
Only two other plays in Griffins history have appeared in 1,000 NHL games : Kelly Miller , who played his first minor - league game with Grand Rapids in 1999 - 2000 after 1,057 NHL contests , and Chris Chelios , who had a two - game conditioning stint with the Griffins last season and ranks fourth all - time with 1,644 NHL games .
May has one assist , a minus - 5 rating and 66 penalty minutes in 40 games with the Red Wings this season .
He also practiced with the Griffins for a week last fall before he was signed by Detroit on Oct.

Anthem Blue Cross customers got a shock this week when the health insurer informed thousands of individual policyholders that their premium rates will jump as much as 39 percent on March 1 .
" There are n't any other parts of our society where people have no regard for inflation rate and increase their prices this much .
I can't imagine anything in the world that 's going up 39 percent , " said Josh Libresco , 54 , of San Rafael , as he grappled with the news that his family premium will go from $ 858 per month to $ 1,192 - and that 's with a $ 5,000 deductible .
Anthem , which has reportedly sent letters this week to those who buy their coverage individually and are not covered by a group policy , said rising health care costs led to the increase .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The company , based in Woodland Hills ( Los Angles County ) , declined to say how many customers received the increase or what the average premium hike was , but the insurer has the largest number of individual customers in the state .
Last year , when Anthem Blue Cross raised rates by as much as 68 percent for some customers , the company said it had about 800,000 members .
The Department of Insurance plans to hire an actuarial firm to look into Anthem's " alarming " rate increases , said Darrel Ng , spokesman for the department .
Unlike home and automobile insurers , California insurers can legally raise rates for policyholders as much as and whenever they want .
Regulators technically oversee the increases , but they have no power to control rates .
The most recent effort to require state regulators to approve health insurance rate increases , a bill by Assemblyman Dave Jones , D - Sacramento , failed to pass the Assembly Health Committee in April .
For Jeff Sher of San Francisco , who is both an independent health insurance agent and an Anthem customer , his 38 percent increase comes on top of a 41 percent increase last year .
That means that in just a year , his premium increased from $ 273 to $ 530 per month , or 94 percent .
Sher , who is 59 , said he has n't needed to see a doctor in seven or eight years .
" It 's all based on this illusion there is a free market in this product .
But you can't shop for health care , particularly after you 're already sick , " he said .
" You can't shop for a carrier because there is almost no competition . "
Inspired by Mendel Heit , Martin Bauer and Jay Cousins we ’ve been doing a lot of playing around with bioplastics .
Here you can see the original post with a video that shows you how they made bioplastic .
Additionally this video is quite helpful .
So why have I been spending every minute of my free time cooking bioplastic ?
Basically the idea is : make a biodegradable plastic in your own home .
This will potentially be of big benefit for desktop 3D printing , personal production and also in reducing fossil fuel consumption and one ’s carbon footprint .
Make a material with easily obtainable biological products that you can in turn use to make lots of things .
If we ’re dreaming we can also then perhaps make a material that enables you the consumer to recycle the consumer products you make in your own home at home .
I tried to test and replicate a number of recipes and also show you what results you can achieve by cooking bioplastics in the home , right now .
Theoretically home made bioplastics could be of great benefit to hobbyists and
hardware hackers .
Such a material might actually also make a
fundamental impact on how certain people consumer things , make things ,
buy things and live their lives ( Makers and Green people ) .
It might
additionally have profound effects beyond this limited group ( bleeding
edge technology people , designers ) .
Via this group and with significant
improvements it could go much wider ( ie used by people drawn to
customization such as millennials ) .
And an ideal version of this
material could even “ change everything ” ( ie become mainstream and
fundamentally alter the distribution and creation of consumer goods ) .

A copy of the first comic to feature caped hero Superman has been sold on the internet for $ 1 m ( £ 646,000 ) .
The 1938 edition of Action Comics No 1 - which originally sold for 10 c - was sold by a private seller to a private buyer , neither of whom was named .
Stephen Fishler , co-owner of the US auction website Comic Connect , said it was " the Holy Grail of comic books " .
The sale smashes the previous record price for a comic book of $ 317,200 ( £ 205,000 ) in 2009 .
That was also a copy of Action Comics No 1 , but in poorer condition .
Mr Fishler said the transaction happened minutes after the issue was put on sale at around 1030 local time ( 1530 GMT ) on Monday .
He said that the seller was a " well - known individual " in New York with a pedigree collection , and that the buyer was a known customer who had previously bought an Action Comics No 1 .
' A milestone '
" The opportunity to buy an un-restored , high - grade Action One comes along once every two decades .
It 's certainly a milestone , " said Mr Fishler .
He added : " It is still a little stunning to see a comic book and $ 1 m in the same sentence . "
About 100 copies of Action Comics
No 1 remain in existence and only two of those have a grading of 8.0 - very fine - including the one sold on Monday .
The previous record - holder had a grading of 6.0 .
The cover of the rare issue pictures Superman lifting a car over his head .
HONOLULU ( Reuters ) - Hawaii sounded warning sirens and began evacuating residents near the coastline on Saturday ahead of a tsunami generated by a massive earthquake in Chile .
Civil defense sirens sounded across the island state at 6 a.m. local time ( 11 a.m. EST ) after the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said a tsunami was generated that could cause waves of up to 8 feet and damage along the coasts of all the Hawaiian islands .
“ We ’re not expecting this to be a worst - case scenario , but we are expecting dangerous waves to appear on shore , ” said Charles McCreery , director of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii .
Civil defense officials sent firefighters and firetrucks into neighborhoods bordering the coast , and used loud speakers urging residents to evacuate .
Gas stations in Honolulu were jammed with lines of cars stretching a quarter of a mile in some places as residents waited to fill gas tanks before evacuating .
Buses were to patrol beaches and take people to parks in a voluntary process expected to last five hours .
“ Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property , ” the Warning Center said in a bulletin .
“ All shores are at risk no matter which direction they face . ”

The center has issued a Pacific - wide tsunami warning that included Hawaii and stretched across the ocean from South America to the Pacific Rim .
Geophysicist Victor Sardina said the Hawaii - based center was urging all countries included in the warning to take the threat very seriously .
“ Everybody is under a warning because the wave , we know , is on its way .
Everybody is at risk now , ” he said in a telephone interview .
The warning follows a huge earthquake in Chile that killed at least 122 people and triggered tsunamis up and down the coast of the earthquake - prone country .
Updated estimates from the center forecast the first tsunami , which is a series of several waves in succession , would hit Hawaii at 11:05 a.m. Hawaii time ( 2105 GMT ) in the town of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii , with waves around 8 - feet high .

POPULAR BEACHES
Smaller waves were then expected to hit Honolulu , and its popular beaches like Waikiki , roughly 20 minutes later .
Sardina said the center was looking at Hilo Bay on Hawaii Island as a worst - case scenario right now .
“ The shape of the bay favors the waves gaining in height , ” he said in a telephone interview .
The last time a destructive tsunami struck Hawaii was on May 23 , 1960 , when much of downtown Hilo was destroyed and 61 people killed in the aftermath of a 9.5 magnitude earthquake off the west coast of South America , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Wave heights in Hilo Bay reached 31 feet .
But since then , tsunamis have largely been a no - show .
The last time civil defense officials ordered evacuations was in 1994 , prompting concern that some Hawaii residents may not take this event seriously .
The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center also said a tsunami advisory is in effect for the coastal areas of California , Oregon , Washington , British Columbia and Alaska from the California - Mexico border to Attu , Alaska .
A tsunami advisory means that a tsunami capable of producing strong currents or waves dangerous to persons in or very near the water is imminent or expected .
But significant , widespread inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory .
The Toyota show trials are more like an episode of Judge Judy than an actual investigation by Congressional committees .
Sitting in for the esteemed TV judge is a cadre of Democrats who 's interest in nailing Big Business and protecting union constituencies can barely be hidden behind a wall of teary witnesses and flimsy conspiracy theories .
Before members of Congress even questioned CEO Akin Toyoda , they gave lengthy statements that accused Toyota of hiding evidence of malfunctions and endangering drivers .
Then came the tear - jerking testimony of traumatized Toyota owners , the eleventh - hour departure of a Democratic congresswoman on the Committee after her connections to Toyota were publicized , and the incestuous analysis of auto journalists and consumer advocates .
Not heard was the testimony of certain automobile representatives , industry analysts , and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials who raised eyebrows at the hasty condemnation of the automaker while no less than two other carmakers have issued recalls at the same time – without any attention from the government or the public .
Just this week , both Hyundai and Chrysler recalled nearly half the number of cars Toyota has , but received about a millionth of the media attention .
“ It just seems like [ the response ] is totally blown out of proportion , ” said Brian Johnson , executive director for the Alliance of Worker Freedom .
“ Where were they when the millions of GM and Ford Explorers were recalled ? ”
Indeed , there were no hearings for GM or Ford in 2001 , or for the Hyundai or Chrysler recalls happening now .
There ’s only a hearing for Toyota .
And during it , Democrats were lining up to condemn the company for everything short of blowing up America .
“ Toyota all but ignored pleas from consumers to examine sudden unintended acceleration incidents [ SAIs ] .
They claim that they first became aware of sticking pedals in late October of 2009 , when in fact they received numerous complaints many months and years earlier , ” said Bart Stupak , chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee , during the investigation .
That ’s true , but as reported earlier , those complaints were hard to evaluate .
SAIs are frequently caused by careless or drunk drivers who misplace their feet – who are anything but eager to admit wrongdoing .
Stupak also did n’t mention the fact that 84 SAIs had been registered with Toyota , while the Chevy Cobalt was subject to a whopping 1,157 SAI complaints – without any action taken .
Yet Democratic lawmakers are raising the roof over what Toyota knew and when they knew it , an complicated by not only the ambiguousness of SAI complaints , but also cultural issues , said a former senior official at NHSTA .
Because Japan maintains ultimate authority over Toyota decisions , all NHSTA compliance negotiations must go through formal international meeting procedures .
American carmakers often negotiate compliances through ongoing , cooperative relationships with the NHSTA .
But the fact that Japan maintains tight control is also the reason automaker have become one of the most profitable manufacturers in the industry , supplying the U.S. with thousands of jobs .
“ Toyota employs over 35,000 workers in the U.S. , ” said Johnson .
“ The reason they ’re able to do this is because they ’re a highly efficient , non-unionized company ” – who ’s main business plan is worker independence .
Whether those jobs are the right kind for Democratic Congressional interrogators is yet another heated issue in this boiling debate .
Stupak , who is heading the Congressional inquiry , represents Michigan – the one state that stands to benefit most from the downfall of a foreign car company .
Sen. John Dingle ( D - Mich . ) , is also standing in for some questioning , along with Sen. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , an outspoken bailout advocate and Obama ally .
“ Waxman and Dingle are totally dragging Toyota through the mud on this .
There ’s a clear violation of the government ’s own non-compete clause , ” said Johnson , alluding to the recent $ 25 billion bailout of Detroit .
Johnson pointed out that Mr. Toyoda had three reasons to blame for SAI incidents : the driver , sticky pedals , and floor mats .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood – the man primarily responsible for the safety of American drivers – blamed sticky pedals and floor mats .
Yet Waxman called again and again for an investigation into the electrical issues with Toyota ’s acceleration systems .
If such electrical issues existed , it would be in the best interest of both Toyoda and LaHood to recognize it .
The PR fallout associated with highly - publicized , questionable business practices are worst possible scenario for a manufacturer of any kind .
The only way to avoid that is to play by the rules , and keep consumers safe .
Playing by the rules is Toyota ’s forte , and except for thirty - four fatalities – out of 37,000 fatalities on American roads last year – Toyota has kept consumers safe .
But during a screamy show trial , those kinds of facts tend to get lost .

While I 'm loathe to write a top - 10 list , if only for fear of falling short of Dave Letterman 's legendary bit , I 'm making an exception in this first week of 2010 -- a moment when we get to not only make New Year 's resolutions , but resolutions for the new decade .
As we make those prospective pledges , let 's take a moment to look back at the Top Ten Quotations from the last 10 years -- the ones telling us some painful truths about our country , society and worldview ; the ones that might inform us of what we need to do as we move forward :
10 . " They frankly own the place . " -- Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill. , in 2009 admitting the taboo about banks ' influence in Congress .
9 . " Have n't we already given money to rich people ... Should n't we be giving money to the middle ? " -- President George W. Bush in November 2002 , acknowledging to advisers that he knew his tax cuts were giveaways to the super - wealthy .
8. " Keep your government hands off my Medicare . " --
Anti-health care protester at an August 2009 congressional town hall meeting in South Carolina -- the single most succinct sign that our country has become an Idiocracy .
7 . " We did this for the show . " -- Falcon Heene on Oct. 15 , 2009 , telling CNN that the Balloon Boy chase was a hoax .
The declaration demonstrated that the media 's 24 - 7 knee - jerk sensationalism is irresponsible and proved that America 's culture of celebrity aspiration is completely out of control .
6 . " As we know , there are known knowns .
There are things we know we know .
We also know there are known unknowns .
That is to say , we know they 're some things we do not know .
But there 're also unknown unknowns ; the ones we do n't know we do n't know . " -- Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Feb. 12 , 2002 , effectively telling us that the government had no idea what it was doing by invading Iraq .
5 . " Bring 'em on . " -- President George W. Bush on July 2 , 2003 , daring al - Qaida to attack U.S. troops -- yet more proof that the elite defines " toughness " as politicians flippantly sacrificing young American lives for Washington 's hubristic ideologies .
4 . " The investment community feels very put-upon .
They feel there is no reason why they should n't earn $ 1 million to $ 200 million a year , and they do n't want to be held responsible for the global financial meltdown . " -- Daniel Fass , chairman of President Barack Obama 's financial - industry fundraising party on Oct. 19 , 2009 , insisting that despite wrecking the economy and then being handed trillions of bailout dollars , Wall Street is a victim .
3. " $ 500,000 is not a lot of money , particularly if there is no bonus . " -- Wall Street compensation consultant James Reda on Feb. 3 , 2009 , giving The New York Times a good example of just how totally out of touch the super - rich really are .
2. " I did n't campaign on the public option . " -- President Obama on Dec. 22 , 2009 , expecting the public to forget that his presidential campaign platform explicitly promised to pass health care legislation giving all Americans " the opportunity to enroll in new public plan . "
1 . " It does n't matter . " -- Vice President Dick Cheney on Nov. 5 , 2006 , referring to polls repeatedly showing the majority of Americans oppose the Iraq war -- a sign the ruling class truly does not care about the demands of the public .
These epigrams expose a nation that has internalized and accepted the forces of avarice , corruption , dishonesty , incompetence and insensitivity .
Some of them are darkly funny , some of them are gut - wrenchingly sad -- but all of them are warnings .
Whether we listen to them or not will be the difference between repeating the last decade 's folly or learning from it .
Here 's to resolutions for the new decade that finally choose the latter .

Striking workers occupied Total 's refinery in Dunkerque after management refused to meet an ultimatum over negotiations .
At least 150 workers stormed the buildings this morning , forcing their way past security guards and at one point using ladders to gain entry to the offices on the higher levels of the buildings .
Workers took the action after union demands for a mediator in negotiations and for the removal of security guards from the site were ignored .
Workers at the site have been on strike since January 12th .
The site has been closed since September due to " a structural and durable fall in the consumption of petroleum products " .
Fearing that Total would try to close the site altogether workers launched the strike and later the occupation .
The refinery employs 370 workers directly and a further 450 through sub-contractors .
The inter-union group at Total comprising CGT , CFDT , Sud and FO has called for a national strike on Wednesday and Thursday in support of the strikers in Dunkerque
Davis Calbet , a CGT member and spokesman for the occupiers said that they would no longer negotiate with the director nor the local human resources department who had repeatedly refused to meet them .
He stated " We will stay in these buildings until we have received what we are asking for .
We do n't want more blah - blah - blah ...
We wo n't budge until we have a response . "
He also stressed " We are n't crooks , it 's out of the question that we 'd damage our equipment .
We have been peaceful since the beginning of this action .
We are n't calling for violence . "

When the Turkish gendarmes came for Mugrditch Nazarian , they did not give him time to dress , but took him from his home in the dead of night in his pyjamas .
The year was 1915 , and his wife , Varter , knew that she was unlikely to see her husband alive again .
Armenian men like him were being rounded up and taken away .
In the words of their persecutors , they were being " deported " - but not to an earthly place .
Varter never found out what fate her husband suffered .
Some said he was shot , others that he was among the men held in jail , who suffered torture so unbearable that they poured the kerosene from prison lamps over their heads and turned themselves into human pyres as a release from the agony .
Heavily pregnant , Varter was ordered to join a death convoy marching women and children to desert concentration camps .
Scroll down for more ...
She survived the journey alone - her six children died along the way .
The two youngest were thrown to their deaths down a mountainside by Turkish guards ; the other four starved to death at the bottom of a well where they had hidden to escape .
Varter herself was abducted by a man who promised to save her - but raped her instead .
Eventually , she was released to mourn her lost family , the victims of Europe 's forgotten holocaust .
The killing of 1.5 m Armenians by the Ottoman Turks during World War I remains one of the bloodiest and most contentious events of the 20th century , and has been called the first modern genocide .
In all , 25 concentration camps were set up in a systematic slaughter aimed at eradicating the Armenian people - classed as " vermin " by the Turks .
Winston Churchill described the massacres as an " administrative holocaust " and noted : " This crime was planned and executed for political reasons .
The opportunity presented itself for clearing Turkish soil of a Christian race . "
Chillingly , Adolf Hitler used the episode to justify the Nazi murder of six million Jews , saying in 1939 : " Who , after all , speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians ? "
Yet , carried out under the cover of war , the Armenian genocide remains shrouded in mystery - not least because modern - day Turkey refuses to acknowledge the existence of its killing fields .
Now , new photographs of the horror have come to light .
They come from the archives of the German Deutsche Bank , which was working in the region financing a railway network when the killing began .
Unearthed by award - winning war correspondent Robert Fisk , they were taken by employees of the bank to document the terror unfolding before them .
They show young men , crammed into cattle trucks , waiting to travel to their deaths .
The Turks crowded 90 starving and terrified Armenians into each wagon , the same number the Nazis averaged in their transports to the death camps of Eastern Europe during the Jewish Holocaust .
Behind each grainy image lies a human tragedy .
Destitute women and children stare past the camera , witness to untold savagery .
Almost all young women were raped according to Fisk , while older women were beaten to death - they did not merit the expense of a bullet .
Babies were left by the side of the road to die .
Often , attractive young Armenian girls were sent to Turkish harems , where some lived in enforced prostitution until the mid-1920s .
Many other archive photographs testify to the sheer brutality suffered by the Armenians : children whose knee tendons were severed , a young woman who starved to death beside her two small children , and a Turkish official taunting starving Armenian children with a loaf of bread .
Eyewitness accounts are even more graphic .
Foreign diplomats posted in the Ottoman Empire at the time told of the atrocities , but were powerless to act .
One described the concentration camps , saying : " As on the gates of Dante 's Hell , the following should be written at the entrance of these accursed encampments : ' You who enter , leave all hopes . ' "
So how exactly did the events of 1915 - 17 unfold ?
Just as Hitler wanted a Nazi - dominated world that would be Judenrein - cleansed of its Jews - so in 1914 the Ottoman Empire wanted to construct a Muslim empire that would stretch from Istanbul to Manchuria .
Armenia , an ancient Christian civilisation spreading out from the eastern end of the Black Sea , stood in its way .
At the turn of the 20th century , there were two million Christian Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire .
Already , 200,000 had been killed in a series of pogroms - most of them brutally between 1894 and 1896 .
In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire entered World War I against the Allies and launched a disastrous military campaign against Russian forces in the Caucasus .
It blamed defeat on the Armenians , claiming they had colluded with the Russians .
A prominent Turkish writer at the time described the war as " the awaited day " when the Turks would exact " revenge , the horrors of which have not yet been recorded in history " .
Through the final months of 1914 , the Ottoman government put together a number of " Special Organisation " units , armed gangs consisting of thousands of convicts specifically released from prison for the purpose .
These killing squads of murderers and thieves were to perpetrate the greatest crimes in the genocide .
They were the first state bureaucracy to implement mass killings for the purpose of race extermination .
One army commander described them at the time as the " butchers of the human species " .
On the night of April 24 , 1915 - the anniversary of which is marked by Armenians around the world - the Ottoman government moved decisively , arresting 250 Armenian intellectuals .
This was followed by the arrest of a further 2,000 .

Some died from torture in custody , while many were executed in public places .
The resistance poet , Daniel Varoujan , was found disembowelled , with his eyes gouged out .
One university professor was made to watch his colleagues have their fingernails and toenails pulled
out , before being blinded .
He eventually lost his mind , and was let loose naked into the streets .
There were reports of crucifixions , at which the Turks would torment their victims : " Now let your Christ come and help you ! "
Johannes Lepsius , a German pastor who tried to protect the Armenians , said : " The armed gangs saw their main task as raiding and looting Armenian villages .
If the men escaped their grasp , they would rape the women . "
So began a carefully orchestrated campaign to eradicate the Armenians .
Throughout this period , Ottoman leaders deceived the world , orchestrating the slaughter using code words in official telegrams .
At later war crimes trials , several military officers testified that the word " deportation " was used to mean " massacre " or " annihilation " .
Between May and August 1915 , the Armenian population of the eastern provinces was deported and murdered en masse .
The American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , Henry Morgenthau , said : " Squads of 50 or 100 men would be taken , bound together in groups of four , and marched to a secluded spot .
" Suddenly the sound of rifle shots would fill the air .
Those sent to bury the bodies would find them almost invariably stark naked , for , as usual , the Turks had stolen all their clothes . "
In urban areas , a town crier was used to deliver the deportation order , and the entire male population would be taken outside the city limits and killed - " slaughtered like sheep " .
Women and children would then be executed , deported to concentration camps or simply turned out into the deserts and left to starve to death .
An American diplomat described the deportations or death marches : " A massacre , however horrible the word may sound , would be humane in comparison with it . "
An eyewitness who came upon a convoy of deportees reported that the women implored him : " Save us !
We will become Muslims !
We will become Germans !
We will become anything you want , just save us !
They are going to cut our throats ! "
Walking skeletons begged for food , and women threw their babies into lakes rather than hand them over to the Turks .
There was mass looting and pillaging of Armenian goods .
It is reported that civilians burned bodies to find the gold coins the Armenians swallowed for safekeeping .
Conditions in the concentration camps were appalling .
The majority were located near the modern Iraqi and Syrian frontiers , in the desert between Jerablus and Deir ez - Zor - described as " the epicentre of death " .
Up to 70,000 Armenians were herded into each camp , where dysentery and typhus were rife .
There , they were left to starve or die of thirst in the burning sun , with no shelter .
In some cases , the living were forced to eat the dead .
Few survived .
In four days alone , from 10 - 14 June 1915 , the gangs ' eliminated ' some 25,000 people in the Kemah Erzincan area alone .
In September 1915 , the American consul in Kharput , Leslie A. Davis , reported discovering the bodies of nearly 10,000 Armenians dumped into several ravines near beautiful Lake Goeljuk , calling it the " slaughterhouse province " .
Tales of atrocity abound .
Historians report that the killing squads dashed infants on rocks in front of their mothers .
One young boy remembered his grandfather , the village priest , kneeling down to pray for mercy before the Turks .
Soldiers beheaded him , and played football with the old man 's decapitated head before his devastated family .
At the horrific Ras - ul - Ain camp near Urfa , two German railway engineers reported seeing three to four hundred women arrive in one day , completely naked .
One witness told how Sergeant Nuri , the overseer of the camp , bragged about raping children .
An American , Mrs Anna Harlowe Birge , who was travelling from Smyrna to Constantinople , wrote in November 1915 : " At every station where we stopped , we came side by side with one of these trains .
It was made up of cattle trucks , and the faces of little children were looking out from behind the tiny barred windows of each truck . "
In her memoir , Ravished Armenia , Aurora Mardiganian described being raped and thrown into a harem .
From a wealthy banking family , she was just one of thousands of Armenian girls to suffer a similar fate .
Many were eventually killed and discarded .
In the city of Malatia , she saw 16 girls crucified , vultures eating their corpses .
" Each girl had been nailed alive upon her cross , spikes through her feet and hands , " Mardiganian wrote .
" Only their hair blown by the wind covered their bodies . "
In another town , she reports that the killing squads played " the game of swords " with young Armenian girls , planting their weapons in the ground and throwing their victims onto the protruding blade in sport .
Elsewhere , bodies tied to each other drifted down the Euphrates .
And in the Black Sea region , the Armenians were herded onto boats and then thrown overboard .
In the desert regions , the Turks set up primitive gas chambers , stuffing Armenians into caves and asphyxiating them with brush fires .
Everywhere , there were Armenian corpses : in lakes and rivers , in empty desert cisterns and village wells .
Travellers reported that the stench of death pervaded the landscape .
One Turkish gendarme told a Norwegian nurse serving in Erzincan that he had accompanied a convoy of 3,000 people .
Some were summarily executed in groups along the way ; those too sick or exhausted to march were killed where they fell .
He concluded : " They 're all gone , finished . "
By 1917 , the Armenian ' problem ' , as it was described by Ottoman leaders , had been thoroughly " resolved " .
Muslim families were brought in to occupy empty villages .
Even after the war , the Ottoman ministers were not repentant .
In 1920 , they praised those responsible for the genocide , saying : " These things were done to secure the future of our homeland , which we know is greater and holier than even our own lives . "
The British government pushed for those responsible for the killing to be punished , and in 1919 a war crimes tribunal was set up .
The use of the word " genocide " in describing the massacre of Armenians has been hotly contested by Turkey .
Ahead of the nation 's accession to the EU , it is even more politically inflammatory .
The official Turkish position remains that 600,000 or so Armenians died as a result of war .
They deny any state intention to wipe out Armenians and the killings remain taboo in the country , where it is illegal to use the term genocide to describe the events of those bloody years .
Internationally , 21 countries have recognised the killings as genocide under the UN 1948 definition .
Armenian campaigners believe Turkey should be denied EU membership until it admits responsibility for the massacres .
Just as in the Nazi Holocaust , there were many tales of individual acts of great courage by Armenians and Turks alike .
Haji Halil , a Muslim Turk , kept eight members of his mother 's Armenian family safely hidden in his home , risking death .
In some areas , groups of Kurds followed the deportation convoys and saved as many people as they could .
Many mothers gave their children to Turkish and Kurdish families to save them from death .
The Governor - General of Aleppo stood up to Ottoman officials and tried to prevent deportations from his region , but failed .
He later recalled : " I was like a man standing by a river without any means of rescue .
But instead of water , the river flowed with blood and thousands of innocent children , blameless old men , helpless women and strong young people all on their way to destruction .
" Those I could seize with my hands I saved .
The others , I assume , floated downstream , never to return . "
The Treasury may have made some silly paper " profit " on its bailout of Citigroup ( C ) but the taxpayer may not get much of anything .
The Washington Post reports that as part of the bank 's TARP payback agreement , it 's quietly been given a $ 38 billion tax break by the IRS .
Seriously .
The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued an exception to long - standing tax rules for the benefit of Citigroup and a few other companies partially owned by the government .
As a result , Citigroup will be allowed to retain billions of dollars worth of tax breaks that otherwise would decline in value when the government sells its stake to private investors .
While the Obama administration has said taxpayers are likely to profit from the sale of the Citigroup shares , accounting experts said the lost tax revenue could easily outstrip those profits .
So what specifically happened ?
Citigroup was required to replace its federal aid with an equal amount of money from private investors , more than any other bank .
The government concluded that Citigroup needed the IRS ruling because a reduction in the value of its tax breaks would have eroded its capital , forcing the company to raise more money , officials said .
Federal tax law lets companies reduce taxable income in a good year by the amount of losses in bad years .
But the law limits the transfer of those benefits to new ownership as a way of preventing profitable companies from buying losers to avoid taxes .
Under the law , the government 's sale of its 34 percent stake in Citigroup , combined with the company 's recent sales of stock to raise money , qualified as a change in ownership .
This is actually an issue that 's been talked about for a while .
Mike Mayo and Rolfe Winkler have been banging the drum on this , warning that the eorsion of these tax credits would eat into Citi 's coming quarterly earnings , big - time .
But apparently they did n't count on the generosity of Uncle Sam once again .

In all cases , the Senate report says , the banks ignored controls intended to prevent money laundering and related screens on PEP , meaning politically exposed persons  high - risk clients from corrupt countries .
The report recommends strengthening regulations against money laundering at banks and revoking exemptions for lawyers and other third parties from restrictions on money laundering in the USA Patriot Act .
It recommends that Congress pass laws requiring people who form corporations to disclose the true owners .
The report , brimming with bank statements and internal e-mail messages , contains four case studies .
“ Together , these four case histories demonstrate the need for the United States to strengthen its PEP controls to prevent corrupt foreign officials , their relatives and close associates from using U.S. professionals and financial institutions to conceal , protect and utilize their ill - gotten gains , ” it says .
The report details how Teodoro Nguema Obiang , the son of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo , the president of Equatorial Guinea , used lawyers , bankers , real estate agents and escrow agents , all Americans , from 2004 through 2008 to move more than $ 110 million into the United States , including $ 100 million through Wachovia and Citibank .
Sarah Palin apparently thinks we need some " divine intervention " in our politics , as if we have n't been Jesus 'd enough already by these clowns who do n't believe in the separation of church and state .
Not surprising since these great Tea Party " patriots " think the only " real Americans " are Christians .
I wish Palin ’s concern for the media criticizing those who inject religion into our politics was true .
Sadly it is just the opposite as we ’ve seen with the likes of the Tony Perkins and other hate mongers being allowed to weigh in on DADT and the abortion debate .
And someone tell me how easy it is for anyone who is an atheist to get elected ?
Or who ’s not a Christian for that matter ?
I do n’t know what world Palin is living in , but it does n’t resemble the one I ’ve been watching when it comes to those expressing their faith having any problems in the media or with getting elected .
That of course will never stop the likes of Palin from playing the religious victim card .
ORLANDO , Florida ( Reuters ) - General Motors
Co will talk to state and local governments to see what incentives might be available before deciding which shuttered U.S. plant it will reopen , North American president Mark Reuss said on Saturday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Reuss said last month that the No.1 U.S. automaker was looking at reopening shuttered assembly lines at Spring Hill , Tennessee or Janesville , Wisconsin , to resolve a short supply of hot - selling vehicles .
On Saturday , he told reporters attending the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Orlando , Florida that the company is “ still looking at which ( plants ) and how to do it .
“ And that would be a conversation that would not be just internal to GM but also to some of the states where those plants are , ” he said .
The Janesville and Spring Hill assembly lines are considered likely candidates to reopen because while they were closed last year as part of GM ’s bankruptcy , they do not belong to the so - called “ Old GM ” that remains in bankruptcy .
The “ New GM ” emerged from a U.S. government - financed bankruptcy in July .
GM is in short supply of some of its best - selling vehicles , including the Chevrolet Equinox , Buick LaCrosse , Cadillac SRX as well as full - size pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles like the Chevy Tahoe .
The automaker has about 390,000 vehicles in U.S. dealer lots , short of its targeted inventory in the range of 400,000 and 450,000 .
vehicles , U.S. sales chief Susan Docherty said .
Reuss said if a shuttered U.S. plant is reopen , it would operate in a more flexible , and innovative way .
“ What we want to do is something that may not be traditional in terms of how we do it and how we staff it and how we bring it on and off , ” he said .
Every day , the Internet enables more people to be narcissists in truly wonderful ways .
Now there 's a new site called failin.gs where you can learn how your " friends " really feel about you — anonymously !
It 's like formspring in reverse .
In the offline world , telling your friends what you really thought about them was a parlor game for high school Mean Girls ' slumber parties .
But instead of asking " what do my friends think of me ? " , failin.gs ' purported mission is " to answer that age old question that perhaps all of us have asked ourselves at some point in our lives : what is wrong with me ? " — which puts the burden on the individual , not their ( potentially shitty ) friends — which turns this into potentially just another exercise in online narcissism .
( Which is fine , since that was sort of why the Internet was invented , was n't it ? )
You create a profile and then people can leave " anonymous constructive criticism about your character . "
But you do n't really want to improve , do you ?
( Though I suppose this could come in handy for that guy in your office who does n't wear deodorant , the bane of advice columnists the world over . )
You really just want an excuse to read about yourself , no matter how crappy the " constructive criticism " might be .
There 's no way this site is n't going to be a massive success .
Barclays was not bailed out by the UK government during the financial crisis Barclays is preparing to pay bonuses to its staff of more than £ 2bn , the BBC has learned .
But the bank , which did not take any direct state help during the financial crisis , is expected to say it is paying out less than it normally would .
Barclays will reveal its full - year results on Tuesday and is expected to announce profits of about £ 10.3 bn for 2009 - up 70 % on the year before .
Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to pay out £ 1.3 bn in bonuses .
The rise in profits means there are still likely to be multimillion - pound handouts for Barclays ' top bankers .
Barclays is expected to pay out around £ 4.5 bn in total remuneration to the 23,000 investment bankers employed at its investment bank , Barclays Capital .
Both Barclays and RBS will say that they are responding to the public 's mood of unease ... and are showing " restraint "
The BBC's Robert Peston
Robert Peston 's blog Average pay for Barclays Capital 's 23,000 employees will be about £ 196,000 and just under half of this will be in the form of bonuses .
The large profits enjoyed by bankers prompted widespread public anger because they were widely perceived to have taken dangerous risks which led to the global recession .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said : " Bank chiefs insist they are paying out less of their revenues as bonuses than they normally do to show they are sensitive to the mood of the public . "
The semi-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland has " more or less agreed " with UK Financial Investments , which looks after the taxpayer 's controlling 84 % stake in the bank , that it will pay out £ 1.3 bn in bonuses , Robert Peston added .

This crazy and funny police chase happened in Orange County , California .
On the 241 highway .
And best of all , it was woman driving : DLOS ANGELES - A driver tried to ram a Long Beach car , prompting an hour - long , high - speed chase Friday in which the woman drove the car in circles , went the wrong way on a tollway and even got out of the car to gesture at officers , authorities said .
The woman was arrested after about a 40 - mile pursuit and could face charges of reckless driving , California Highway Patrol Officer Gabe Montoya said .
Her name was not immediately known .
No injuries were reported , but the woman endangered motorists on four freeways , CHP officers said .
The chase began when Long Beach officers went to an intersection shortly after 6 a.m. in response to a report of a woman screaming .
A car tried to ram their police cruiser three times and then fled , Long Beach police Officer Jackie Bezart said .
After an eight - minute chase through Long Beach , the driver got onto a freeway and the CHP was notified .
Officers chased the silver Scion into Orange County at speeds that sometimes topped 100 mph , authorities said .
Television news helicopters carried the chase live .
On the SR 241 tollway in Rancho Santa Margarita , the woman made " doughnuts " while driving on both shoulders of the road , briefly drove the wrong way then got out of the car and gestured with both hands at officers before returning to the slowly rolling vehicle and driving off .
A short time later a patrol car rammed the back of the Scion , spinning it around and knocking an attempt to stop it , but the driver managed to flee again .
The car finally was stopped at the end of the tollway in an unincorporated area near Rancho Santa Margarita .
After being bumped a second time , the Scion was boxed in and swarmed by officers , including one who jumped onto the roof .
The woman was pulled through the car 's window , forced to the ground and handcuffed .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict used his traditional New Year address on Friday to call on people to change their lifestyles to save the planet , saying environmental responsibility was essential for global peace .
Recalling that world leaders had gathered in Copenhagen last month for the U.N. climate conference , the pope said action at a personal and community level was just as important to safeguard the environment .
“ Nevertheless , in this moment , I would like to underline the importance of the choices of individuals , families and local administrations in preserving the environment , ” the Pope told the thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter ’s Square .
“ An objective shared by all , an indispensable condition for peace , is that of overseeing the earth ’s natural resources with justice and wisdom . ”
The pope , who had a scare last week when a woman with a history of mental problems knocked him down during Christmas Eve mass , also said “ ecological responsibility ” should be taught as part of the education syllabus .
The pope and his predecessor John Paul have put the Vatican firmly on an environmentalist footing .
Last month , in a message sent to heads of state and international organizations , the pope called on rich nations to acknowledge responsibility for the environmental crisis and shed consumerism .
SWITCH , the registry for .CH and .
LI domain names , enabled DNSSEC on day two of the annual Domain Pulse conference in Luzern yesterday .
SWITCH became the third ccTLD registry to enable DNSSEC giving registrants of .
CH domain names added security following .SE ( Sweden ) and .CZ ( Czech Republic ) .
The added security for internet users allows for a more secure internet , especially important for banks and other financial services providers , for example .
At the Domain Pulse conference , Urs Eppenberger of SWITCH and Marc Furrer of the Swiss Federal Communications Commission ( ComCom ) enabled DNSSEC .
Furrer said he was very pleased with the efforts of SWITCH to be playing a leading role in the implementation of more secure internet communications and commerce .
" I am particularly proud of the fact that Switzerland is one of the first countries in Europe to introduce DNSSEC .
This now guarantees security in the internet " said a delighted Marc Furrer , President of ComCom , in a statement .
Meanwhile DENIC is on schedule to prepare a test bed for registrars and this phase will run until 2011 , said Sabine Dolderer , the company 's CEO .
However nic.at will not be introducing DNSSEC in 2010 , said Richard Wein , CEO of nic.at .
Wein believes there is not yet the demand or the market for it in Austria ( . AT ) at the moment , but like DENIC , nic.at will be watching developments closely in the .
CH ccTLD closely .
Nic.at will be preparing for DNSSEC internally to have it ready for deployment when there is a demand .
Nic.at is also preparing an innovative business model to allow internet companies from registries , and in particular those planning to apply for new generic Top Level Domains ( gTLDs ) , registrars , banks and others demanding a high level of security , to use their infrastructure .
It is planned to have this finalised in the summer of 2010 .
Among other presentations included Steve Gobin from ICANN who spoke of the new Registrar Accreditation Agreement while Simon Kopp of Kantonspolizei Luzern spoke about Fit4 Chat website , an initiative of the Luzern canton 's police department to help parents and children deal with unwanted contact from strangers , and in particular older adults , online .
There was also a presentation on internationalised domain names ( IDNs ) from Leonid Todorov from the Coordination Centre for TLD RU who explained the difficulties for Russian users in having to use only Latin characters for domain names .
With a very small number of English speakers , especially in the more remote regions , and no adequate Latin / Cyrllic script translation , particularly relating to international trademarks , the introduction of IDNs will be of huge benefit to internet users in the country .
The 2011 Domain Pulse conference will be held in Vienna , Austria , from 17 to 18 February which will more or less coincide with the predicted one millionth .
AT domain registration milestone .
Videos and slides of all presentations , mostly in German , are available on the Domain Pulse website at Domain Pulse conference website although without simultaneous translations as occurred during the meeting .
I ’d like to start to apportioning more of this site to places that may not be as well - known in the mainstream .
That ’s not to say that there will only be a focus on obscure places .
But there is a bit of magic when your imagination starts getting revved up upon the discovery of fantastic new places .
Jaisalmer , commonly known in India as the “ Golden City ” , is located in western India near the border with Pakistan and covers a major part of the desert region of Rajasthan .
Situated in the heart of the Thar Desert , it was once at an important crossroads of camel caravan routes between India and Central Asia .
The “ Golden City ” is known for its ancient palaces , temples and proximity to sand dunes .
The city is said to be founded by Raja Rawal Jaisal , a Rajput ruler , in approximately 1156 A D. after his people fled from their homeland .
Legends say that he choose Trikuta ( three - peaked ) Hill as the new site for his fort , Jaisalmer Fort .
The fort ’s massive sandstone walls still stands and its 99 turrets continue to loom 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) above the town .
In medieval times , Jaisalmer was the focus of the region because of its location .
It falls in the way of one of the two routes , which connected India from Persia , Egypt , Africa and the West .
However , the the advent of shipping routes and the emergence of Bombay as India ’s capital led to its becoming a backwater once more and , fortuitously , led to the preservation of much of its architecture .
In the modern era , the rulers of Jaisalmer were the last among the Rajputana royals to sign the “ Instrument of Agreement ” with the British establishment in India .
In the year 1947 , the royals signed the agreement to remain in just independent India .
Since then it has developed itself into a major tourist destination as well as a cultural hub of the western India .
The landscape outside the city is desolate , but beautiful .
The majority of the population are descendents of the original settlers .
The city is dominated by the Jaisalmer Fort , which contains five interlinked palaces .
Unlike most forts in India , the Jaisalmer Fort is a living fort , as there are shops , hotels , old havelis ( homes ) and of course , tourists inside the fort area .

Irish diplomats were today investigating reports that two more Irish passports were linked to a team of assassins who murdered a senior Hamas official in Dubai .
Authorities in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) are believed to have identified a further two passport numbers allegedly used by suspects in the assassination of Mahmoud al Mabhouh last month .
It has also emerged that the address of a Dublin property owned by James Reynolds , the brother of former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and father of music promoter John Reynolds , was given to a hotel by one of five suspects using the fake documents .
A man travelling under the name of Kevin Daveron said he lived at 6 Elgin Road in leafy Dublin 4 .
Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs are liaising with staff at the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi to confirm the accuracy of reports .
" We are continuing to work closely with authorities in UAE and our EU partners to establish the facts about this case , " a spokesman said .
Hamas commander al - Mabhouh was killed by suspected agents from Israel .
Five forged Irish passports initially linked to the 18 strong hit squad were found in the Emirate with authentic numbers but names which did not match .
However , Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Israel 's Ambassador to Ireland , Dr Zion Evrony , have both told the Irish Government they have no information about the killing or the forged documents .
Clones of passports belonging to six British Israelis were also among those used by the team of assassins .
The documents were among European identity papers revealed by police as blame for the assassination centred on agents from Israel 's Mossad secret service .
Fine Gael called on Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin to brief the Dail on the details of the case urgently .
Billy Timmins , the party 's foreign affairs spokesman , said : " The Minister for Foreign Affairs must start getting explanations as to how suspects in an assassination overseas were able to use valid Irish passport numbers on fake passports and provide a bona fide Dublin address when checking out of a hotel . "
He added : " The Irish passport has great standing internationally and the minister must do all he can to ensure its status is not debased .
" The illegal use of an address is also a worrying development in this matter . "
Elsewhere , Labour 's Proinsias De Rossa called on the Irish Government to press the EU to put on hold current proposals to upgrade relations with Israel .
" The stealing of Irish citizens ' identities and the abuse of Irish passports by another state is a gross infringement of Irish sovereignty , " said the Member of the European Parliament .
" It is not the normal practice for friendly states to abuse each other 's sovereignty in this way .
" One can only assume that Israel either has no regard for international law or holds Ireland and the other EU states affected in contempt . "
Dr David Lanby , chairman of the Ireland - Palestine Solidarity Campaign , said : " The Israeli denial of involvement in the Dubai assassination has been wholly unconvincing and more a case of ' if you can't prove it , then we wo n't admit it ' .
" Israel is treating the international community with contempt . "

The past decade has seen a lot of bloated special - effects brain - sucks ... but it 's also seen some of the best science - fiction films ever .
Superhero films came of age , apocalypses ruled , and interstellar adventures came back .
Here are the decade 's 20 greatest .

This is , of course , just our opinion , and feel free to disagree in comments .
We went back and forth about several of these films , and there were a few others that we almost included instead , so we 're not claiming infallibility here .

Pitch Black .
This is nearly the perfect movie — a gritty anti-hero with weird eyes that can see in the dark is on a prison ship , which crashes on an alien planet .
The lurking monsters are ominous and alarming , but the film 's real mystery is Riddick himself — the Furyan inspires loathing , hero - worship and a desperate longing for the anti-hero to become a hero by the movie 's end .
Like Riddick 's own eyes , our view of him only really works when we see him through total darkness .

I 'm going to post my review of this film in a few days , closer to its actual release date .
But this is definitely one of the decade 's most significant science - fiction films , both in its startling new look and in its elaborate alien world .
Sigourney Weaver is one of the few heroic scientists we 've seen in movies lately , and she fearlessly spouts facts about the science of Pandora .
Avatar is by no means a perfect movie — it 's a frustrating mixture of brilliance and utter cheese — but it 's clearly an important movie in science - fiction history .

Slither .
This movie sort of slid ( I 'm tempted to say slithered ) under the radar , but it 's one of the great all - time alien possession movies , and a brilliant metaphor for being trapped in a bad marriage .
An alien parasite lands in a small town and takes over a woman 's awful husband — and then it starts infecting everyone else in town , so that they all speak with the husband 's voice .
Wherever the wife goes , she hears her husband talking to her .
And then people start getting grotesquely pregnant with alien offspring — this sort of thing is really why body horror was invented .

Star Trek .
A young hero reluctantly starts to claim his true destined greatness ... only to find out that his whole life has been altered , and maybe wrecked , by time - traveling , tattooed maniacs from the future .
It 's a weird spin on a Star Trek movie , but considering how hard it was to imagine being thrilled by another Trek after Nemesis , this film is a marvel .
Plot holes , frat - boy antics , " red matter " and all , it 's still the film that recharged Star Trek and may have helped bring back space - opera as a genre .
And Spock has never been so ... fascinating .

Donnie Darko has garnered an enduring cult fan base , for good reason .
Its blend of mysicism and weird physics has aged amazingly well , and we still get lost in its " tangent universes . "
We keep hoping Richard Kelly will make another film that 's both as mind - blowing and as well - constructed as this one .

Robot Stories .
Another great movie that did n't get enough props when it came out .
Greg Pak , who went on to write the Planet Hulk storyline for Marvel Comics , creates an anthology of three stories about robots that show how much robots are connected to our emotional lives — and what will happen when robots get emotions .
In one story , two office robots fall in love , only to find that robot love is forbidden .
In another story , a mother becomes determined to help her dying son amass the perfect collection of robot action figures — at any cost , even stealing .
You 'll see robots in a whole new light after watching this film .

Spider - Man 2 .
There were a number of superhero films that managed to bring the greatness of comics ' storylines to life in the first half of the decade , including two X - Men movies and two Spider - Man movies .
For my money , though , this is the best of the bunch , particularly because of Alfred Molina 's Doc Octopus .
Peter Parker 's superpowered angst collides with Doc Octopus ' cyborg identity crisis , and both hero and villain seem to be clinging to their identities by a thread .
Even though we wish Peter Parker could keep his damn mask on , it 's still thrilling and maybe the most perfect straight - up superhero movie of all .

Sleep Dealer .
Alex Rivera 's look at the dark side of telecommuting is one of the most memorable and intense films we 've seen lately .
In the future , everything depends on the dollar — you can't even access water reservoirs in Mexico or speak to your family in another town without feeding dollars into a slot .
And the only way to get dollars is to get cyber nodes all over your body , allowing your nervous system to pilot machines in the United States .
That way the U.S. can import Mexican labor without bringing in actual Mexicans .
It 's beautifully filmed and harrowing look at the ultimate form of alienated labor .

The Incredibles .
The other great straight - up superhero movie was one of several Pixar films that we wanted to pay tribute to from the past decade .
If you were as disappointed as we were by the two Fantastic Four films , then rejoice that this film does the FF right .
A surprisingly light - hearted look at super - mutants in a world that learns to fear them , this movie does a better job of portraying what makes superhero comics so awesome than almost any live - action film .
And we love the Omnidroid .

The Host .
Sorry , Cloverfield — this was the monster - rampage movie we loved from the past few years .
Unlike Clovey , the Host actually has a decent if snarky origin story , including weird chemicals dropped in the water by a callous American , causing one of the local creatures to get a little too big ( and rambunctious ) for comfort .
More than almost any other monster movie , this film sucks us into caring about its main characters , a hapless family who operate a failing fast - food stand on the beach — we laugh at their antics and then get hopelessly , tragically , wound up in their fate when they tangle with the monster .
Rob and Hud just do n't quite measure up .

28 Days Later .
Purists may hate this film's " fast zombies , " but they 're not even really zombies — they 're the victims of a " rage " virus that stupid animal - rights activists cause to be released onto an unsuspecting world .
Of all the apocalyptic scenarios we 've seen in the past decade , 28 Days provides the best dose of terror and the sheer horror of society unraveling .
When Christopher Eccleston 's vicious soldier says the words , " I promised them women , " your gut sinks .
And the idea that the rage - virus outbreak will cure itself because the quasi-zombies will starve is genuinely clever .
We were tempted to include Danny Boyle 's other great SF film of the decade , Sunshine , but 28 Days is clearly better .

Trippy , insane and mind - expanding , this is a film you need to watch more than once .

Primer .
Speaking of films you need to watch more than once ... few , if any , science - fiction movies talk down to their audiences less than this one .
You do n't even realize , for a good chunk of the movie , that the geeky characters are building a time machine .
and it comes with very realistic and fascinating limitations , even as it allows the main characters to cross their own timelines over and over again , rewriting history in more and more psychotic ways .
The walkman scene makes the whole thing worthwhile , just by itself .

It 's interesting how many of the great science - fiction movies of the past decade are about loneliness , one way or the other — but none of them delve into isolation as hauntingly as Duncan Jones ' debut feature .
Sam Rockwell is amazing as the two versions of Sam Bell , who 's tantalizingly close to finishing out his contract on a lunary mining station — until he finds out that things are n't ever what they seem .
Add paranoia to the list of things this film does better than almost any other .

Iron Man .
As we wrote when this film came out , it 's actually more of a cyborg narrative than a superhero one .
Jon Favreau and company wisely chose to focus on the heart of Tony Stark 's origin — literally , the fusion reactor that keeps his heart from stopping , and turns him into a part - machine badass whose armor is just a shell that goes over his cybernetic body .
Tony Stark 's uneasy relationship with the military technology that he created parallels his unease with his new technological body — he 's like the heroic flipside of Spider - Man 2's Doctor Octopus .
And yes , any movie that talks about our dependence on , and unease with , technology automatically gets to leap over the pile of by - the - numbers superhero films .

The Dark Knight .
See here for our argument as to why this film really is science fiction .
Shorter version : Batman 's fantastical technology is at the heart of the story .
If Batman Begins showed how Bruce Wayne used technology to become Gotham 's fearsome crime - fighter , then The Dark Knight is about how far he 's willing to take that approach in the face of a mad bomber .

District 9 .
Most science - fiction movies , you come out of furiously debating the science or the finer points of the storyline ... but this one , people walked out of speechless and shellshocked .
Perhaps the ultimate " humans oppress aliens " movie , this film confronts us with a perfect allegory of our own inhumanity , through the story of a crashlanded group of aliens who are forced into shantytowns .
Even before the main character , Wikus , starts turning into one of the aliens , our loyalties are getting more and more divided .

Wall - E. The other Pixar movie we could n't help including on the list , this may have been the greatest blend of post - apocalyptic dystopia and cute robots .
The love between Wall - E and Eve is both lovable and genuinely moving , and the trademark Pixar humor is in full effect with Wall - E's junkyard slapstick and spaceship antics .
The funniest , and maybe the best , robot uprising we 've ever seen .

Serenity .
Just pretend for a second that this was n't the continuation of a beloved TV series , and that Joss Whedon had created a whole new universe from scratch just for this film — it would still be one of the most audacious , most memorable , science - fiction films of all time .
The story of the Alliance , which maintains a tenuous grip on a sprawling star system after a brutal civil war , and the lengths to which the Alliance will go to try and make people " better , " Serenity is one of the great action - adventure films as well as one of the neatest SF concepts ever .
When you discover the secrets of Miranda and see how River Tam becomes both the messenger and the avenger of Miranda 's people , it 's hard not to jump up and down in your seat .

How far are you willing to go to get over a lost love ?
Are you willing to injure yourself — by erasing a huge chunk of your brief time on this planet from your own mind — just to get back at your former lover ?
This Charlie Kaufman / Michel
Gondry joint does what all the best science fiction does : it creates a fictional technology that has the potential to change who we are as people , and then it uses it to tell a deeply personal story .
The scenes where Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wandering through Carrey 's childhood memories are both unsettling and poignant , as Carrey tries to hold on to the love he was in the process of throwing away — by letting her into more of his mind .
This week , data from NASA 's Cassini probe has shed light on a couple of the stranger features of Saturn , providing answers to questions that were raised years ago .
In terms of the planet itself , Cassini has spotted strange hexagonal patterns in the clouds near the north pole that were observed for the first and only time 30 years ago , when the Voyager probes swung by the planet .
And researchers have used Cassini data to produce what they think are satisfying models for the strange coloration of Saturn 's moon Iapetus , something that was first noted over three centuries ago — by Cassini himself .
First , Iapetus , which would look like a fairly typical moon if it were n't for a rather distinctive feature : the face that leads it around its orbit is about 10 times darker than its trailing face .
This difference is so pronounced that Cassini himself reported it all the way back in 1677 — both of today 's papers about the moon cite his paper in the the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society ( volume 12 , page 831 , for those inclined to look it up ) .
In Arthur C. Clarke 's book 2001 : A Space Odyssey , the moon 's bright side was created by an alien civilization as a way of drawing the attention of any intelligent life .
Two papers that are being released by Science today offer a more mundane ( but still rather exciting ) explanation for the differences between the leading and trailing sides : like our own moon , Iapetus has a water cycle .
Previous explanations for the discrepancy have focused on the fact that the dark portion of the moon is on its leading edge , suggesting that its orbit brought it in contact with debris knocked loose by impacts on some of Saturn 's outer moons .
The next moon inward is Titan , with a large gravity and atmosphere that should be sufficient to ensure that no other moons in the system get a similar paint job .
The problem with this explanation is the slow rate of accumulation of this debris ; objects hit Iapetus ( referred to as " impact gardening " ) frequently enough that the surface should be regularly mixed .
The new papers modify this model significantly .
Dark debris landing on Iapetus ' leading edge are important , but only because they create a temperature difference that triggers the real cause of the brightness difference : a water cycle .
Because Iapetus keeps one face directed towards Saturn , its rotational period — a Iapetian day — takes nearly 80 Earth days .
That means the dark material remains in sunlight long enough to create a temperature difference .
Cassini registered temperatures of 129 K on the dark side , and 113 K on the bright side .
That 's enough to drive the sublimation of water at much higher rates on the dark side .
Over time , that will gradually drive the water ice to the bright side , enhancing and stabilizing the brightness , and hence the temperature difference .
The authors point to craters on the dark side with bright patches on their rims as evidence that exposure to sunlight is a key factor .
A mathematical model of the system suggests that Iapetus only has to accumulate 0.3 cm of dark material per billion years to drive this sort of behavior , and that a dramatic leading / trailing difference becomes visible after 1.2 billion years .
The authors of the modeling paper actually discovered that they were n't the first to suggest this .
Someone more or less got it right back in 1974 , and successfully predicted observations that were n't reported until 2008 .
Unfortunately , the paper had been overlooked .
Saturn also held another mystery that has confounded for decades rather than centuries .
The Voyager probes went past the planet during its northern hemisphere 's spring , which allowed them to image the planet 's north pole .
They apparently observed a strange hexagonal pattern in the pole 's clouds .
Shortly after , spring ended , and nobody was sure if the pattern is a long - term feature of the atmosphere , or simply a one - off oddity that we were lucky to catch .
It 's springtime again , 30 years later , and Cassini was in orbit around Saturn , ready for further observations .
And , as sunlight crept northwards , the hexagonal patterns were still present .
The NASA press release quotes Ars contributor Kunio Sayanagi as saying , " The longevity of the hexagon makes this something special , given that weather on Earth lasts on the order of weeks .
It 's a mystery on par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long - lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter . "
Fortunately , Cassini has instruments that are significantly improved from the ones that shot past on the Voyagers , and is remaining in orbit around the planet , which would enable its path to be tweaked in order to get a better look at the feature .
Hopefully , this will mean that we wo n't have to wait 300 years in order to produce a decent model of the processes that generate these hexagonal cloud patterns .

As my colleague Robert Worth reported , Dubai ’s police chief said on Monday that an 11 - person team of trained killers with European passports carried out the mysterious assassination of a senior Hamas official last month in a Dubai hotel .
In addition to releasing the names and photographs of the 11 suspects , the chief , Lt. Gen .
Dahi Khalfan al - Tamim , told reporters that security camera video obtained by his investigators showed the team at work in Dubai in the hours leading up to the assassination in a luxury hotel last month .
On Tuesday , a newspaper Web site in Dubai published the video released by the authorities , which appears to show the suspects following the Hamas official , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh ; changing into disguises ; and spending a lot of time on the second floor of the hotel where the murder took place .
The video , embedded below , was edited by the Dubai police and includes titles that explain their interpretation of the movements of the 11 suspects before , during and after the assassination .
Readers with less time may want to watch this video report from Al Jazeera , which includes key portions of the footage and shows some of the news conference at which it was presented .
Britain ’s ITN News reported that the victim ’s brother blamed the Israeli intelligence service Mossad for the assassination .
In a report from Dubai , Alex Thompson of Britain ’s Channel 4 News said that authorities there are so outraged by the assassination plot that they have sworn to issue a warrant for the arrest of Israel ’s prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , if the killing can be traced back to Mossad .
On Tuesday , Emirates News Agency reports , Dubai issued international arrest warrants for the 11 suspects , who all traveled with European passports that appear to have been forged .
Ireland ’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that three of the suspects said to have used Irish passports do not exist , The Irish Times reported .
The ministry added that the passport numbers were obviously fake , since they had the wrong number of digits and contained no letters , as genuine Irish documents do .
According to Julian Borger and Adam Gabbatt of The Guardian , “ British officials said today that the British passports used by six suspects in the assassination of a Hamas ­commander in Dubai were forgeries , and that the suspected assassins are not British nationals . ”
German officials told The Associated Press that the number on a passport used by a suspect named Michael Bodenheimer , who traveled to Dubai from Frankfurt and left for Hong Kong three hours after the killing , was too short .
The French foreign ministry told AFP on Tuesday that it was “ not able to confirm the nationality ” of the one suspect said to have used a French passport .
AFP also reports that Dubai police said they are questioning two Palestinians in connection with their investigation .
Dubai ’s police chief said that both men are residents of the United Arab Emirates who “ fled to Jordan ” after the killing and were extradited three days ago .
In Israel , a man with the same name as one of the suspects identified by the Dubai police as a British national who was a member of the team told Reuters that his identity must have been stolen .
Speaking in British - accented English , Melvyn Adam Mildiner , resident of a town near Jerusalem , told Reuters he had nothing to do with the assassination and had never been to Dubai .
“ I woke up this morning to a world of fun , ” he said in a sarcastic tone , after Israeli newspapers splashed names and photos of the suspects distributed by Dubai .
“ I am obviously angry , upset and scared — any number of things .
And I ’m looking into what I can do to try to sort things out and clear my name , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , Yossi Melman observed that the actions of the 11 suspects shown on the security camera footage were similar to methods apparently used by Israeli intelligence agents .
Mr. Melman wrote :

Watkins and her friend got out of the car and confronted the man over the parking spot .
Witnesses state the argument soon turned into a physical fight .
Watkins somehow managed to stab the man a half dozen times with a 5 - inch ice pick !
He is now in the hospital with a punctured kidney .

New report suggests inaction on climate change a major threat to food prices
The impact of extreme weather events on food prices overshadow the ‘ modest increases ’ expected under the proposed CPRS or even more ambitious emissions trading schemes , The Climate Institute briefing paper ‘ Food Prices and Emissions Trading ’ – released today – suggests .
Droughts and other extreme weather events , which are on the rise , have recently increased grocery shopfront prices for lamb by almost 60 per cent and tripled the price of bananas , the think tank noted .
UK and Australian analysis of emissions trading schemes , meanwhile , found average grocery prices would face significantly smaller rises .
“ Hysterical claims by some politicians and business lobbyists of food prices sky - rocketing because of action on climate change that limits and prices carbon pollution are just not supported by publically available , credible evidence , ” Climate Institute CEO John Connor asserted .
“ Making big polluters pay through an emissions trading scheme , as part of a global effort , is the best way to manage the risks of climate change and the threat it poses to food prices and farming productivity .
“ What all the credible research shows is that farmers , consumers and producers will be hit hardest in the hip pocket by the impacts of climate change – not by policies that limit and price the carbon pollution through an emissions trading scheme . ”
Mr Connor added that a major commitment to reducing carbon emissions must be viewed as a solution rather than a problem by the food sector .
“ The last quarter of 2009 saw fruit prices rise 16 % because of poor growing conditions and those conditions will get tougher and ultimately near impossible in our Murray Darling foodbowl if global warming gets over 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels , and especially if it approaches 4 degrees , ” he said .
The Garnaut Report warned that unmitigated climate change would all but wipe out farming in the Murray Darling Basin by the end of the century and called for global efforts including Australia reducing 2000 carbon pollution levels by 90 % by mid-century .
“ As the International Energy Agency recently highlighted , a global effort to reduce carbon pollution will keep a lid on petrol price rises by pushing back the date when global oil supplies peak – another reason why we need to make our polluters pay and for us to join global efforts , ” Connor remarked .
“ The conclusion is pretty stark for farmers , food producers and consumers alike – an emissions trading scheme is affordable , climate change is not . ”
Last week , Australia ’s leading representative of food and beverage manufacturers urged the government to match the plans of other developed economies rather than go it alone on their own scheme – with industry concerned about the global competitiveness of the sector if higher costs are imposed on them .

The Vancouver Sun is reporting that our friend and colleague Andrew Koenig ’s body was found today in Vancouver ’s Stanley Park .
Our thoughts are with his family and friends .
Our friend Andrew Koenig , the video producer for Never Not Funny , has n’t been seen in nearly a week .
Here ’s what mutual friend Dave Holmes has to say :
HAS ANYONE SEEN HIM ?
Andrew Koenig ( AK - 47 , the video guy on “ Never Not Funny , ” and “ Boner ” from “ Growing Pains ” ) has been missing for a week , last seen 2/14 in Vancouver .
Did n’t make his flight back to the US on 2/16 .
The Vancouver Police are involved , and lots of people are looking .
Could you reblog this and help get the word out ?
And say some prayers or think some positive thoughts ?
Andrew is a super , super good guy , and we ’re thinking of him and his family .
If you ’re in the Northwest , please keep your eyes out , and no matter where you are , please share this news .
Andrew was last seen near Vancouver ’s Stanley Park .
He is 5 ’ 5 ″ tall , and weights 135 pounds .
If you ’ve seen Andrew since February 14th , or have any helpful information , PLEASE call Vancouver authorities @ 604-717-2967 or 604-717-2534 .
Refer to case # 202029519 .
Andrew ’s father Walter has posted about the disappearance on his own site .
Here ’s a message to Never Not Funny listeners from hosts Jimmy Pardo and Matt Belknap .
In addition to working with Andrew , Jimmy is married to Andrew ’s sister , Danielle .
Contrary to previous reports by Radar Magazine , formerly linked here , there has not been any new electronic evidence of Andrew ’s activities since he went missing .
Here is the text of the VPD ’s press release ( find the latest releases here ) , as of February 24th :
Andrew Koenig was last seen on February 14th at a friend ’s house in the area of Main Street and 25th Avenue .
When he did n’t return home to Los Angeles on the 16th , his family and friends became concerned and reported him missing .
Vancouver Police Missing Persons investigators canvassed all the cafes and restaurants in the south Vancouver neighbourhood where he was last seen , showing Andrew ’s photo and seeking information .
When they learned that Andrew , who once lived in Vancouver in the early 90s , loved walking in Stanley Park , Mounted Police and park rangers were notified .
Constable Tim Fanning says investigators followed up all possible leads before going public with the case , as it ’s considered a very private matter .
On February 23rd , 30 members of local Search and Rescue teams scoured the park for over four hours , which consists of 1000 acres and 150 miles of trails .
There has been no evidence that Andrew was recently in the park .
Walter Koenig , Andrew ’s father , made an emotional plea directly to his son today .
“ I just want to know you ’re okay .
If it means you just want to stay here , that ’s okay .
You do n’t have to come back .
Just let us know that ’s your intention . ”
Both parents acknowledged their son ’s emotional state , which Walter said has been a lifelong struggle .
“ It has not prevented him from being a participant in his community and a conscientious activist . ”
Andrew ’s mother , Judith , also reached out to her son , believing he is probably in a very depressed state .
“ Andrew , there is help .
You have so many gifts to offer this world and so much yet to do in this world .
Look how many people love you and care about you . ”
The family has been touched by the outpouring of concern for Andrew ’s safety and happiness and they are asking people to look out for him and get the word out that he ’s missing .
“ You are loved , you count and you matter , ” says Judith .
Anyone with information is asked to call 604-717-2540 begin_of_the_skype_highlighting 604-717-2540 end_of_the_skype_highlighting .
If Andrew is sighted , call 911 or if you ’re outside of Vancouver , contact the local police .
California ’s largest for - profit health insurer violated state law more than 700 times over a three - year period by failing to pay medical claims on time and misrepresenting policy provisions to customers , the state ’s insurance commissioner said Monday .
Anthem Blue Cross of Woodland Hills could face fines of up to $ 7 million stemming from the alleged violations from 2006 to 2009 .
Commissioner Steve Poizner said the insurer repeatedly failed to respond to state regulators in a “ reasonable time ” as they investigated complaints over the last year .
“ We believe there is evidence to suggest there are serious issues with how Anthem Blue Cross pays claims , ” Poizner said at a Sacramento news conference .
“ Most disturbing to us is that they do n’t even respond ” to the Department of Insurance “ in a timely way . ”
Anthem ’s parent company , WellPoint Inc. , said it had n’t seen the enforcement action but would cooperate fully with Poizner to resolve the matter “ in the best interests ” of its policyholders .

“ We take the issues raised by Commissioner Poizner very seriously , ” the Indianapolis company said in a statement .
“ As the largest insurer in California , our responsibility is to pay the many millions of claims on behalf of our members each year fairly , fully and promptly .
“ While this review represents a small fraction of those claims , it is nonetheless very important to us to make sure we take any corrective action that may be necessary . ”
WellPoint and Anthem have faced intense criticism from consumers , regulators , members of Congress and the Obama administration over rate hike proposals of as much as 39 % for customers with individual policies in California .
Lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington are holding hearings this week on the increases , which have been postponed until May 1 amid the outcry .

The rate hikes would affect many of the 800,000 individual policyholders in California .
Anthem is not the only company facing scrutiny over the way it pays claims .
Poizner ’s office filed a similar complaint against Cypress - based PacifiCare in January 2008 .
Officials said at the time that they had uncovered 133,000 violations of state laws and regulations over payments for medical care .
That case is pending , Poizner said Monday .

Nearly 40 % of the violations in the Anthem case , 277 , stem from allegations that the company failed to pay patient claims within 30 days as required by state law , officials said .
Poizner ’s office filed the enforcement action against Anthem on Monday with the Office of Administrative Hearings .
An administrative law judge will hear the matter .
Each violation carries a maximum penalty of $ 10,000 .
“ Over the next several months , we hope to bring this case to fruition , ” Poizner said .

Analysing the impact of the Fed ’s mortgage - backed securities purchase
Johannes Stroebel , John Taylor
Should the Fed scale back its ownership of mortgage - backed securities ?
This column analyses the effect of the programme on mortgage interest rates .
Controlling for prepayment and default risk suggests the programme has had little or no impact , and that the Fed could gradually cut the size of its portfolio without a significant impact on the mortgage market .
There is an ongoing policy debate about when and at what speed the Federal Reserve Bank should reduce its portfolio of mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) .
The MBS purchase programme was set up with an initial limit of $ 500 billion , was later expanded to $ 1.25 trillion , and is about to expire at the end of the first quarter of 2010 .
At its meeting in mid-December 2009 , the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it was continuing its MBS purchases at a “ gradually slowing pace . ”
However , the minutes from that meeting reveal a disagreement among the board members with respect to the need for continuing the programme :
“ A few members [ … ] observed that it might become desirable at some point in the future to provide more policy stimulus by expanding the planned scale of the Committee 's large - scale asset purchases and continuing them beyond the first quarter , especially if the outlook for economic growth were to weaken or if mortgage market functioning were to deteriorate .
One member thought that the improvement in financial market conditions and the economic outlook suggested that the quantity of planned asset purchases could be scaled back , and that it might become appropriate to begin reducing the Federal Reserve 's holdings of longer - term assets if the recovery gains strength over time . ”
An important input to this discussion involves an empirical assessment of the impact of the MBS purchase programme .
The programme was introduced with the explicit aim of reducing mortgage interest rates ( Board of Governors , 2008 ) , so an empirical analysis of whether this has been achieved is required .
Another longer - term question is whether such price - keeping operations ( Fisher , 2009 ) should be a regular part of monetary policy in the future .
Brian Sack , who runs the trading desk at the New York Fed , argued in a recent speech that they should be ( Sack , 2009 ) .
Conventional wisdom suggests that the MBS purchase programme has successfully contributed to the reduction in mortgage interest rates throughout 2009 .
Figure 1 shows that at the same time as the Fed ( and the Treasury , which ran a smaller purchase programme ) increased their holdings of mortgage - backed securities , the primary and secondary mortgage market spreads declined .
1
Ben Bernanke consequently claimed as early as January 2009 that “ [ … ] mortgage rates dropped significantly on the announcement of this programme and have fallen further since it went into operation . “
More recently , he concluded that : “ The Federal Reserve ’s agency debt and mortgage - backed securities purchase programmes stabilised the functioning of private secondary mortgage markets during the height of the financial turmoil .
These actions also provided significant benefits to primary mortgage markets ” ( US Senate , 2009 ) .
A similar optimism about the success of the programme was expressed by Sack ( 2009 ) .
Figure 1 . Mortgage spreads and stock of MBS purchases
It is likely , however , that other factors – beyond the Fed ’s MBS purchases – have also affected mortgage interest spreads .
In particular , movements in prepayment risk and default risk should impact the yields on MBS , and consequently the primary mortgage rate .
A question that needs to be considered is whether movements in prepayment risk and default risk that contributed to the increase in mortgage spreads in 2007 and 2008 can also explain their decline in 2009 .
The first factor we consider that impacts the yields of MBS is the prepayment risk .
Mortgage - backed securities are structured products that are collateralised by residential mortgages .
Most of these mortgages entail a prepayment option , allowing the borrower to prepay the mortgage at any time prior to the maturity of the loan .
Yields of mortgage - backed securities need to be adjusted upwards to compensate the holder of the MBS for this prepayment risk , which can vary over time and is driven by factors such as the implied volatility of interest rates .
We control for the prepayment risk in the underlying mortgages by considering the effect of the MBS purchase programme on the swap option - adjusted spread , which is regularly used by MBS traders and investors .
The option - adjusted spread is the yield - spread of the MBS over a term - structure of alternative interest rates after controlling for the value of the prepayment option .
More details on the calculation of the option - adjusted spread can be found in Windas ( 1996 ) .
The other factor that affects MBS pricing is the default risk .
Since we are considering yields on MBS insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the default risk is related to the default risk of the underlying mortgages as well as to the potential of the insuring Government - Sponsored Enterprise being unable to meet its guarantee obligations .
We control for default risk in our regressions by using spreads on senior and subordinated agency debt .
In an alternative specification , we also instrument for these spreads using housing market and credit market indicators .
This is necessary to ensure that yields on Government - Sponsored Enterprise debt were not primarily driven by the simultaneous ( albeit smaller ) intervention of the Fed in the agency debt market .
Since MBS guarantees rank pari passu to senior bonds , we believe that the spreads of agency senior and subordinated debt to Treasuries capture the default risk of agency - insured MBS well .
New evidence on the impact of the MBS purchase programme
When we control for the impact of prepayment risk and default risk on the option - adjusted spread , we find that that the MBS purchase programme has not had a consistently large or statistically significant effect on mortgage spreads .
Our results can be summarised as follows ( see Stroebel and Taylor 2009 for more details ) :
Using conventional option - adjusted spreads constructed by using a LIBOR swaps term - structure to control for prepayment risk , we find that the MBS programme has had no significant effect on mortgage spreads .
Movements in prepayment risk and default risk explain virtually all of the movements in the option - adjusted spreads .
In particular , the decline in the option - adjusted spreads that occurred during the period of the MBS programme can be better explained by a general decline in default risk .
We use Figure 2 to illustrate this finding .
It shows the development of the Swap option - adjusted spreads in blue .
The red series shows the predicted Swap option - adjusted spreads using the agency debt spread ( a measure of default risk ) .
Movements in default risk explain the movement in Swap option - adjusted spreads very well .
The residual between the actual and the predicted Swap option - adjusted spreads series , shown in green at the bottom of the graph , indicates that there is little left for the Fed ’s MBS portfolio to explain .
Figure 2 . Residual analysis of swap option - adjusted spreads
If one uses an alternative measure of the option - adjusted spreads based on the Treasury yield curve , a somewhat more significant effect on mortgage spreads — about 30 basis points — can be detected .
This is illustrated in Figure 3 by the downward - shift in the residuals in Q3 / Q4 2009 , around time of the start of the Treasury ’s MBS purchase programme and the announcement of the Fed ’s programme .
However , even with this measure , the volume of purchases appears to have no effect over and above the mere existence of the programme .
It is interesting to observe that as the volume of MBS held by the Fed and Treasury grew to $ 1000 billion , the residual did not become more negative – the expansion of the MBS purchase programme does not appear to have lowered mortgage spreads , beyond the initial downward shift .
Figure 3 . Residual Analysis of Treasury - OAS
We also estimate the impact using indirect methods to control for prepayment risk ( by controlling for the implied volatility of interest rates ) .
The results generally confirm the analysis using option - adjusted spreads , but shows somewhat larger effects in the secondary market .
The impact of the programme on primary market spreads ranges from the wrong sign and insignificant to around 30 basis points .
For secondary market rates the estimated impact is in the 30 to 60 basis point range .
This corresponds to a less than full pass through of any impact to primary mortgage spreads , the rate paid by the home - buyer .
This suggests that a portion of any reduction in funding costs contributed to the profit margin for lenders .
If our estimates hold up to scrutiny , they raise doubts about price - keeping operations such as the MBS purchase programme and suggest that the Fed could gradually reduce the size of its portfolio without a significant impact on the mortgage market .
Footnotes
1 The primary market mortgage rate series comes from Freddie Mac ’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey .
The secondary market mortgage is the Fannie Mae MBS 30 Year Current Coupon .
The spreads are created by subtracting the yield on 10 - year Treasuries from both series .
The maturity difference between these series captures the fact that most 30 - year mortgages are paid - off or refinanced before their maturity .

Now I am probably not telling you anything new in this title , but when I saw this op - ed by William Kristol in his Weekly Standard magazine ( hat tip to Matt Y ) , I just suddenly got this pounding headache and resulting furious reaction .
In areas where policies are still being debated -- in foreign policy in particular -- conservatives need to keep urging Obama to do the right thing .
We are disgusted with Obama 's irresoluteness on Afghanistan .
But we continue to urge that he side with the experienced military leaders he 's been fortunate to inherit against the second - guessing of political hacks ( and of failed ex- generals turned political hacks ) .
We conservatives want American soldiers to win wars , American interests to prevail , and American principles to flourish .
We want the bad guys to lose .
We 're happy to work with President Obama to defeat them -- and we only wish he shared our clarity and urgency about accomplishing that task .
That is to say , Obama should only listen to active duty generals like Petraus ( USCENTCOM ) , Odierno ( Iraq ) , and McChrystal ( Afghanistan ) , not " failed ex-generals turned political hacks " such as former generals Karl Eikenberry ( US Ambassador to Afghanistan ) and James Jones ( National Security Advisor ) .
The latter have , of course , counseled caution before engaging deeper into Afghanistan .
To be more specific , the Republican political line seems to be " yeah , we always do what our generals tell us to do - so long as their statements support indefinitely continuing the wars in the Middle East . "
What a ridiculous little man he is .
As far as Kristol 's other statement - he wants American soldiers to win wars and American interests to prevail - I really want to haul back and punch him hard in the stomach .
If you cared one iota about the American soldier , you slime , you base villain , you would have been pestering the CheneyBush administration as to its inability to put adequate numbers of American troops into Iraq and Afghanistan and its refusal to grow the military force to the numbers required for a long post - war occupation .
Now we have military families breaking up , military suicide rates going ever upward , promotions for any officer with a pulse , military modernization programs on hold because of mounting operational costs , and a trillion - dollar bill that was never adequately planned for , largely due to the CheneyBush administration 's inability to close the deal after eight years of continued combat .
You clearly have no respect for the American soldier or for American interests .
In fact , if you were working directly against the American soldier and American interests , you could not be doing a better job .

Explanation : Another moon of Saturn has been imaged in detail by the Cassini spacecraft .
Orbiting Saturn since 2004 , the robotic Cassini got its closest look yet at Saturn 's small moon Prometheus last week .
Visible above in an unprocessed image from 36,000 kilometers away , Prometheus ' 100 - km long surface was revealed to have an interesting system of bulges , ridges , and craters .
These features , together with the moon 's oblong shape and high reflectivity , are now being studied to help better understand the history of Prometheus and Saturn 's rings .
Prometheus is one of the few shepherd satellites known , as its gravity , along with its companion moon Pandora , confines many smaller ice chucks into Saturn 's F Ring .
Cassini's next major targeted flyby is of the moon Rhea on March 2 .
How being vegetarian does more harm to the environment than eating meat
Switching from British - bred beef and lamb to imported meat substitutes such as tofu increases the need for cultivated land
It is a claim that could put a dent in the green credentials of vegetarians : Meat - free diets can be bad for the planet .
Environmental activists and vegetarians have long taken pleasure in telling those who enjoy a steak that livestock farming is a major source of harmful greenhouse gases .
But research has shown that giving up meat may not be as green as it seems .
The Cranfield University study found that switching from British - bred beef and lamb to meat substitutes imported from abroad such as tofu and Quorn would increase the amount of land cultivated , raising the risk of forests being destroyed .
Production methods for meat substitutes can be energy intensive and the final products tend to be highly processed , the report , which was commissioned by the environmental group WWF , found .
The researchers concluded : ‘ A switch from beef and milk to highly refined livestock product analogues such as tofu could actually increase the quantity of arable land needed to supply the UK .
Donal Murphy - Bokern , one of the report ’s authors and a former co-ordinator at the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs told the Times : ‘ For some people , tofu and other meat substitutes symbolise environmental friendliness but they are not necessarily the badge of merit that people claim . ’
But Liz O’Neill , of the Vegetarian Society , said : ‘ If you ’re aiming to reduce your environmental impact by going vegetarian then it ’s obviously not a great idea to rely on highly - processed products . ’
A spokesman for the WWF said it was important to remember that livestock produce large amounts of methane , a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .

Sharadashram Vidyamandir school has been rocked by Shushant Patil 's death
A writer once said that more than one soul dies in a suicide .
It seems so in Neha Sawant 's home .
The atmosphere in the tiny flat in Mumbai has been lifeless since the 11 - year - old was found hanging from her apartment window .
It has been weeks but her parents are still in deep shock .
They look dazed and sleep - deprived .
Neha 's distraught grandmother said in a broken voice : " Our brains are not working .
We still cannot believe it . "
Neha , at 11 , must be one of the youngest in Mumbai to commit suicide .
Figures suggest that more and more teenagers in India 's financial hub are killing themselves .
Dizzying
Inexplicably , teenage suicides have become an almost daily occurrence in Maharashtra - one of India 's most developed states - and its capital Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
Something has gone amiss in [ children 's ] lives quite early and suicides are a manifestation of that
Clinical psychologist Rhea Timbekar
The toll of teenage suicides from the beginning of the year until 26 January 2010 stood at 32 , which is more than one a day .
While there are no comparative figures for the same period in 2009 , there is a consensus among the concerned authorities in Mumbai that teenage suicides are spiralling out of control .
There is also a general agreement between psychologists and teachers that the main reason for the high number of teenagers taking their own lives is the increasing pressure on children to perform well in exams .
The scale of this largely preventable problem is dizzying - both in India with its billion - plus people and particularly in the state of in Maharashtra .
More than 100,000 people commit suicide in India every year and three people a day take their own lives in Mumbai .
Suicide is one of the top three causes of death among those aged between 15 and 35 years and has a devastating psychological , social and financial impact on families and friends .
' Needless toll ' World Health Organisation Assistant Director - General Catherine Le Gals - Camus points out more people die from suicide around the world than from all homicides and wars combined .
" There is an urgent need for co-ordinated and intensified global action to prevent this needless toll .
For every suicide death there are scores of family and friends whose lives are devastated emotionally , socially and economically , " she says .
The children do n't realise they have more avenues than academic successes
School principal Mangala Kulkarni
In Mumbai the authorities are so alarmed by the scale of the problem that they have began a campaign , Life is Beautiful , which aims to help students cope with academic pressure .
Psychologists visit government schools in Mumbai once a week to train teachers dealing with students ' problems .
Sharadashram Vidyamandir school boasts illustrious alumni such as cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli .
It has been holding parent - teacher assemblies where parents can receive tips on tackling the pressures children face .
And yet such sessions could not prevent 12 - year - old Shushant Patil 's death .
He was found hanging in the school toilet on 5 January .
Mangala Kulkarni is the principal of the girls ' section of the school .
She says that ultimately families need to be more proactive when it comes to stopping students from feeling stressed .
" The children do n't realise they have more avenues than academic successes .
They need to be made to realise this by their families from childhood , " she said .
Blockbuster A helpline in Mumbai , called Aasra , has been operating for several years to tackle the problem .
The director of the helpline , Johnson Thomas , says the problems today 's children face are manifold : " They have peer pressure , they have communication problems with their parents , broken relationships , academic pressure and fear of failure , " he says .
Classes to help vulnerable teenagers are now being held
The home ministry estimates that for every teenage suicide in Mumbai there are 13 failed attempts .
One theory behind the recent rise is the influence of a recently released Bollywood blockbuster , Three Idiots , which has a scene where an engineering student is shown committing suicide after a mediocre exam result .
The film 's impact has been debated and scrutinised in prime time television shows , with many directly blaming it for adding to the problem .
But Mumbai clinical psychologist Rhea Timbekar argues that it would be wrong to blame the film , which she says strives to explain that parents should not put too much pressure on their children .
Ms Timbekar says that she recently met a child who had not eaten for four days .
The child 's parents said they were upset with him because he only got 89 % in exams and stood third in the class , compared to coming first in previous years .
" Such parents need to be counselled , " she asserts .
Ms Timbekar said that another explanation for the high teenage suicide rate was " copycat suicides " where children read about suicides in newspapers and decide to do the same thing themselves .
' Extreme steps ' Dilip Panicker , an eminent psychologist in Mumbai , says that pressure of exams is alone is too simplistic an explanation .
It 's hoped that young people will have a brighter future " At one level school pressures and expectations from parents are a valid reason , " he says , " but that 's always been there .
" In fact , parents used to beat up their kids in our time .
What 's changed is that today children are more aware , they have more exposure .
They are more independent .
So they blame themselves for failures and take extreme steps . "
Psychologists also argue that the definition of a teenager needs to be revised in 2010 .
" Today 's 11 - year - olds are the new teens .
What we did at the ages of 14 and 15 children can do at 11 today , " says Rhea Timbekar .
She demolishes the theory that children are more likely to be spontaneous in committing suicide , as opposed to adults who start with an idea , proceed with a plan and end with action .
" A child does n't just wake up in the morning and says I will commit suicide today , " she argues .
" Something has gone amiss in their lives quite early on and suicides are a manifestation of that . "
The breakdown of India 's traditional family system is also being blamed for the problem .
In a city like Mumbai - where it is common for both parents to work - children tend to become reclusive and watch too much television .
Dilip Panicker argues that there is a simple solution .
" If parents love their children unconditionally , with all their successes and failures , the problem would be greatly alleviated . "

OREM --
Orem police have tracked down a man suspected of raping a woman he met last week in a bar .
They say he gave the woman a pill that caused her to lose consciousness .
Detectives arrested the man Wednesday night .
The alleged victim says she invited the man to her apartment and was persuaded by him to take a pill , which he claimed would help her sleep .
" After taking the pill , she does n't really remember anything , " says Orem Sgt. Craig Martinez .
The last thing she remembers is waking up a few hours later in her bedroom with this man sexually assaulting her .
Then after that , she does n't remember anything for several hours ; and she does wake up , she was undressed . "
The 24 - year - old woman is from Orem .
Detectives discovered the pill she was given was Seroquel , commonly used to treat bipolar patients .
When combined with alcohol , the drug 's side effects can be dramatically increased , and police say it caused the woman to sleep for more than eight hours .
Detectives say the woman now regrets trusting the man and taking the pill .
" You should n't take pills or anything from people , one , you do n't know and , two , you do n't know what it is , " Martinez said .
" She had no idea what she was taking .
She had no idea what it was going to do to her , and now she is paying that price . "
Police followed several leads on the man , and discovered Wednesday he was living at a motel in Provo .
Jason Christensen , 26 , was arrested on charges of rape and distribution of a prescription .
Christensen has been booked into the Utah County Jail .
He is waiting $ 10,000 bail .

Ente
Last time I checked the score it was Iran 5 — International Community 0 .
It is with much amusement that I now note the Iranians have managed to bag another goal against the international community .
The achievement here on the part of Iran is not that Iran has responded formally to the stix - and - karats proposed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council + 1 ( the nokhodi is Germany that has allusions of grandeur ) .
The achievement on the part of the Iranian establishment is that it said it was going to respond on August 22 and it stuck to the date of August 22 to give its response .
The Iranian atomic czar , the light - complexioned Mr. Larijani ( let ’s hear it for the shomali everywhere ! ) summoned the ambassadors of the 5+1 ( the pouting US was represented by Switzerland ) to the palace and in a regal gesture sent them back to their offices with a document containing Iran ’s non-responses to the aspects of the proposal .
It is a delicious irony that the Iranians , who are notorious for being late and unpunctual , to demonstrate such sense of time .
That cultural shift itself might be in the long run more important than any accomplishment that atomic enrichment could possibly garner for the Iranian psyche .
Also noteworthy is that the formalities took place in Tehran — not Geneva , or Vienna or New York , the institutional venues of Western hegemony and neo-colonial imperial structures peddled as necessaries of “ peace and security . ”
Iran handed its response on its turf , on its terms and at the time of its own choosing and , no less , in Farsi — and so , Iran 6 — International Community ( still ) 0 .
After many weeks of saying to the world that the US will not accept anything short of suspension of enrichment activities prior to start of negotiations , John “ the shaggy dog ” Bolton stated on August 22 that the US will study carefully the Iranian response !
Excuse me , am I missing something here — what is there to study , bozo ?
On August 21 the Supreme Leader of the Resolute Nation in Tehran declared that Iran will not give up enrichment and fuel - cycle technology and will continue this stuff with vigor .
What is there to study ?
The US has Iran ’s answer — which is a big fat bilakh (! ) c moslam ( buttered ) as the Russian version goes .
The condition of no pre-condition , brilliant !
Iran ’s non-response — all of its 23 pages — was delivered in Farsi .
You ’ve got to love it —
If biding for time is what Iran needs in order to master this cascade stuff and other technical matters , this submission in Farsi was genial .
I can only imagine the long debates that will now ensue because of the lousy translations that the various translators in US / UK , France , Russia , China and Germany will furnish — making Tehran object to the errors and misunderstandings and other such time - consuming and indeterminate linguistic pursuits .
Take , for example , the Iranian Supreme Leader ’s statement the other day about Iran pursuing its nuclear program with vigor .
The jackass in Tehran or somewhere else who translated this statement made it sound like Iran will be pursuing its program “ forcefully . ”
These are not isotopic difference .
There is a ton of elemental difference between the two words — the word “ forceful ” sounds militaristic , unnatural and obnoxious .
Anyway —
The time from now until August 31 will be an eternity for the Bush - league architects of America ’s kaka - diplomacy .
As President Bush stated with masterful yet mumbling oratory at his press conference the other day , on the 31st the US will get together with others in the Security Council to deal with the issue !
Great , more sitting down , getting up , lying sideways , spooning Chirac , massaging Angela , yo - yoing with Tony “ the Pretty Boy ” Blair and dickering with the Orientals — Russians and Chinese !
All that sitting around may or may not produce a sanctions resolution to isolate Iran diplomatically and pressure it economically !
Wait a minute — are these not the very conditions that have been imposed on Iran for the last 25 years or so ?!
You mean to tell me that there were things that the US did not prohibit ?
I am shocked , shocked , I tell you !
If the Iranians survive the additional sanctions and isolation ( which they will , out of sheer spite if not nerve ) , the Iranians will emerge from all this with a shitload of other self - reliant achievements that will baffle the West even more !
Maybe they will tunnel under the forever Persian Gulf and walk off with the Black Stone of Kaba .
The progression of Iran ’s geostrategic emergence today will lead to its becoming the central power in the next ideological “ ism ” as yet to be named .
What the West does not get is that the Iranian appeal cannot be analyzed or dismissed in terms of the tired old cliché of sectarian differences as to Shiite versus Sunni , or the national / cultural differences as to Arab versus non-Arab , or Islam versus Judeo - Christianity , or even international rivalries like US versus Iran , Iran versus Saudi Arabia , etc .
Iran ’s appeal today is the universal theme of friendship , lending a hand , standing up against the bully and for the oppressed .
Was n’t that a long time ago America ’s own appeal .
It is a shame all that has happened to all of that American moral authority .
Folks this contest will not end in a miraculous comeback by the international community , tying the score or going ahead , or going into overtime and ten winning by penalty kicks .
The sides are playing two different sports — the Iranians are playing volleyball and the West is playing dodgeball .
The contest has an asymmetrical moral imperative —
Iran is playing for honor and self - determination and the West is playing for unmitigated imposition of its self - righteous will .
I will not be surprised at all if in the final analysis the Iran Nuclear Enrichment Case ends up before the International Court of Justice — maybe even on Iran ’s own motion .
After all , is it not the job of the Court to decide if any international laws are being broken by Iran over this issue ?
Of course not !
Silly me —
It is the job of the President of the United States to be the judge , jury and executioner in the international system and it is the job of the Poodle - Four +
Tofailis to go headlong into another disaster of untold consequences .
