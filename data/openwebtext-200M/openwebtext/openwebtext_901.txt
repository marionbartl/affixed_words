Michael Harold Lynch was ticketed for doing 54 mph in a 35 mph area that was also a construction zone .
The fine was $ 206 .
Lynch decided to let his anger flow by placing $ 206 in a plastic bag , peeing in the bag and sending it in .
Upon receiving Lynch 's little care package , the courthouse staff gave it to a police officer and declined to accept the pungent payment to clear the ticket .
Turns out Lynch did n't break any laws – it's not necessarily illegal to mail bodily fluids .
The pee-and - pennies were sent back to Lynch – COD , in fact – with a note that said they could n't be taken because " the pile of coins emitted a strong , pungent odor of stale urine . "
Lynch responded by sending a check made out to another agency , which was returned , then he sent a check for the wrong amount .
Now he's on the hook for $ 271 because his payment is late .
We wonder what he has in store forround 2 ... [ Source : Oregon Live
Updated Sun Microsystems ' rocky relationship with open source over Java is again in the spotlight , after it lost support of two influential groups for the latest update to enterprise Java .
The Apache Software Foundation ( ASF ) has voted against Java Enterprise Edition ( Java EE ) 6.0 to register its protest in a long - running dispute over licensing of test compatibility kits ( TCKs ) with spec- lead Sun .
It 's the first time Apache has voted against a pending Java spec , having voted for both Java EE 5.0 and Standard Edition ( SE ) 6.0 in the past .
Abstaining from the Java EE 6.0 vote was SpringSource , home of the ever - popular Spring open - source Java framework .
SpringSource blamed a process of " design by committee " that it said had led to the inclusion of new and untested features that risked introducing breaking changes to enterprise Java .
Other , closed - source companies taking part in the Java Community Process ( JCP ) vote who said " yes " qualified their support .
Enterprise giant SAP called for more work on a " single consolidated and extensible " component model instead of the current three : EJB , JSF and JSR 299 .
Apache - home of the ever - popular web server - was the only one of 16 JCP members to vote " no " on the Java EE 6.0 spec , though .
Java EE 6.0 is the long - awaited update to the EE platform used by Oracle , Sun , IBM and relied on by organizations like Eclipse and SpringSource .
Geir Magnusson Jr , Apache 's JCP representative , told The Reg JCP members have few avenues to disagree with Sun , so a " no " vote was the only option open .
Apache voted against the spec because it said Sun - the spec lead - has breached the terms of the JCP 's Java Specification Participation Agreement ( JSPA ) , by inserting terms into the licensing of the all - important TCKs that limit uptake of Java .
Magnusson said he 's forbidden from revealing what the licensing agreement is , but that Apache cannot pass on another company 's terms and conditions in its own license .
It 's the latest chapter in a long - running disagreement between Sun and ASF over TCKs .
Magnusson published an open letter to Sun chief executive Jonathan Schwartz in 2007 that asked for a TCK license that complied with JSPA .
Magnusson claimed today , as the did two years back , that Sun 's refusal to change its licensing terms is damaging Apache 's Project Harmony , an open - source implementation of Java SE .
Harmony had a modular , OSGi implementation in Java SE before Sun 's official Java SE .
Without a TCK , Apache cannot prove Harmony complies to Sun 's Java specification , meaning people will shy away from using it .
" Sun 's doing tremendous damage to the project , " Magnussen said .
It looks like Sun 's rigorous stance is hurting the one thing the company holds so dear , anyway : compatibility .
Google 's Android uses Harmony 's class libraries .
SpringSource , meanwhile , said while the Java EE 6.0 was a move in the right direction with the inclusion of a " web profile " - hence the " abstain vote " rather than " no " vote - the final spec had departed from its original vision of being lightweight .
The concern is that particularly during the last six months a significant number of dependencies were added to the web profile that increased its size .
Another problem was the addition of unproven technologies in Java Specification Request ( JSR ) 299 that risk causing more harm than good , with the introduction of breaking changes .
Johnson called it a classic case of design by committee instead of building something real - world users would want .
The inclusion of untried features had raised a " red flag . "
" We feel there 's too much new and unproven stuff we think is unproven - in part the light - weight variant to EJB that 's never been seen in the wild , " Johnson said .
The Java EE spec is now finished and is now simply awaiting implementation by Java vendors .
SpringSource senior vice president of engineering and product management Peter Cooper - Ellis told The Reg the company is evaluating the spec and would only implement the parts " that make sense . "
Sun was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press . ®

Was the viral contamination intentional ?
Why it all suddenly makes sense
Or was it just an innocent mistake ?
Oops !
Why a global pandemic is only a matter of time
Important Resources
( Natural News )
There 's a popular medical thriller novel in which a global pandemic is intentionally set off by an evil plot designed to reduce the human population .
In the book , a nefarious drug company inserts live avian flu viruses into vaccine materials that are distributed to countries around the world to be injected into patients as " flu shots . "
Those patients then become carriers for these highly - virulent strains of avian flu which go on to infect the world population and cause widespread death .
There 's only one problem with this story :
Or , at least , the part about live avian flu viruses being inserted into vaccine materials is n't fiction .
It 's happening right now .
Deerfield , Illinois - based pharmaceutical companyhas just been caught shippingmixed with vaccine material to medical distributors in .
The " mistake " ( if you can call it that , see below ... ) was discovered by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada .
The World Health Organization was alerted and panic spread throughout the vaccine community as health experts asked the obvious question :
How could this have happened ?
As published on LifeGen.de ( http://www.lifegen.de/newsip/shownews.php4?g... ) , serious questions like this are being raised :
Or , put another way , , sending deadly viral samples around the world .
If you mail an envelope full of anthrax to your Senator , you get arrested as a terrorist .
So why is Baxter -- which mailed samples of a far more deadly viral strain to labs around the world -- getting away with saying , essentially , " Oops ?
" But there 's a bigger question in all this :
How could this company havemixed LIVE avian flu viruses ( both H5N1 and H3N2 , the human form ) in this vaccine material ?
The shocking answer is that .
Why ?
Because Baxter International adheres to something called ( Biosafety Level 3 ) - a set of laboratory safety protocols that prevent the cross-contamination of materials .
As explained on Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level... ) :" Laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents , and are supervised by competent scientists who are experienced in working with these agents .
This is considered a neutral or warm zone .
All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices , or by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment .
The laboratory has special engineering and design features .
" Under the BSL3 code of conduct , it isfor live avian flu viruses to contaminate production vaccine materials that are shipped out to vendors around the world .
This leaves only two possibilities that explain these events : : Baxter is n't following BSL3 safety guidelines or is so sloppy in following them that it can make monumental mistakes that threaten the safety of the entire human race .
And if that 's the case , then why are we injecting our children with vaccines made from Baxter 's materials ? :
A rogue employee ( or an evil plot from the top management ) is present at Baxter , whereby live avian flu viruses wereinto the vaccine materials in the hope that such materials might be injected into humans and set off a global bird flu pandemic .
It just so happens that .
Although some naive people have a hard time believing that corporations would endanger human beings to make money , this is precisely the way corporations now behave in America 's ethically - challenged free - market environment .
( Remember Enron ?
Exxon ?
Merck ?
DuPont ? Monsanto ?
Need I go on ? )
Make no mistake : Spreading bird flu is a clever way to create demand for bird flu vaccines , and we 've all seen very clearly how drug companies firstand then " leap to the rescue " by selling the solution .
( Disease mongering of ADHD , bipolar disorder , etc. ) Until today , I would not have personally believed such a story .
I personally thought talk of bird flu vaccines being " weaponized " was just alarmist hype .
But now , in light of the fact that LIVE bird flu viruses are being openly found in vaccine materials that are distributed around the world , I must admit the evidence is increasingly compelling that something extremely dangerous is afoot .
Baxter , through either its mistakes or its evil intentions , just put .
Given all the laboratory protocols put in place to prevent this kind of thing , it is difficult to believe this was just a mistake .
There is some speculation , in fact , that the 1918 influenza pandemic , which killed up to 50 million people worldwide ( http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&rlz=1C... ) , was intentionally started by injecting servicemen with " experimental " flu vaccines that actually contained live , " weaponized " flu material just like the material being distributed by Baxter today .
Examine the historical record .
You 'll find that the 1918 flu originated with servicemen .
Even more interestingly , There is no single point of origin with the 1918 flu .
It appears to have " spontaneously " sprung up across multiple cities all at once , including a military base in Kansas .
( Kansas ?
Yep .
So how did it get to Kansas in an era when air traffic was virtually non-existent ?
Vaccines , of course ! )
All those cities and servicemen have one thing in common :
Flu shot vaccinations given to them by the military .
If you put the pieces together on this , it 's not too difficult to suspect thatto catalyze outrageous profit - taking or power grabbing agendas .
A desperate , infected population will gladly give up anything or pay anything for the promise of being cured .
But for the skeptics who dismiss any such talk of conspiracy theories , let 's examine the other possibility :
That a global avian flu pandemic was nearly unleasheddue to the outrageous incompetence of the companies handling these viral strains .
As we just saw , this is a very real possibility .
Had this live bird flu virus not been detected , it could have very easily found its way into vaccines that were injected into human beings .
And this , in turn , could have unleashed aIf the drug companies making and handling these materials are so careless , then it seems like .
And that leads to essentially the same scenario : A global pandemic , widespread death , health care failures and a desperate population begging for vaccines .
So either way -- whether it 's intentional or not -- you essentially get the same result .
I am on the record stating that a global pandemic is only a matter of time .
The living conditions under which humans have placed themselves ( crowded cities , suppressed immune systems , etc. ) are ideal for the spread of infectious disease .
But I never dreamed drug companies could actually beby contaminating vaccine materials with live avian flu viruses known to be highly infectious to humans .
This , it seems , is a whole new cause for concern .
You can believe what you will .
Maybe you agree with the nefarious plot theory and you agree that corporations are capable of great evils in their quest for profits .
Or perhaps you can't accept that , so you go with the " accidental contamination " theory , in which your beliefs describe a very dangerous world where biohazard safety protocols are insufficient to protect us from all the crazy viral strains being toyed with at drug companies and government labs all across the world .
In either case , We are like children playing God with Mother Nature , rolling the dice in a global game ofwhere the odds are not in our favor .
With companies like Baxter engaged in behaviors that are just begging to see the human race devastated by a global pandemic wipeout , it might be a good time to question the sanity of using viral strains in vaccines in the first place .
Vaccine - pushing scientists are so proud of their vaccines .
They think they 've conquered Mother Nature .
Imagine their surprise when one day they learn they have actually killed 100 million human beings by unleashing a global pandemic .
We came close to it this week .
A global pandemic may have just been averted by the thinnest of margins .
Yet people go on with their lives , oblivious to what nearly happened .
What 's inescapable at this point is the fact that the threat of a pandemic that looms for all of human civilization , and that drug companies may , themselves , be the source of that threat .

The current buzz around my home state of Montana is whether or not the Guantanamo Bay prisoners , should that facility actually close , be moved to the Two Rivers Authority in Hardin , Montana .
Wow !
Many feathers have been ruffled , politicians are spewing threats and the debate is getting heated .
Since there are two distinct sides to this argument , let me preface my remarks by explaining the dual dynamic at work concerning this hot issue .
First and foremost , one should understand that the town of Hardin , Montana ( population 3,400 ) is at the heart of this dilemma .
The Two Rivers Authority located there was completed in July , 2007 at a cost of $ 27 million dollars and has remained empty since that time .
Rocket science is not necessary here to figure out why the owners and Executive Director of this facility , Greg Smith , and the town " leaders " are pursuing prisoners ; any prisoners !
Mr. Smith actually made the very bootlicking - like statement : " I think it 's our duty at times to help the President if he believes he wants to do this .
We believe we have a facility we think can help .
I think the law enforcement people can be up to the task .
We would share the concern that we would want the public to be safe .
Obviously , we live in the community as well . "
A more self - interested position could not be taken here , but at least the " we want to help " line is easily seen through by most everyone in the state .
It wo n't be a surprise to anyone to learn that since this jail is completely empty , and has been since its inception , that its construction loans are now in default .
Imagine that ?
This is apparently what got the city council 's butt in gear to lobby the new president .
The other side of this farcical argument of course is the political element .
What a chance for the state 's " representatives " to grandstand and spew anti-terrorist rhetoric .
Both sides of the aisle are in rare form .
U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg R-Mont. said , " Whether or not the Obama Administration calls them terrorists , that 's exactly what these Guantanamo prisoners are .
( He apparently knows this without benefit of evidence ) .
We should be doing everything possible to keep them out of our country , let alone our state . "
Senator Jon Tester D- Mont. released a statement saying , " If these prisoners need a new place , it 's not going to be anywhere near the " Last Best Place . "
Max Baucus D - Mont. , our senior senator , had a more measured tone when he said , " It 's a security risk that I do n't think we want to have .
It 's just not the right thing to do .
Now clearly we have to help those folks in Hardin in finding some other solution to this , but I do n't think the Guantanamo prisoners should come to Montana .
That 's not a good thing to do . "
This last part sounds like a bribe in the making to me , or at least some sort of bailout proposition , but who am I to question the good intent of a U.S. Senator ?
With all the state in a rage , no one to my knowledge has yet bothered to ask about the well - being or legal rights of these prisoners .
No one has asked if they will continue to be tortured should they be moved to Montana .
No one has asked why they do n't have proper council or have access to the rule of law .
No one has asked why most are being held without charge .
But they have been called terrorists , murderers , rapists and animals ; all this without the benefit of charge or trial .
Is n't this an immoral and backwards approach ?
Scott McPherson began his article today on Jacob Hornberger 's Future of Freedom site with this quote :
He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression ; for if he violates this duty , he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself .
~ Thomas Paine
Nothing could be truer !
Has this precedent already been set ?
I certainly think so .
Just look around .
What do you see ?
Not only are the rights of those foreigners who are being held without the benefit of trial lost , but our precious rights are all but lost as well .
Is it too late to reverse this trend , or will the subservient and duteous sheep in this country continue hiding from the truth ; allowing this rights - stealing behemoth to expand even more ?
If so , what then ?
The political rhetoric is fast flowing but moral sanity has disappeared from view .
It is irrelevant whether or not these U.S. government prisoners are moved from Guantanamo Bay to Montana or anywhere else .
What is relevant , regardless of the venue , is when will these human beings be given the normal and natural rights they deserve ?
When will this country 's good citizens demand that all be treated equally under the law ?
If we do n't protest and change this heinous course we 're on , and by force if necessary , how long will it be before you or I or your neighbor are hauled away , and without the benefit of proper representation and trial ?
Just think of the recently leaked government directives sent to our jack - booted local , state and federal police forces warning that many of us are right - wing extremists and need to be watched .
Any of us could be branded a terrorist or enemy combatant you see , and at any time , so why should I risk my safety for you or you for me just to protect liberty ?
Because if we wo n't , who will ?
And if we do n't , what will be our and our future generation 's destiny ?
This is one slippery slope that leads straight to hell , and this hell is a one - way street away from freedom and into the arms of servitude to the state !
None of us can afford or allow this to happen .
All of human - kind is born with a God - given natural and inherent right to life and liberty .
By allowing the manipulation of the system in favor of some over others , we will all eventually suffer .
By stopping this totalitarian assault on those we do n't know or understand we are only benefitting ourselves and in turn , all of mankind .

THE euro area is falling into such a deep hole that the recovery , when it eventually comes , will be a long , hard journey .
Figures released on Friday May 15th showed that GDP in the 16 - country currency zone fell by 2.5 % in the first quarter , an annualised rate of some 10 % , far worse than many analysts had feared .
Germany , the largest economy in the group , fell even harder : its GDP shrank by 3.8 % in the three months to March and has plunged by almost 7 % since its recession began a year ago .
Italy 's GDP fell by 2.4 % in the quarter ; Spain 's by 1.8 % .
The 1.2 % fall in France , large by any normal standards , almost counts as a boom .
The figures confirmed that the euro zone has been hit far harder by the global downturn than its rich - world peers ( and largest export markets ) in America and Britain .
When spending in these countries dried up , because of scarce credit , they exported some of the pain to their suppliers .
For that reason Germany has so far paid a higher price for its reliance on exports than the Anglo - Saxon countries have borne for their dependence on credit and rising house prices .
Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September , export - led manufacturers have been hit hardest .
For example Slovakia , the euro zone 's newest member ( it joined in January ) , saw its GDP crash by 11.2 % in the first quarter .
Its economy leans heavily on carmaking and its loss has been far more severe even than in Germany .
One of the ironies of this downturn is that it was caused by global housing and credit busts , and yet the economies that have suffered most , such as Germany and Japan , sat out the credit boom .
Even in Europe some sinners have faired better than saints , in GDP terms at least .
As painful as Spain 's construction bust is , in terms of lost jobs and evaporating tax revenues , its economy has contracted less and more slowly than Germany's .
Despite the carnage in continental Europe , the sense of crisis among the population is not yet as great as in America or Britain .
That is because of another irony : Europe 's inflexible labour markets may hamper jobs growth , but they also work against rapid lay - offs in recession .
The unemployment rate in Germany has scarcely budged in the past year .
The bad news on euro - zone jobs has mostly been in Ireland and Spain , where jobless rates have roughly doubled in a year .
Ireland is one of Europe 's most flexible economies .
Spain has its rigidities , but at the peak of the boom as many as a third of its workers were on fixed - term contracts .
Those jobs can be shed quickly and easily .
In both countries , jobs are disappearing fast in the construction industry , because of collapsing house - building .
Things will not get much better soon .
Business - activity indicators across the euro - zone are starting to pick up from record lows .
That points not to a revival but rather to a slower rate of GDP decline in the present quarter ( it could scarcely get worse ) .
A meaningful recovery is a long way off .
Firms cannot take losses forever without shedding jobs .
Unemployment in Germany and elsewhere will begin to pick up quickly this year and carry on in 2010 .
Even where cutting jobs is costly , it is unavoidable given the scale of the fall in GDP .
The European Central Bank seems to have hunkered down for a long recession .
It is now prepared to offer banks unlimited loans for 1 % for up to 12 months , and that horizon may even be extended .
When you have fallen so far , it is a long way back out .
Flawless execution .

Have you made plans for April 25th yet ?
No ?
Well , how about you eat pizza that day ?

Everyone else is doing it .

GRAND RAPIDS --
If someone should start shooting , Jeff Kellogg wants to be packing his own heat .
But Steve Sager believes that kind of protection should be left up to police .
That 's the debate this week at Grand Rapids Community College , sparked by a student group taking part in the national Empty Holster Protest , supporting laws allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on campus .
"
The members of our society who are allowed to carry a concealed weapon are the most law - abiding in our community , " Kellogg said Monday while sporting a holster for his Springfield Armory double stack .
" They carry weapons in grocery stores .
They carry weapons everywhere .
What 's so special about a college campus ?
Why is a campus taboo ? "

Grand Rapids Community
College student says guns should be allowed on campus
Kellogg , 23 , of Ada Township , is one of nine members who took part Monday in the protest that will go national April 20 - 24 .
The group 's 50 members plan to quietly wear empty holsters this week in advance of the national event to provoke conversation with fellow students about GRCC 's policy prohibiting weapons on campus .
Current state law allows those possessing a concealed weapons permit to carry them except in gun- free zones , such as bars , churches or schools .
The current law allows carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus except in classrooms and dorms .
The national group was formed the day after the Virginia Tech shootings that left 33 dead in 2007 .
Members of the group that formed here in December say there is a contradiction between state law and GRCC 's policy prohibiting weapons anywhere on campus .
Sager , an 18 - year - old nursing student from Rockford , said he sees nothing wrong with the current weapons ban .
He noted the same laws gun advocates say do not stop people from killing also do not stop those with concealed weapons permits from potentially abusing the privilege .
" It 's clearly unnecessary to carry weapons on campus , " Sager said .
" I understand maybe they could react faster than the police , but the danger of a lot of people carrying weapons on campus far outweighs that . "
Lt. Harold Woolworth of the Grand Rapids Community College Police Department agrees , saying the current policy works to ensure a safe environment without the added distraction of students having to wonder if their fellow students are armed .
" We just feel it 's safer if we do n't have a lot of extra guns on campus , " Woolworth said .
" In this environment , we want students to be able to focus on the instructors and not have to worry about whether their peers have a gun . "
Josh Eberly , the student group 's president , said Monday was a good start to an important debate .
He estimated group members made contact with some 200 students .
" Some agree , some do n't , " Eberly said .
" I expect it will snowball from here . "

This paper is an attempt to understand expanding information spaces from a phenomenological perspective .
As technology continues to challenge the online / offline distinction , phenomenology provides a useful framework for thinking about context , the role of situated being , and the need for order .
Artificial intelligence and context - aware computing are used as examples of information environments that specifically call out the benefits of understanding information as a bodily entity — as in a “ body of information ” or “ body of knowledge ” .
Concentrating on a Heideggerian approach to technology , which in part characterizes technology as a call for order and structure , the essay will examine the idea of ‘ structured flexibility ’ needed for systems that not only process information but also predict needs , shape information contexts , and actively engage in the user - system interaction .
Finally , it will provide new ways for information architects to think about the expanding space of information .

Last week , the American Enterprise Institute provided the forum for Dick Cheney to give his creepy and disturbing speech espousing the virtues of torture .
Today , over at the the American Enterprise Institute ’s blog , one of the architects of the Bush / Cheney torture policy , lawyer John Yoo , launched an attack on Sonia Sotomayor :
Conservatives should defend the Supreme Court as a place where cases are decided by a faithful application of the Constitution , not personal politics , backgrounds , and feelings .
Republican senators will have to conduct thorough questioning in the confirmation hearings to make sure that she will not be a results - oriented voter , voting her emotions and politics rather than the law .
One worrying sign is Sotomayor ’s vote to uphold the affirmative action program in New Haven , CT , where the city threw out a written test for firefighter promotions when it did not pass the right number of blacks and Hispanics .
Senators should ask her whether her vote in that case , which is under challenge right now in the Supreme Court ( where I signed an amicus brief for the Claremont Center on Constitutional Jurisprudence ) , was the product of her “ empathy ” rather than the correct reading of the Constitution .
An attack from Yoo should pretty much guarantee Sotomayor ’s nomination .
Yoo is facing an effort to have him disbarred for his advocacy of torture .
And ,
Yoo is the subject of an ethics investigation at the Department of Justice , which he ’s desperately trying to have altered .
So , let ’s just say , his legal credentials are already suspect , at best .
But , just for fun , read what the hypocrite Yoo said about Clarence Thomas .
For a right - wing conservative , the personal story matters :
Justice Thomas speaks from personal knowledge when he says : “ So - called ‘ benign ’ discrimination teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps , minorities cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence . ”
He argued that “ these programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are ‘ entitled ’ to preferences . ”
By forswearing the role of coalition builder or swing voter — a position happily occupied by Justice Anthony Kennedy — Justice Thomas has used his opinions to highlight how the latest social theories sometimes hurt those they are said to help .
Because he both respects grass - roots democracy and knows more about poverty than most people do , he dissented vigorously from the court ’s 1999 decision to strike down a local law prohibiting loitering in an effort to reduce inner-city gang activity .
“ Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest and most vulnerable citizens with a terror that the court does not give sufficient consideration , often relegating them to the status of prisoners in their own homes . ”
Expect a lot of this kind of hypocrisy from the Republicans and their minions over the next couple months — aided and abetted by the traditional media , for example , Politico .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - After 16 years , Sci Fi Channel is changing its name ... unless you say it aloud .
NBC Universal - owned cable network will become SyFy starting in June .
The phonics - friendly moniker is part of a network - wide rebranding campaign that has been in the works for more than a year .
It ’s an evolution that also includes a new logo and tagline -- “ Imagine Greater ” -- and will be announced Monday at the network ’s “ upfront ” presentation to advertisers for the new programing season .
The changes attempt to address longtime marketing goals at the network , as well as practical challenges that have stemmed from using a generic term as a brand name .
“ We love being sci -fi , and we ’re still embracing that , ” said network president Dave Howe on Friday .
“ But we ’re more than just space and aliens and the future -- the three things most people think of when they think of ‘ sci fi . ’ ”
Though at first blush more fantastical - looking than the current name , “ SyFy ” aims to telegraph that the channel is a unique destination without being so different from the current title as to lose the network ’s core familiarity .
“ What this does is hopefully give us the best of both worlds , ” Howe said .
“ You keep the heritage , but also open up to a broader range of content . ”
For years the network has sought ways to expand its image beyond its signature male - skewing space operas such as “ Stargate ” and “ Battlestar Galactica . ”
The network will unveil the branding campaign this summer along with the premiere of “ Warehouse 13 , ” a series about two FBI agents who hunt down paranormal objects .
Next year ’s “ Battlestar ” prequel “ Caprica , ” which is a terrestrial drama rather than an outer - space adventure , will further support this brand expansion , an effort that began on the programing side a few years ago with the launch of drama “ Eureka , ” about a town of geniuses .
The pragmatic aspect of the change is that from a business affairs standpoint , the network ’s genre - as - title has long been cumbersome .
“ We ’re going to have upwards of 50 Sci Fi Channels in various territories , and yet you cannot trademark ‘ Sci Fi ’ anywhere in the world , ” Howe said .
“ A new logo design would not solve that particular challenge .
We needed a brand name that was own - able , portable and extendable . ”
Howe knows some fans will dislike the change and see Syfy as a rejection of the network ’s core viewership .
More than most channels , Sci Fi has an intense relationship with its audience .
Clashes are unavoidable to some degree when you combine a network making businesses - minded decisions with a genre that has some of the most passionate and outspoken fans around .
“ Our core audience will use it an opportunity to question our motives -- they always do , ” Howe said .
“ But what we ’re embracing is the total sci - fi landscape -- fantasy , paranormal , action - adventure , mystery ... it ’s imagination - based entertainment . ”

US Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday outlined a sweeping set of changes to the Department of Defense 's budget that he described " will profoundly reform how this department does business " .
The changes cut many a congressperson 's pet project , shuffle billions out of some programs and into others , and thoroughly reorganize and reprioritize the US 's warfighting capabilities .
Among Gates ' proposals are the following :
In his remarks , Gates said that he had " consulted closely with the president " and that the chairman and vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff were in complete accord with his recommendations .
He did n't mention , of course , those pork - hungry congressfolks - one of whom , Senator James Inhofe ( R - Oklahoma ) , was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying : " I can not believe what I heard today .
President Obama is disarming America . "
Now the real war begins . ®

Mergesort
「 集合」を明示的に値とするアプロー チ [ 1 ] [ 2 ] だと、 「 同順の要素の並びはどちらでもいい」ソートアルゴリズムは、
全ての可能なソート順の集合を返すことになると思います。
-- msort_one xs = one_of ( msort xs ) msort [ ] = { [ ] } msort xs = let ( ys , zs ) = split xs in {merge xs ' ys ' | xs'∈msort xs , ys'∈msort ys} where merge ys [ ] = {ys} merge [ ] zs = {zs} merge ( y::ys ) ( z:: zs ) = if y<z then {y : : ws | ws ∈ merge ys ( z :: zs ) } else if z<y then {z : : ws | ws ∈ merge ( y ::ys ) zs} else {y : : ws | ws ∈ merge ys ( z :: zs ) } ∪ {z : : ws | ws ∈ merge ( y ::ys ) zs} split xs = 略
これ、本当に非決定性が気になる最後の分岐以外でも全ての場面で集合を気にしなくてはいけなくて、
書くの面倒じゃないでしょうか。自分は、せめてこう書きたい：
x |?| y = if cointoss then x else y msort [ ] = [ ] msort xs = let ( ys , zs ) = split xs in merge ( msort xs ) ( msort ys ) where merge ys [ ] = ys merge [ ] zs = zs merge ( y::ys ) ( z:: zs ) = if y<z then y :: merge ys ( z :: zs ) else if z<y then z :: merge ( y ::ys ) zs else ( y :: merge ys ( z ::zs ) ) |?| ( z :: merge ( y::ys ) zs ) split xs = 略
いや、これにも全く満足はできていないのですが。シングルトン集合
{e} はそのまま e、 内包表記による集合に一般化した関数適用もそのままただの関数適用、合併 ∪ は |?| になります。 一つだけを選び出す際の one _of は不要です 。
空集合や、その他の集合演算（共通部分 ∩、可能な答え全部を取り出す all_of などなど…） を許すとバックトラック等が必要なヘビーウェイトな非決定性になってしまうので、
それ は " この文脈では " おそらく考えるべきではないと思う。 （…というのが、もしかしたら私の主張の最大のポイント、ということになるのかもしれない。）
別の言い方をすると 「++ と >>= と return だけを許す リストモナド にプログラム全体を閉じ込めてしまえ」という主張になります、たぶん。 扱う対象は、常に " 複数の値を束ね た 「 集合 」 " です。 あまりにも当たり前に集合過ぎるのでソースコード上では見えないだけ。
Haskell で IO モナドから逃げられないのと同じで、このリストモナドからは逃げられません。 main ::
List a に最後に one _of が（プログラムの世界の外から）適用されて実行が終わります。 「++ と >>= と return と one _of だけを許す 」 と制限することで 、 ( 1 ) まず、仕様にあう処理系実装をゼロコストで実現するのは現時点でも非常に簡単
( 2 ) さらに、何か画期的にわかりやすい構文で非決定性が表現できる気がしてならないのですが、 cointoss も |?| もなにか違うような、違和感がある、というのが現状です。
Read the appeal for the release of Dawit Isaak in English

Uppdaterad : 11 mars 2011 kl. 08.24
Thomas Mattsson , chefredaktör Expressen , Kalle Jungkvist , chefredaktör Aftonbladet.se , Lena K Samuelsson , chefredaktör Svenska Dagbladet , Thorbjörn Larsson , chefredaktör Dagens Nyheter , och Jan Helin , chefredaktör Aftonbladet har gemensamt utformat och undertecknat .
Dawit Isaak has today been jailed for 2 742 days .
Without charge and without any sentence .
Dawit Isaak is a journalist and a Swedish citizen who is in prison in Eritrea .
His crime ?
Dawit Isaak wrote and published articles on the need for democracy and freedom in Eritrea in the newspaper Setit .
On September 23 , 2001 he was arrested and imprisoned in connection with the Eritrean government shutting down the country 's independent newspapers .
The regime in Eritrea has never formulated any allegations against Isaak , let alone a prosecution , a trial or a sentence .
In total silence , he has for nearly eight years been locked up in Eritrea ’s capital Asmara .
Recently , there has been new alarming information about Dawit Isaak .
He is alleged to have been taken by prisoner transport to a military hospital .
He is kept isolated and his only human contact is with a doctor .
No relatives are allowed to see him .
His health has also deteriorated because of diabetes .
The Swedish authorities ' attitude to the case is characterized by silence .
They refer to the method of “ quiet diplomacy ” .
So far , this method has yielded few results .
Now is the time for the Swedish government to start working actively for Dawit Isaak´s release .
Dawit Isaak´s children are growing up in Gothenburg , but without a father .
The two oldest children have finished both primary school and most of secondary school without their father .
His youngest daughter is now ten years old and has lived almost her entire life with only vague memories of her father .
This indecent cruelty to Isaak´s family must come to an end , just like the daily violation of freedom of expression and freedom of press is being violated through Dawit Isaak´s imprisonment .
There are 143 journalists imprisoned around the world today .
Dawit Isaak is one of them and the only Swedish citizen currently in prison without trial for having exercised freedom of speech .
He is also the only Swedish citizen adopted as a “ prisoner of conscience ” by Amnesty International .
This is not only about journalists , but of all people ’s right to freely express their opinions .
Today .
as editors - in - chiefs of of Sweden ’s largest media houses , we begin a joint campaign to focus on Dawit Isaak ’s case .
During the campaign , the daily competition between us will be put aside .
We will report on Isaak and what the Swedish Foreign Ministry is doing to free him .
Our demand is very simple : Free Dawit Isaak .
Our cause will be powerless without your help .
We need your name in the fight for Isaak ’s release .
Every added name to the list s a small step closer to freedom for Dawit Isaak .
Show your commitment .
Go into any of our web sites and sign the petition .
On May 4 we will hand over all the names to the Eritrean Embassy .

There is a major cultural schism developing in America .
But it 's not over abortion , same - sex marriage or home schooling , as important as these issues are .
The new divide centers on free enterprise -- the principle at the core of American culture .
Despite President Barack Obama 's early personal popularity , we can see the beginnings of this schism in the " tea parties " that have sprung up around the country .
In these grass - roots protests , hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans have joined together to make public their opposition ...
April Fool Skype was pushed onto Apple 's iPhone at the instigation of the VoIP app's corporate owner eBay , the Reg can exclusively reveal - in order to reap huge sums from government listening agencies interested in spying on Jesus - mobe - toting terrorists .
The revelations come from a disgruntled eBay insider familiar with the matter , known to Reg handlers only by the randomly - assigned codename " Click Jezebel " .
This individual , already sickened by years spent living off the proceeds of artificially hyped repeat sales of bug - infested rugs and defective lava lamps , found the latest attempt to wring value from Skype a step too far .
According to this source , cynical eBay profiteers have long been intent on squeezing some revenue out of Skype , but the customer base has stubbornly resisted monetisation .
It 's also well known that Skype is considered extremely difficult to listen in on by plods , spooks and so on - partly because of its peer - to - peer nature , which routes calls unpredictably , and partly because of its obscure encryption .
The Reg has reported before on the difficulties faced by Italian and German police - not to mention Britain 's GCHQ - in eavesdropping on Skype calls .
When news broke recently that America 's NSA was offering " billions " to any company which could offer a bona - fide solution for Skype eavesdropping , unscrupulous tat - bazaar overlords saw their chance at last .
Secret top - level negotiations were opened with the NSA : these were time - consuming as they had to be carried out via courier - delivered , one - time - pad encrypted hardcopy letters owing to understandable paranoia on both sides .
The idea was that eBay would order Skype engineers to develop a Skype update which would cause user clients to relay details of every call or chat to secretly - established NSA " black servers " , located in China to provide plausible deniability .
In the event of the NSA wishing to listen in on a given call , the clients at either terminus - in addition to sending the normal Skype encrypted traffic to each other - would also send the voice or text to the spooks .
Within the NSA the ploy is known as the " man-at - each - end " attack , according to our source .
Company engineers prefer the term " p2p2 pwn " , apparently .
It appears that negotiations initially proceeded well , with payment arrangements swiftly hammered out .
Each time the NSA
Skype backdoor is used , US black - budget funds will be used to purchase an agreed , substantial amount of tat on eBay , causing clean untraceable revenue to flow into the online gumble - bazaar 's coffers .
The purchases will then normally be put straight back up for re-auction , maximising the payment to eBay and minimising losses to the US taxpayer .
But at the final stages a sticking point emerged .
It 's well known that many targets of interest to the NSA dislike platforms which have long been able to run Skype , such as Windows Mobile phones .
These individuals - Taliban warlords , Afghan politicians , celebrities , ruthless criminal biz - kingpin supervillains etc. - typically favour the added bling factor of Apple 's Jesus Phone .
" They said to us , get backdoored - up Skype on the iPhone , we 'll pay full price , " according to our person familiar with the matter .
" Otherwise we knock off $ 2bn . "
Thus Skype at once entered into negotiations with Apple , while telco objections to free VoIP on the iPhone were stifled behind the scenes by NSA arm - twisting .
This part of the plan , according to our informant , was known as " Project Judas Phone " , and has now reached fruition .
Our source , possibly exposed after the Reg accounts department called him at work to verify an expense - account lunch claim from one of our scribes , was forced to flee his job and home last week .
He is now thought to be in hiding , or perhaps in a secret prison overseas somewhere .
Attempts to contact eBay 's Swiss alpine mountaintop HQ for comment have so far proved fruitless .
We also tried to reach the NSA , but negotiating a secure comms protocol has so far proved impossible . ®
Most PC ’s and Notebook require a special handshake from the LCD or display device before they output video .
This handshake involves reading the EDID table from the monitor .
EDID contains information such as Supported Resolutions , Native Resolution , and Video Formats .
Most older cables and most video switches , splitters , or extenders do not support EDID , result is that you often ca n’t get video from your notebook PC to external display .
To easily fix this , Hall Research has designed the EDID Emulator .
It is a tiny device that plugs to the VGA port of your PC and you simply plug the cable to the monitor to this unit .
The EM - EDID - HD15 is powered from the PC itself , so in 99.9 % of cases you do n’t need an external power supply ( but if you are connecting to something non-standard that does not provide power on pin 9 , we also offer the same device with a small power supply ) .
We have pre-programmed a lot of standard 4×3 and 16×9 resolutions in to the Emulator , so chances are you will have a perfect video right off the bat .
But if you want to specifically program the EDID from a unique LCD into the Emulator , that is possible too with the use of USB - EDID - HD15 ( sold separately ) .
" And these matters , together with poor response by the council , had as their effect two years of anxiety and low morale for the school staff , stress leading to a need for early retirement in some staff and Mrs Connor and disruption in the local community with , on the evidence , little , if anything , positive to show for it . "
Josh Bard ’s second stint with the Red Sox was even briefer than his first .
The Red Sox announced this morning that they have placed the 30 - year old catcher on unconditional release waivers .
General manager Theo Epstein indicated that Bard ’s departure means that George Kottaras — a 25 - year - old lefthanded - hitter with power who is out of minor league options — will probably make the Opening Day roster and catch knuckleballer Tim Wakefield on a regular basis .
“ Our young catchers are doing a really good job in camp , ” said general manager Theo Epstein , who noted that Bard was informed of the decision at 10 a.m. this morning .
“ George in particular did a nice job with Wakefield the other night .
We like the way George is throwing .
He ’s throwing well .
Once he showed he could handle Wakefield we decided that is the direction we ’re going . ”

Epstein said it was difficult to let Bard go but that Kotteras was the best fit .
There is also somewhat of a financial factor to the move .
Bard signed a one - year deal with the Red Sox worth $ 1.7 million in late December , with a team option for a second year .
But his contract was not guaranteed , and by releasing him now the Red Sox are obligated to pay only one - sixth ( $ 283,333 ) of his 2009 salary .
He would have been guaranteed one - fifth of his salary ( $ 340,000 ) had he remained with the club until tomorrow , and the full amount would have become guaranteed had he been on the Opening Day roster .
“ [ It ’s ] his job to lose right now , ” Epstein said of Kottaras .
“ We hope he continues to do a nice job and Dusty Brown ’s having a good camp as well .
This ’ll get them some more time .
We had to make this move now because we need George and Wake to work together and we need to make sure we know what we have , and prepare for the season . ”
Bard first came to Boston in 2006 as part of the trade that also brought outfielder Coco Crisp from the Cleveland Indians .
He served as a backup to Jason Varitek and played seven games for the Sox , but struggled catching Wakefield ’s knuckleball .
Advertisement
On May 1 , before a Wakefield start against the Yankees , Bard was traded to the Padres along with righthanded reliever Cla Meredith in exchange for Doug Mirabelli , Wakefield ’s longtime catcher .
Mirabelli remained with the Sox until last spring , when he met a fate similar to Bard ’s :
He was released last March 13 in favor of Kevin Cash .
Cash held the backup job last season — usually as Wakefield ’s catcher — but signed with the Yankees in the offseason .
Bard hit just .202 in 57 games for the Padres last season while battling ankle problems , but he was productive in two previous seasons in San Diego .
In 2006 , he hit .338 with nine homers and 40 RBIs in 231 at - bats , and hit .285 with five homers and 51 RBIs in 389 at - bats in 2007 .
Bard batted .462 with six hits in 13 at - bats this spring , with a home run and four RBIs .
With catching at premium , it ’s probable that he will catch on elsewhere .
Kottaras is hitting .286 with one home run in 14 at - bats this spring .
He hit .243 with 22 home runs in 395 at - bats last year at Pawtucket .
As they sipped tea and nibbled on dates , more than 100 men and women listened to a litany of speakers sounding the same message :
The FBI is not your friend .
“ We ’re here today to say our mosques are off limits , ” Hussam Ayloush , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations for Greater Los Angeles , told the crowd last month at an Anaheim mosque .
“ Our Koran is off limits , ” Ayloush said .
“ Our youth , who they try to radicalize , are off limits .
Now is the time to tell them , ‘ We ’re not going to let this happen anymore . ’ ”
Such strong words from a man who once was a vocal advocate of ties with federal law enforcement was yet one more signal that the fragile relationship between Muslim American groups and the FBI is being tested .

In the months and years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , FBI officials met privately with Muslim leaders , assuring them that a spate of hate crimes would be vigorously investigated and at the same time asking for help in the campaign against terrorism .
Local leaders promised to encourage cooperation .
But even as relations warmed , a series of revelations -- including allegations that the FBI sent an informant into a mosque in Orange County , surveilled community leaders and sent an agent to UC Irvine -- caused some to begin questioning the FBI ’s real intentions .
Now , the leaders of several Muslim organizations say they feel betrayed .
Because Orange County has been at the center of many of the revelations , local leaders have taken a lead in challenging the FBI , but the issues are resonating nationwide .
On Sunday , a coalition of the nation ’s largest Muslim organizations , including the Council on American - Islamic Relations , the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Islamic Society of North America , issued a statement demanding that the Obama administration address FBI actions , including what they describe as the “ infiltration of mosques , ” the use of “ agent provocateurs to trap unsuspecting Muslim youth ” and the “ deliberate vilification ” of the council .

“ It reached a level where we felt we had to do something , ” said Agha Saeed , chairman of the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections .
“ The FBI is doing things which are not healthy .
They are creating divisions and conflict , creating a totally negative , Islamophobic image of Muslims in America . ”
Over the years , there ’s been a gradual erosion of trust between the groups and the FBI .
Months ago , the agency told local leaders it was suspending relations with the council , one of the largest Muslim civil rights groups in the country .
Since then , things have unraveled rapidly .
Like other Muslim communities in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , many in Orange County -- home to more than 100,000 Muslim Americans , dozens of mosques and several prominent Muslim community organizations -- worried about FBI investigations .
The FBI , in turn , believed terrorists were either trying to get to Southern California to carry out attacks or were already here .
To gain intelligence and demystify the agency ’s operations , the FBI met with local leaders and formed a committee that met monthly .
Advertisement
“ In the post - 9/11 world , the Arab American and Muslim community became one of those places where we said , ‘ It ’s worth making the extra effort , ’ ” said FBI spokesman John Miller , who is also in charge of the agency ’s national community outreach program .
Early on , Ayloush said the FBI was acting in good faith and working with the community as “ partners rather than suspects . ”
But the delicate relationship soon began to fray .
In 2004 , the FBI and immigration officials arrested the popular head of an Anaheim mosque ; he was held on immigration - related charges for two years until a judge ordered his release pending deportation .
In 2006 , an FBI agent was quoted as telling a business group in Newport Beach that the agency was monitoring Muslims at local universities .
A year later , UC Irvine students said an FBI agent conducting an investigation at the school assaulted a Muslim student with his car near the site of a demonstration .
Advertisement
On a national level , there was the disclosure that FBI agents had been secretly monitoring radiation levels at mosques in search of radioactive bombs .
More troubling were news reports that Muslims had been asked to become informants or face deportation .
The breaking point came in February with the revelation that the FBI had sent an informant to an Irvine mosque to collect evidence of jihadist rhetoric and other allegedly extremist acts by a Tustin man who attended prayers there .
To some , the incidents added up to this conclusion :
The government was targeting all Muslims .
Miller strongly disputes that contention , saying that the agency does not go on “ fishing expeditions . ”
“ What we investigate is people , ” he said .
“ If we develop information on a person , that investigation may take us different places -- to their home , their place of business . . . and yes , if . . . they go to a mosque , the investigation may take us to the mosque .
That is part of what we do . ”

The Council on American - Islamic Relations was named in 2007 , along with hundreds of other organizations and individuals , as an unindicted co-conspirator in a case against the Texas - based Holy Land Foundation , which the government accused of funneling money to terrorists .
As a result , the FBI suspended relations with the council this year .
“ That is not to suggest that anyone or everyone associated with CAIR has any kind of taint , ” Miller said , adding that “ there are some issues we would like to know more about from the leaders at CAIR ’s headquarters . ”
But at the recent meeting at the Anaheim mosque , the tone was one of frustration and anger .
Advertisement
Speakers suggested that ordinary Muslim Americans need to protect themselves from overzealous FBI agents .
“ You do n’t get brownie points for speaking to them , ” said Ameena Qazi , a lawyer for the council .
“ They do n’t go back to the office and check off your civic engagement or your patriotism .
. . .
We are a very open and hospitable community , but we should n’t be naive . ”
Attendees applauded Qazi ’s statement , but it was a mea culpa that most moved them .
“ We goofed up , guys , ” said Shakeel Syed , head of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California .
“ We brought them here .
We brought them to our mosques , to our meetings .
. . .
We have to hold ourselves responsible .
That ’s why it ’s so important to dig our heels into the ground and say we ’re not going to take this lying down , we ’re going to fight . ”

He got the loudest applause of the night .

会社など、プリンターの使用頻度が高い所で重宝されているのがリサイクルトナーです。レーザープリンターを利用するコストを下げてくれますし、使い終わったり使いきれなかったトナーも業者に買い取ってもらえます。一方でリサイクルトナーの買取は条件が複雑だったり、業者によって買取価格が異なったりと気をつけたいこともあります。
そこでリサイクルトナー買取サービスを利用するときの注意点をまとめてみました。
リサイクルトナーを扱っている業者かどうか確認する
トナーの買取を行っている業者は多いですが、それらがリサイクルトナーも扱っているとは限りません。中にはメーカー純正トナーのみ買取をしており、リサイクルトナーは一切買取をしていない所もあります。またリサイクルトナーの買取をしていても、未使用のものに限るといった条件付きの業者も見られます。
このような理由から、買取業者を選ぶときにはまず買取対象としてリサイクルトナーがあるかどうか、そして買取が可能な状態のものかを確認しておくことを勧めます。
トナーの使用期限を意識しておく
レーザープリンターのトナーには使用期限があり、この期限を過ぎると印刷の品質が落ちたり、場合によってはプリンターに不具合が生じる恐れがあります。このため使用期限が過ぎたリサイクルトナーは業者からも買取を拒否されたり、買取可能であっても査定価格が下がることがあるので注意が必要です。
一般的にトナーの使用期限は2年ほどですが、これはあくまで開封せずに安定した環境下で保管されることを想定したものです。そのためリサイクルトナーをプリンターに取り付けたまま長期間放置した、といった場合は使用期限が想定よりも短くなります。
あまり状態の悪いリサイクルトナーは買取を拒否されることもあるので、使用期限と保管環境にも意識をしておきましょう。
買取価格が下がる理由を知っておく
先述のようにトナーを買い取ってくれる業者は多いですが、リサイクルトナーだと買取に条件を付けてくる業者も少なくありません。さらに買取時に減額となる要素も多いので、損をしないためにも買取価格が下がる理由を押さえておきましょう。
買取価格が下がる1つ目の理由は、リサイクルトナーが使用済みであることです。
リサイクルトナーは、通常のトナー同様に未開封未使用品が一番高く買い取ってもらえます。逆に使用済みのものはほとんどの場合は安い価格での買取になってしまいます。2つ目の理由は、その買取業者が特定メーカーの買取に消極的な場合です。
そのメーカーのリサイクルトナーの売上がよくなかったり、他のメーカー品よりもトナー入れ替えに経費が掛かるので利益率が悪いとか、考えられる理由は様々です。そのため業者によっては未使用のリサイクルトナーにもかかわらず、特定のメーカーのものだけ安く査定をされたといったこともあり得ます。
そして3つ目の理由として、トナーの状態に不備があるケースです。例えばトナーに落書きや汚れがあったり、一部のトナーには付属しているトナーカバーが無かったりなどです。またリサイクルトナーは繰り返し使用されるため、どうしてもトナー本体に痛みや劣化が生じやすくなります。
本体に大きな傷や割れなどがあった場合は、買取を断られることもあるので気をつけておきましょう。
大量の買取依頼を出すと断られることもある
大量のリサイクルトナーを業者に買取してもらおうとした場合は、断られることもあるので注意を要します。理由として、リサイクルトナーはその買取業者が契約している工場や、あるいは自社工場で買い取ったトナー本体にトナーを詰め替えて販売しています。
そのため工場の受け入れ状況いかんでは、リサイクルトナーの買取を断られることがあるためです。
一度に大量の買取をしてもらおうとすると、特にそういったことが起こりやすくなります。そういった際には複数の買取業者を利用したり、買取依頼の数を減らすことを勧めます。
事前に見積もりをしてもらう
繰り返し使用されることが前提のリサイクルトナーは、商品によって状態もまちまちです。そのため業者の買取価格をそのまま鵜呑みにして直接買取をしてもらうと、思ったよりも安い査定価格で引き取られたといった失敗がありがちです。
このような失敗を避けるためにも、事前に査定の見積もりを出してくれる業者を利用することをおすすめします。見積もりは基本的に無料の業者がほとんどのため、仮にその金額に納得がいかない場合は別の業者に見積もりを出せば良いだけです。
また見積もり時は、リサイクルトナーの現物の写真をはじめ購入時期などの情報を一緒に伝えると、見積もりでの査定価格も高くなりやすいので意識しておきましょう。
送料の有無と金 額
実際にリサイクルトナーの買取をしてもらうときには、直接買取業者に持ち込む人は少なく、多くは宅配便を使った宅配買取を利用しています。その際に注意をしておきたいのが、送料がいくら掛かるかです。当然送料が無料の方が望ましいですし、着払い可能ならば送り状を書く時も楽です。
ただし、必ずしも送料が無料や安い業者が一番得とは限りません。買取業者の中には、送料を買取価格に転嫁している所もあるためです。そのため送料の有無と金額だけで買取業者を判断するのではなく、業者の買取価格表や他の必要手数料なども考慮した上で判断をしましょう。
身分証明書を用意しておく
不要なリサイクルトナーを業者に買い取ってもらうときに、意外と忘れがちなのが身分証明書の準備です。
身分証明書の提示は何もリサイクルトナーの買取に限ったことではなく、買取サービスを利用するときには法令で必要とされるものです。
宅配買取の場合も同様で、買取申込書と一緒に身分証明書のコピーを封入するのを忘れないようにしましょう。身分証明書は保険証や免許証などのコピーで問題ありません。社員証のコピーは買取業者によっては使えない所もあるので気をつけておきましょう。
買取時には梱包にも注意
リサイクルトナーの中にはトナー粉が詰められています。トナー粉は5ミクロン程の非常に小さい粒子です。これらが人の体に付着したりしないように、通常使用においてはトナーカートリッジからトナー粉が漏れることはありません。
しかしリサイクルトナーが強い衝撃を受けたりすると、トナー粉が漏れることもあるので要注意です。買取時にリサイクルトナーを宅配便で送るケースも多いですが、その際には特に上記のような事故が起きやすいので梱包時には衝撃対策が必要です。
エアーキャップなどの緩衝材の使用がベストですが、無ければ新聞紙等を用いても問題ありません。

自分なりにもっと凝縮版を。渋川さんが言っている事全体もその通りとは思うけど*1、もっと簡単で、しかも射程が広い、と自分が思っている事。
渋川さんはちょろっと触れてるだけだけど、自分はこれが最も基本的で汎用的、かつ、ソースをきれいにする原動力となる上にバグをも減らしてコードの汎用性まであげる、コーディングのエンジンみたいなものと思ってる。それは、
もちろんそれはそれで非常に大事な効果。意味がない名前や実態と合ってない名前が溢れてると、ソースを見ても、何をやってるか分からなかったり、勘違いを招く。それがなくなれば、ソースは大幅に読みやすくなる。大きなメリットであり非常に重要ではあるけど、それは効果のほんのごく一部に過ぎない。「正しい名前付け、正しい名前の維持」で生まれるのは、そんな当たり前の事だけではない。「正しい名前」を付けるために、コードの方も直すのだから。
「 すべてに正しい名前」を求める意志は何を生むか
偉そうなことをいっておいて、実は全然整理されてないけど*2、思いつくところを順不同で挙げていく。抜けてる物・説明もたくさんあると思う。それぞれは完全に独立したものではなく、多分にオーバーラップしつつ、全体で上記に挙げたメリットに繋がる。
そのコード・その部分がやることが明確になる たとえば、メソッドや関数。適当な名前で「なんとなく」で書き始めてなんとなく動いたら終わり、では、目的不明確でコードがヨレがち。ヨレてフラフラしたコードが綺麗な訳がない。その各部分（ブロックなりループなり、メソッド・関数内の数行の塊なり）に注目しても、単に不完全な断片にしかならない。
しかし、まじめに的確に名前を付けようとすれば、それが何をする物なのか明確に考えなくちゃならない。そして、明確になったら名前としていったん固定され、実装ではその固定された「やる事」をぶれずに書き下す。もちろん、実装中に名前の方が実は間違ってる事に気が付いたら、名前の方を直す。書き上がってからも、名前と実態が合ってるか、名前にそぐわぬコードが混ざってないか見直す。これにより、無駄やヨレがなくなり、コードは綺麗になり、バグも減る。
部分についても同様。実際に言語では名前を与えられなくても、各部分部分について的確な名前を考え、コードもそれに合わせるように直していけば、部分についてもやる事が明確になり、無駄・ヨレの排除でコードが綺麗になり、バグも減る。
クラスでもモジュールでも、話は同じ。
変数であっても同じ。その変数は何なのかきちんと考えて固定すれば、役割が明確になる。役割が明確なら、役割に合わない値を入れたり、役割と違った目的で値を使う事がなくなる。というか、なくす。もちろん、最初考えた役割の方が間違ってたら、正しい役割を表す名前に直して、その役割と使い方がすべて合ってるか見直す。これも、ヨレを無くし、バグを減らす。
「 それは何なのか」が一貫す る 適当な名前で何となく書かれた関数なりクラスなり変数なりは、曖昧がゆえに実装の部分部分や使われる場所によって、それがどういう物なのかが微妙にまたは大きく揺らぎが生じる。これもヨレや無駄、そしてバグの元。
一方、かならず的確な名前を付けるようにしていれば、その実装やその使い方がそこから外れる事が無くなる。実装や使い方が、その名の通りに一貫される。使い方を間違えない。
スコープが最適になる なんとなく処理に必要な変数を用意して使っていると、それが必要な範囲も漠然としてしまう。
変数に最も的確な名前を考え、コード内の部分（ブロックなりループなり、メソッド・関数内の数行の塊なり）についても的確な名前を考えていくと、変数がその名前にふさわしい役割で必要とされている範囲がはっきりしてくる。そして、スコープで適切な名前にしようとすると、自然と本当に必要な範囲だけのスコープの変数になっていく。
スコープが最適になると言う事は、それが本来無用の場所でも間違って使われたり、読むときも無用に意識する必要がなくなるという事。ソースは綺麗になり、バグも減る。
プログラムが 「とにかくそう動く」ではなく、意味レベルで整理・洗練される
そのコードが何なのか一貫した認識がなく、またそのコードで使ってる変数や関数も何なのか曖昧だと、「ああなってこうなって…、えーと…、ウン、よし、動くな」と、動き中心でコードが書かれがち。それでは、何とかそのときは動くコードにはなるが、コードは洗練されない。
きちんと的確な名前を付けようとすると、動きでなく意味で考えざるを得なくなる。意味で考えて意味通りのコードにしようとすれば、コードはただ動くではなく、洗練の方向が明らかになるし、洗練させずには意味通りのコードにはならない。
コードの凝集度が上がる そのコードが何なのか一貫した認識がなく意味レベルで整理されていなければ、「動く」という理由で、関係の深い物も浅い物もバラバラに配置されたままになる。
意味で考えられていて、コードを意味に合わせていれば、関係ある物はどうしたって集まってくるし、関係が浅い物は離れていって別メソッド・関数や別クラスなどに分離されていく。これはコードの凝集度が上がる事に他ならない。凝集度があがると、コードは綺麗だし、変更の影響範囲が狭い範囲に閉じるし、コードの依存事項も小さくなり、いい事づくめ。
設計が本当に必要な最適解に近付いていく 名前と実装の絶え間ない改善のスパイラルは、実装を書いてみて気が付いた大事な事を吸収しながら、ソースコードを明確な意味達の集まりに洗練していく。これはソースコードを、事前設計では得られない正しい設計に導く。
さらに、それぞれの意味が明確に名前で表されていれば、必要なものとのズレも見付けやすくなる。これによって、そのズレを直すべく設計をさらに洗練させる事になる。
複雑さが名前で表現できる範囲に押さえられる 名前は名前であり、それなりに簡潔であるべき物。簡潔な名前の意味にあったコードにするには、そもそもダラダラと長く複雑なコードではいられなくなる。長いコードは、その部分（ブロックなりループなり、関数内の数行の塊なり。あるいはメソッドの集まりであったり）についてもそれが何であるのか名前を付けようと意味を明確にしようと考える事で、部分の役割が明確になって、関数やクラスに独立させる事になる。
コードがシンプルになる 正しい名前にするために意味で整理して凝集度が上がることで、メソッド・関数なりクラスなりは小さな単位になっていく。これは、一つ一つの役割は小さくなり、小さな役割について意味を明確にしようとして、その明確な意味通りのコードにしようとすれば、それは自然に短くシンプルになる。
コードの矛盾・ズレ・間違いが排除される 使ってる物（変数・メソッド・関数・クラス、など）の正しい名前・意味が曖昧なままだと、使ってる物に何か変更が入ったときも、もともとの意味が曖昧なので使い方に矛盾・ズレ・間違いがあっても目立たない。
使ってる物の名前・意味が明確ならば、使い方の矛盾・ズレ・間違いは目立つし、かつ名前・意味を明確であり続けさせようとすると、そのような矛盾・ズレ・間違いは排除しない訳に行かない。
依存の少ない変更に強いコードになる 使ってる物（変数・メソッド・関数・クラス、など）や部分（ブロックなりループなり、関数内の数行の塊なり。あるいはメソッドの集まりであったり）の名前・意味が曖昧なまま整理されないと、それらが依存する（影響を受ける）ものも必要以上に増えた状態になる。そのため、別の部分を修正したときも、本来関係ないはずであっても影響を受けてしまいやすくなる。
的確な名前を考え意味で整理され無駄が無くなっていると、本当に必要な物だけが使われるので、関係ないものへの依存が無くなり、変更に強くなる。
コードの重複が排除される その部分の名前・意味が曖昧で依存が広く塊も大きいと、似たような事をやるにもちょっとした違いのためにそれを利用できず、また部分的にはほとんどそのまんまでも、部分を切り出す事が困難になり、似たような別のコードを書かなくてはならなくなる。
明確な名前と意味で整理されたコードは、自然と凝集度が高く独立性が高い小さな単位(メソッド・関数、クラス、など)の集まりになる。役割が小さく意味が専門化させていくと、そもそも「似た処理」の本当の共通の性質部分そのものの意味になりやすい。「似た処理」が必要と思ったとき、その部分について本当に的確な意味として既に切り出されて専門化されている。
Let it be said for Dora - when she embraces something , she embraces it all the way ( like a boa constrictor ) .
See you tomorrow .
While game shows have often made the jump into video games , and trivia games are a popular draw for bars and restaurants , Microsoft is trying something new by hosting real , live , game - show - like content on Xbox Live .
The first experiment ?
1 vs. 100 , a scheduled , live game show with a real host , real prizes to be won , and questions that never repeat .
Originally revealed at last year 's E3 , the game is nearly ready for prime time .
Ars took part in the Canadian beta and , after talking to the game 's director , we think Microsoft could be on to something .
Here 's how it works : the live shows are scheduled , so you have to make sure you 're free to take part in the game .
When you join , you either are part of the Mob , the 100 , or the One .
The Mob competes on the scoreboard and could win Microsoft points and Xbox Live Games , the 100 have their avatar shown on the big wall , and could become the One if the main player is knocked out .
If you answer a question incorrectly , you 're out of the Mob .
The One answers the questions for prizes , and if he or she is knocked out by a wrong answer , one of the 100 takes his or her place .
It may sound complicated at first , but you 'll soon get it , and the best advice is just to answer all the questions right and see how long you can last against your fellow contestants .
You can also play during scheduled " extended play " sessions that do n't feature a live host , but playing well during these can bump your chances of being part of the 100 in the next show .
Do n't bother trying to Google the answers , you only have a moment or two to answer .
" What we 're doing here is new territory .
We 're bringing people together with a live host , and creating new questions for an experience that 's always fresh , with prizes , " game director Manuel Bronstein told Ars .
Because you 're playing against real players , and there is a live host emceeing the whole experience , every game is something different .
The host is part of what makes each episode interesting and gives the game its flavor .
" The live host has the host tool , which gives information like names , gamertags , things that are in your public profile .
He can see the top three scorers , and the players with the fastest answers , " Bronstein explained .
" Along with the stats he can see , we 're complimenting that with Twitter , the forums , e-mails , so he can balance the factual data with things that are more emotional , and he can interact with what people are saying about the game . "
The host and the producer sit down before each game for an hour or so , talking about ways to make each experience special .
While the game does benefit from the live host , the experience was a bit more canned than we were expecting .
Game mechanics and question setup are handled by a recorded female host , with the live announcer breaking in during various pause points in the game .
As with most online multiplayer games , there 's a real thrill that comes with knowing you are competing in real time against thousands of other players — and an even bigger thrill that comes when you whip most of them in points .
Microsoft set us up with a Canadian Xbox Live account to take part in the beta , and boy were the questions Canada - centric : you better know your hockey , geography , and Canadian history .
One question did in fact use the word " hoser , " and my knowledge of Trailer Park Boys came in handy .
The questions are a big part of the experience , and their difficulty is a tricky thing to nail down .
" It 's very interesting for us .
We have our internal team of writers , and we 're trying to strike a balance between difficulty , fun , and the entertainment value of the question , " Bronstein told Ars .
" We have mechanisms to measure right and wrong answers , and we can then see if questions are too easy .
It 's a great exercise to keep fine tuning to keep the experience very inclusive and entertaining . "
The service clearly remains in beta .
Getting into the game caused my Xbox to hang ; when I did enter the game lobby , the program stalled ; when I finally got into the game , I was disconnected after a couple of minutes .
But persistence paid off , and eventually my avatar found his way into the circular game hall , where 15,000 Canadians had assembled to answer trivia questions about the Canadian Football League .
" You can test a lot internally , but when you go live and see the network conditions , with scaling , you start discovering things , " Bronstein said when we brought up the technical issues .
" We 're discovering issues early , and we 're monitoring information from servers , forums , from disconnects , then we can sit down and analyze that data , understand what created it , and try to get it fixed . "
This is what betas are for , and hopefully the game will be a smooth experience when it launches in the spring .
The play itself is rather leisurely .
For every question , you simply hit a button to lock in your answer ; there is a lot of production for very little game - type interaction .
" The mechanic is simple , I 'm not going to argue that , " Bronstein agrees .
" There 's going to be a lot of opportunity to take on the feedback we get , and to make the next version even better . "
While the cost of a live host and scheduled events may only make sense in games where large amounts of people can play , Bronstein says that there are many other concepts or game play ideas that can be used in the live environment ; this just the first stab at this kind of experience .
Even the digital prizes of Microsoft points and Xbox Live Arcade games are enough to make the play more thrilling — it really feels like something is at stake .
The scheduled nature of the shows also makes playing something of an event ; this could be the closest many of us get to getting on Jeopardy .
Players can also be entered into drawings for real electronics and other prizes .
We look forward to playing more when the technical issues are ironed out , and of course it will be more fun without Canadian - flavored questions for us Yanks .
Still , this is an interesting step in the world of interactive entertainment , and leaves plenty of room to grow .
Even better , the first " season " of the game will be free if you 're an Xbox Live Gold member , and it 's expected to begin this spring .
Police have carried out what is thought to be the biggest pre-emptive raid on environmental campaigners in British history , arresting 114 people believed to be planning direct action at a coal - fired power station .
The arrests - for conspiracy to commit criminal damage and aggravated trespass - come amid growing concern among protesters about increased police surveillance and infiltration by informers .
Police said the raid on a school in Nottingham was made just after midnight yesterday , and was linked to a planned protest , thought to be at nearby Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station .
Nottinghamshire police said action had been taken because " in view of specialist equipment recovered by police , those arrested posed a serious threat to the safe running of the site " .
The mass arrest , involving three police forces , prompted renewed concern about the tactics of officers policing environmental protests , particularly over expansion of airports and coal power .
Last night campaigners said police were photographing and stopping people entering and leaving public meetings and the offices of the lobby group Greenpeace .
Policing of the recent G20 protests has also come under scrutiny after video evidence suggested the newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson died minutes after being pushed from behind by a police officer .
Caroline Lucas , leader of the Green party , said that with no charges more than 12 hours after the arrests , " confidence in policing of protests like this has just about hit rock bottom .
" Peaceful protest is a civil liberty we need to be upheld , even more in the context of the lack of government action on climate change .
We have tried all the usual channels . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " In the light of the policing of the G20 protests , people up and down the country will want to be confident that there was evidence of a real conspiracy to commit criminal damage by those arrested and that this was not just an attempt by the police to disrupt perfectly legitimate protest . "
No group had last night claimed responsibility for the alleged demonstration , which fellow activists said was because charges of conspiracy could lead to a jury trial and possible jail sentence .
Emails setting out planned action could be used by police to prove conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and criminal damage , as could any equipment or documents found during the arrests .
No formal details of the proposed action have been released , but campaign veterans speculated that demonstrators may have planned to chain themselves to the conveyor belts taking coal into the power plant in order to stop the generators when fuel ran out .
The tactic has been used at both Ratcliffe and a coal plant at Kingsnorth , Kent , both owned by the utility company E.ON .
There was speculation that the arrests in Nottingham followed a tip - off from a police informer .
Other campaigners said the size of the protest group made it vulnerable to routine police surveillance .
There have been a growing number of demonstrations and " direct actions " by campaigners angry about government plans for a new generation of coal - fired power stations .
The secretive nature of the alleged protest plan is similar to actions organised by the Climate Camp network , a loose affiliation of groups , but nobody from the movement could be contacted yesterday .
Last month a Guardian investigation revealed police were targeting thousands of political campaigners in surveillance operations at events including the Climate Camp , and storing their details on a database for at least seven years .
Nottinghamshire police said the 114 people arrested were from across the country .
" There were no injuries during the arrests and the police investigation is ongoing . "
Some of those arrested were taken to police cells in Leicestershire and Derbyshire .
E.ON said : " We can confirm that Ratcliffe power station was the planned target of an organised protest during the early hours of this morning .
While we understand that everyone has a right to protest peacefully and lawfully ... we will be assisting the police with their investigations into what could have been a very dangerous and irresponsible attempt to disrupt an operational power plant . "

In these Hubble photos , the core of M87 is located at lower left in the images .
HST - 1 is the bright blob at center .
The glowing material at far right is part of a stream of particles in the jet that speed up and glow in the ultraviolet .
The photos show show the jet growing brighter over a seven - year period .
A jet of gas spewing from a huge black hole has mysteriouslybrightened , flaring to 90 times its normal glow .
For seven years the Hubble Space Telescope has been watching the jet , which pours out of the supermassiveblack hole in the center of the M87 galaxy .
It has photographed the strangephenomenon fading and then brightening , with a peak that even outshines M87 ' sbrilliant core .
Scientists have dubbed the enigmatic bright blob HST - 1 , andare so far at a loss to explain its weird behavior .
" I did not expect the jet in M87 or any other jetpowered by accretiononto a black hole to increase in brightness in the way that this jetdoes , " said astronomer Juan Madrid of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , who conducted the Hubble study .
" It grew 90 times brighter thannormal .
But the question is , does this happen to every single jet or activenucleus , or are we seeing some odd behavior from M87 ? "
Many supermassive black holes have jetsof material that spray out perpendicularly from the donut - shaped ring ofmatter falling onto the black hole .
These beams of hot gas are thought toresult from magneticfield lines that are twisted by the black hole 's mass , and propel chargedparticles outward .
But most rays do not appear to blaze up with such extremeintensity as HST - 1 . Scientists aren?t sure if it is an exceptional case , or ifit represents a normal event for black hole jets , which are still not very wellunderstood .
In this case , the bright knot of HST - 1 is about 214 light - yearsfrom the M87 galaxy 's core
To learn more about this bizarre light show , Madrid analyzedthe seven years ' worth of Hubble images of the jet in ultraviolet light tocapture changes in HST - 1's behavior over time .
He also compared the Hubble datato photos of the jet taken in X - rays by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and inradio by other telescopes .
Madrid found that between 1999 and 2005 , the blobcontinually brightened .
By May 2005 , HST - 1 was 90 times brighter than it was in1999 .
After that , it seemed to fade , and then intensified again in November2006 .
" By watching the outburst over several years , I wasable to follow the brightness and see the evolution of the flare overtime , " Madrid says .
" We are lucky to have telescopes like Hubble and Chandra , because without them we would see the increase in brightness in thecore of M87 , but we would not know where it was coming from . "
More data will be needed to solve the mystery of why HST - 1acts the way it does .
" We hope the observations will yield some theories thatwill give us some good explanations as to the mechanism that is causing theflaring , " Madrid says .
" Astronomers would like to know if this is anintrinsic instability of the jet when it plows its way out of the galaxy , or ifit is something else . "
This strange case could provide a unique opportunity tolearn more about black hole jets in distant galaxies , which are difficult tostudy because they are so far away .
M87 is located 54 million light - years awayin the Virgo Cluster .
Madrid 's study is detailed in the April 2009 issue of the AstronomicalJournal .
Pet detectives received a tip off that Toots had been shot dead Pop star Sandi Thom is said to be " devastated " over reports that her missing cat has been shot dead .
The musician launched a hunt for Toots after she disappeared near her mother 's home in Edzell , Angus , six weeks ago .
She called in pet detectives Animal Search UK , who have since been tipped off that the cat has been shot and the body disposed of .
Sandi and the group have appealed for anyone with information about where Toots ' remains are to come forward .
The pet detectives were tipped off that the animal had been shot by a local person and disposed of along the banks of the West Water in the area .
On her website , the I Wish I was a Punk Rocker singer , who is originally from Aberdeenshire , said : " The police have confirmed it is illegal to shoot a cat .
" However , to enable them to make an arrest we have to find wee Tooty 's remains , or this sickening person will get away with it .
" How would this person behave , if someone walked up to his dog and shot it dead ? "
Sandi
Thom has pleaded for information about her cat Toots had lived with the musician in London but moved to Sandi 's mother 's home in Edzell .
After she disappeared on 27 February , posters were put up around the village asking for information .
Tom Watkins , the former police officer who set up Animal Search UK , said he is convinced the cat is dead and added that investigations are continuing to trace the alleged killer .
" It is good information we had , it 's pretty firm evidence that Toots has been shot .
" Sandi is devastated and has not really been able to think about anything apart from Toots since she found out .
She is terribly upset . "

A Chat with Chris O’Dowd ( “ The IT Crowd ” )
You lot over the UK may have been well familiar with “ The IT Crowd ” for quite some time now , but here the States , we ’ve only just recently gotten the opportunity to be introduced to it .
First , we had the Independent Film Channel ( IFC ) to thank , and now MPI Home Video has released Season 1 of the series onto DVD .
Actually , there had been talk that the set would be released quite some time ago , but , then , that was back when NBC was still threatening to give us an Americanized version of the show .
After those plans were canceled , so was the release of the set … ’ til now .
We had a chance to chat with Chris O’Dowd , who plays Roy on “ The IT Crowd , ” about his experiences on the show , and we took the opportunity to quiz him a bit about a couple of upcoming film roles , including the re-telling of “ Gulliver ’s Travels , ” starring Jack Black and Jason Segel .
Stay tuned for …
Chris O’Dowd : Hello , Will !
Bullz - Eye : Hello , Chris !
How are you ?
CO : I ’m really well .
I ’m walking on the beach in Venice .
BE : Now that ’s a nice place to be .
I ’m stuck in Virginia , and it ’s definitely not beach weather .
CO : Well , may I gloat as I walk .
( Chuckles )
BE : Oh , please do , I ’d appreciate that .
( Laughs )
Well , it ’s a pleasure to talk to you .
CO : Thanks very much .
BE : I ’m glad the “ The I.T. Crowd ” has finally gotten a DVD release over here .
They put it off forever , but it ’s here at last .
CO : Yeah , it ’s terrific .
I guess they kind of , you know , they ’ll wait for more series to come out before they start releasing it around the world .
BE : Well , I know it was originally in talks for release as soon as they were talking about bringing an American version to air .
But when that fell through , suddenly they yanked it from the schedule .
CO : Right , yeah .
It always works like that .
BE : But it ’s hilarious and , certainly , the comedy transcends British - ness … to say the least .
CO : Oh , that ’s great .
I ’m glad you enjoyed it .
BE : So what was your IT or computer background when you first took on the job ?
CO : Well , I mean , I knew a little bit about computers and stuff , and I have a lot of problems with computers .
Not necessarily technical problems , more like spillages and dropping stuff on laptop .
More like hand - to - mouth problems than Windows Vista or anything .
My brother - in - law is an IT guy , so I kind of use him a little bit for research for it .
And he ’s also kind of a grumpy IT guy , so I kind of used him a little bit for the characterization .
BE : Excellent .
So how much of a geek would you consider yourself to be ?
CO : I ’m , like , 18 % geek .
If I were to have to put a number on it , which I think I do , I ’m going to go with 18 % .
BE : That ’s not really a bad geek to normal quotient , I think .
CO : No , I mean , I like a lot of websites and some nerdy websites , but I ’m also able to play tennis .
BE : Just going outside is half the battle .
CO : Yeah , there you go .
I ’m not afraid of the sun .
BE : So how well developed a character was Roy when they first handed you the script ?
I mean , did he evolve considerably from script to first filming ?
CO : I mean , I guess the bigger change was that , in the script , he was English .
So then to make him Irish , because I ended up getting cast in it , was the biggest change .
But other than that , it was pretty much there .
Graham ( Linehan , who created the show ) likes to say that the characters essentially … both Roy and Moss are versions of him at a different time of his life .
So Roy is Graham at 25 and Moss is Graham at 15 .
So there ’s a lot of characterization there .
The writer is kind of basing it slightly on himself .
BE : So does Graham get out much these days ?
CO : No , he ’s got two kids , so he has n’t left the house since ’ 98 .
I think .
BE : How quickly did you feel the show became a hit in the UK ?
I mean , I got the impression that “ Have you tried turning it on and off again ? ” became a catch phrases almost right out of the box .
CO : Yeah , I mean , it did .
And it had a very specific audience very early on , and there was a lot of people that really , really loved it .
But I kind of feel that it really took off , in terms of the whole country , after the second series came out .
People had watched the repeats of the first series , and then the second series , we kind of ventured out of the office a little bit more , so it became a bit more universal .
I think around then , people really , really took to it .
BE : We did a review for the first season set for our site , and the fellow who did the review observed that he did n’t feel like it really took off as its own series until the fourth episode .
CO : Yeah , and I think that ’s probably fair .
Like I said , I think for me it was even the seventh or eighth episode , then it really kind of came into its own .
BE : Well , I think that he felt it was more of a traditional office comedy in the first three episodes , but then when you got the kind of surreal bit of bringing the Goth employee into the picture …
CO : No , I think that ’s a really good point .
It ’s the reality of the show that kind of permeates all of the normal , standard sitcom kind of stuff is what makes the show individual .
The more of that that we throw in , I think the better .
BE : Now you had plenty of television experience prior to coming aboard to this show .
You had worked on “ The Clinic ” and “ Roman ’s Empire ” .
CO : That ’s right .
Well , “ Roman ’s ” is actually after “ The IT Crowd ” .
BE : Oh , okay .
Sorry .
CO : No , that ’s alright .
I guess I did it after we shot the first season of “ The IT Crowd . ”
But , yeah , for three years , I had done kind of like a medical drama in Ireland .
But I was essentially playing the comedy character , I guess .
So I would just be kind of wheeled in to do a couple of gags and then leave again , never leaving the comfort of my chair .
It was a great ground in .
It was a nice way to learn how to shoot very quickly , which you generally have to do on a sitcom set .
BE : So when did you first get into acting ?
I mean , were you someone who did a little bit of stage first and then moved into television beyond that ?
CO : Yeah , I went to university and got a degree in politics .
While I was there , I got really involved in the drama society and everything .
I did a lot of plays , then decided to go to drama school in London .
I went and did that , then shuffled around doing some terrible part time job for a year or so until I got a break .
And that was maybe seven or eight years ago .
BE : How often does the degree in politics help you out these days ?
CO : Not once yet .
I imagine it ’s only a matter of time .
BE : Surely any day now .
CO : My major was in Northern Irish conflict , so I just need for that to kick off again for me to really come into my own .
So hopefully there will be a bit of terrorism up north soon , so I can look clever .
BE : I ’ll keep my fingers crossed for you .
CO : Yeah , thanks .
BE : So how well did the cast of “ The IT Crowd ” gel when you all first got together ?
Had you known either of the two ?
CO : Yeah , I knew them both , actually .
We all kind of …it was a very organic process of getting together , because Richard and I had done a film together called “ Festival ” , where we did n’t actually have much stuff together , but we hung out a lot .
And so he was the first one cast , and when they were stuck looking for my character , he suggested me .
So it was him that put me up for it .
And then I got cast .
And Katherine I had been in drama school with , and I thought she would be great .
So I asked them to audition her for it , and she got the job .
So it kind of worked like that .
So we all knew each other and we got on really well .
And we get on so , so well now .
It ’s amazing .
BE : I actually was familiar with Richard before I was familiar the rest of you , I guess courtesy of …
CO : Oh , “ Garth ( Merenghi ’s Darkplace ” ) !
BE : Yeah , absolutely .
CO : Oh , yeah , it ’s such a great show , is n’t it ?
BE : Yeah , they played it over here on the Sci -Fi Network , but they did n’t know what to make of it , so they moved it over to Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network .
I do n’t think they knew what to make of it , either .
But I just thought it was hilarious .
CO : Oh , yeah , I think it ’s such a great show .
He ’s such a clever guy .
He wrote and directed that as well , you know .
BE : I did .
And “ Dean Learner ” , I ’ve seen some clips of that as well .
CO : Yeah , there ’s some funny stuff in “ Dean Learner ” .
BE : So although I have n’t actually seen his episodes yet , I knew that Matt Berry is also on “ The IT Crowd ” as well .
CO : Oh , you ’re going to love it .
He does such a great job in the show .
BE : Yeah , his song “ One Track Lover ” from “ Darkplace ” …
CO : Oh , God , that is the funniest , funniest thing , is n’t it ?
BE : I ’ve actually got an MP3 of it on my iPod .
CO : Lovely .
He put out an album you know .
BE : I did not know that .
CO : Oh , you ’ve got to check it out .
Check out … I want to say it ’s called “ Witch Hazel ” or something .
So maybe Google “ witch hazel . ”
( Writer ’s note : I have no clue what O’Dowd was thinking about , because it turns out that Berry ’s album is called Opium . )
It ’s a whole album … because he kind of tours singing songs and doing a very odd comedy performance .
BE : Well , there ’s a clip of a live version of him doing “ One Track Lover , ” so I knew he had done some concerts .
But I did n’t know he actually had an album out .
CO : Oh , check it out .
You know , it ’s really well produced .
It ’s like a normal album , but it ’s kind of funny and quite surreal .
BE : Well , having not seen anything from the second or third seasons yet , how does the dynamic change on the series between the first one and the second ?
CO : I mean , in a way , I think we become more comfortable as performers .
In terms of dealing with the audience and stuff , it becomes a bit more … not necessarily naturalistic , but a bit more like we ’re in control .
And we ’re driving the comedy rather than the comedy driving us .
Sometimes I felt in the first series that we just got caught up a little bit trying to make the jokes sound great , rather than making the characters look good and letting the jokes speak for themselves .
If that makes any sense .
BE : Yeah , I understand that .
CO : So I think that , as the dynamic got a bit better , it became more character - based as a comedy , because we were doing it a bit better and he was able to write that in .
So the relationships are stronger , and then once the relationships are strong and you believe them , the situations can become even more absurd .
You know , in the first episode of the second season , I end up pretending that I ’m disabled for the entire episode .
There ’s also a gay musical called “ Gay . ” I mean , it ’s quite full on high farce but really natural and funny .
BE : Actually , speaking of gayness , a friend of mine over in the UK , when I asked her if she had any questions for me , said to ask you , “ Did you enjoy your gay kiss when you became football hooligans for the day ? ”
CO : Oh , yeah , that was funny .
I mean , I found it very odd that …
Richard really got into it .
I mean , a little bit more than I was comfortable with .
You know , the kissing was fine , but when he dropped the hands , it was a bit full on for me .
You know , we had n’t even been out for dinner .
BE : Yikes .
Well , I wanted to ask you a couple of things about some other stuff you ’ve been working on .
CO : Sure .
BE : Now are you still working on “ Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel , ” or is that fully wrapped ?
CO : No , that ’s done .
That ’s out in a few weeks .
BE : Alright .
Excellent .
CO : And a film of mine came out last week …or this week .
Actually , it opens today in London , called “ The Boat That Rocked ” .
BE : Oh , okay .
Right , I saw that on your IMDb page .
CO : Yeah , it ’s a new Richard Curtis film .
But it comes out stateside on the 28th of August .
BE : Well the time travel film , the concept alone had me immediately psyched .
CO : Sure , yeah , it ’s really fun , you know ?
And we ’ve got Anna Faris in it .
It ’s essentially about three guys … I ’m kind of the leader , who is obsessed with time travel .
Then we go to a pub and start drinking , and then one of the guys goes into a toilet and comes out and he ’s gone 15 minutes into the past .
So , like , it ’s a really low key time travel movie where we never actually leave the pub , but we travel forward and back in time .
And then towards the end of the evening , we ’re not sure whether it ’s really happened or whether we ’ve just drunk too much .
BE : Nice .
Yeah , I saw a description where they referred to it as a cross between “ Dr. Who ” meets “ Shaun of the Dead ” .
CO : Wow , that ’s nice .
I could live with that .
BE : You were in “ How to Lose Friends & Alienate People , ” albeit briefly .
CO : Yeah , very , very briefly .
Somebody said that Bob Weide was making a movie in London , and they called me up , like , a couple of days beforehand , and asked if I wanted to go in and do , like , a day on it .
I said , yeah .
I ’m a big “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ” fan , and he directs that , so I was there with bells on .
BE : And with “ The Boat That Rocked ” , I had actually read about it , I just did n’t realize it was coming out quite so quickly .
What was your knowledge of the whole pirate radio scene from the ‘ 60s , before going into the film ?
CO : I mean , my parents had told me a lot about it , and I ’m really into the music of that time .
So I listened to a lot of the recordings , and luckily there is so much stuff on YouTube and everything now .
So to get the tone and the taste of it right , I just listened to a lot of stuff .
And then we were all taught how to work the equipment of the time , which was really fun .
BE : Cool .
So what ’s the soundtrack of the film like ?
Is it a mixture of the popular and the obscure ?
CO : Yeah , it ’s incredible .
I mean , there ’s just so much great stuff on it .
You know it ’s The Kinks and The Who .
I think there is some Hendrix on there .
It ’s really , really great .
It ’s just every track is a classic track .
BE : And then you ’re also part of the TV series “ FM ” .
Is that right ?
CO : That ’s right , which is a show that I think airs its final episode of the first season tonight .
Where I play a modern Indie DJ .
BE : You ’re just making the radio rounds .
CO : I ’m just trying to free myself from being a nerd .
So I go to play DJs and sportsmen .
BE : Well , with that series , who was responsible for picking the artists who performed on there ?
CO : On “ FM ” ?
I guess the producers were , you know .
BE : Okay .
I did n’t know if the cast themselves got to have any say or not .
CO : I mean , we kind of …I think I vetoed a couple of bands , but that ’s as far as it went .
BE : Well , I saw that Hot Leg , with Justin Hawkins singing , was in the first episode .
CO : That ’s right ; he is in the first episode .
BE : I have yet to hear his new band , but I was a huge Darkness fan .
CO : Yeah , I was a Darkness fan .
I have n’t heard his new band , either .
He ’s a nice guy , though .
He was really fun .
BE : So where do your personal music tastes lie ?
CO : Oh , I mean , I go through phases , you know ?
I listen to a lot of Indie music , a lot of new bands and stuff .
But then I ’ll also listen to …I like a lot of Gospel stuff .
Sam Cooke and Al Green , Dorothy Cole , and stuff like that .
And then I ’ll go into a bit of a Dylan phase for awhile , and then people who are trying to imitate Dylan .
You know , it comes and goes .
BE : What ’s the word on “ Gulliver ” ?
CO : “ Gulliver ’s Travels ” starts in three weeks time .
I actually fly back to London this weekend to start learning how to ride a horse .
BE : Oh , nice .
CO : Yeah , so that ’s going to be interesting .
BE : I take it you have no equestrian background at all ?
CO : I really do n’t .
I ’m fucking shitting myself .
And I ’m a big guy ; I ’m , like , 6 ′ 4 ″ , so I have no idea what size this fucking horse is going to be .
So I ’ve decided on day one , I ’m just going to let him know who ’s boss .
BE : Probably the best way to handle it .
CO : Which will consist of me quietly whispering into his ear , “ Mr. Horse , you are the boss . ”
BE : So when you found out who all was going to be in the cast of the film ( Jack Black , Jason Segel , and Emily Blunt ) , did you just completely shit yourself ?
/ strong >
CO : Yeah , I mean , it was really exciting .
I went to see “ I Love You , Man ” last night .
BE : Oh , that ’s great , is n’t it ?
CO : I loved it .
I kind of fell in love with Jason Segel a bit .
So I ’m really looking forward to working with him .
During the audition process , I did some stuff with Jack , so I got to meet him and he was really nice .
So I ’m really excited about it , they are great people .
BE : Be sure to quiz Jason Segel all about his Muppet movie he is writing .
CO : He ’s writing a Muppet movie ?
BE : Absolutely .
He has apparently finished the script .
CO : I did n’t know about that .
Wow , how exciting !
BE : So back to the “ The IT Crowd . ” I know you were not cast within the American version that was planned , but how much were you all involved on the backend ?
I mean , were people coming to you to find out how to play your character in the American version ?
CO : No , I never talked to any of them .
I mean , they did ask me to be involved quite early on , but I was shooting that “ Roman ’s Empire ” thing , so I could n’t do the pilot .
But I have n’t seen it , I do n’t really know anything about it , to be honest .
BE : Okay .
Yeah , I mean , I know the situation was that the network changed presidents and the new guy was less thrilled than the old guy , but …
CO : Yeah , yeah , that ’s what I heard .
BE : Did you ever hear any reports from Richard about his experience working on the pilot ?
CO : I think he had a good time , you know .
The only problem , I thought , was that it was the same script and it was the same blocking , so it might have been a bit boring .
That was the only thing that struck me about it .
BE : Well , that ’s what they kind of did with “ The Office ” in the States , too .
The first couple of episodes were identical to the original , and then they expanded .
CO : Yeah , it ’s surprising that they did n’t really learn from it .
Because I really thought the American “ Office ” just really took off when they stopped worrying about the British one .
I do n’t know why they did n’t try to do the same .
BE : Right , exactly .
And actually , on a related note , when “ The IT Crowd ” originally premiered , were “ The Office ” comparisons … did you just get tons of those from the critics immediately ?
CO : No , I mean , because the tone of the show was so strange .
I remember before anybody saw the show , everybody was , like , “ Oh , God , another show set in an office . ”
But then once you watch the show , I mean , it ’s just so completely different in tone and characterization .
I ca n’t remember any critic mentioning “ The Office . ”
They are just so completely different .
BE : Right .
I just did n’t know … the mere fact that they were set in an office , a lot of critics enjoy using the easy crutch .
CO : Yeah , absolutely .
I guess they did before they saw it .
But also Graham , you know , is a very renowned comedy writer in Britain , so he would generally miss all of that kind of crap .
Do you know what I mean ?
BE : Oh yeah , definitely .
I ’ve got the “ Father Ted ” box set , so I ’m definitely well versed .
CO : Yeah , I mean , anybody who decides to write a program about three priests on an island is never going to get hassled for doing nothing original .
BE : Oh , and something else I meant to ask about .
Neil Hannon does some of the music for the show .
CO : That ’s right .
He does the theme tune
BE : Yeah , I ’m a very big Divine Comedy fan .
CO : Oh. yeah , he ’s a great guy .
BE : Do you have any idea how he got hooked up with the show ?
I know he had also worked for “ Father Ted , ” too .
CO : Well , he did a lot on “ Ted , ” I guess , so Graham and he must be kind of close , and he got him again .
BE : Does he , like , pop ’round the set or anything ?
CO : We ’ve played poker a few times , and he really likes the show .
BE : How ’s his poker face ?
CO : Pretty terrible .
I think I actually won the Divine Comedy back catalog .
BE : Oh nice .
Very nice .
If you could get that reissued in the states , that would be great .
CO : I do n’t even mean the CDs .
I mean I think I won the rights .
And it was just on a pair of queens .
BE : Well , that ’s just ridiculous .
So what ’s your favorite episode from the first season , if you can think back that far , given how far ahead you are now ?
CO : God , let me think .
What is there ?
God , remind me what there was .
BE : Well , I have to admit , my favorite episode was when you premiered the Goth character .
There is the episode about stress , the episode where Moss starts the fire .
CO : Oh , yeah .
Actually , I think that ’s the same episode .
BE : Actually , I think you ’re right .
Sorry , I forgot what was the A story and what was the B story there .
CO : You know what , I ’m going to go with the Goth in the cupboard as well .
Yeah , I think that ’s really funny .
Noel is so funny in that .
BE : Cradle of Filth does not get enough sitcom love , for my money .
CO : Oh wow , that ’s amazing .
The Cradle of Filth .
The Funeral .
BE : Does Richmond continue to pop up during the show beyond the first season ?
CO : He does .
He ’s in the second season , but not so much in the third season , because he did his own show .
But hopefully he will be back for the fourth .
BE : I understand that Denholm has a bit of an issue where he , uh , goes to hell at some point .
CO : That ’s right .
That ’s really funny .
Matt Berry comes in and plays Denholm ’s son .
After Denholm dies , then he …at some stage , he blacks out and he sees his father down a very lightened corridor and thinks that it ’s the doorway to heaven , but then Hitler jumps out .
Chris Morris tells him it ’s not Hitler , it ’s just a fancy dress party in heaven .
BE : What ’s your favorite absurd quirk about Roy ’s character ?
CO : Oh , it does n’t really come to the forefront in the first season , but later on , we find out that he is really , really cheap .
Somebody lends him 20 pounds , and he spends the rest of the episode trying to get it back .
BE : Do you have a favorite of the geek related shirts that you wear or have worn ?
CO : Oh , yeah , I like the “ Look at the fucking manual ” one , with Chairman Mao on the front .
What is it ?
RTFM , or something like that .
BE : Right .
Yeah , “ Read the fucking manual . ” Excellent .
Alright , well I think that ’s pretty much everything I ’ve got here .
CO : Great .
Thanks so much , man .
Hope you enjoyed the beautiful day on the beach .
( Laughs )
Thanks very much , and thanks for talking to me !
The World of Dentistry for the Rest of Us
Feb 13 , 2009 ( CIDRAP News ) –
With money for pandemic influenza preparedness stripped from a huge economic stimulus bill that appears headed for final congressional approval , public health advocates say they have to look to the regular budgeting process for the next chance to get some pandemic funding .
The House of Representatives had included $ 900 million in pandemic preparedness funds in its version of the massive stimulus package , but it appeared that all but $ 50 million was removed by the conference committee that ironed out differences between the House and Senate versions , said Richard Hamburg , government relations director for the nonpartisan , nonprofit group Trust for America 's Health ( TFAH ) .
The House passed the $ 787 billion compromise bill this afternoon by a vote of 246- 183 , with no Republican support , the New York Times reported .
The story said the Senate was expected to approve the measure this evening .
The $ 50 million left in the bill , listed as a Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund , is for improving information technology security at the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , Hamburg said .
The sums removed included $ 420 million for pandemic flu and $ 430 million for biomedical advanced research and development , he reported .
Now it 's back to the regular budget process for those seeking pandemic and other public health preparedness funds , leaders of public health groups say .
" Hopefully in the president 's budget for 2010 there will again be funding and decisions about funding for preparedness , " said Robert ( Bobby ) Pestronk , executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials .
The Obama administration is expected to propose its 2010 budget soon .
Nothing left in pipeline
Hamburg said there is no more pandemic preparedness money in the pipeline for state and local public health .
" The $ 600 million that was made available in December 2005 , in the fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental bill , the last of those dollars went out the door this past August , " he said .
In addition to the cutoff of pandemic flu funding , public health agencies have seen their " all hazards " preparedness funding drop about 25 % since 2005 , Hamburg said .
TFAH and its partners are advocating for another $ 350 million specifically for pandemic readiness and additional money for other public health emergencies , he said .
Fiscal year 2009 budget legislation is still awaiting action , and it could include some pandemic money , but it would all be for federal activities , according to Hamburg .
He said President Bush 's proposed 2009 budget included $ 507 million in one - time spending for pandemic vaccines and countermeasures , plus $ 312 million for annual recurring pandemic activities at HHS , but no funds for state and local activities .
Hamburg expects that Congress may take up the labor and HHS funding bill , which includes that money , later this month .
Some public health money survived
Although pandemic money was stripped from the stimulus package , still included is about $ 1 billion to support various other state and local public health activities , according to Pestronk .
He said it appears that the sum includes $ 300 million for community vaccination programs and $ 50 million for healthcare - associated infections .
Funds are also targeted for " evidence - based programs to address chronic disease and to support current and new workforce development for public health . "
The vaccination funds are part of the Section 317 program , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunization program mainly for uninsured and underinsured children , he said .
" Overall it looks like there will be over $ 1 billion available , " Pestronk said .
" I think that while the amounts initially talked about in the Senate committee and in the full House were greater , this is still a success for the public health community . "
Story of the deleted $ 900 million
Hamburg said the $ 900 million that was dropped from the stimulus package essentially represented the final installment of the $ 7.1 billion that President Bush proposed for pandemic preparedness back in 2005 .
In his proposed 2008 budget , Bush asked for a one - time appropriation of $ 870 million for vaccines , antivirals , and diagnostics , Hamburg explained .
But that was cut from the final budget legislation .
Then last August , Bush made a supplemental budget request that included the $ 870 million , which was for different purposes than the $ 507 million that was part of the 2009 budget proposal , he said .
" So when the stimulus bill came up , our supporters in Congress saw an opportunity to take care of the $ 870 million request , with the assumption that the $ 507 million would be taken care of in the regular appropriations process , " Hamburg said .
A Senate committee had approved the inclusion of $ 870 million in the stimulus bill , but that was removed before the full Senate voted on it .
The House supported $ 900 million , but that was deleted by the House - Senate conference committee .
Hamburg said a number of lawmakers felt that pandemic funding should be handled in the regular appropriations process , not in an economic stimulus measure .
" Now we 'll need to take a look at opportunities starting with the fiscal year 2010 funding cycle and the [ proposed ] budget we 'll see in the next month or so , " he said .
Dr. Paul Jarris , executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials , said yesterday , " We are extremely concerned about the diminishing funding for state and local preparedness as well as the removal of all funding for pandemic flu , and the decrease in funding for hospital preparedness .
Along with the state budget cuts , this is a matter of losing the infrastructure created over the past several years . "
Looking ahead , he said , " We will pursue everything we possibly can , but there are no guarantees .
I would n’t ' say there are any promising leads we 're following right now .
It seems that Congress is turning a blind eye to state and local health preparedness . "
Derek Smalls :
Well , it ’s less horseshit .
Tufnel : Less horseshit .
Less grass in the infield …
Less dirt .
Saddles are smaller — less leather .
Less money , it turns out , because no one actually wants to see it .
Less interest .
It ’s a less is more .
St. Hubbins : I ’ve been managing acts .
Actually , recently I was really excited by the success of some female tribute bands : AC / DShe and Lez Zeppelin .
So I ’ve gone out on the road with some bands , Girl Jam .
And of course R.E.Emma­—very successful .
And we ’re branching out into the oldies field .
Blood Sweat & Cramps .
Manfried Woman .
And I just made a deal with Alice Cooper .
It ’s called Jim Cooper .
Derek , are you still the “ lukewarm water ” between [ David and Nigel ’s ] “ fire and ice ” ?
Smalls : I think we ’ve all gone a bit lukewarm in the intervening years .
It ’s the magic of age .
Marty DiBergi :
You ’ve gotten out of rehab , though .
You were in rehab .
The last time I talked to Derek , he was in rehab because he was addicted to the Internet .
Smalls :
There ’s no was addicted … I ’m still addicted .
DiBergi :
But you ’re not in the rehab place anymore .
Smalls :
Not in the rehab place .
Had a great year .
Had a business venture , which did well for a while .
I think the economy killed it , really .
It was a chain of decaf - coffee stores called Kips .
Because you want your little shot , but you ’d like to take a nap .
St. Hubbins :
That ’s a brilliant idea .
Smalls : I thought it was a brilliant idea .
St. Hubbins :
You could also serve little carob bars too . …
As long as it ’s brown and fake , you ’ll take it .
Smalls :
It did n’t work out .
This bloke who I was partnered with said , “ Let ’s go the other way , because people obviously want their jolt .
They do n’t want their caffeine — they want the jolt .
There ’s this decaffeinated coffee beans that I can source from Colombia somewhere that still gives them the jolt . ”
So we changed the name of the chain to Kups , with a K , because we just had to pay to change one letter — we ’d paid for all the signs .
And I find out he ’s injecting meth into the coffee .
DiBergi : Really ?
Smalls :
It really gave you a jolt .
It defeated its own purpose .
Tufnel :
And that ’s an illegal thing , init ?
Smalls :
Well , that ’s where the money went , it ’s all illegal stuff .
DiBergi :
Have you guys been writing anything ?
St. Hubbins : Derek and I have been working on a new song .
We ’ve got to do some serious woodshedding , though .
Does it have a title , the new song ?
Smalls : “ Do n’t Get Old . ”
St. Hubbins :
It ’s all about it not getting old .
What not getting old ?
St. Hubbins : It .
All of it .
All of what we do .
How do you stay relevant after all these years ?
Smalls :
We never were relevant .
That ’s the key .
St. Hubbins :
We never had the pain of seeing relevance slip away from us .
Tufnel :
You ca n’t chase relevance .
You ca n’t be wed to it .
You ca n’t look at it like a religion .
If you look in the mirror and see it , you ’ve made a mistake .
That ’s your first mistake .
What about groupies ?
What would you say is the average age of a Spinal Tap groupie in the year 2008 ?
Smalls :
It ’s not the age , it ’s the circumference that ’s worrying .
St. Hubbins :
For some reason , because of a certain song , we do attract the larger south end .
Tufnel :
Once in awhile there ’s a granddaughter of someone from the original days , and that ’s always interesting .
The typical age : I would say between 50 and 70 .
Total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were 7,282 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent in 2007 , an increase of 1.4 percent from the 2006 level .
The U.S .
Environmental Protection Agency on Friday declared that greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide endanger human health and welfare , clearing the way for possible U.S. regulation .
The EPA said it found that “ greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations ” and human activities spur global warming .
“ These high atmospheric levels are the unambiguous result of human emissions , and are very likely the cause of the observed increase in average temperatures and other climatic changes , ” the agency said in its finding , released online at epa.gov .
Regulation is not automatically triggered by the finding , the agency said .
There will be a 60 - day comment period .
The environmental agency said motor vehicles contribute to rising greenhouse emissions and the “ threat of climate change . ”
It said five other greenhouse gases also endanger health and contribute to global warming in addition to carbon dioxide — which is emitted by natural and human - made sources , including coal - fired power plants , oil refineries and fossil - fueled vehicles .
The other five gases are methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons , and sulfur hexafluoride .

Re : Your on - air bashing of Free Republic
So , you think that because one poster on FR comments that a diabetic supreme court nominee might not live to a ripe old age that all 350,000 of us are insensitive right - wing loons ?
Got news for you pal .
The owner of Free Republic ( namely me ) is diabetic and I 've already lost one leg due to this despicable disease and the other leg looks like it 's ready to fall off any day now .
My sister died of complications brought on by juvenile diabetes at the tender age 43 .
I 've out - lived her in years , but I do n't think I 'll be signing on to any life term judgeships .
And I sure as hell would n't wish this disease on anyone else .
Hey , what can I say .
My political enemies make fun of the one - legged old gimp every day of the week .
Good thing I 'm not as sensitive as you about such nonsensical non-issues .
And if it 's impossible for a minority to be racist , then it 's impossible for a diabetic to be insensitive .
/ sarc
But , I do agree with you on one thing .
We FReepers are a bunch of right - wing loons , bitterly clinging to our guns and religion .
And proud of it you elitist gasbag !

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
It 's time to debate legalizing marijuana in California - so says Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
As the state faces mounting deficits , the governor says he 's open to talking about different ways to create revenue .
Although Schwarzenegger does n't think the state should rush to judgment and start taxing and legalizing pot right now , he says he 's interested in looking at other countries that have legalized it to see what effect it 's had .
A cannabis plant is pictured .
Cannabis is known as marijuana in its herbal form .
Schwarzenegger 's comments come as support grows nationwide for legalizing pot .
In California , a recent poll found for the first time a majority of voters back legalization .
One California lawmaker says regulating and taxing marijuana would bring the state as much as $ 1.3 billion a year in extra revenue .
Proponents say it 's about more than just money ; it 's about the failure of the war on drugs and implementing " a more enlightened policy . "
One advocate tells
The San Francisco Chronicle that Schwarzenegger 's comments represent " a tectonic shift " in attitudes on the issue , saying : " The public is going to drag the politicians into doing what is right . "
But not everyone is so sure this would be the right move .
Some lawmakers say the potential revenue would hardly make a dent in California 's deficit - which could soon reach $ 20 billion .
They say this is just a sign of the governor 's " growing desperation " over the budget .
Here ’s my question to you :
Is legalizing marijuana the answer to the government 's money problems ?
Tune in to the Situation Room at 5 pm to see if Jack reads your answer on air .
And , we love to know where you ’re writing from , so please include your city and state with your comment .
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Ray from Nashville , Tennessee writes :
It wo n't solve the problem of the deficit , but it would help a little with revenues .
More importantly , our court system would rid itself of a huge burden created by petty pot violations .
Think of the money that would be saved by not having to bust , try and jail these people .
It 's a win -win situation .
M. writes :
There are too many people making too much money from this drug being illegal : cops , prisons , courts , and all the people they employ take home good paychecks from weed .
Tim from Texas writes :
Would you start smoking pot if it were legalized , Jack ?
How about Wolf ?
Does the fact that it is not legal prevent anyone from smoking it ?
The point here is that whether it 's legal or not has no effect on whether people use it or not .
So why not make it legal and tax it ?
For a billion dollars you could pay 20,000 teachers 50 K a year .
Kathy from Wilcox , Alabama writes :
Legalizing pot wo n't eliminate government deficits .
But it 's a viable idea to discuss .
If anything , legalizing pot would pacify large segments of the population into not worrying so much about deficits .
I 've never encountered aggression or anger in a pot smoker .
But I 've seen a lot of bruises and broken lives caused by alcoholics .
Sam from Orlando writes :
Absolutely !
Marijuana should be legalized and taxed , that 's more money .
Satisfying munchies means more money .
Taxing rolling paper means more money .
Less violent crimes equals less need for enforcement resources , which means more money .
We can have a more friendly society , crooks and coppers hugging and holding hands while sharing some fine government ganja .... it would be beautiful .
Guy from Atlanta writes :
Dude , I was going to post something but I forgot what it was .
Have a nice day !
Mahinda Rajapaksa :
It is my duty to protect the people Sri Lanka 's President Mahinda Rajapaksa has again ruled out a ceasefire with Tamil Tiger rebels and says the West should not lecture him about it .
He was speaking a day after visiting UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French counterpart Bernard Kouchner had called for a truce .
Mr Rajapaksa said the rebels still had " a little time left " to surrender .
He said foreign envoys should not preach about civilian welfare or believe " the propaganda of terrorists " .
The Sri Lankan military has restricted Tamil Tiger rebels to a 10 sq km ( 6 sq miles ) area of land in the north and believes it is close to defeating them .
See a map of the region
Tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped in the area or are in government - run camps for displaced people .
' Winning the peace ' Mr Rajapaksa said : " We have no plans to go for a ceasefire with the Tigers , but they have a little time left to drop their weapons and surrender even though our military operation is at a final stage . "
Mr Rajapaksa said foreign envoys were " trying to preach to us about civilians " .
" We have seen how Afghanistan is bombed .
Those who come to preach to us [ have ] seen how Afghanistan is bombed .
It must be made clear that before accusing others , you must have the strength to know what you do yourself , " he said .
The French and UK envoys had called for a truce " It is my duty to protect the people of this country .
I do n't need lectures from Western representatives . "
The UN and EU have persistently called for a ceasefire and expressed concern at civilian deaths .
The Sri Lankan government this week said it had stopped using heavy weapons in the conflict zone but the Tamil Tigers say artillery and air attacks are continuing .
Mr Rajapaksa said : " If I say we do n't use heavy weapons , that means we do n't .
But these foreign envoys are prepared to believe the propaganda of a terrorist organisation . "
The pro-rebel TamilNet website said the UK and French mission had " failed " and the Tigers were expecting " the worst phase of massacre any time soon " .
A Tamil Tiger representative , Puleedevan , saying he was speaking from the war zone , told the BBC's Charles Haviland that the rebels would not surrender until they had - as he put it - safeguarded the " legitimate rights " of Tamils , rights which , he said , were all denied to them .
On Wednesday , Mr Miliband said : " Now is the time for the fighting to stop .
Sri Lanka 's military advances have been spectacular , but winning the peace is as vital as winning the war . "
He repeated his call for a truce when speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday , saying the Sri Lankan government should " give unhindered access to the UN and other aid agencies to provide much needed relief to tens of thousands of civilians trapped by the fighting " .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war , but that figure could now be far higher .

ZeusTracker and the Nuclear Option
One of the scarier realities about malicious software is that these programs leave ultimate control over victim machines in the hands of the attacker , who could simply decide to order all of the infected machines to self - destruct .
Most security experts will tell you that while this so - called " nuclear option " is an available feature in some malware , it is hardly ever used .
Disabling infected systems is counterproductive for attackers , who generally focus on hoovering as much personal and financial data as they can from the PCs they control .
But try telling that to Roman Hüssy , a 21 - year - old Swiss information technology expert , who last month witnessed a collection of more than 100,000 hacked Microsoft Windows systems tearing themselves apart at the command of their cyber criminal overlords .
Hüssy oversees Zeustracker , a Web site listing Internet servers that use Zeus , a kit sold for about $ 700 on shadowy cyber criminal forums to harvest data from computers infected with a password stealing Trojan horse program .
One of Zeus 's distinguishing features is a tool that helps each installation on a victim PC look radically different from the next as a means to evade detection by anti-virus tools .
According to Hüssy , among Zeus 's many features is the " kos " option , which stands for " kill operating system . "
The help file distributed with Zeus kits includes the following Google - translated explanation of this feature :
kos - incapacitate OS , namely grip branches HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry and / or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE .
If you have sufficient privileges - fly to " blue screen " , in other cases creates the brakes .
Following these steps , loading OS will not be possible !
In early April , Hüssy began tracking a Zeus control server used to receive data stolen from a botnet of more than 100,000 infected systems , mostly located in Poland and Spain .
While investigating this newfound Zeus control server , he noticed something unusual : the " kill operating system " had just been issued to all 100,000 infected systems .
Hüssy said he has no idea why the botnet was destroyed .
" Maybe the botnet was hijacked by another crime group , " he offered in an online chat with Security Fix .
Then again , maybe the individuals in control over that ill - fated botnet simply did n't understand what they were doing .
" Many cyber criminals ... using the Zeus crimeware kit are n't very skilled , " Hüssy said .
Researchers at the S21sec blog have their own theory : that maybe attackers wield the nuclear option to buy themselves more time to use the stolen data .
" The point more probably for a phisher is to earn time , " writes S21's Jozef Gegeny .
" Taking the victim away from Internet connection - before the unwanted money transfer is realized and further actions could be taken . "
As one might imagine , bad guys who control these Zeus crimeware servers are n't always too happy about having their networks called out .
Since my interview with Hüssy on Wednesday , his site has come under a fairly massive distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack , no doubt from systems under the control of Zeus botmasters .
This is hardly the first time Hüssy has been targeted .
His site at abuse.ch was similarly attacked last summer .
Then , early one morning in August 2008 , local police roused him from slumber to check on his whereabouts .
Turns out , cyber crooks had been circulating a fake suicide note sent in his name to hundreds of thousands of Swiss residents .
Zeustracker divides the sites used to control infected systems into several camps :
Those apparently hosted at so - called " bulletproof hosting " services that specialize in remaining online despite significant pressure from law enforcement and foreign governments ; those hosted on free Web hosting services , and those hosted on apparently legitimate but otherwise compromised Web servers .
One of hacked servers -- johnnybees.com -- was added to Zeustracker on Feb. 13 , 2009 .
The site belongs to John Natoli , a graphic Web designer from central New Jersey .
Natoli said he had been working with his hosting provider to resolve the problem , which he said he first noticed about a month ago when odd files began showing up on his server .
Natoli said he did n't know what the files were or where they were coming from , until being contacted by Security Fix .
What he could n't have known is that Zeus encrypts both the data stolen from infected systems and the configuration files left on servers that tell Zeus - infected systems which bank Web sites the attackers are trying to steal credentials for each day .
In either case , the files would appear to anyone without the encryption key to be gibberish - filled files .
" I was continually deleting these suspicious files off my servers .
It got kind of out of control , " Natoli said , noting that he thinks the problem has been resolved , as he has n't seen any new files in several weeks .
" My hosting company provided me with some scripts that were supposed to clean things up . "
Currently , about one - third of the sites listed at Zeustracker are hacked or free Web services .
Imagine the good that the affected ISPs and hosting providers could do by working with customers to clean up these hosts .

SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNET ) --
In an industry dominated by men , leave it to women to come up with the winning idea in a contest to create a concept for a video game about losing one 's virginity .
Two women won a contest this week to create a concept for a video game about losing one 's virginity .
On Wednesday , at the Game Developers Conference here , the two - woman team of Heather Kelley and Erin Robinson won the Game Design Challenge with just 36 hours of preparation , while their competitors had weeks to come up with concepts for a game about " your first time . "
This was the sixth straight year of the design challenge , hosted annually by New York - based game developer Eric Zimmerman .
The contestants are generally top - tier game designers like two - time winner and Spore and The Sims creator Will Wright , Deus Ex lead designer Harvey Smith , or 2008 winner and Leather Goddesses of Phobos creator Steve Meretzsky .
The contestants are generally given several weeks to come up with a concept for a game based on some sort of unusual challenge posed by Zimmerman .
Past themes have included a game about love , a game based on the poetry of Emily Dickinson , and a game that could win the Nobel Peace Prize .
" We are in a medium that is just incredibly plastic , " Zimmerman said .
" We can put anything up on the screen ... Still , we find every year that most of the money being put into games is put into a relatively narrow ( set of ) genres " that tends to include monsters , dragons , and the like .
Zimmerman added that the purpose of the challenge is " to think about how we can create games that really break away " from what 's been done so many times before .
Sex and autobiography have been constant themes in literature , film , and theater , Zimmerman argued , pointing to " Lolita , " the work of Henry Miller , Chaim Potok 's novel , " My name is Asher Lev , " and the films of Fellini and Woody Allen .
But while Zimmerman touted the widespread historical acceptance of the theme of autobiographical sex , he noted with some dismay that veteran game designer Kim Swift , who works for Valve and who created the award - winning Portal , had originally been slated to be among the contestants but had eventually been pressured by Valve to withdraw due to the theme .
" I 'm saying this as a fan of Valve , " Zimmerman said , " but I do find it frustrating and disturbing that Kim would be pulled from the panel . "
Still , he said , after word got around about Swift 's withdrawal , Lapis designer Kelley and independent developer Robinson volunteered to step up and compete .
The two ended up facing off against Meretzsky , on hand to defend his crown , and Habbo Hotel lead designer Sulka Haro .
And in the end , while all three submissions were well - received , the duo of Kelley and Robinson were judged by the audience to have very closely beaten out Meretzsky .
The two women came up with a concept for " Our first times , " and presented it as a two - level game , one level for Kelley 's experience and the other for Robinson's .
They imagined a series of mini games that could be played on Nintendo 's Wii , or possibly on Apple 's iPhone .
Kelley began by explaining that her game would commence with the player having to pick an outfit for a date that was intended to conclude with their deflowering .
It would have to be the least complicated outfit possible , she said , nothing with zippers that get stuck , or too many buttons or ties .
Then , there would be a mini game in which players would have to shave their legs , making especially sure not to miss the all - important spot " by the knees . "
Next up , dinner , and making sure to remove all the garlic from the meals , something the main character -- clearly a female , since the game was presented from a woman 's perspective -- would have to do because of the general cluelessness of the boyfriend in question .
The next mini game would revolve around choosing the proper mood music from a selection of LPs - - yes , records , since the game would be set in the timeframe of Kelley 's first time .
And clearly , she said , Miles Davis would have to be the choice .
The penultimate mini game would task the player with " not falling off the top bunk " in a college dorm room , " while the final task would involve flicking off the smirking roommate .
The Robinson level also involved a series of mini games that commenced with " driving home from ultimate - Frisbee practice " and setting the radio station in a car -- perhaps using the Wiimote dial , she said -- to anything except country music .
Next would be a stop at a drug store to buy a brand of condoms that does n't terrify you , and then going " back to his place , " and grappling with adjusting the tracking on his " antiquated " VCR .
Being a game concept presented from the woman 's perspective , the next mini game would revolve around " making the first move .
Poor guy . "
And then , afterward , calling the best friend to tell the tale .
" But you have to be careful , " Robinson said , " because she 's next to mom and grandma on the speed dial . "
Perhaps given their short notice , the mini - game concepts created by Kelley and Robinson were n't very fleshed out , something that was a shame since they seemed to be onto something .
But the crowd appreciated how much effort they had put into the storyboards they 'd created , and forgave the rudimentary fleshing out of the details .
Meretzsky 's concept -- which came in a very close second -- ended up revolving around the idea of moving beyond the awkwardness of fumbling high school attempts at romance .
But before explaining his final design , he talked at length about the challenges of coming up with a game idea when every possible title was too overtly sexual .
He said he tried out " Where 's dildo , " but discarded it because " it had nothing to do with my autobiography . "
And then , he thought " about the almost too obvious genre of first - person shooters . "
He also threw away " Call of Booty " -- because it would have " problems that would keep it off the shelf at Wal - Mart " -- and then almost settled on a beat - matching idea called " Hump Hump Revolution . "
And , playing off the title of Swift 's hit game , as well as a popular 2008 film , he said he nearly ended up with " Zack & Miri make a Portal , " but " my business people tell me paying licenses for two different ( intellectual properties ) is a non-starter . "
In the end , he said , he came up with a three - act structure for a game based in the virtual world , Second Life , where act one involves the awkward era of high school , the second act is the more promising college years and finally , act three , happiness in the form of a series of vignettes including dates , a wedding , and then , home life .
The game , he said , would be called , " Wait , time passes . "
" No matter how picked on you are , " Meretzsky said , " this too shall pass .
Your time will come , and you will find happiness and your place in the world . "
Of the six Game Design Challenges , this year 's felt the most wanting for detail and working game mechanics .
That may have been because the contestants ' task of building something autobiographical did n't meld well with game design .
Still , the crowd , which was heavy with game designers , appreciated the efforts and shouted out their support for all three contestants .
After all , in the end , the point was to take a particularly challenging game design topic and create something that could plausibly be a working title .
And who would know better the difficulties of doing so than a room full of game designers ?

Shortly before my vacations ( Ferie i Norge ! )
I want summarize what happened in Perl 6 land .
Specification
Many small corrections improved the consistency of the specification , but the biggest area of development was the language mutability and interaction of various languages .
There are various dialects that inherit some of the main language 's syntactic features , but are quite different : quotes , regexes , quasi quotes ( for macros ) , transliterations etc .
Those are now called slangs , and for example declaring a new backslash assertion in a regex now works like this ( r26734 ) :
augment slang Regex { token backslash : sym<y > { y\w + } }
The various slangs are available via the ~ twigil , for example $ ~ Regex refers to the current braid of the Regex slang ( r26733 ) .
Implementations
Rakudo
There were , as usual , many activities in Rakudo .
Jonathan Worthington finished his Hague grant on the multi dispatcher and object orientation , and applied for a new one , covering ( among other features ) parallel dispatch ( of the form @array >>. method( @args ) ) and user defined traits .
He started his work already ( and seems to have finished a good part already ) , even though the grant committee has n't yet approved .
He also implemented much nicer error message : they now contain a stack trace of the Perl 6 functions only ( used to be also internal subs ) , and each position in the call chain is annotated with file name and line number .
This brings Rakudo an important step closer to real - world usability .
Patrick Michaud implemented basic parsing of the «... » quotes , fixed some Unicode issues , and implemented operator definitions and overloading ( things like precedence and associativity are still missing , but it 's very impressive nonetheless ) .
chromatic tirelessly optimized Parrot and Rakudo startup ( Rakudo startup used to be about one second ) with good success .
Stephen " Tene " Weeks put Rakudo into its own high level language ( HLL ) namespace , which is Parrot 's tool to avoid leakage of Parrot symbols into Perl 6's namespaces , and to simplify interaction with other languages .
Sadly this make Rakudo a bit slow , eliminating about half of chromatic 's speed improvements .
SMOP
Paweł Murias continued the refactoring of smop and mildew , working ( as far as I can tell ) on attributes , method signatures and control exceptions .
Miscellaneous
Smartlinks
Gabor Szabo released the smartlinks utility as Text :: Smartlinks to CPAN , and implemented the linking to the various S32 documents , and published a keyword index to the synopsis documents .
Test suite
In the test suite there are 50 to 60 files ( with a total of about 230 tests ) left that are under consideration / review to moved into t/ spec / , the official part of the test suite .
Commit activity in the test suite :
( The last spike is caused by me using git-svn .
Every other weekend I 'm offline and do some work on the test suite .
With svn that resulted in one huge commit , with git - svn that results in many more smaller commits . )
I did some useless statistics on who committed how much , and found that there were twelve hackers who had at least 100 commits to the test suite each :
# Commits Nick 1259 moritz 916 audreyt 548 iblech 279 lwall 230 jnthn 212 pmichaud 152 corion 148 agentz 145 putter 123 Stevan 117 cosimo 107 Auzon
We had commits from 132 different accounts in the test suite .
Web.pm
The TPF grant for producing a Web framework on top of Perl 6 seems to progress nicely , for example it enabled the quick building of a blogging application .
Like most boys , 13 - year - old Mykel Mendes looked up to his big brother , Jordan .
The two rode bikes , did yard work and hung out together .
But when it came to the family business -- a major drug ring -- Mykel did not want to share , police say .
Mykel , a seventh - grader , is accused of masterminding the slaying of his 16 - year - old half - brother so he could take over the drug operation , which police say the boys inherited from their father , who is in prison for running one of the biggest cocaine rings on Cape Cod .
The boys have different mothers .
Jordan was found shot , stabbed 27 times and dumped into a pit , where his body was torched .
Two other suspects also are charged with murder .

Mykel ’s lawyer , John Cunha , dismissed authorities ’ claims .
“ He loved his brother , ” Cunha said .
“ He ’s not the 13 - year - old Al Capone . ”
Authorities say Jordan took over after his father was imprisoned , selling OxyContin and cocaine .
Dist .
Atty .
Michael O’Keefe said Jordan was a “ significant drug dealer . ”

Mykel , according to authorities , was jealous of the money Jordan was making and wanted to take over .
Over two days in December , police say Mykel , his 20 - year - old cousin Robert Vacher and 13 - year - old Kevin Ribeiro stole $ 10,000 in cash from Jordan , killed him , poured gasoline on his body and set it on fire .
Lawyers for all of the youths deny they took part in the slaying .
The extreme right British National Party ( BNP ) claims its website has been attacked by cybercriminals in Eastern Europe .
The Register reported that BNP leader Nick Griffin is asking for donations to help the party fix the problem caused by a distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack .
A DDoS attack is a method used by cyber attackers to make a website unavailable .
It often involves the site being constantly bombarded with requests .
Griffin asks for help to " fight back against the Marxist cybercriminals ! " in a letter sent to BNP supporters .
“ There is concern among the banks that the stress test has led to uncertainty , the opposite of what is intended , and they would be diluting their shareholders based on a scenario that the regulators say themselves are unlikely to happen , ” said Edward L. Yingling , the head of the American Bankers Association .
According to people briefed on the situation , the disputes center on several assumptions that regulators made in administering the tests .
These include the severity of losses on assets like mortgages , credit card loans and commercial real estate loans , as well as the banks ’ potential to generate earnings .
In a further challenge , the banks are also pushing regulators to relax the timetable for them to obtain new capital .
Some investors are prepared to buy problem assets from banks .
What is less certain is whether banks will be willing to sell .
Big money managers like BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon said they had applied to raise money for the troubled - asset funds .
While administration officials say they never expected every bank to participate , large banks whose involvement was regarded as vital to the plan ’s success have said they will not be involved .
Executives worry that whatever assurances the White House gives them , an angry Congress might impose new rules on banks that participate , particularly on pay .
Officials from Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , PNC Financial and a number of other big lenders that have received multibillion - dollar government bailouts are reluctant to participate or have refused so far to commit until more details are offered .
Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan
Chase ’s chief executive , has said he believes that the Public - Private Investment Program  which depends on loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  could be “ good for the system ” but that his bank has no intention of being either a seller or buyer .
“ We ’re certainly not going to borrow from the federal government , because we ’ve learned our lesson about that , ” he said earlier this month in a conference about earnings .
Many banks are reluctant to sell their nonperforming loans because they could suffer big losses , forcing them to raise more capital .
Others want to avoid the stigma of latching on to another federal program .
“ Never mind the price , ” James E. Rohr , PNC ’s chief , said in a recent interview .
“ I would n’t want to be the first person and be perceived as a weak bank . ”

The recession is not helping Sirius XM ( SIRI ) radio as car purchases stall and competition increases .
Update : Sirius XM is going to miss its growth forecast .
Blow - by - blow from today 's earnings release :
The satellite radio monopolist said it lost 400,000 net subscribers during Q1 , finishing the quarter with 18.6 million subs .
Retail subscribers -- those who sign up for Sirius on their own , not by buying a new car -- were the biggest defectors , at 370,000 net sub losses , down from 49,000 net sub losses a year ago .
But " OEM " subscribers -- people who get Sirius radios built into their new cars -- plummeted much faster .
During Q1 , a net 38,000 OEM subs left Sirius , almost 700,000 subscribers worse than net sub growth of 659,000 a year ago .
A lot of that can be blamed on Detroit 's downfall .
than net sub growth of 659,000 a year ago .
A lot of that can be blamed on Detroit 's downfall .
Churn , the percent of customers who ditch the service each month , increased to 2.2 % from 1.9 % a year ago .
And Sirius XM 's conversion rate -- getting people to sign up for paid service after it's free for a while in their new car -- fell to 45 % , down from 51 % a year ago .
At this rate , it 's going to be very hard for Sirius to grow subscribers 8 % this year , as the company predicted last November .
That 's one reason why shares are down 18 % to $ 0.43 today .
The ( mildly ) better news : Sirius expects to report more than $ 350 million in 2009 adjusted income , up from its previous guidance of $ 300 million .
Still , an ugly situation that has no reason to get better .

Domain Specific Languages ( DSL ) written in Scala have become powerful tool in the hands of Scala programmers .
In the original language design great care was taken to ensure that the syntax would allow programmers to create natural looking DSLs .
Spend a moment to enjoy Michael Fogus 's humour and the clever use he makes of implicits to create " Baysick " .
It looks like BASIC feels like BASIC but it 's a Scala DSL .
Then you may like to follow some other links to see DSL examples for Financial Asset Management , Apache Camel Services and OSGi .
Michael decided to extend the simple BASIC interpreter posted by Szymon Jachim to the Scala Nabble forums .
He says " The exercise was an interesting way to appreciate the power that Scala provides in facilitating DSL creation . "
Here is a simple Lunar Lander game he has written using his BASIC - like DSL .
And it really runs !
More information can be found on his site and the source code is located at Github .
object Lunar extends Baysick { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { 10 PRINT " Welcome to Baysick Lunar Lander v0.9 " 20 LET ( ' dist := 100 ) 30 LET ( 'v := 1 ) 40 LET ( ' fuel := 1000 ) 50 LET ( ' mass := 1000 ) 60 PRINT " You are drifting towards the moon . "
70 PRINT " You must decide how much fuel to burn . "
80 PRINT " To accelerate enter a positive number " 90 PRINT " To decelerate a negative " 100 PRINT " Distance " % ' dist % " km , " % " Velocity " % 'v % " km/s , " % " Fuel " % ' fuel 110 INPUT ' burn 120 IF ABS ( ' burn ) <= ' fuel THEN 150 130 PRINT " You do n't have that much fuel " 140 GOTO 100 150 LET ( 'v := 'v + ' burn * 10 / ( ' fuel + ' mass ) ) 160 LET ( ' fuel := ' fuel - ABS ( ' burn ) ) 170 LET ( ' dist := ' dist - ' v ) 180 IF ' dist > 0 THEN 100 190 PRINT
" You have hit the surface " 200 IF 'v < 3 THEN 240 210 PRINT
" Hit surface too fast ( " % 'v % " ) km/ s " 220 PRINT " You Crashed ! " 230 GOTO 250 240 PRINT " Well done " 250 END RUN } }
If you are new to Scala or to DSLs you may like to watch Bill Venners video " The Feel Of Scala " where he both talks about Scala the language and DSLs in the context of program testing .
Debasish Ghosh shows you how he has constructed a DSL to build an Asset Management System in a Financial Trading and Settlement environment .
Heiko Seeberger shows you how you can use a DSL to simplify OSGi implementations .
The Camel project on Apache uses DSL to drive services .
See the development team presentation and their implementation
In the academic world DSL are being considered for improving parallelism in multi-core concurrent systems .
In this presentation " Towards Pervasive Parallelism " by Kunle Olukotun at Stanford UT Austin , you can read about the general problem of concurrency and the role that DSLs can play .
While at Maquarie University you can learn about Scala DSLs in the context of the Kiama project .

In early April , Mukhtar Mai , the Pakistani survivor of a tribal - ordered gang rape who prosecuted her rapists rather than accepting a tradition of suicide after rape , married her bodyguard , Nasir Abbas Gabol .
Scathing condemnations of the marriage came from Pakistani writers , women ’s groups , and news outlets .
While the circumstances under which she married are troubling , the way that Pakistani media has discussed the Mai and her marriage is equally troubling .
According to AFP , these are the facts :
Nine years her junior , Gabol first proposed in 2007 .
When he was rejected he tried to kill himself with an overdose of sleeping pills .
“ The morning after he attempted suicide , his wife and parents met my parents but I still refused , ” Mai said .
Gabol then threatened to divorce his first wife , Shehla Kiran .
Panicked at the prospect of enduring the stigma of divorce , Shehla sought to persuade Mai — who was married and divorced before her rape — to consent to becoming a second wife .
… On Mai ’s insistence , Gabol transferred ownership of his family house to his first wife , agreed to give her a plot of land and a monthly income — all designed to guarantee Shehla ’s rights .
In exchange , Mai tied the knot .
But she has no intention of moving to her husband ’s village , away from the hive of activity she has created here with the help of aid money .
These are the facts that the media agrees on .
By most accounts , this seems like a measured , deliberate marriage , even if an unwanted one .
But reading most media analyses , one would think either that Mai was as giddy as a school girl or a traitor to women ’s rights .
The AFP article that I pulled all these facts from also paints Mai as a “ gushing ” bride who is living the “ happily ever after ” storyline : “ Seven years after her ordeal , she may still be a pariah among illiterate and older women but her transformation from victim to queen of her own destiny is complete since becoming the second wife of Nasir Abbas Gabol . ”
This completely contradicts an interview she gave to Mag The Weekly , an online Pakistani magazine , in which she said of Gabol ’s proposals :
“ I knew that Nasir Abbas is a married man with five children .
I was concerned about his wife and children and I kept arguing with my family members about the proposal .
Then one day , Nasir sent his wife and children to our house .
His wife forced me to marry her husband .
Her behaviour was very strange to me .
My siblings also forced me to accept the proposal .
I finally gave up . ”
What romance !
I ca n’t think of anything better than being coerced into becoming someone ’s second wife by his reckless and selfish behavior !
The AFP article inappropriately constructs Mai as some sort of Cinderella whose suffering has been rewarded by a knight in shining armor , not as a woman who has made deliberate moves to counter her suitor ’s irresponsible threats .
AFP ’s article , however falsely glittery , pales in comparison to the Pakistani reception .
An article from the Inter Press Service , written by Zofeen Ebrahim , casts Mai in the role of fallen feminist hero .
Ebrahim writes , “ Mai , who has fought a valiant , 7 - year - old battle against tradition and patriarchy was suddenly no longer a role model and icon . ”
So now Mai ’s feminist card gets revoked ?
The article makes it seems as if Mai ’s hard work prosecuting her rapists has all been washed away with this marriage .
It also discounts the work she is currently doing .
According to AFP :
“ Mai runs three schools — two for girls and one for boys — where around 1,000 children from poor families get an education .
She heads a staff of 38 , half of them teachers , the rest working in her office and welfare centres .
They shelter female victims of violence who trek far and wide to seek refuge with Mai , organise seminars to boost awareness of rights , dispense legal aid and operate a mobile unit that reaches out to women in their communities . ”
Running schools for girls and education women about domestic violence and their rights ?
Not feminist at all !
Perhaps if Mai were to give all this work up and move in with her husband , I could understand the condemnations by Pakistani women and feminist groups .
But Mai has stipulated that she ’s not giving up her schools , her work , or her village .
So what ’s behind all these accusations of Mai ’s feminist treason ?
“ Mukhtaran Mai has fallen from being a national heroine to a disappointment , even for the media , ” asserts Karachi - based Najma Sadeque , a founding member of Shirkat Gah , a non-governmental organisation .
“ One wishes she had not done it , ” says Naeem Sadiq , a business consultant here who actively campaigns on pro-democracy issues .
Sadiq who considers Mai an “ exceptionally brave woman ” is concerned that her marriage sends a message that “ she is promoting polygamy ” .
That ’s some serious haterade .
Sadiq and Sadeque fail to realize that Mai ’s marriage happened the way it did because she is a role model , and is conscious of the messages she sends .
Mai ’s marriage contract , her conditions that guarantee herself divorce and land and a monthly allowance for Gabol ’s first wife , and her commitment to her work and her village send a powerful message that a woman ’s marriage does not have to be a submission , but can be a political and social tool .
In all of this condemnation , no one ever mentions Gabol ’s irresponsible behavior ( suicide , threatening to divorce his first wife , disrespecting Mai ’s choice not to marry him ) .
Sadeque says , “ I think she should n’t have done it since it immediately puts the first wife in a secondary , dispensable and vulnerable position . ”
This statement completely glosses over the fact that it was Gabol that first put his wife in this position : it was his first wife who , worried over the fact that Gabol had threatened to divorce her because of Mai ’s rejections , sought Mai ’s acceptance .
Pak Tea
House ’s coverage , written by Aisha Fayyazi Sarwari , is the only outlet that brought up Gabol ’s issues in a way that puts any culpability on him :
“ There are some troubling signs in this new relationship .
One is that the groom , Mr. Gabol is an unstable character , younger and indelibly lacking in the maturity she possesses , and was a little too quick to commit suicide with sleeping pills when she turned him down in 2007 . ”
Sarwari raises issues and concerns about Mai ’s marriage without blaming her for them , unlike other outlets .
The majority of media responses to Mai ’s marriage play the blame game , pushing all of it onto her and none onto Gabol .
Mai has done everything to turn a bad situation into a good one : by turning a marriage with a man she does n’t want into something that benefits her and all the women and children it touches , she reminds us of her strength and commitment to women ’s freedom .

Remember those dumbass RNC members pushing a party resolution demanding the Democrats rename themselves the " Democrat Socialist Party " because , well , Republicans have nothing left to offer the political debate except for insults ?
The DNC responds :
" I 'm going to pass on marketing advice from folks who had n't fully thought out the implications of using tea bags as a brand , " said Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan .
" But what 's clear is that when you 're devoid of leadership , devoid of ideas and your only answer is to say ' no ' to change , it 's not surprising that angry , fringe elements take center stage at the Republican Party . "
Remember when people used to take the Republican Party seriously ?
And remember when Democrats used to cower in fear ?
Now everyone mocks them with impunity .
It 's fun !
And it's all that party deserves , as even some Republicans concede :

Advertisement A Tory MP has agreed to repay £ 20,000 in tax and mortgage payments , much of which was claimed from public funds towards staff quarters in his home .
Sir John Butterfill said he was given incorrect advice about what he could claim for a section of his house , later sold for £ 1.2 m , occupied by a gardener .
He denied avoiding capital gains tax on the 2005 sale of the six - bedroom house .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is calling for MPs ' summer breaks to be delayed until Westminster reforms are agreed .
Sir John , who announced last year he would stand down from Parliament at the next election , is the latest MP from his party to be the focus of reports in the Daily Telegraph , which has obtained details of all MPs expenses over a four - year period .
The one mistake I made was that in claiming interest on the home , I did n't separate from that the value of the servants , or the staff , wing
Sir John Butterfill
He told the BBC's Newsnight he had spent nearly £ 500,000 renovating a virtually " derelict " property in Woking and therefore any capital gain he would have made when selling it in 2005 would have been " minimal " .
But he said he was prepared to re-examine the transaction and if he had made a profit , would repay an " appropriate amount " .
According to the paper , Sir John designated a six - bedroom property in Woking as his second home and regularly claimed towards the cost of running it from his second home allowance .
At that time , the Bournemouth West MP said his main residence was a smaller flat in his constituency .
But when it came to selling the Woking property , the paper said Sir John informed Revenue and Customs that it was his main residence and therefore not liable for capital gains tax .
Under the rules , MPs can designate different properties as their primary and secondary residences for the purposes of claiming expenses and for capital gain liability .
' One mistake ' However , Sir John admitted he had made an inadvertent error in not " separating out " the cost of claims for mortgage interest and council tax on a new annex he added to the Woking property to accommodate his gardener and his family .
" The one mistake I made was that in claiming interest on the home , I did n't separate from that the value of the servants ' , or the staff , wing .
" And I claimed the whole of that and the whole of the council tax relating to that , " he told Newsnight .
" I cleared that with the fees office at the time .
I was n't told I needed to separate out the part of the house that was being occupied by my gardener and his wife from the whole house .
" I understand now that I should have done that . "
Having discussed his claims with the Tories ' internal scrutiny panel on expenses , Sir John said he had agreed to repay an estimated £ 20,000 in claims he said were , with hindsight , " inappropriate " .
These would also include £ 3,000 for work on his Bournemouth flat , he added .
" Bar gates "
The continuing revelations about MP expenses have increased the pressure on party leaders to be seen to act .
Writing in the Guardian , Mr Clegg set out a 100 - day action plan to clean up Commons expenses and speed up key constitutional changes .
" Let us bar the gates of Westminster and stop MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out , and every nook and cranny of our political system reformed , " he wrote .
Mr Clegg wants to change the electoral system , capping donations to parties , abolishing the House of Lords and making it possible for MPs to be sacked by their constituents .

My favorite quote of the day :
“ What are the odds that one could convince greater wingnuttia that pork barrel spending was the cause of the swine flu outbreak ?
I ’m guessing there ’s at least a 20 % chance of success . ”
Update :
It looks like the wingnuts decided to go full - monty on this one and are using the swine flu outbreak to attack Obama .

There is an entire development methodology ( whose name escapes me at the > moment ) that makes use of that very phenomenon .
We called it the Rubber Duck method of debugging .
It goes like this : 1 ) Beg , borrow , steal , buy , fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck ( bathtub variety ) 2 ) Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it , if that 's all right .
3 ) Explain to the duck what you code is supposed to do , and then go into detail and explain things line by line 4 ) At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing .
The duck will sit there serenely , happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way .
Works every time .
Actually , if you do n't have a rubber duck you could at a pinch ask a fellow programmer or engineer to sit in .

Law enforcement sources said David Kellermann , acting chief financial officer of mortgage company Freddie Mac , was found hanging in the basement of his Vienna , Va. , home , dead from an apparent suicide early this morning .
The death was " an active investigation " and there were " no signs of foul play , " Fairfax County police officer Sabrina Ruck said .
Local police said they were called to Kellermann 's home at 4:48 a.m. , but would not say who 'd placed the call to 911 .
Kellermann , 41 , and a 16 - year veteran of Freddie Mac , had been the company 's CFO since September , after a government takeover of the company following the housing crisis .
County records show the large home in Hunter Mill Estates was worth about $ 900,000 .

Neighbors said they were shocked to learn of the man 's death .
" This is a solid salt of the earth kind of family and guy , and I just cannot imagine what has occurred , " neighbor Paul Ungar said .
" I mean , I understand the economy , I understand what 's gone on with those companies , but I just can't imagine what would have driven him to that . "
Freddie Mac had been criticized for reckless business practices that some argued contributed to the housing and financial crisis .
The company is controlled by the government and owns or guarantees about 13 million home loans .
Freddie Mac and sibling company Fannie Mae , which together own or back more than half the home mortgages in the United States , have been hobbled by skyrocketing loan defaults and have received about $ 60 billion in combined federal aid .
Kellermann was named acting chief financial officer in September 2008 , after the resignation of Anthony " Buddy " Piszel , who stepped down when the government took over .
According to securities reports filed in March , Kellermann was to receive an $ 850,000 bonus .
Kellermann owned 43,000 shares of Freddie Mac stock last summer , worth about $ 395,000 .
As the company 's stock plummeted from $ 9 a share in July to 80 cents or so this morning , he had slowly sold off some shares , for pennies on the dollar .
His holdings of 38,861 shares , as of April 11 , were worth $ 30,000 , according to ABC News ' calculations of Security and Exchange Commission filings .
In filings with the SEC in March , Freddie Mac said it had entered into a pact with Kellermann and two other company executives to protect them from liabilities and expenses in connection to any threatened or pending lawsuits .
The agreement , which kicked in retroactively from the time of the government takeover , would not protect the officials from willful criminal misconduct .
In an SEC filing from September , Freddie Mac disclosed that it received a federal grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York seeking information about the company 's accounting , disclosure and corporate - governance procedures .
The subpoena was withdrawn , and the investigation was taken over by the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia .
Before he was named acting CFO , Kellermann served as senior vice president , corporate comptroller and principal accounting officer .
" We at FHFA are very saddened by the death of David Kellermann , " the Federal Housing Finance Agency , the government agency that oversees Freddie Mac , said in a statement .
" For many years , we have known David as a person of the utmost ethical standards who was hardworking and knowledgeable in his field .
As the Acting Chief Financial Officer of Freddie Mac during particularly challenging times , David was an inspiration to his staff and many others who were privileged to work with him .
We extend our condolences to his family , friends and colleagues , " the statement read .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner also released a statement expressing the government 's condolences .
" On behalf of the Treasury family , we are deeply saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann 's death .
Our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at Freddie Mac during this difficult time , " Geithner said in a statement .
Kellermann , a graduate of the University of Michigan and the George Washington University School of Business , was married with one daughter .
ABC News ' Tom Giusto and Scott Mayerowitz contributed to this report , which was supplemented by The Associated Press .
Selfish Gene Theory : It 's Time To Ditch The Mantra
David Sloan Wilson is doing a great job in his blog at The Huffington Post , exposing the contradictions that lie at the heart of selfish gene theory .
He ’s run a series of articles under the umbrella title of Truth and Reconciliation for Group Selection , singling out Richard Dawkins as a target for some pretty heavy broadsides .
Like this ;
“ Richard has become unaccountable , in part by becoming a public icon .
That disqualifies him as a spokesperson for science . ”
And this ; “ when it comes to semantic confusion , you can't beat selfish gene theory . ”
It just makes me feel warm and tingly all over .
But like most critics of the gene - centric view of evolution , DS Wilson has somehow fallen into the trap of accepting some of the assumptions and rhetoric that underpin the gene - only view .
An example can be seen in the following passage ; “ Selfishness beats altruism within groups .
Altruistic groups beat selfish groups . ”
This was the conclusion that David Sloan Wilson and EO Wilson reached in their paper Rethinking The Theoretical Foundations of Sociobiology , but David Wilson is repeating it so frequently , ( albeit in the very good cause of undermining selfish gene theory ) that it ’s becoming a mantra .
The problem with this particular mantra is that the proposition contains a flaw .
That flaw flows from the acceptance of the validity of the Hamiltonian interpretation of altruism , whereby an altruistic act decreases the fitness of the altruist and increases the fitness of the receiver .
( That acceptance was not just implied , but actually stated in one of the series articles . )
But acts that decrease biological fitness are rare in nature , because such acts present a significant risk to the survival of the altruist .
Where such acts occur , it ’s highly likely that the altruist makes a mental note to avoid a similar situation in future or to approach it differently .
How many of us help others to the point where our personal well - being is at risk ?
It just does not happen often enough to be a factor in evolution .
So what form of altruism is it that is well known , accepted , even admired ?
It ’s that form of giving in which the giver has no expectation of receiving in return .
And in most of these acts , altruists give that which they have in excess , whether that be an excess of goods , time , labour , or in the case of humans , money .
Because they give what they have in excess , their fitness is not affected .
But we still help others ; our daily lives are an endless round of helping .
How do we achieve that without adversely affecting our fitness ?
By constantly receiving help from others .
While we are giving , we ’re receiving .
It ’s that cycle of mutual aid that defines social life .
It is therefore the quality of the system of mutual aid , and the quality of the commitment to mutual aid , that determines the fitness of particular groups .
And of course that fact applies at all levels of selection .
For example , it ’s the quality of the system of cooperation between cells , between organs , and other physiological features such as the immune system , that determines the fitness of individual organisms .
This matter of mutual aid was recognized by the Wilsons in their paper , but misinterpreted ; “ It is simply a fact of social life that individuals must do things for each other to function successfully as a group , and that these actions usually do not maximize their relative fitness within the group . ”
They overlooked the important point that givers are also receivers .
They again came close to solving what they referred to as “ the fundamental problem of social life ” with this ; “ Traits that are “ for the good of the group ” are seldom selectively advantageous within groups .
At worst , they are highly self - sacrificial .
At best , they provide public goods at little cost to the actor , making them close to selectively neutral , or they constitute a stable local equilibrium . ”
Their “ at best - at worst ” comparison is the problem here .
It seems to imply a balance or equality of frequency and value between the differing forms of altruism , but if it was possible to draw a graph there would be no horizontal line or bell curve , it would show a curve or straight line heading up towards neutral with highly self - sacrificial hovering just above zero .
So unfortunately David Sloan Wilson , for whom I have the greatest respect , in his noble quest to analyse group selection in a big - picture manner , has been diverted from the big picture .
He has focused his attention on a perverted and irrelevant version of altruism when the principal element in group fitness , and hence group selection , is clearly cooperation in all its forms , of which altruism is but a part .
Let ’s alter his proposition to see how it reads in light of those facts .
We now have ; “ Selfishness beats cooperation within groups .
Cooperative groups beat selfish groups . ”
The second sentence is obviously true , and actually summarises a well - known yet much neglected passage from Darwin ’s " The Descent of Man " , as the Wilsons acknowledged .
The first sentence is too concise to be meaningful .
It could refer to selfishness , or cooperation , as a single act or as a concept , a way of life , or a state of mind .
But importantly , it brings into focus the inconsistency contained in the original proposition .
If selfishness beats cooperation within groups then there is little likelihood of the development of group cooperation to a level that is effective .
Likewise for the original proposition .
If selfishness beats altruism within groups , then altruistic groups are unlikely to develop .
It ’s doubtful that a split personality makes for biological fitness .
So it ’s time for David to ditch the mantra .
It ’s served its purpose .
It ’s shown a lot of people that selfish gene theory is not the only game in town .
Now he should concentrate on cooperation as the principal factor in evolution .
Cooperation is the principal factor in evolution ?
Now that ’s a mantra !
And here ’s a challenge to all the gene - centrics out there :
Find a flaw in it !

Shorter version of Michael Steele ’s “ Change in a teabag ” speech to the RNC :
We ’re not going to talk about our failed past ever again .
We really hate President Obama and everything he ’s doing to America .
There ’s never been a better time to be a Republican .
Here ’s a highlight reel of the speech ... which almost seemed like a comedy routine :
Environmental Activists Plant Seed Balls in Abandoned Lots
I ’ve long been fascinated by guerilla gardening , in which gardeners illegally under the cover of night cultivate plants in public spaces .
Now , activists have a new tool for cultivating abandoned spaces : seed balls !
Developed by Japanese Masanobu Fukuoka , a pioneer in “ natural farming ” , seed balls are made out of mulch and seeds mixed together .
The seeds and mulch are kneaded into a red terra cotta clay .
Recently , Neighbors Allied for Good Growth ( NAG ) , formerly Neighbors Against Garbage , in Brooklyn , NY are tossing seed balls into abandoned lots .
From building a town hall to fighting for tenant rights , NAG is not just about planting random seeds around Brooklyn , but seed balling has gotten national attention .
Michael Freedman - Schnapp , one of the co-chairs of NAG , explains why the guerrilla gardening movement is a reaction to city abandonment :
We are at the end of a development boom , and it is clear that the city ’s resources are going to be constrained .
They are not going to be able to take care of everywhere in the city .
And so the city is going to have to rely on citizens stepping up and taking care of their own surroundings .
Becky Striepe of EcoLocalizer explains how to make a seed ball :
Combine 2 parts mixed seeds ( Maybe ones from a local solstice seed swap ? ) with 3 parts compost .
( I bet that organic potting soil would work , as well . )
Stir in 5 parts powdered red or brown clay .
Moisten with water until mixture is damp enough to mold into balls .
Pinch off a penny - sized piece of the clay mixture and roll it between the palms of your hands until it forms a tight ball ( 1 inch in diameter ) .
Set the balls on newspaper and allow to dry for 24 – 48 hours .
Store in a cool , dry place until ready to sow .
The clay helps protect the seeds from birds , and the small ball shape makes seed balls easy to toss throw chain linked fencing surrounding abandoned lots .
After several rain storms , the seed balls break down and start to germinate .
Of course , it is best to use native species for seed balls ; who can resist a wildflower show in abandoned lot ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
By maintaining adequate vitamin D levels during pregnancy , mothers may be protecting their babies against early tooth decay in childhood , according a study reported Friday at the International Association for Dental Research meeting in Toronto , Canada .
Dr. Robert Schroth from the University of Manitoba reported that mothers of children who developed cavities at an early age had significantly lower vitamin D levels during pregnancy than those whose children were cavity - free .
The study team enrolled 206 women during the second trimester of pregnancy “ as that is when primary teeth begin to develop and calcify , ” Schroth explained in comments to Reuters Health .
They measured vitamin D levels in the women ’s blood at enrollment and then followed them until their infants were around 1 year old .
Only 21 women ( 10.5 percent ) were found to have adequate vitamin D levels .
The average vitamin D level was about half what is considered adequate , the investigators found .
Among 135 infants who had their teeth checked by the team , roughly 22 percent had noticeable enamel defects and about 34 percent had early childhood tooth decay .
Mothers of children with enamel defects in their primary teeth had lower average vitamin D levels than those of children without enamel defects , but the difference was not significant from a statistical standpoint .
However , mothers of children with early tooth decay had significantly lower vitamin D levels during pregnancy than mothers whose children did not develop early tooth decay .
“ Considering that 90 percent of this study group was comprised of urban Aboriginal women , the results may not be completely generalizable to the public at large , ” Schroth noted .
“ However , this is the first known study that has attempted to link blood levels of vitamin D and infant oral health , particularly caries ( tooth decay ) and suggesting a significant association , ” Schroth said .

Besanti Devi's confinement shed is airless and dark
In the darkness , a 10 - day - old baby boy wails .
It is midday , but the infant has not been allowed out of this special room , separate from the rest of the house , since being brought home after birth .
Only his young mother , Basanti Devi Bhul , can touch him .
She goes out a little but cannot touch anybody else because until the 11th day after the birth , society considers her to be unclean .
" I 'm not doing any work , " she tells the BBC .
" I just eat dry bread , green vegetables and rice - no lentils or meat .
I can't touch any pots or pans or go into the main house .
I just go out to wash myself and my clothes , that 's all . "
This practice of confinement , known as chhaupadi , extends also to women during their monthly period .
Some sort of confinement during menstruation is common in this and other societies .
But here in western Nepal it takes extreme forms , with a woman sometimes restricted to a dirty cow - shed or other special huts .
Extreme confinement was outlawed by Nepal 's Supreme Court three years ago , but continues to be widespread .
Custom defended
The room where Basanti Devi rocks her baby is musty , airless and dark .
Out in the yard her relatives and neighbours can be heard laughing .
To get into her room , we have come in through an outer shed , where logs and wooden ploughs lie piled , into a very dark inner shed where there is just a single stream of light coming in from the door .
" I wish I were more free to roam around , " she says .
" I wish someone else could come and look after my child when he cries .
I wish the system could be abolished . "
The village of Dil , where she lives , is a steep two - hour climb from the road which snakes through these hills .
It is a place with breathtaking views and closely packed houses of clay or stone .
On the walls hang banners in support of the Maoists , the former rebels now leading the government .
Every house here practices the chhaupadi system .
It is a tradition that Basanti Devi's mother - in - law , Durga Devi Sarki , defends .
Besanti Devi's parents - in - law defend chhaupadi but her husband wants change " Our god will be angry if we do n't do this , " she says .
" She is a nursing mother so how can she cook ?
Everyone around here does this , so we do , too .
" If she eats normal food she 'll get sick . "
In another village we met a similarly confined young mother , Padma Devi Deuba .
" I believe that if I take my child outside he will be sick and God will be angry , " she says .
" It is quite difficult , but it is our system . "
It is the same when she has her period .
" I ca n't go inside or cook anything for five days , " she says .
" If I touch anyone , it will be a sin . "
But there is an uneasiness in her .
She believes in it ; yet she , too , says she would like it eradicated .
' Grim consequences '
The related beliefs vary .
Some people in western Nepal think a new mother or a menstruating woman will bring bad luck on a whole household if she stays in the main house ; or that she can make cow 's milk into blood .
Their accommodation is often insanitary , shared with cattle and their excrement and sometimes some distance from a village .
It tends to be unventilated and cramped .
And the consequences of chhaupadi can be grim .
Besanti Devi was kept in a shed underneath this house Last summer a 15 - year - old girl died of diarrhoea she contracted while sleeping alone in a shed .
No one wanted to take her to a health post .
In the biggest hospital in Far Western Region , senior doctor Ganesh Bahadur Singh says chhaupadi has a definite detrimental effect .
Speaking of mothers with newborn infants , he says , " at this period the mother and child should have good nutrition and everything .
" They want care , love , everything .
[ But ] the surroundings , their personal hygiene , they all invite the infection .
They will cause fever
The mothers in this situation - they are more anaemic , they do n't have the blood . "
Reform push Change is happening .
Many parents say they would take the younger women to the clinic in an emergency .
Women are declaring they do not like the practice , and in Dil village , so too is Basanti Devi 's husband , Ganesh .
His activism in the Maoist party has opened his eyes to the need for change .
He wants to see the chhaupadi system abolished .
" I broke the rules , " he says .
" I carried our child back from the health post where he was born and then entered the main house despite my parents ' protests .
I do touch my child .
" I wanted to give normal food to my wife but I could n't go that far against my parents ' wishes .
We can't change everything at once .
It has to be gradual . "
Devaki Shahi has been campaigning to reform chhaupadi Devaki Shahi agrees .
She works for a local charity , the Rural Women 's Development and Unity Centre , and travels around advocating change .
She speaks from experience , having been confined after her own son's birth .
Thanks to campaigns by her and others , the actual sites of confinement are at least improving in this district .
If sheds are used , they 're likely to be cleaner , less likely to be shared with animals .
The women get better food too .
But fear keeps this tradition alive .
" If someone breaks the practice and her child falls ill , people say it 's because they did n't observe chhaupadi , " says Devaki Shahi .
" In one village local people destroyed some of the confinement sheds .
Someone hurt his leg in the process and everyone said it was because he was doing a bad thing . "
So Basanti Devi still needs to go to a special tap , outside the village , to wash , away from all her neighbours .
On the 11th day her confinement will end .
A priest will perform a blessing , and take her child and point his head towards the sun for the first time .
Then he will throw flour and rice on her - and make her " pure " .

One of the Pirate Bay 's founders has vowed to pay off his court - ordered fine ( if it is n't successfully appealed , I assume ) by getting net - users to send tiny sums to the entertainment industry 's law - firm , thus swamping them with transaction fees that could cost them millions :
A friend of anakata told Blog Pirate that the bank account to which the payments are directed has only 1000 free transfers , after which any transfers have a surcharge of 2 SEK for the account holder .
Any internet - fee payments made after the first 1000 , which includes the law firm 's ordinary transfers , will instead of giving 1 SEK , cost 1 SEK to the law firm .
Since Danowsky & Partners Advokatbyrå is a small firm , all the transactions are handled by hand .
Handling all payments will be time consuming , costing the law firm in productivity .
Maybe it will even affect their success in other cases …
Additionally if after paying the internet - fee you determine that your payment was erroneous , Swedish law states that you can request the money back , putting an additional load on Danowsky 's law firm .
To some extent , the support for same - sex marriage reflects a sea change in New Hampshire politics since 2006 , when Democrats gained control of the legislature for the first time in over a century .
While staunchly conservative on fiscal matters , New Hampshire has been less so on social issues , partly because its residents ’ famous libertarian streak resists government intrusion in personal matters .
But last - minute politicking also played a role in the Senate ’s vote .
Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 3 to 2 against the marriage measure , and the committee ’s chairwoman , Senator Deborah Reynolds , a Democrat , said afterward that New Hampshire was simply not ready for same - sex marriage .
Ms. Reynolds , the only Democrat who opposed the bill in committee , emphasized that civil unions were still new in New Hampshire and that Vermont , whose legislature approved same - sex marriage on April 7 , had done so only after living with civil unions for nine years .
But on Wednesday , Ms. Reynolds , who represents a fairly conservative region , said the new language made the bill acceptable .
She described it as a compromise that was “ respectful to both sides of the debate and meets our shared goals of equality under the state laws for all of the people of New Hampshire . ”
Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont , a Republican , vetoed that state ’s same - sex marriage bill , but the Democratic - controlled legislature overrode his veto , making Vermont the first state to adopt same - sex marriage legislatively instead of through the courts .
Days earlier , the Iowa Supreme Court found a state law banning same - sex marriage to be a violation of the State Constitution .
In New Hampshire , more than 650 same - sex unions have been registered since they became legal in January 2008 .
Same - sex marriage was among several contentious bills that the Senate took up Wednesday , all passed by the House in recent weeks .
One , a measure to allow people with certain illnesses to possess marijuana for medical purposes , passed in a vote of 14 to 10 .
But the Senate voted unanimously against a bill that would guarantee transgender people protection from discrimination in housing and employment .
It also put off action on a bill to repeal the death penalty .
Music recommendation is not doing its job , says Paul Lamere , director of developer community at ' machine listening ' specialists The Echo Nest .
However long the long tail of music , mechanical recommendation is biased towards what the majority of listeners do because brand new bands have very little audience and little related data .
Musician unloading in Austin , Texas , for SXSW
It means that if you listen to the ' short head ' of music - the mainstream , most listened to artists - you are likely to be referred to similar artists that are also in the short head , like Britney Spears to Christina Aguilera .
He said 48 % of short - head recommendations push back to the short head , and that in 2007 music retail data on 4 m sold tracks showed 13 % were either American Idol or Disney artists .
" We still have n't seen the promise of the long tail .
It 's not that [ The Long Tail author ]
Chris Anderson was wrong but the music recommenders are n't doing their job - they are pushing people towards the short tail . "
Recommendation can get stuck in corners
Hype Machine creator Anthony Volodkin said the problems are the same for film and book recommendations , but that another problem is that if recommendations are n't accurate enough , users tend to leave .
That explained ' dark corners ' of recommendation sites where a critical mass of people create a kind of recommendation cul - de-sac .
And someone people love to hate , like Napoleon Dynamite , are n't properly represented if they have a majority of five and one - star ratings .
Recommendation would also benefit by bring in extra details to explain why something is being recommended .
Why would recommend Johnny Cash to someone looking at Nine Inch Nails ?
Because Johnny Cash covered a Nine Inch Nails song .
" It could get you into a whole new genre you never would have discovered otherwise - and great albums like Fulsom Prison .
But it 's hard for collaborative filtering to do because all they know is what poeple bought . "
Recommendation can also be gamed .
When religious broadcaster started blaming the gay community for some of society 's problems , it prompted a campaign on Amazon where people visited the page for his book , Six Steps to Spiritual Revival , and then went to the page for the Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Men .
The site noticed the traffic and flagged up the sex guide as a related title of interest ...
More sinister gaming is already happening though .
Lamere said he 's already seen profesionals at music companies trying to game recommendation systems to push sales for certain artists .
How could music recommendation be improved ?
Lamere said semantic recommendation is one route .
A tag cloud of words related to one artist can be compared to another , with surprisingly similar results .
Another route is comparing complex visualisations of a track .

He also showed a 3D map of his music collection , developed when he worked in research at the Sun Microsystems Lab , which shows each track as a dot , and its location in the ' galaxy ' is determined by an analysis of its sound , so classical is clustered together , rock , country and so on .
It 's not perfect - it thinks distorted guitar is the same as harpsichord , for example - but it is far more accurate than collaborative recommendation .
As well as social context , sites need to do a better job at presenting new music so that long tail is really discoverable .
They need to " create meaning " , said Volodkin , and that 's something traditional , human editors have always been better at .
Editors of something like Pitchfork might be quite divisive but their opinion is meaningful .
Their strong editorial voice still resonates with readers , despite the number of music startups that have entered the space since Pitchfork launched in the nineties .
Maybe technology is n't the right answer , said Volodkin .
There 's still no better recommendation than that of a friend , but the best services will be those that combine social recommendation .
It 's not enough that other people have listened to , recommended or bought one artist - who are those people , and how many of them were there ?
" The really meaningful sites will represent all the activity going on out there - the news , blogs , Twitter posts , what people are sharing , " said Volodkin .
" It will all come together around people . "
Peter Thiel -- noted gay Silicon Valley libertarian , PayPal co-founder , and the one of the first Facebook investors -- recently penned an essay in which he suggests that the last time one could be " genuinely optimistic " about U.S. politics was just before dames got the right to vote .
In Cato Unbound , a site run by libertarian - ish Cato Institute , Thiel suggests the following .
The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics .
Since 1920 , the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women - two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians - have rendered the notion of " capitalist democracy " into an oxymoron .
That is to say , women are prone to illogically vote with their feelings , especially when catching the vapors .
Silicon Valley gossip scribe Owen Thomas suggests one reason for Thiel 's anti-XX - chromosome mindset : drugs .
All kids of them , it seems .

Shocked ?
Indignant ?
Hard to tell , really .
Most Italians simply do n't know that Silvio Berlusconi has compared the plight of earthquake victims forced to sleep in tents in the wintry weather of the Abruzzo region to a camping holiday .
Television broadcasts tactfully ignored the slip .
The good man , after all , was only trying to keep everyone 's morale up .
Virtually every newspaper in the country did the same .
Only the readers of the very leftwing Il Manifesto were informed in a brief note : " Shock at ' camping weekend ' comment .
But only abroad . "
That 's it , really .
Past caring .
If you can take the spectacle of your prime minister parading in front of TV cameras , massed officialdom and one miserable homeless old lady in an outsize fireman 's helmet , you can take anything .
Berlusconi the blunderer is news abroad , not at home .
The astonishing trail of antics and misdemeanours that Berlusconi blazed across Europe as he hopelessly tried to squeeze into the limelight of Barack Obama left the rest of the world gawping and most Italians apparently resigned .
It 's an old story , which may puzzle outsiders but not anyone familiar with the Italian media .
Trouble usually starts when Berlusconi ventures abroad .
In Moscow at the end of last year , he hailed then president - elect Obama as " handsome , young and suntanned " .
( Speaking for the many Italians who cringed , Carla Bruni-Sarkozy said she was glad she was no longer an Italian citizen . )
Back in 2003 , during a debate at the European parliament in Strasbourg , he called a German MEP " kapo " , as the guards in Nazi concentration camps were called , and said he would put him forward for a part in a film about the camps .
In the same year he attempted to charm investors in New York with the line : " Another reason to invest in Italy is that we have beautiful secretaries . "
The list goes on .
At home , however , Berlusconi 's image and public appearances are minutely managed .
He chooses questions , his staff plan every outing and appearance , cameras are positioned at what he and his aides consider flattering angles .
Remember , half the journalists in Italy work for him and the other half know they might do so one day .
Through his media group , Mediaset , Berlusconi and his family control three private national television channels ( the family advertising company Publitalia supplies most of the others as well ) , two newspapers , a fleet of magazines , the biggest cinema circuit , and the country 's largest book publisher .
Conflict of interest ?
Ironed out of existence by self - serving legislation that the former hard - pressed and short - lived centre - left government of Romano Prodi never got round to abolishing .
Thanks to another trademark law , Berlusconi overruled the constitutional court and legalised his virtual monopoly while consolidating absolute political control over the public service broadcaster RAI .
Even as the earthquake in the Abruzzo continues to wreak havoc , all the top jobs in RAI are up for grabs .
Parliament has agreed on a new board of directors , and now Berlusconi and his allies are turning their attention to the newsrooms .
Every one of the current heads of RAI 's three TV networks , news programmes and radio services will be reappointed .
According to tradition , the prime minister will pick the head of TG1 , RAI 's banner TV news programme .
Its current incumbent , apparently well aware of Prodi 's wobbly hold on power , was always remarkably polite to Berlusconi even when he was in opposition .
He has been guaranteed a very soft landing as editor of the country 's most important newspaper , the Corriere della Sera .
It should be cause for concern to any Italian that political horse - trading over the top media jobs in the country is so all - embracing that even the main privately owned newspaper is thrown into the same basket as the state broadcaster .
But nobody turned a hair , and news of the appointment was recorded with zeal by every media outlet in the country .
In this situation the very notion of the media as watchdog has paled into insignificance .
There will , no doubt , be some excellent investigative reporting on just why so many new buildings collapsed in the latest earthquake - in spite of existing , but apparently widely flouted , construction laws .
But they will , if we are lucky , be shown late at night on the one channel traditionally conceded to the opposition .
That is , if the new appointee thinks fit to renew the best investigative journalists ' contracts .
On his return from his tour of London and Strasbourg , Berlusconi raged publicly at the journalists who had had the cheek of reporting on his embarrasments .
" We will take steps ! " he threatened .
The first step Mr Berlusconi should take , however , is thinking more carefully before opening his mouth .

Roland Burris has voted really well since being appointed to the Senate by Rod Blagojevich .
In terms of progressive issues , he 's up there with Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) , Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) and Jeff Merkely ( D - OR ) , the Senate 's champions of working families .
But Burris is more a champion of Roland Burris than of any families and every minute he's in the Senate is a blot on that already suspect institution of systemic corruption .
A new secretly recorded transcript of a phone conversation between Burris -- looking to be appointed to the Senate -- and Blagojevich 's brother -- looking to help his bro sell a Senate seat -- was released yesterday .
In it Burriss offers Blagojevich money for the seat and frets about how bad it will look if the media finds out .
He was right .
It looks bad .
He should be removed immediately .
Illinois has an exceptionally honest reform governor , Pat Quinn .
I wish I could say the same thing about the state legislature but , unfortunately , it is n't that much different from other notoriously corrupt state legislatures like Texas ' , Florida's , Pennsylvania 's and California's .
This sounds like a job for Patrick Fitzgerald , far more from the hidebound , incumbent protection racket known as the Senate Ethics Committee .
And speaking of crooked politicians , Bernie Kerik was finally indicted .
According to this morning ' sthe Rudy Guiliani crony and bagman was " indicted on charges of making false statements to White House officials vetting him for the secretary 's seat at the Department of Homeland Security in 2004 . " Kerik 's camp -- i.e. , the never ending Giuliani campaign -- claims the Justice Department is out to get him and that this is just " the latest example of the Department of Justice 's overzealous pursuit of high - profile public figures .

The great housing turndown , which started as early as 2007 , has entered a second and more difficult phase .
We can trace this to Monday , September 15 , 2008 just as October 29 , 1929 – “ Black Tuesday ” – marked the start of the Great Depression .
September 15 does not yet have a name and the name “ Black Monday ” has already been taken by the 1987 stock market crash .
The 1987 crash looks in historical perspective like a slight downturn compared to what the world faces today .
On September 15 – let ’s call it “ Meltdown Monday ” – the housing downturn ended its
Phase I and burst into financial markets leading to the most serious global recession since the Great Depression .
Indeed , International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss - Kahn now classifies it a depression .
Phase I claimed its own share of victims ;
Phase II seems likely to hit many more .
Phase I of the Housing Downturn
Whether in depression or recession , parts of the United States housing market were already in a deep downturn well before September 15 .
Phase I of the housing downturn started when house prices reached an unprecedented peak in some markets and began fell into decline .
By September of 2008 , house prices in the “ ground zero ” markets of California , Florida Las Vegas , Phoenix and Washington , DC had dropped from 25 percent to 45 percent from their peaks .
These markets represented 75 percent of the overall lost value among the major metropolitan areas ( those with more than 1,000,000 population ) .
The Varieties of House Price Escalation Experience : In Phase I , the house price escalation and subsequent losses were far less severe in other major metropolitan areas .
This depended in large part to the degree of land use controls – such as land rationing ( urban growth boundaries and urban service limits ) , building moratoria , large lot zoning and other restrictions on building routinely – that helped drive prices up to unsustainable levels .
This effect , cited by a number of the world ’s most respected economists , was exacerbated by the easy money policies adopted by mortgage lenders .
On the other hand , in the “ responsive ” land use regulation areas , the market ( people ’s preferences ) was allowed to determine where and what kind of housing could be built .
In these areas housing prices rose far less during the housing bubble and fell far less during Phase I of the housing downturn .
Leading to the International Financial Crisis :
These radically differing house price trends set up world financial markets for ” Meltdown Monday . ”
The easy money led to a strong increase in foreclosure rates , an inevitable consequence of households having sought or been enticed into mortgage loans that they simply could not afford .
Yet it was not foreclosure rates that doomed the market .
It was rather the unprecedented intensity of those losses in particular markets .
Foreclosures were not the problem : Foreclosures happened all over .
Foreclosure rates rose drastically in California and the prescriptive markets , but had relatively less impact in the responsive markets of the South and Midwest , where house prices changed little relative to incomes .
Intensity of the losses was the problem .
The problem lay largely in the scale of house value losses in some markets , particularly the most prescriptive ones .
Lenders faced foreclosure and short sales losses on houses that had lost an average of $ 170,000 in value in the ground zero markets .
In the responsive markets , on the other hand , average house value losses were less than one - tenth that , at $ 12,000 per house ( http://www.demographia.com/db-hloss.pdf).
By the end of Phase I of the housing downturn , house value losses in the prescriptive markets had reached nearly $ 2.3 trillion , accounting for 94 percent of the total losses in major metropolitan markets ( those with more than 1,000,000 population ) .
If the market had been allowed to operate in these markets , the losses in the prescriptive markets could easily have been one - fifth this amount .
Most likely the mortgage industry and the international economy might have been able to handle such losses , sparing the world the current deep financial crisis .
True , the housing bust would not have happened without the easy money .
Neither easy money nor prescriptive land use regulation were sufficient in themselves to send the world economy into a tailspin .
But together they conspired to create the conditions for “ Meltdown Monday ” .
Phase II of the Housing Downturn
The Panic of 2008 : By September 15 , the “ die had been cast . ”
The holders of mortgage debt could no longer sustain the losses that were occurring in the ground zero markets .
This led to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and then to a financial sector that seems to be accelerating faster than the taxpayers can pick up the pieces .
The ensuing “ panic ” – a 19th century synonym for a severe economic downturn – has led to millions of layoffs , decreases in demand across the economy and taxpayer financed bailouts around the world .
Many have seen their retirement funds wiped out .
Others have lost their jobs .
American icons , such as General Motors and Bank of America have been relegated to begging on Washington ’s K Street .
Housing Downturn Broadens and Deepens :
The panic has now brought about a new phase in the housing downturn – what I label Phase II .
In Phase II , a deteriorating economy starts to kick the bottom out of the rest of the housing market .
With evaporating confidence in the economy and the drying up of demand , house prices have begun a free - fall in virtually all markets , regardless of the extent to which their prices had bloated .
Our analysis of National Association of Realtors data shows this .
In almost all markets house price declines accelerated during the fourth quarter of 2008 ( the first quarter following Meltdown Monday ) .
In just three months , median house prices fell an average of more than 12 percent in the major metropolitan markets .
In the ground zero markets , house prices dropped 14 percent , with the average loss from the peak exceeding 40 percent .
In the responsive markets , prices fell 11 percent , approximately double the previous reduction from the peak ( See Table ) .
Thus , the difference is that in Phase I , house price declines were in proportion to the previous price escalation .
In Phase II , the percentage declines are generally similar without regard to the house price increases .
House Price Deflation from Peak By Phase of the Housing Downturn PRESCRIPTIVE LAND USE MARKETS RESPONSIVE LAND USE MARKETS Factor Ground Zero Other All ALL MARKETS Prices : To Phase I - 31.70 % - 11.10 % - 20.80 % - 5.90 % - 17.90 % Prices : To Phase II - 41.40 % - 21.40 % - 30.80 % - 16.60 % - 28.00 % Prices in Phase II - 14.20 % - 11.60 % - 12.60 % - 12.40 % - 14.20 % Loss per House : To Phase I ( $ 193,800 ) ( $ 42,400 ) ( $ 96,300 ) ( $ 12,200 ) ( $ 66,900 ) Loss per House : To Phase II ( $ 253,000 ) ( $ 81,800 ) ( $ 142,700 ) ( $ 34,200 ) ( $ 104,800 ) Loss per House in Phase II ( $ 59,200 ) ( $ 39,400 ) ( $ 46,400 ) ( $ 37,900 ) ( $ 59,200 ) Gross Losses ( Trillions ) : To Phase I ( $ 1.82 ) ( $ 0.46 ) ( $ 2.29 ) ( $ 0.16 ) ( $ 2.44 ) Gross Losses ( Trillions ) : To Phase II ( $ 2.40 ) ( $ 0.99 ) ( $ 3.39 ) ( $ 0.44 ) ( $ 3.82 ) Gross Losses ( Trillions ) : in Phase II ( $ 0.58 ) ( $ 0.52 ) ( $ 1.10 ) ( $ 0.28 ) ( $ 1.38 ) Phase I : To September 2008 Phase II : To December 2008 Major Metropolitan Markets ( over 1,000,000 population )

Recession or Depression ?
It ’s critical to note that the decline is by no means as deep as in the 1930s .
On the other hand , there is no indication that conditions are going to improve markedly in the short run .
Millions of households who saw their retirement accounts devastated are likely to curb consumption for years to come .
The key question is whether we are in the equivalent of 1933 , in the pit of the downturn , or in the equivalent of the late 1930s , soon to begin a long , slow climb out .
For housing though , this is a depression .
Never before over the last half - century have house prices fallen as they have in the prescriptive markets during Phase I of the housing downturn .
And since the bust , during Phase II , overall price declines are on a par with the worst years of the Great Depression .
“ Meltdown Monday ” has incited a downward spiral whose course will be the topic of future commentaries on this site .

Some say Cheney ' feeling the heat ' over potential probes Rachel Oswald

While the rest of the mainstream press has largely reacted to former Vice President Dick Cheney 's harsh critique of the Obama administration in last Sunday 's interview on CNN as business as usual for the man , several observers have a different theory - that Cheney is nervous about calls for investigations into the Bush adminstration and is going on the offensive .
Bobby Ghosh writes for Time , " Several observers think Cheney may be starting to feel the heat from Democrats ' efforts to investigate the Bush Administration 's counterterrorism policies - policies Cheney advocated , and for which his proteges allegedly provided the legal basis .
But if he was trying to deflect attention from Bush - era policies , Cheney 's aggression will likely have the opposite effect . "
" If his goal was to tamp down talk of a truth commission , he has probably exacerbated the problem , " a veteran Republican told Time .
The recent release of controversial Office of Legal Counsel memos , which authorized harsh interrogation tactics for detainees and made the case for doing away with protected civil liberties under the Fourth Amendment , when taken with investigative reporter Seymour Hersh 's allegations of an " executive assassination ring " operating under the direction of the former veep , may have prompted the normally very private Cheney to think that an interview on a large media platform , like CNN , was in order to strengthen his public image .
But it may be too late .
Just as his interview was airing on Sunday , a leaked Red Cross report was published in The New York Review of Books .
The report outlined in graphic detail the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and specifically used the word " torture " to refer to some of the interrogation tactics and called other tactics " degrading " and ' inhumane . "
Ghosh reports that , " pressure is also growing on the [ Justice ] department to release the report of an internal ethics probe into the actions of [ former OLC attorney John ]
Yoo and two other OLC lawyers .
Many Democrats would like to see Yoo and Cheney 's own lawyer , David Addington , investigated for their role in creating the Bush Administration 's so - called torture doctrine . "

With his bold message to Iran ’s leaders , President Obama achieved four things essential to any rapprochement .
He abandoned regime change as an American goal .
He shelved the so - called military option .
He buried a carrot - and - sticks approach viewed with contempt by Iranians as fit only for donkeys .
And he placed Iran ’s nuclear program within “ the full range of issues before us . ”
By doing so , Obama made it almost inevitable that one of the defining strategic issues of his presidency will be a painful but necessary redefinition of America ’s relations with Israel as differences over Iran sharpen .
I will return to that below .
The innovations in the president ’s Persian New Year , or Nowruz , overture to Tehran were remarkable .
He referred twice to “ the Islamic Republic of Iran , ” a formulation long shunned , and said that republic , no other , should “ take its rightful place in the community of nations . ”
Here was explicit American acceptance of Iran ’s 30 - year - old clerical revolution .
More than 80 undersea volcanoes and a multitude of islands are dotted along the Hawaii - Emperor seamount chain like pearls on a necklace .
A sharp bend in the middle is the only blemish .
The long - standing explanation for this distinctive feature was a change in direction of the Pacific oceanic plate in its migration over a stationary hotspot – an apparently unmoving volcano deep within the earth .
According to the results of an international research group , of which Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität München geophysicist Professor Hans - Peter Bunge was a member , however , the hotspot responsible for the Hawaii - Emperor seamount chain was not fixed .
Rather it had been drifting quite distinctly southward .
Nearly 50 million years ago , it finally came to rest while the Pacific plate steadily pushed on , the combination of which resulted in the prominent bend .
The movements of hotspots are determined by circulations in the earth 's mantle .
" These processes are not of mere academic interest , " Bunge emphasizes .
" Mantel circulation models help us understand the forces that act on tectonic plates .
This in turn is essential for estimating the magnitude and evolution of stresses on the largest tectonic fault lines , that is the sources of many major earthquakes . "

See Schuberth et al. [ 2009 ] for details .
The characteristic bend in the trail of the 5000 kilometer long Hawaii - Emperor seamount chain is one of the most striking topographical features of the earth , and is an identifying feature in representations of the Pacific Ocean floor .
For a long time , textbooks have explained the creation of the Hawaii - Emperor chain as an 80 million year - long migration of the Pacific oceanic plate over a stationary hotspot .
Hotspots are volcanoes rooted deep within the bowels of the earth , from which hot material is constantly pushing its way up to the surface .
According to this now obsolete scenario , the bend would have come about as the Pacific plate abruptly changed direction .
In the past 30 years , geophysicists had also depended on the apparently unchanging locations of hotspots in the earth 's mantle in their definition of a global reference for plate tectonics .
More recent investigations , however , suggest that hotspots are less stationary than so far assumed .
An international research group , of which Professor Hans - Peter Bunge of the LMU Munich Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences was a member , took a closer look at certain evidence pointing towards substantial inherent motion of the underground volcanoes , and has now confirmed this evidence .
" Paleomagnetic observations suggest that the bend in the Hawaii - Emperor chain is not the result of a change in the relative motion of the Pacific plate , " Bunge states .
" On the contrary , it seems the hotspot had been drifting rapidly in a southward direction between 80 and 40 million years ago before it came to a complete halt . "
If the trail of the Hawaiian hotspot is corrected to include this drift , the result implies a largely constant movement of the Pacific plate over the last 80 million years .
The bend ultimately came about as the hotspot started to slow down .
The driving force behind the migration of the hotspot is the circulation of material under the surface of our planet .
" The earth 's interior is in constant motion , " reports Bunge .
" Over geological timescales , this motion compares to the weather patterns in our atmosphere .
These patterns can easily lead to a change in position of hotspots .
Numerical simulations of this global circulation in the earth 's mantel allow us to retrace these motions in unprecedented detail . "
The new data will now be entered into the mantle circulation models presently used .
These calculations help explain the driving and resisting forces acting on tectonic plates .
" And we need to understand these forces because they are essential for estimating the magnitude and evolution of stresses on the major tectonic fault lines – that is , the sources of many major earthquakes on our planet , " says Bunge .
The findings to come from these models will allow scientists to improve their computer models by checking their calculations against observations .

The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , today ruled out building a single state " super- database " to track everybody 's use of email , internet , text messages and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Smith said creating a single database run by the state to hold such personal data would amount to an extreme solution representing an unwarranted intrusion of personal privacy .
Instead the Home Office is looking at a £ 2bn solution that would involve requiring communications companies such as BT , Virgin Media , O2 and others to retain such personal data for up to 12 months .
The decision to abandon a state central database is a setback for the police and security services who wanted rapid access to the data while conducting counter - terror and crime investigations .
Instead they will have to apply for the data to be released to them on a case - by - case basis to each individual telecoms and internet company .
Smith , publishing a consultation paper detailing the private sector solution , said : " Advances in communications mean that there are ever more sophisticated ways to communicate and we need to ensure that we keep up with the technology being used by those who would seek to do us harm . "
She said it was essential that the police and other crime - fighting agencies had the tools they needed to do their job .
" However , to be clear there are absolutely no plans for a single central store .
We recognise that there is a delicate balance between privacy and security , but to do nothing is not an option as we would be failing in our duty to protect the public . "
She argued that more privacy concerns were raised by the proposal to store all the personal communications data in a state - run single database than individual private companies retaining the information for access by the police and security services as and when they needed it .
The home secretary said the cost of the project was around £ 2bn over 10 years , far short of speculation that it could be as high as £ 12bn .
The Home Office consultation paper published today was originally expected in the early new year but has been delayed by an intense cabinet debate over whether or not to go ahead with the state database .
The paper makes clear that the Home Office regards it as technically the best option , describing it as " the least challenging technically to implement and the cheapest to build and run " .
But it adds that the government " recognises the privacy implications in holding all communications data from the UK in a 12 - month period in a single store .
The government therefore does not propose to pursue this approach . "
Instead communications companies are to be required by legislation to ensure that all traffic data – who sent a text to whom at what time and from where – is collected and kept in Britain .
They will also be asked to store additional third - party data crossing their networks including phone calls and internet use from outside Europe .
This goes far beyond the current data collected for billing purposes .
The companies will also be asked to organise the data – for example , matching it where it relates to the same person so that the authorities can access it in a form that is immediately usable .
Smith said that while the new system could record a visit to a social network such as Facebook , it would not record personal and private information such as photos or messages posted to a page .
" What we are talking about is who is at one end [ of a communication ] and who is at the other – and how they are communicating , " she said .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said the details of the policy remained unclear .
" The Home Office has been sending out conflicting signals on the superdatabasefor some months , frantically briefing journalists in private but failing to publish any detailed proposals , " she said .
" If this statement from the home secretary marks a genuine change of direction on privacy policy , we will welcome it .
However , it might be wise to read the small print first , " she said .

I do n’t know about you , but when I wake up I generally let out a huge yawn , stretch until I can feel ( or hear ) my joints crack and generally laze about until my brain kicks in .
Sometimes I ’ll laze in bed and read a book or check out something on my phone before I actually get out of bed and I like doing so without any obstructions .
This is generally my morning routine provided I ’ve had a good sleep .
There are a lot of things that can impact whether or not you have a good sleep .
Temperature , position , health , comfort are some of the major reasons why people can have a great sleep or a terrible sleep .
If you ’re unable to shut off your brain at night and you find yourself running through all the issues and problems you ’ve had during the day that can really put a damper on your slumber .
There ’s also a huge issue that many people face that can make or break their sleep : snoring .
Now , you might snore or your partner might snore but the fact of the matter is that someone in your house is snoring and keeping people awake .
I ’ve heard tales of those who have snored so loudly the walls shook or that the snoring was so unbearable the spouses slept separately .
While these might seem kind of funny the reality is that it ’s going to put a strain on the relationship of those in the house .
If you are a snorer or know someone who is , chances are you have been looking into ways to help stop the snoring .
You might even have read about the ZQuiet mouthpiece .
Some people snore only when they ’re sick because their noses are blocked and there are other ways to circumvent that issue .
I want to talk about the people who snore constantly and they have no idea why .
Many people snore because when they are sleeping the muscles in their mouths and neck relax and the tongue falls to the back of the mouth therefore blocking off the airway .
Some people snore because they drink or smoke before bed or because they may be struggling with weight issues .
These concerns can all be addressed by focusing on the airway .
The people who suffer with these concerns have airways that are not completely clear when they are sleeping which causes the sound we all know .
There are a lot of items on the market but there are some you should really stay away from .
One of the more popular anti-snoring devices that a lot of people are using these days is anti-snoring mouthpieces .
Some great reviews are here .
They work by sitting your mouth and either pushing your jaw forward or holding your tongue in place so Read the rest of this entry »
No image can match the real thing , but Madrid 's Prado museum has edged closer to that ideal by teaming up with Google Earth in a pioneering project that allows art lovers to zoom in on some of the gallery 's best loved masterpieces .
Fourteen of the museum 's finest works , including Velazquez 's Las Meninas , Goya 's Third of May and Rubens '
The Three Graces have been photographed to such a high resolution that details barely discernible to the naked eye become visible online .
Google 's first collaboration of its kind with an art museum , presented yesterday in Madrid , allows viewers anywhere in the world to home in on tiny sections of the chosen works , and skim the canvas in a way that is unimaginable in real life .
The images are 1,400 times clearer than anything the average tourist 's 10 - megapixel camera could render , said Javier Rodriguez Zapatero , Google Spain 's director .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It 's a unique vision .
In the museum we can not get this close to a painting ; if we did we'd need a three - metre - high ladder to get these views , " said Clara Ribera , of Google Spain .
The 14 paintings were photographed section by section in " mega high resolution " , then 8,200 photographs were stitched together digitally .
For just one of the museum 's most popular paintings , Hieronymous Bosch 's Garden of Earthly Delights , which celebrates every aspect of human ecstasy and depravity , 1,600 photographs were taken .
" There is no better way of paying tribute to the great masters than to universalise their art , and make it accessible to the greatest number of people , " the Prado 's director , Miguel Zugaza , said .
" An image is no substitute for the direct experience of the work , but these actual - sized reproductions offer prodigious realism . "
The Prado chose works it considered indispensable for any visitor .
They include works by El Greco , Rembrandt , Durer , Raphael , Van de Weyden , Tiepolo , Ribera , Fra Angelico and Titian .
" Although in my opinion we could include 1,000 more , " Mr Zugaza said .
The spectacular images will allow scholars and art lovers to study up close the lines and brushstrokes of each artist , examine the under - drawing , the cracks and imperfections of the varnish , and check the quality of restoration work .

Depending on how the pilot is received , Google may extend the initiative to other paintings and other galleries .
The United States has reportedly threatened to invade Eritrea and subject it to “ the same fate as Taliban - controlled Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks ” for providing support to the al - Shabaab resistance movement in Somalia , which the US has since attempted to link with al - Qaeda .
The Daily Telegraph quotes one source as saying “ There are consequences for working with al - Shabaab when President Obama cannot afford to look weak on terrorism . ”
Situated along the Red Sea , the State of Eritrea is a nation of under 5 million people with a long history of foreign occupation .
Bought by an Italian shipping company in 1869 , the region remained under Italian rule until 1941 , when Britain took control of them .
British control was formalized under UN auspices in 1947 , and the United Nations ceded the region to Ethiopia .
What followed was a particularly bloodly 30 - year long battle of secession between Ethiopia and an Eritrean rebel faction ( the Eritrean Liberation Front ) , which ended in 1993 when Ethiopia finally gave in to demands for an independence referrendum , which passed with 99.79 % of the votes in favor .
Eritrea has remained on poor terms with Ethiopia since , fighting a border war which ended with the installation of a UN commission to establish the still tenuous border between the two .
In 2006 , Ethiopia invaded Somalia with American support , vowing to crush the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) movement and prop up the self - proclaimed Transitional National Government ( TNG ) of Somalia , which had recently been chased from a Kenya hotel for failing to pay their bills and was attempting to assert control over the stateless region .
Eritrea backed the ICU , and later the al - Shabaab movement ostensibly to repay Somali support for their own independence bid .
Though the TNG remained on the verge of collapse , Ethiopia declared “ mission accomplished ” in December of 2008 , withdrawing its troops and claiming it had foiled a “ plan orchestrated by Eritrea . ”
The Bush Administration attempted to have Eritrea declared a “ state - sponsor of terrorism ” numerous times for backing forces in opposition to the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia .
Eritrea publicly denounced “ foreign intervention ” in Somalia and said the Ethiopian pullout had vindicated their position that military occupation would not stabilize the nation .
Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki remains defiant , saying he will continue to oppose the Western - backed TNG ’s attempt to assert control over the nation .
“ There is no government , there is not even a naiton of Somalia existing , ” the president insisted , calling for a peace conference in which all parties , including those branded by the US and Ethiopia as “ extremists ” would have a voice .
“ Peace is not guaranteed without a government agreed by all Somalis . ”
This year large metropolitan newspapers have folded in Seattle , Denver , and Tucson .
More will likely follow .
Journalists at the Post - Intelligencer , the Rocky Mountain News , and the Citizen joined the 10,000 print newsies downsized or bought out from print newsrooms over the past few decade .
Media pundits ( including me ) cluck - cluck incessantly over these democracy - wrenching signs of the impending journalistic apocalypse .
But readers in those cities still have print options for newspapers providing some local news .
Not so in the mountain town of Carbondale , Colo. , whose population about equals its elevation .
The Valley Journal , founded in 1975 , had its plug pulled in March , reports DeeDee Correll of the Center for Rural Affairs .
The 6,000 residents had no other sources of local news .
Their solution : Publish a newspaper themselves .
A core of volunteers started the Sopris Sun , running it as non-profit free weekly with a press run of 3,000 copies .
Why ’d they do it ?
Says the Journal ‘s original founder , Rebecca Young : “ It just beat the dickens out of sitting around whining that our paper was dead . ”
Carbondale ’s solution was civic - minded .
It taps every possible source of revenue , including grants .
Says Carbondale Mayor Michael Hassig :
I do n’t know if they have a business model that will work .
It would n’t surprise me if [ the newspaper ] was sustainable because there are an awful lot of people who do labors of love here .
There was a void .
Every town should have a park , a library and a newspaper . ” [ emphasis added ]
The Sun , of course , has days of reckoning ahead .
Commitment and pride may drive volunteerism , but is free labor a sustainable business model ?
Will printing 3,000 copies a week be a cost that eventually cannot be borne ?
Will volunteers shy away from penetrating coverage of their neighbors and friends who may be public officials or business owners ?
Will the Sun succumb to soft - feature - itis by being unable or unwilling to produce eat - your - veggies journalism ?
American has thousands of small daily and weekly newspapers .
The mean circulation of the American daily newspaper is about 38,000 — but I ’ll bet the median circulation is a third of that .
Small papers ’ chances of economic survival are much higher than the metro newspapers of large cities .
Small papers offer unique goods – local news and a local audience for local advertisers .
Big newspapers are targets of aggregators galore .
Their goods are not always unique .
Carbondale could react quickly to fulfill the communal void left by the demise of its newspaper .
Could Cleveland ?
Portland ( either one ) ?
Tampa Bay ?
Dallas ?
Boise ?
Toledo ?
Burlington ?
San Diego ?
St. Louis ?
Spokane ?
Buffalo ?
America ’s cities are largely served by only one daily newspaper of substance .
( Yes , that substance has been diluted by foolish cost - saving measures such as firing or buying out the professionals who report and write the product the papers are trying to sell . )
We ’ve seen the first metro dailies fail .
What happens when the lone metro of a large city ceases print publication ?
Perhaps opportunity happens .
Dan Conover , says his bio , edited a big metro-daily and took a buyout in 2008 after 18 years in the news business .
He makes this observation :
A client looking to invest in media asked me earlier this month for advice on what might replace failing newspapers .
My response ?
There are plenty of interesting ideas in play , but the first meaningful test wo n’t come until a major American city loses its only metro daily .
So wait .
That ’s because metro newspapers are taking up the market space in which the innovation he ’s looking for must occur .
Newspapers may be failing , but most do a passable job of limiting serious competition in their markets .
What succeeds in the shadow of an established metro , therefore , may not be what ultimately winds up contending for the market positions vacated by Old Media giants .
[ emphasis added ]
That ’s an interesting perspective .
So pundits like me will be watching what ’s lining up to contest for that “ market space ” about to be relinquished , developments in Seattle , Denver , and Tucson suggest , by large metro dailies .

Editor ’s note : The Coast Guard is one of the five elements of the U.S. Armed Forces .
In short , the military is now feeding the homeless and hungry .
How long before they are feeding them in FEMA camps ?
PHILADELPHIA — Petty Officer 3rd Class Jordan R. Perry and Petty Officer 3rd Class Matthew Thompson , members of the electronic support detachment at Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City , help other volunteers work the serving line at Saint John ’s Hospice in Philadelphia , Tuesday , March 31 .
[ efoods ]
Perry and Thompson are first - time volunteers for the feed the homeless program .
The cinder - block walls of the cafeteria were painted an antique yellow .
A tattered American flag hung in the doorway of the small table - filled area .
The clanking of silverware and utensils overwhelm the undersized kitchen quarters .
The limited serving domain was brimming with aluminum containers filled with a variety of nourishing foods donated to the cause .
An assembly of men of all walks of life patiently waits their turn , out the building , around the corner and down a busy street in central Philadelphia .
This building holds a sign tall and proud , which states clearly : Saint John ’s Hospice seeks to be a community grounded in faith and service where homeless persons find dignity , respect , nourishment and opportunities for a new beginning .

Vice President Joe Biden issued a high - level admonishment to Israel ’s new government Tuesday that it would be “ ill advised ” to launch a military strike against Iran .
Biden said in a CNN interview that he does not believe newly installed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would take such a step .
Even so , his comment underscored a gap between the conservative new Israeli government and the Obama White House on a series of questions , including the Israeli - Palestinian peace process and Iran .
While the Obama administration has made a series of recent overtures to Tehran , the Israelis have grown more confrontational out of concern that the Islamic Republic ’s increasing nuclear know - how could one day become an existential threat .
Netanyahu signaled several times during his election campaign that he would not tolerate a nuclear - armed Iran .
“ I promise that if I am elected , Iran will not acquire nuclear arms , ” he said in one appearance , “ and this implies everything necessary to carry this out . ”

With his brief comment Tuesday , Biden became the highest - ranking administration official to caution the Jewish state against a military strike .
In the interview , Biden was asked whether he was concerned that Netanyahu might strike Iranian nuclear facilities .
“ I do n’t believe Prime Minister Netanyahu would do that .
I think he would be ill advised to do that , ” Biden said .
“ And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago . ”
But many U.S. officials believe Israel is serious .
Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , head of U.S. forces in the Middle East , told senators this month that the Israeli government may be “ so threatened by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon that it would take preemptive military action to derail or delay it . ”

Other U.S. officials have made it clear in the past that they would prefer that Israel not carry out a strike against Iran .
Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , cautioned last summer against military action .
“ This is a very unstable part of the world , ” he said then .
“ And I do n’t need it to be more unstable . ”
Among other concerns , U.S. Defense Department officials worry that Iran might retaliate by striking at U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq .
Differences between U.S. and Israeli officials also are emerging on key issues involving the Palestinians .
Netanyahu has not embraced Washington ’s goal of an independent Palestinian state , and some of his key supporters favor expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank , an idea criticized by President Obama .

But U.S. views are important to the Israelis .
Steven J. Rosen , a former policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , an influential lobbying group , said a decision by Israel to attack Iran ’s nuclear facilities “ depends to a large extent on the impact such a strike might have on the United States . ”
He made the comment in a blog , the Obama Mideast Monitor .
Many top officials in the Obama administration have said they believe the costs of a U.S. attack on Iran would outweigh any benefits , and they are considered less likely to favor military action than the Bush administration .
One hint of the Obama administration ’s intentions may lie in its choice of top experts .
Richard C. Holbrooke , the administration ’s representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan , has hired longtime Iran expert Vali Nasr .
Dennis Ross , senior administration advisor for Southwest Asia , has hired Ray Takeyh , another veteran Iran expert .

Both Nasr and Takeyh have advocated diplomatic engagement with Tehran .

The German government is planning to ban paintball and laser shooting games in reaction to the recent school massacre in which 15 people died .
Under legislation agreed by the ruling coalition of the chancellor , Angela ­Merkel , using air rifles to shoot paint - filled pellets at opponents is likely to be made illegal , and would be punishable with fines of up to € 5,000 ( £ 4,480 ) .
The decision , which is expected to be fast - tracked through the Bundestag before the summer recess , comes two months after 17 - year - old Tim Kretschmar shot dead 15 people at his former school in Winnenden , south - west Germany , with a weapon he had taken from his father 's bedroom .
Kretschmar 's love of paintball as well as violent video and computer games was widely publicised .
The government has found itself under pressure to tighten gun laws in Germany in what has become one of the main issues before a general election in September .
" This so - called game plays down violence , leading to the danger that people have fewer inhibitions about shooting each other , " said Dieter Wiefelsputz , of the Social Democrats .
Owners of paintball arenas , which are already out of bounds for under - 18s , said they felt they were easy targets in what opposition politicians have referred to as " populistic placebo politics " .
Arne Petry , spokesman for the German Paintball League , said : " Paintball is not about simulating bloodbaths – the most you 're going to end up with is a bruise or two . "
The owner of one of Germany 's largest paintball halls , north - west of Berlin , said he thought the ban ironic , not least because " many of my customers are government workers " .
He said he counted bank managers , firefighters , police and even security guards from Merkel 's chancellery among his regular customers .
" They come here after their shifts to let off steam and stay for several hours at a time , " he said , requesting anonymity .
The new law is also expected to forbid under - 18s access to high - calibre guns and to make it easier for police to carry out random controls at the homes of registered gun owners .
Claudia Roth , head of the Green party , said that while she was no fan of paintball , the government 's plan to ban it was hypocritical and amounted to a " cowardly concession to the gun lobby " .
" They should instead be banning high - calibre weapons , " she said .
A new algorithm can pack any 50 differently sized discs into a smaller space than any other , and could help pack 3D objects into smaller spaces too .
That could make shipping and delivery services less tough on resources ( Image : Johannes Schneider and colleagues )
Geeky holidaymakers wanting to take more on a trip , as well as delivery firms trying to maximise loads and storage , could benefit from a new algorithm that packs collections of differently sized 2D shapes into the smallest available space with unprecedented efficiency .
This may seem like a more academic version of the video game Tetris , but the techniques developed can be applied to 3D problems in the real world .
Increasing packing efficiency this way would lower the cost and also the environmental impact of shipping .
Fitting a set of objects into the smallest amount of space is such a complex scientific problem that researchers have yet to calculate the single best solution if more than around 20 objects are involved .
Advertisement
To get closer to that optimum fit , researchers pit their algorithms against each other in competitions to solve particular packing problems , such as fitting a collection of differently sized discs inside the smallest circle possible without overlaps .
Johannes Schneider ‘s team at the University of Mainz has just smashed all previous records in that disc - packing problem .
New direction
Their new algorithm matched all the records for packing up to 23 different sized discs in the smallest possible circle and broke all those for packing between 26 and 50 discs – challenges set in a previous competition contested by 155 groups from 32 countries .
The secret to the team ’s success is their algorithm ’s ability to take backward , as well as forward steps .
Packing algorithms usually shuffle the discs again and again , aiming to reduce the space they occupy each time .
But that ’s rather like asking a mountaineer to find the highest point on Earth by always walking uphill , says Schneider .
“ Using this approach the mountaineer would climb to the top of a nearby hill , but there he would be stuck . ”
So Schneider and colleagues ’ algorithm allows for occasional reverse steps that can unlock better solutions – disc arrangements that take up more space than the previous one , but lead to even more compact packs .
The algorithm uses backward moves often at the start of a packing process but they become less frequent as it closes in on the final solution , he says .
Although the new algorithm has n’t solved the packing problem for good , it provides the best solutions to date .
Three dimensions
“ Making the use of backtracking moves more explicit is certainly a merit , and one of the main reasons for the successful approach , ” says Marco Locatelli at the University of Turin , a member of the team that previously held most of those records .
However , he points out that packing algorithms improve fast and records rarely stand for long .
Locatelli would like to see how the new algorithm performs in other packing problem scenarios , including in three dimensions , something that Schneider ’s team plans to explore .
“ We now have an algorithm which is able to solve packing problems with [ 3D ] goods of different sizes in general , ” he says , making it applicable to real - world problems .
“ Shipping companies face the problem of packing trucks or ships in a way that as many goods as possible can be placed inside . ”
Schneider also plans to take the order in which objects are packed into account .
“ For example , the driver of a parcel delivery service must not unload half of his truck in order to get to the parcel which he should deliver to the next customer , ” he says .

Media files , data synchronization , and remote backups , oh my !
Home computing has advanced to a point where it 's practical to run your own home server , and we 're running down the five best tools for the job .

Earlier this week we asked you to tell us what software you used to power your home servers and add that extra kick of convenience and power to your home networks .
After tallying up the votes we 're back to share the top five contenders for the home server championship belt .
The following server implementations cover a broad spectrum of solutions ranging from install - it - and - forget - it to tinker - your - way - to - perfection and everything in between .

FreeNAS is by the far the most bare bones home server software in the top five .
More specifically , FreeNAS is an extremely minimal distribution of FreeBSD .
How minimal , you ask ?
You can run FreeNAS off a 32 MB flash drive .
Designed to be an absolutely skeletal operating system to maximize the resources devoted to storage FreeNAS is great for when you want a simple operating system that leaves every hard drive bay and disk platter wide open for file storage goodness .
Despite being so slim , FreeNAS is still feature packed , including support for BitTorrent and remote web - based file management via QuiXplorer ; it even serves as the perfect iTunes music server .
You can boo FreeNAS off nearly any media : hard drives , optical discs , floppy disks , and flash - based media .
It has support for both hardware and software based RAID , disk encryption , and management of groups and users via local authentication or Microsoft Domains .
Even an old dusty Pentium III can become a headless file - serving powerhouse with the addition of a basic $ 20 SATA PCI card to pack it full of modern hard drives , thanks to FreeNAS 's scant 96 MB of RAM requirements .

Ubuntu Server Edition shares the ease of use that has catapulted its desktop - edition sibling to popularity .
The automated LAMP ( Linux , Apache , MySQL , and PHP ) installation makes installing the core components of a robust server a walk in the park compared to manually configuring each component on your own .
While configuring Ubuntu is n't going to be as easy as grabbing a pre-configured Windows Home Server off the shelf at your local Best Buy and plugging it in , there are a wealth of applications to help you integrate your Linux based home server with the rest of your network .
It wo n't be as straight forward as using Windows Home Server or a Time Machine backup , but Ubuntu is more than powerful and capable enough to handle all your media streaming , remote back up , and file serving needs .
We 've covered using Ubuntu as the basis for a home media server before , so if you 're considering trying it out check out how to build a Linux media server and build yourself an affordable media server to get an idea of what you 're in for .

Apache is the only entry in the top five that is n't a completely stand alone server package .
Apache is , however , open source and cross platform ; it support a dozen operating systems ; and it's the backbone of many of your fellow readers ' home server operations .
Because of its widespread adoption and extreme compatibility with a variety of platforms , we 're including it here .
No matter what operating system you throw on your home server , you 're almost guaranteed that you can run Apache on it .
Nearly four years ago we covered how to set up a personal web server using Apache , and it 's still relevant and worth a look for getting an idea what the setup entails .
While you 're at it , you may also want to try setting up a home Subversion server with your Apache installation for keeping track of file revisions .

Why use Debian for a home server ?
There are over twenty five thousands software packages available for Debian , and the operating system supports 12 unique hardware architectures .
There 's a a slim - to - none chance you 've got a computer that can't run it .
Like Ubuntu —a Debian derivative by the way — you can configure this flexible operating system to do nearly anything you can imagine , from serving media and remote backups to running your own web server with a wiki and running your own mail server .
Like other Linux distributions , Debian can be used to run a low - power and headless server when run without a GUI and using remote administration .
Along with FreeNAS , Debian is a prime candidate for turning an aging computer into a quiet , tucked - in - the - basement server .

If your home is filled with Windows - based computers — which the average American home certainly is — it's tough to go wrong with Windows Home Server .
It is n't free , and until recently you could n't even buy it separately from the home servers sold by Hewlett Packard and others — but even though it has the distinction of being both the only commercial and closed - source software package on the list , that does n't mean you should dismiss it out of hand .
Windows Home Server stands definitively as the most Average Joe-friendly server implementation on the list .
Not only is it the only server package you can buy pre-configured and installed in a ready to go off - the - shelf server , but Microsoft has gone out of their way to make the experience of using Windows Home Server as transparent and painless as possible for the end user .
In fact , many Lifehacker readers expressed the " It just works " sentiment when logging a vote for Windows Home Server .
Once you have all your computers connected to your Windows Home Server , you 'll have a centralized backup location that supports up to 10 remote PCs and indexed remote file storage .
Printers are shared and there is easy to use remote server access to log into your archives from anywhere in the world .
Files are no longer lost in a mass of drives , add a few terabyte drives to a Windows Home Server and you 'll never wonder if that movie file is on the F , G , or H drive again .
Windows Home Server spans drives using Drive Extender so that files are located in a single folder namespace , sans drive divisions .
The most recent update of Windows Home Server even adds an option to backup the server itself to external drives for extra data redundancy .

The former chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell , Ret. Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson was on The Rachel Maddow Show where he described former vice president Dick Cheney as a man who frightens easily .
Wilkerson also said that Cheney is trying to set up a legal defense for himself against torture charges .
Here is the video .
( The interview begins at the 5:30 mark ) :
Advertisements
As Wilkerson said , “ He is a man who lives on fear , and he is a fearful man .
I think this as you hinted is his effort because he is fearful right now of what might happen to him and some of his subordinates .
He is trying to lay out some sort of defense , but the defense does n’t hold water from my point of view . ”
It is possible that Cheney requested that two memos be declassified strictly to make a political point , but it is just as likely that Cheney is trying to head off any potential charges that could be brought against him for his role in setting up or approving the Bush torture policy .
In my opinion , President Obama has more important things to do than investigate the Bush administration , but he may not be able to escape this issue anytime soon , if Congress decides to conduct their own investigations and hold their own hearings .
Obama has already shot down the ideas of a appointing a special prosecutor or a commission .
However this may not stop the Democrats in Congress from defying Obama .
There are two schools of thought behind why an investigation is merited .
There are people out there who want a truth commission appointed , so that the nation can hear all the facts and hopefully avoid getting into a situation like this again , but there are also the diehards who believe that members of the Bush administration should face criminal charges .
I am in favor of getting all the facts , but not criminal charges .
I believe that retroactively prosecuting members of a previous administration sets a dangerous precedent .
As I used to constantly remind Republicans who applauded every time George W. Bush expanded the power of the Executive Branch , these decisions cut both ways .
In this case , if Democrats insist on prosecuting former Bush administration officials , they are opening the door for these types of prosecutions to become partisan and common .
Democrats had two years to investigate George W. Bush after they assumed control of Congress .
Once again , I think a truth commission is a great idea .
I like the idea of potentially disbarring the attorneys who knowingly warped existing laws when they authored the torture memos , but I do n’t think that criminal prosecutions are the wise way to go .
Cheney is guided by fear , so it would n’t be a surprise if his defense of torture is so vigorous because he is worried about saving his own skin .
I ’m sitting in a generic - looking clinic waiting room .
The space is clean .
Empty .
Quiet .
The all - purpose art on the walls matches the neutral - colored couches .
A receptionist at the office window , a 30 - something brunette clad in scrubs and a sensible cardigan , sits at a desk and appears busy .
It looks like any doctor ’s office .
Totally normal .
I ’m filling out a form .
It ’s only two pages long and does n’t ask the usual personal and medical information .
One page asks for my name , contact info , date of birth and date of my last period .
The other is a disclosure form .
It notifies me that the people I ’m about to talk to do not have psychological degrees and have not gone to medical school .
The volunteers , the form says , should not be considered a substitute for professional counseling .
Oh , and the pregnancy test I ’m about to take , the form tells me , should not be considered a clinical diagnosis .
I ’m at Avenues in Glendale , which — despite all the above disclaimers — styles itself a “ pregnancy clinic . ”
I ’ve come to Avenues Pregnancy Clinic , located on West Glenoaks Boulevard , to do some undercover investigating after hearing a bizarre story from a friend .
Maggie , as we ’ll call her , is 23 years old .
She ’s what I call a yoga twinkie ( not to her face ) : sweet , open - minded and sometimes naïve .
Maggie just moved in with her new boyfriend .
It ’s the first time she ’s lived with anyone .
She ’s elated , she ’s in love , and now she ’s late .
Just by a couple of days , but she ’s worried .
Maggie is proudly paying her own way through college .
There ’s a sign in a medical office complex on the way home from her job touting “ Free Pregnancy Test . ”
So she goes .
To her relief , her test comes back negative .
To her surprise , she ’s kept in what she describes as a backroom , where several women , dressed as nurses , want to speak with her about her life decisions .
Maggie is far too polite to try to leave or question her detention .
The women talk to her about “ living in sin . ”
They ask her if she believes in God .
Yeah , sure , she tells them , she believes in God ( and Allah and Buddha and the Master Cleanse ) .
After two - and - a - half hours the nurses ask Maggie if she would like to give her life to Jesus Christ and pray with them .
Maggie is blindsided .
All she wanted was to know if she was pregnant .
She leaves with a Bible and an existential crisis .
“ They were so convincing ; they said all this stuff , ” Maggie tells me , in tears , after her ordeal .
“ I do n’t know .
Is it wrong that I ’m living with Mike ? ”
Her voice seems earnestly stressed about the answer .
“ Tina , do you think I ’m going to hell ? ”
Avenues is a California primary clinic , fully licensed and accredited by the state .
So exactly what kind of medical facility lures women with the promise of free pregnancy tests and leaves them fearing eternal damnation ?
The mission statement on Avenues ’
Web site reads , “ Avenues Pregnancy Clinic is a Christ - centered ministry dedicated to affirming the value of life .
Our mission is to provide a network of care to those experiencing pregnancy - related crisis and compassionately presenting Biblical truth resulting in changed lives to the glory of God . ”
According to their site , Avenues has been “ presenting Biblical truth ” to women since 1988 .
And no , this is not Honduras .
This is not even Arkansas .
This is Los Angeles County .
A 2006 article in The New York Times says there are anywhere from 2,300 to 3,500 of these religious - themed clinics , often referred to as “ crisis pregnancy centers , ” nationwide , compared with around 1,800 abortion providers .
Planned Parenthood has 15 clinics in the LA area .
LifeCall.org , a pro-life resource Web site , mentions 25 or more centers in the same area .
Typically , as is the case with Avenues , the religious intentions of these clinics - in - name - only are n’t publicly displayed on their sign or even on their disclosure forms .
They intentionally camouflage themselves to look like medical facilities , following the advice of Robert Pearson , who — after Hawaii decriminalized abortion in 1967 — started the first crisis pregnancy center in Honolulu to combat it .
The Pearson Foundation Manual , “ How to Start and Operate Your Own Pro-Life Outreach Crisis Pregnancy Center , ” published in 1984 , is still used today as a blueprint .
Pearson writes , “ Obviously , we ’re fighting Satan .
A killer , who in this case is the girl who wants to kill her baby , has no right to information that will help her kill her baby . ”
The camouflage is still used , even today .
“ I thought I was at a medical clinic , ” recalls Judy , a gruff 43 - year - old mother of one , who mistakenly went into Avenues because it ’s adjacent to her general practitioner ’s office .
“ I told them the same dialogue I was going to tell my doctor . ”
Judy was pregnant .
The volunteers at Avenues put her in the backroom and told her if she had an abortion she would have problems “ getting into heaven . ”
Judy had already had an abortion 20 years ago .
A recovering drug addict , Judy was afraid that if she had another child she could “ revert back to addiction ” as she did when her 9 - year - old was born .
“ I was vulnerable , ” she says .
“ I was falling apart . ”
Like Maggie , Judy was kept there for two hours .
“ I heard that I was going to hell and that I was fucked , ” she remembers .
They hooked her up to the ultrasound to “ see the heartbeat , ” a procedure that Chicago - based gynecologist and author Dr. Michael Applebaum describes as both unnecessary and even irresponsible .
“ It ’s not an emergency to have an ultrasound immediately , ” he says , adding that “ medical tests should n’t be performed without a reason . ”
Judy describes her visit to Avenues as a trip into “ The Twilight Zone . ”
A week later she found an actual women ’s clinic and terminated her pregnancy , a decision she says that she is happy with .
But her detour to Avenues still haunts her .
“ I do n’t like what I went through , ” she says .
“ Bizarre is putting it lightly .
It ’s like I slipped into hell for a minute .
[ What they do in Avenues ] just does n’t go with the face of the physical place .
It was a horrible experience — just manipulative .
Deceptive !
That ’s what I feel — deceived . ”
In the waiting room , I write my drag queen name ( favorite pet plus street I grew up on ) , “ Sasha Collins , ” on the form .
I ’m / she is four days late .
A woman in scrubs calls out my name and leads me through the halls to the backroom that Maggie described .
There ’s a desk , more generic office artwork , some literature and a chair I plop down on .
I appear to be the only client in the building that day .
A sturdy woman with shaggy blond hair who will later give me her card with the name Melissa Knox , RN , comes in .
She sits down and shuffles through her official - looking paperwork .
“ Have you given any thoughts to what you ’re going to do if you ’re pregnant ? ” she asks .
I say I do n’t know .
I tell her I have no money , and my boyfriend I was living with just left me .
“ Is n’t there , like , a pill or something I can take ? ” I ask .
“ There is .
It ’s called RU486 .
But you can only take it if you are less than three weeks pregnant . ”
From the information I gave her , I would be around three weeks pregnant , maybe less .
She grabs a chart and shows me .
“ Since your last period was on this date , if you ’re pregnant , you ’re at least five weeks along right now . ”
“ Really ? ” I ask , peering closer at the chart .
“ Oh my God ! ” I say , pretending to be shocked , but simultaneously actually shocked .
“ Yeah , is n’t that weird how that works , ” she offers .
Indeed .
“ Plus , ” she says matter - of - factly , “ the FDA is under investigation for RU486 .
They ’re going to be in a lot of trouble . ”
“ Wow ! Really ? ” I play along .
Just who investigates the FDA ?
I wonder , but never ask .
“ OK , we ’re going to give you a urine test to see if you ’re pregnant .
Now if you are … ” she pauses dramatically , “ we have to give you an ultrasound , kay ?
We do that , kay , to see if the fetus is viable .
Thirty percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriages , so we need to know what ’s going on , kay ? ”
She hands me another disclosure form , this one stating that the ultrasound is also not a clinical diagnosis .
Basically contradicting what she just said .
Dr. Applebaum says that not as many pregnancies end in miscarriage as Melissa claimed .
And RU486 ?
It ’s called Mifepristone in this country , and most guidelines state that a woman can take it up to two months after their last period .
I pee into a cup .
In the room where I drop it off is the massive ultrasound machine .
It is the only medical equipment in the place .
I was expecting to see at least a tongue depressor .
A couple of minutes later Melissa enters the backroom I ’m in .
“ OK , your pregnancy test came back negative . ”
“ Awesome ! ” I bleat .
“ What a relief ! ”
Melissa sits down at her desk and abruptly launches into her personal story .
“ I am a very sexual person , ” she informs me , “ but you know latex allows viruses to seep through . ”
Latex ?
The same material surgical gloves are made out of ?
Viruses seeping through ?!
Then Melissa announces she personally has forgone sex for the past eight years .
“ My God !
How do you do that ? ”
I ask .
“ With God , ” she responds .
“ I pray … a lot . ”
Why not be candid ?
Why not give accurate medical facts ?
Why mask the religious intention ?
Why all the sneakiness ?
Is n’t this a classic bait and switch ?
Go in for a root canal and come out with fire insurance ?
Is n’t this fraud ?
“ I would be curious to know what kind of medical license allows a clinic to NOT offer health care , ” says Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney , D - NY .
In 2006 , Maloney sponsored HR 5052 , the Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women ’s Services Act .
“ We have to protect the First Amendment , ” she tells me by email .
“ We ca n’t clamp down on the honest opinions of those who disagree with those of us who are pro-choice .
What we CAN do is what my bill does , which is clamp down on those who advertise with intent to deceive , and empower the [ Federal Trade Commission ] to enforce such a provision . ”
The bill would have outlawed these fake clinics .
It was co-sponsored by 46 members of Congress , including Rahm Emanuel , now President Obama ’s chief of staff , and Hilda Solis , now the Secretary of Labor .
However , the bill died in committee .
“ Marketing should be 100 percent truthful , ” says Dan Steiner , president of Avenues , when reached by phone .
Is Avenues 100 percent truthful ?
Says Steiner , “ Absolutely . ”
Mission Pre-Born ( MP ) , is Steiner ’s broad nonprofit .
Its stewardship guidelines read , “ Full disclosure [ walking in the light ] is our practice . ”
His “ vision ” is to bring more “ fully disclosed ” crisis pregnancy centers to LA County in what he likes to call the “ Miracle Campaign . ”
However , when asked about the cryptic forms that state that none of the tests should be considered a clinical diagnosis , Steiner responds , “ I ’m not aware of the form . ”
Steiner , who could be entered in a Ross Perot look - alike contest , explains Avenues tactics and hopes for a new clinic in Hollywood on a fundraising video on the MP Web site : “ This is the front door of Los Angeles City College .
All the students come out here and if they have a suspicion that they have an unplanned pregnancy , day after day they will see our sign , ‘ Free Pregnancy Test , ’ right across the street .
They ’ll see it before they see Planned Parenthood ; they ’ll see it before they see the abortion clinic .
Then they walk out and there it will be and BANG ! ”
He slaps his hands together .
“ We ’ve captured that woman before the abortionist does ! ”
Bang ?
We ’ve captured that woman ?
“ Capture their attention , ” Steiner attempts to clarify .
Minutes later the video is taken down from the Web .
“ Captured is a good word , ” says Joyce Schorr , president and founder of Women ’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project , or WRRAP .
“ They have to capture you because what they do is not aboveboard .
“ To not say who you really are is to have an illegal front , ” continues Schorr .
“ [ Avenues and clinics like it ] continue to be effective because there is no public outcry , because people do n’t care . ”
But that ’s not the only reason .
This common kind of deceit in women ’s health care has its allies .
Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D .
Antonovich , arguably one of the most powerful men in California , is listed on Avenues ’ advisory board .
He oddly omits the affiliation with the clinic from his bio on his Web site .
When asked about this , Antonovich ’s press secretary Tony Bell says curtly , “ We certainly can add that . ”
As to whether the supervisor is aware of the misleading practices done by an organization he ’s advising , Bell simply states , “ He supports the mission . ”
In the backroom , Melissa tells me about all the reasons I should never have intercourse .
“ Every woman , when she has sex , gives away a little piece of her heart , ” she says , then hands me a fistful of abstinence literature .
We chitchat a bit more before Melissa finally stands up , indicating I can go .
She escorts me to the back door and hands me a flyer to see her band play the following week .
I wonder why I did n’t get a Bible .
The receptionist in the office is there to see me off .
“ We had another clinic in Hollywood , ” she informs me on my way out .
“ We ’re trying to get back there again because we ’re so badly needed there . ” I nod and walk out the door .
What could possibly be so badly needed ?
I just spent nearly two hours of my time to get an admittedly unreliable pregnancy test , erroneous medical information and find out more than I ever wanted to know about the life of a sexless 35 - year - old bass player .
This is a licensed medical clinic .
It ’s usually safe to assume that medical clinics provide medical care .
But if you have the capacity to bear children , those rules apparently do n’t apply .
If a cancer clinic were run as a Christian Scientist front there would be anger .
There would be disgust .
It would be shut down .
But the distraught woman in dire circumstances — “ a killer who in this case is the girl ” — being routinely defrauded because she “ has no right to information ” has gone unnoticed by the general public .
As I walk down the street back to my car , I glance at one of the abstinence flyers Melissa gave me during her oversharing session .
“ True love , ” it says , “ protects 100 percent of the time . ”
Scientists have discovered an elusive , alternative type of fat in adults which could hold the key to effortlessly shedding excess kilos .
Researchers in the Netherlands have found evidence of " brown fat " working in a group of young men , a discovery which runs counter to the conventional view the unique substance disappears during childhood .
" The function of brown fat in infants is to burn energy to produce heat , to maintain body temperature , " Sydney - based Dr Tim Gill said of brown fat 's amazing extra ability over ordinary white fat .
" In your body you use energy to grow and move and breathe ( and ) if you want to burn up more energy you have to exercise , that 's the only thing you can do . "
" But with brown fat it uncouples that , it can burn off energy just to produce heat . "
In short , white fat is an energy store which is used up during human movement and body functioning .
Brown fat can take these stores and convert it straight into heat , causing a rise in body temperature but the process is otherwise effortless .
Dr Gill said if scientists could find a way to harness the mechanism used by brown fat , people could quit their gym and instead flick an internal switch to " waste " those excess calories as heat .
" Up till now we 've not found effective way to do that that is safe , " he said .
" The body has mechanisms for wasting energy when necessary but normally it is extremely good at conserving energy ( i.e. as conventional white fat ) " .
The Maastrich University study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , took 24 men and split them into " lean " and " overweight or obese " groups .
The men were exposed to a pleasant 22 degrees celsius , and they were put through a range of complex tests designed to shown any heating effect from brown fat .
The tests were run again at a cool 16 degrees , and all but one of the men showed evidence of brown fat in operation .
The overweight men also showed a significantly weaker response , leading researchers to conclude " the percentage of young men with brown adipose tissue is high but its activity is reduced in men who are overweight or obese " .
Dr Gill said this could be because men who had lower levels of brown fat found it easier to put on weight .
" This is one study which is suggesting we need to revise our thinking which dismissed the role of brown fat in obesity and weight gain , " he said .
There 's also bad news for dieters - there 's no way to replace fat in our food with this good brown fat .
" It 's like being tall , you can't change your height - brown fat is something you inherit , " he said .
Dr Gill is Associate Professor at the University of Sydney 's Institute of Obesity , Nutrition and Exercise .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - For IBM , buying Sun Microsystems
Inc makes a lot of good business sense :
It removes a competitor , strengthens IBM against rival Hewlett - Packard and picks up on the cheap the intellectual property of one of Silicon Valley ’s most respected companies .
Employees follows a speech at the booth of IBM at CeBIT computer fair in Hanover March 3 , 2009 .

While it may be tough to persuade regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to approve the deal , and melding easy - going Sun with more conservative Big Blue will be a challenge , many analysts believe IBM has a good chance of doing just that .
“ This is a very difficult environment in which to gain market share .
That ’s probably an easier way than putting more sales people on the ground , ” said Pat Becker Jr , chief investment officer for Becker Capital , which manages about $ 1.6 billion and holds a small number of shares in IBM .
Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said IBM IBM.N and HP HPQ.N have been trying to woo customers away from Sun JAVA .
O for years .
“ Sun ’s installed base is pretty good .
While it is shrinking , it is fairly loyal .
And what better way to get to that customer base than just buying the company , ” he said .
And then there ’s International Business Machines Corp ’s track record .
It has spent some $ 25 billion since 2003 to buy 80 companies , with only a few hiccups along the way .
IBM offered to purchase Sun -- whose market value tops $ 6 billion -- for $ 9.55 per share after a thorough vetting , a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday .
That source , who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly , said a final agreement could be announced within days .
Both companies have declined comment .
The deal would add what was one of the world ’s hottest brands during the dot.com technology boom to IBM ’s arsenal of computer services , hardware and software products .
While Sun is expected to post a loss this year as it undertakes a massive restructuring , laying off thousands of workers , buying the company would give a boost to IBM ’s lagging sales .
Analysts expect the recession and currency headwinds to cause revenue to slip 6 percent this year to $ 98 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Sun ’s sales are seen falling 11 percent to $ 12 billion in its current fiscal year .
But IBM is well positioned to slash Sun ’s costs and boost the profitability of its businesses , analysts and investors said .
When IBM acquires a company , it slashes overhead and dramatically increases distribution using its own sales force , one of the world ’s largest .
Buying
Sun would give IBM a clear lead at the high - end of the $ 45 billion overall server market that it fights over with Hewlett - Packard .
The deal would also broaden IBM 's software portfolio and add storage products that vie with EMC Corp EMC.N and Network Appliance Inc NTAP.O .
It would also provide an edge over Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O , which some see as IBM 's biggest rival in the long term .
Kim Caughey , an analyst with Fort Pitt Capital , which holds IBM shares , expects IBM to generate efficiencies through moving production of Sun ’s high - end computer chips to IBM ’s own plants and dropping Sun products with low margins .
Sun is best known for its high - end Unix servers favored by big financial services firms , telecommunications carriers and government agencies .
IBM led that $ 17 billion market last year with a 37.2 percent share of sales , followed by Sun with 28.1 percent and HP with 26.5 percent .
Pat Becker Jr of Becker Capital said Sun ’s
Unix server sales may be poised to pick up as many customers are using machines purchased in the 1990s that are wearing out .
When they do , IBM may be able to simultaneously sell them products in its broad portfolio , including storage equipment , software and services .
While neither company has publicly commented on the talks , a person familiar with the negotiations told Reuters IBM reduced its original offer for Sun , from somewhere between $ 10 and $ 11 to $ 9.55 after completing a thorough due diligence .
Thomas Lys , a professor of accounting at the Kellogg School of Management , said that may be because IBM discovered some weaknesses during its review .
“ Sun is struggling .
They are getting a company that needs restructuring , ” Lys said .
“ The good news is that Sun ’s problems are known . ”
Analysts expect IBM would likely cut thousands more jobs beyond what Sun has already announced .
But they added it would be important for IBM to retain the most talented workers and a culture that has fostered innovation .
“ I think it ’s important that they do not break the Sun culture .
If all they do is buy the Sun customer base and beat these guys into submission , then they lose half of what they ’ve paid for , ” said Howard Anderson , a professor with MIT ’s Entrepreneurship Center .

The return of cult sci- fi comedy show Red Dwarf pulled in the highest ratings ever for digital channel Dave over the Easter weekend .
Red Dwarf : Back to Earth attracted more than 2 m viewers when its first new episode was screened at 2100 on Good Friday , early figures indicated .
It smashed Dave 's usual ratings for the time slot , which averaged 266,000 for the whole of 2008 .
The show reunited the original cast who starred in the BBC series .
Dwarf revival
The show was watched by 10 % of the entire digital audience and beat BBC Two , which broadcast live golf , and Five , which broadcast US drama NCIS , in the same time slot .
Later figures revealed a further 342,000 watched the first Red Dwarf instalment on the timeshift channel Dave ja vu an hour later .
Another 226,000 people recorded the show and watched it after its original broadcast .
The revival is one of the most popular non-terrestrial commissioned shows , in terms of the live audience for a first broadcast .
In 2006 , Torchwood 's launch episode on BBC Three and the first instalment of Sky One 's Terry Pratchett adaptation Hogfather , each attracted a live audience of 2.4 m viewers .
The two following Red Dwarf episodes across the weekend scored a total of 1.7 m and 1.3 m viewers respectively , including timeshift viewers .
Red Dwarf ran for eight series on BBC
Two between 1988 and 1999 and remains the channel 's highest rated show .
At its peak , it pulled in around 8 m viewers and was broadcast in more than 25 countries .
Those who followed news coverage of the " tea party " protests last month will recall that one target of the partiers ' ire was the TARP bailout of the banking system -- a policy of the Bush administration that President Obama has carried on .

It has not taken long for the global financial crisis to affect the world 's oldest profession in Germany .
In one of the few countries where prostitution is legal , the industry has responded with an economic stimulus package of its own : modern marketing tools , rebates , discounts and gimmicks to boost falling demand .
Some brothels have cut prices or added free promotions , while others have introduced all - inclusive flat - rate fees .
Free shuttle buses , discounts for seniors and taxi drivers , as well as " day passes " are among marketing strategies designed to keep business going .

" Times are tough for us too , " said Karin Ahrens , who manages the Yes , Sir brothel in Hanover .
Revenue had dropped by 30 per cent at her establishment , she said , while turnover had fallen by as much as 50 per cent at other clubs .
" We 're definitely feeling the crisis .
Clients are being tight with their money .
They 're afraid .
You can't charge for the extras any more and there is pressure to cut prices . "
Germany has about 400,000 professional prostitutes .
In 2002 , legislation allowed prostitutes to advertise and enter into formal labour contracts .
It opened the way for them to get health insurance , previously refused if they listed their true profession .
Annual revenues are about £ 12.3bn , according to an estimate by the Verdi services union .
Taxes on prostitution are an important source of income for some cities .
Prostitution is also legal and regulated in the Netherlands , Austria , Switzerland , Hungary , Greece , Turkey , in some parts of Australia , and the US state of Nevada .
Berlin's Pussy Club has attracted media attention with its headline - grabbing " flat rate " – a € 70 admission charge for unlimited food , drink and sex between 10 am and 4 pm .
" You 've got to come up with creative solutions these days , " said club manager Stefan , who requested his surname not be published .
" We 're feeling the economic crisis , too , even though business has , fortunately , been more or less OK for us so far . "
Stefan , who runs other establishments in Heidelberg and Wuppertal besides the Berlin club , said the flat rate had helped to keep the 30 women working in each location fully employed .
Other novel ideas include loyalty cards , group sex parties , and rebates for golf players .
Hamburg 's GeizHaus is especially proud of its discount € 38.50 price .
Anke Christiansen , manager of the GeizHaus , said the effects of the economic crisis were clear .
" The regular customers who used to come by two or three times a week are only coming by once or twice a week now . "
A client , who gave his name as Pascal , said : " Naturally , we 're all feeling the effects of the crisis . "
He added that he could no longer afford his usual two or three visits a week .
Günter Krull , manager of the FKK - Villa in Hanover , agreed : " The girls are complaining , too , because business is bad and I worry that it 's all going to get even worse . "
Ecki Krumeich , the manager of the upmarket Artemis Club in Berlin , said he had resisted pressure to cut prices , although senior citizens and taxi drivers already get a 50 per cent discount on Sundays and Mondays .
" Our philosophy is we provide an important service and even in a recession there are some things people wo n't do without , " said Mr Krumeich .
" Other downmarket places might cut prices but we decided we wo n't do that . "
Stephanie Klee , a prostitute in Berlin and former leader of the German association of sex workers , said that even if some luxury brothels were weathering the storm , many more were struggling .
" If the consumer electronics shop comes out with rebates and special promotions , why should n't we try the same thing ? " she said .
While she might have had five or six clients per day a year ago , she added , that had fallen to one or even none .
Some suggested that more women were turning to prostitution to make ends meet .
" More and more women are moonlighting on the weekends , " said Ms Ahrens .
" They 're not able to get by with their main jobs and are in pretty dire straits . "

Many of my friends and neighbors may have noticed that I have n’t been in town as much lately , and that I ’m spending more and more of my time in Kansas City .
So why would a hardened MIT denizen who used to think that distant travel meant going to Porter Square now be flying back and forth to Missouri every week ?
It ’s because the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation , which is headquartered in Kansas City , is pioneering new ways to advance our entrepreneurial economy .
Kauffman ’s president Carl Schramm inspired me the other day when he noted in a CNBC interview that all net job creation over the past thirty years has come from companies less than five years old .
So what can we do to keep startups flourishing ?
I am delighted to be joining the Kauffman Foundation team as a senior fellow as we look out over the economic future and embark on a new approach for increasing both the number of new companies formed and the chances of success for these ventures .
This new initiative is called Kauffman Laboratories for Enterprise Creation .
The mission of Kauffman Labs is to create more large - scale , high - growth firms .
As someone with a combination of practical experience building companies , and academic experience teaching innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT — not to mention a passion for helping people build great companies — I ’m very pleased to be a part of this initiative .
It ’s a perfect way to continue the work I started at MIT ’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation .
Bad times are when good people spring into action .
Today , more than ever , it ’s important to catalyze and accelerate the tremendous inventive spirit of the American entrepreneur .
As many have said before , we ’ve got what it takes to innovate our way out of the current crisis .
Many budding entrepreneurs today face an unfortunate choice between going to school , or going to the school of hard knocks .
In one circle , entrepreneurs can join MBA programs , fellowship programs , or business bootcamps .
In another circle , they can dive in and get their hands dirty by starting a company , trying to raise venture capital or angel funding , or moving into an incubator .
For the most part , these circles have not overlapped .
The idea behind Kauffman Labs is to create a new hybrid model .
In the 2009 Kauffman Thoughtbook , the Foundation ’s vice president of entrepreneurship , Bo Fishback , talks about the model of a conservatory , where students not only learn music theory but also play music .
This is emphatically not the model most business schools follow today , as the New York Times noted in a well - reported March 15 article .
B - schools are still trying to shake their legacy DNA of training the future CEOs of General Motors or the next generation of bankers and consultants .
No self - respecting entrepreneur would think that he or she can learn how to run a startup by getting an MBA .
Schools of Engineering are still struggling to understand their approach to teaching innovation , a discipline that runs contrary to traditional funding and tenure models .
Academic institutions , to be blunt about it , are the stodgy old incumbents in today ’s innovation economy — and I say this as a faculty member at a school that is a hotbed of entrepreneurship .
Do n’t get me wrong — there are plenty of wonderful things that will always happen at MIT and could only happen at MIT .
I am thrilled to continue my role at MIT in parallel with my Kauffman work .
But there are many things that cannot happen within the walls of MIT , nor should they .
I want to help make those boundaries easier to understand and navigate .
It ’s time for a disruptive new model , a hybrid between education and company creation .
Entities like Puretech Ventures , led by Daphne Zohar ( an Xconomist like myself ) , are perfect examples of what we at the Kauffman Foundation would like to see more of .
Puretech is not trying to be a classic life sciences venture capital firm , but is in the business of creating companies .
That may include sprinkling in a little money , but it ’s also about validating the science , identifying market needs , and building great leadership and advisory teams .
Xconomy has already written about a new Kauffman program that will place “ Entrepreneur Fellows ” at Puretech and other organizations , and Lesa Mitchell , Kauffman ’s vice president for advancing innovation , has spoken prolifically on this topic .
If you take the best of what entrepreneurs might get out of Puretech , the best they might get out of an MBA , and turbo - charge it by adding the best they might get out of accelerators and incubators like Y Combinator , TechStars , DreamIt Ventures , The Foundry , Bizdom U , or the Cambridge Innovation Center , that ’s where we ’re trying to go .
If you connect all of these things through a coordinated mother ship , you get a new level of scale , quality , institutional memory , patience , and also a certain silo - busting neutrality .
The Kauffman Foundation is in a unique position to make this happen .
There ’s a movement in the philanthropic world to touch the people you ’re trying to help directly , rather than giving money to others and hoping they will do it .
By creating a new entity to focus on high - growth companies , the Kauffman Foundation will be going directly to the customer , and doing it with its talented people and its quality control .
But we ’ll also be practicing what we preach ; we will be figuring out how to grow and create a high - scale model for fostering entrepreneurship as we go .
As my mentor Desh Deshpande likes to say , this is a contact sport .
Rather than developing a stagnant formal curriculum for an aspiring entrepreneur to be on the receiving end of , we want entrepreneurs to have a setting in which they can live the messy process and be able to draw on vital resources and kindred spirits .
This involves getting in there and living the process with the entrepreneurs .
It is real - time , iterative , and immerses us all in action - learning .
With the economy crippled , venture capitalists running from risk , and startup exit opportunities nonexistent ( at least for the foreseeable future ) , somebody needs to create a new world order for high - growth companies .
By weaving together many of the initiatives that the Kauffman Foundation already has underway — and building a few new ones from scratch — we will be following a natural progression .
In short , we will create the sorts of companies that Mr. Kauffman wanted his foundation to spawn .
And that ’s why I ’m developing an appreciation for Kansas City , and why my wife is the one out walking our dog these days .

Speaking of Sex Ed , Obama Proposes Closing Down Abstinence Education .
President Obama ’s 2010 Budget cuts “ Community - Based Abstinence Education ” among other abstinence - only methods .
Page 491 states :
“ This budget eliminates funding for Community - Based Abstinence Education , the mandatory Title V Abstinence Education program , the Compassion Capital Fund , and Rural Community Facilities . ”
Reuters reports that these programs will be replaced by programs to reduce teenage pregnancy .
The so - called “ abstinence only ” programs , backed by many social conservatives who oppose the teaching of contraception methods to teenagers in schools , have received about $ 1.3 billion in federal funds since the late 1990s .

Wednesday , April 29 , 2009 THEMIS space probes discovered that the Northern lights are seen when electrical tornadoes , rotating faster than a million miles an hour , hover about 40,000 miles ( 60,000 km ) above the earth .
The energy spins down to the Earth 's ionosphere where the tornadoes become unstable , and interact with the Earth 's magnetic field .
Professor Karl - Heinz Glassmeier , director of the Institute for Geophysics and Extraterrestrial Physics in Braunschweig Germany , explains , " When these space tornadoes reach the upper atmosphere their enormous energy heats the air so strongly it starts glowing .
That is what generates the aurorae . "

" It is here that all the energy is released , forming the aurorae .
What we see as beautiful lights and colors are actually the product of a violent electrical storm in space .
While these electrical discharges do not cause any direct harm to humans , they can damage man-made structures such as power transformers and communications systems , " said Andreas Keiling , a physicist at the University of California at Berkeley .

Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms ( THEMIS ) are five probes launched by NASA in February 2007 , which orbited Earth recording the volume and electrical current which was higher than 100,000 amperes .
Scientists had previously concluded that aurorae are caused by electrically charged particles discharged as solar winds from the sun which interact with the Earth 's magnetic field .
However , these solar discharges strike the Earth where the sun is shining and the aurorae occur in the opposite hemisphere and are visible in the night sky .
This anomaly was cleared up by THEMIS satellites which showed that the Earth 's magnetic field held the charged particles before deflecting them from the day side of the planet across to the opposite side of the planet where the particles massed into huge clouds .
There the accumulated charge expands continuously until finally the cloud becomes unstable releasing its energy as a geomagnetic tornado which travels down towards the earth along magnetic field lines becoming visible as aurorae in the sky .
The scientists presented their findings at the European Geosciences Union ( EGU ) in Vienna , Austria just this week .

They just can't seem to get their stories straight .
No matter how hard they try to justify torture , the facts do n't seem to support them :
WASHINGTON —
The CIA inspector general in 2004 found that there was no conclusive proof that waterboarding or other harsh interrogation techniques helped the Bush administration thwart any " specific imminent attacks , " according to recently declassified Justice Department memos .
That undercuts assertions by former vice president Dick Cheney and other former Bush administration officials that the use of harsh interrogation tactics including waterboarding , which is widely considered torture , was justified because it headed off terrorist attacks .
[...]
" It is difficult to quantify with confidence and precision the effectiveness of the program , " Steven G. Bradbury , then the Justice Department 's principal deputy assistant attorney general , wrote in a May 30 , 2005 , memo to CIA General Counsel John Rizzo , one of four released last week by the Obama administration .
" As the IG Report notes , it is difficult to determine conclusively whether interrogations provided information critical to interdicting specific imminent attacks .
And because the CIA has used enhanced techniques sparingly , ' there is limited data on which to assess their individual effectiveness ' , " Bradbury wrote , quoting the IG report .
Nevertheless , Bradbury concluded in his May 2005 memos that the program had been effective ; that conclusion relied largely on memos written after the still secret report by Inspector General John Helgerson .
Helgerson also concluded that waterboarding was riskier than officials claimed and reported that the CIA 's Office of Medical Services thought that the risk to the health of some prisoners outweighed any potential intelligence benefit , according to the memos .
The IG 's report is among several indications that the Bush administration 's use of abusive interrogation methods was less productive than some former administration officials have claimed .
Containment of the swine flu virus that has affected people across the world and believed to have killed 149 people in Mexico is no longer feasible , and global health officials should focus on protecting populations from its severest effects , the World Health Organisation said today .
With people taken ill from Scotland to New Zealand , the organisation raised its pandemic alert level to four , from three earlier today .
The highest level is six , indicating a global pandemic .
A WHO official said it had confirmed the virus was being passed from human to human but said it had not rapidly spread from infected individuals to their surrounding communities .
Nearly all the patients struck ill with the disease had recently travelled to Mexico , and no one outside that country has yet perished from the disease .
WHO assistant director general Dr Keiji Fukuda said the increase in alert level indicated " a significant step towards pandemic influenza , " but maintained " we are not there yet " .
" We have taken a step in that direction , but a pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time , " Fukuda said in Geneva .
" The situation is fluid and the situation continues to evolve - and we will monitor that . "
The organisation did not recommend border closures or travel restrictions , saying such measures would likely be ineffective in preventing spread of the virus but would cause significant hardship .
Fukuda said the organisation did not recommend shifting global vaccine - development capacity away from the typically milder seasonal flu to the swine flu , noting that the annual flu season is just ramping up in the southern hemisphere .
It would take four to six months to develop a swine flu vaccine .
Ahead of the WHO announcement this evening , the EU 's health commissioner today urged Europeans to postpone non-essential travel to Mexico and the US , and US officials cautioned against non-essential travel south of their border .
Meanwhile , as the death toll from the swine flu virus in Mexico rose to at least 149 and brought Mexico City , one of the world 's largest cities , to a standstill .
The first cases were confirmed in the UK this afternoon .
In Luxembourg , where EU foreign ministers were discussing the virus , Androulla Vassiliou told reporters people should avoid travelling to Mexico or the US " unless it is very urgent for them " .
" Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the centre of the cluster in order to minimise the personal risk and to reduce the potential risk to spread the infection to other people , " Vassiliou said .
Possible cases of swine flu were reported as far afield as Israel and New Zealand after a declaration at the weekend by the WHO of an international public health emergency was followed by a call for worldwide surveillance of the spread of the virus .
The Scottish health minister , Nicola Sturgeon , tonight confirmed the first British cases of swine flu .
Two people in Airdrie , who had recently returned from Mexico , have contracted the virus and seven others who had been in contact with them are showing mild symptoms , said Sturgeon .
A Canadian woman visiting Sale in Greater Manchester is in hospital undergoing tests for possible swine flu , it emerged this afternoon , as Britain 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , warned that the country would inevitably be hit by cases at some point .
It was not known if the woman had been to Mexico recently .
" We are aware that an overseas visitor to the Sale area is being tested for possible swine flu , " NHS North West said in a statement .
" The person concerned has been taken to hospital for further tests , in keeping with recommendations , and purely as a precaution . "
Spain 's health ministry today said a young man from Almansa in the Castilla - La Mancha region who had recently been in Mexico had been confirmed as having swine flu , and 17 other people were under investigation .
The health minister , Trinidad Jimenez , said the man was responding well to treatment and was not in a serious condition .
In Washington , President Barack Obama said today the swine flu cases were cause for concern , not alarm .
The US has launched border screening for swine flu exposure , with officials to ask people about " fever and illness " .
Financial turmoil
Fears of a potential pandemic have spooked financial markets worldwide , with airline and tourism stocks plunging today , the dollar dropping to its lowest level against the yuan , and the Mexican peso losing about 3 % in electronic trading last night .
Oil prices also fell .
In London the FTSE 100 index lost more than 60 points in early trading , falling about 1.5 % to 4095.06 .
But shares soared in drug companies , including GlaxoSmithKline , and medical glovemakers .
Shares of Top Glove , the world 's largest listed rubber latex glovemaker , jumped more than 8 % to 5.95 ringgit on the Malaysian stock exchange .
Mexico
Mexican health secretary José Ángel Córdova said 149 people are believed dead from swine flu in that country .
He said that health officials are investigating 1,995 people who presented at Mexican hospitals with suspected swine flu .
Mexican health and education officials closed the nation 's schools until 6
May in order to stave off further infections while they formulate preventative measures .
The government is warning citizens not to shake hands or to stand close to each other .
Many people stayed at home , or only ventured out wearing masks .
Some stored water and food .
Others left the city altogether .
" [ We are ] monitoring , minute by minute , the evolution of this problem across the whole country , " said the Mexican president , Felipe Calderón .
The World Bank yesterday approved $ 205 m ( £ 141 bn ) in loans to the country to fight the outbreak .
United States
US health officials have confirmed at least 40 cases in five US states .
None of the US cases has been fatal , but Centres for Disease Control and Prevention acting director Richard Besser said Americans should not believe they have been spared .
" I would n't rest on the fact that we have only seen cases in this country that are less severe , " Besser said .
He said many factors could explain the discrepancy , and said that as health officials monitoring the US discover more cases , the range of severity is likely to " broaden " .
But he added that the additional cases tallied today , all at a school in New York City whose students had recently visited Mexico , were the result of wider testing and not the spread of the virus .
The US last night declared its own national health emergency .
However , White House officials urged people not to panic and pointed out that no case outside Mexico had proved fatal .
The US homeland security secretary , Janet Napolitano , ordered the immediate release of 12 m doses of antiviral treatments , such as Tamiflu , collected over five years in response to fears about the spread of avian flu .
The US has begun work on a vaccine , but that is unlikely to be available for months and CDC officials say schools may be closed and large gatherings banned in the worst affected areas .
British action
In Scotland , the health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said two people in Lanarkshire had been admitted to hospital on their return from Mexico ; however , their flu - like symptoms were mild and the couple 's condition was causing little concern , she said .
Test results due today should reveal whether they have contracted swine flu .
Another man , Chris Clarke , from Stanwick , Northamptonshire , fell ill on a British Airways flight from Mexico City to Heathrow and was told to stay indoors , but tests came back negative .
Britons arriving back at Gatwick from Cancún said a doctor on board had questioned them about possible flu symptoms before they left the aircraft today .
New Simulation Shows Consequences of a World Without Earth 's Natural Sunscreen
Michael Carlowicz
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
The year is 2065 .
Nearly two - thirds of Earth 's ozone is gone -- not just over the poles , but everywhere .
The infamous ozone hole over Antarctica , first discovered in the 1980s , is a year - round fixture , with a twin over the North Pole .
The ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation falling on mid-latitude cities like Washington , D.C. , is strong enough to cause sunburn in just five minutes .
DNA - mutating UV radiation is up 650 percent , with likely harmful effects on plants , animals and human skin cancer rates .
Such is the world we would have inherited if 193 nations had not agreed to ban ozone - depleting substances , according to atmospheric chemists at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency , Bilthoven .
Led by Goddard scientist Paul Newman , the team simulated " what might have been " if chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and similar chemicals were not banned through the treaty known as the Montreal Protocol .
The simulation used a comprehensive model that included atmospheric chemical effects , wind changes , and radiation changes .
The analysis has been published online in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics .
" Ozone science and monitoring has improved over the past two decades , and we have moved to a phase where we need to be accountable , " said Newman , who is co-chair of the United Nations Environment Programme 's Scientific Assessment Panel to review the state of the ozone layer and the environmental impact of ozone regulation .
" We are at the point where we have to ask :
Were we right about ozone ?
Did the Montreal Protocol work ?
What kind of world was avoided by phasing out ozone - depleting substances ?
" Ozone is Earth 's natural sunscreen , absorbing and blocking most of the incoming UV radiation from the sun and protecting life from DNA - damaging radiation .
The gas is naturally created and replenished by a photochemical reaction in the upper atmosphere where UV rays break oxygen molecules ( O2 ) into individual atoms that then recombine into three - part molecules ( O3 ) .
As it is moved around the globe by upper level winds , ozone is slowly depleted by naturally occurring atmospheric gases .
It is a system in natural balance .
But chlorofluorocarbons -- invented in 1928 as refrigerants and as inert carriers for chemical sprays -- upset that balance .
Researchers discovered in the 1970s and 1980s that while CFCs are inert at Earth 's surface , they are quite reactive in the stratosphere ( 10 to 50 kilometers altitude , or 6 to 31 miles ) , where roughly 90 percent of the planet 's ozone accumulates .
UV radiation causes CFCs and similar bromine compounds in the stratosphere to break up into elemental chlorine and bromine that readily destroy ozone molecules .
Worst of all , such ozone depleting substances can reside for several decades in the stratosphere before breaking down .
In the 1980s , ozone - depleting substances opened a wintertime " hole " over Antarctica and opened the eyes of the world to the effects of human activity on the atmosphere .
By 1987 , the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Program had brought together scientists , diplomats , environmental advocates , governments , industry representatives , and non-governmental organizations to forge an agreement to phase out the chemicals .
In January 1989 , the Montreal Protocol went into force , the first - ever international agreement on regulation of chemical pollutants .
“ The regulation of ozone depleting substances was based upon the evidence gathered by the science community and the consent of industry and government leaders , " Newman noted .
" The regulation pre-supposed that a lack of action would lead to severe ozone depletion , with consequent severe increases of solar UV radiation levels at the Earth ’s surface .
"
In the new analysis , Newman and colleagues " set out to predict ozone losses as if nothing had been done to stop them . "
Their " world avoided " simulation took months of computer time to process .
The team started with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry - Climate Model ( GEOS - CCM ) , an earth system model of atmospheric circulation that accounts for variations in solar energy , atmospheric chemical reactions , temperature variations and winds , and other elements of global climate change .
For instance , the new model accounts for how changes in the stratosphere influence changes in the troposphere ( the air masses near Earth 's surface ) .
Ozone losses change the temperature in different parts of the atmosphere , and those changes promote or suppress chemical reactions .
The researchers then increased the emission of CFCs and similar compounds by 3 percent per year , a rate about half the growth rate for the early 1970s .
Then they let the simulated world evolve from 1975 to 2065 .
By the simulated year 2020 , 17 percent of all ozone is depleted globally , as assessed by a drop in Dobson Units ( DU ) , the unit of measurement used to quantify a given concentration of ozone .
An ozone hole starts to form each year over the Arctic , which was once a place of prodigious ozone levels .
By 2040 , global ozone concentrations fall below 220 DU , the same levels that currently comprise the " hole " over Antarctica .
( In 1974 , globally averaged ozone was 315 DU . )
The UV index in mid-latitude cities reaches 15 around noon on a clear summer day ( a UV index of 10 is considered extreme today . ) , giving a perceptible sunburn in about 10 minutes .
Over Antarctica , the ozone hole becomes a year - round fixture .
In the 2050s , something strange happens in the modeled world : Ozone levels in the stratosphere over the tropics collapse to near zero in a process similar to the one that creates the Antarctic ozone hole .
By the end of the model run in 2065 , global ozone drops to 110 DU , a 67 percent drop from the 1970s .
Year - round polar values hover between 50 and 100 DU ( down from 300 - 500 in 1960 ) .
The intensity of UV radiation at Earth 's surface doubles ; at certain shorter wavelengths , intensity rises by as much as 10,000 times .
Skin cancer - causing radiation soars .
" Our world avoided calculation goes a little beyond what I thought would happen , " said Goddard scientist and study co-author Richard Stolarski , who was among the pioneers of atmospheric ozone chemistry in the 1970s .
" The quantities may not be absolutely correct , but the basic results clearly indicate what could have happened to the atmosphere .
And models sometimes show you something you were n't expecting , like the precipitous drop in the tropics . "
" We simulated a world avoided , " said Newman , " and it 's a world we should be glad we avoided .
"
The real world of CFC regulation has been somewhat kinder .
Production of ozone - depleting substances was mostly halted about 15 years ago , though their abundance is only beginning to decline because the chemicals can reside in the atmosphere for 50 to 100 years .
The peak abundance of CFCs in the atmosphere occurred around 2000 , and has decreased by roughly 4 percent to date .
Stratospheric ozone has been depleted by 5 to 6 percent at middle latitudes , but has somewhat rebounded in recent years .
The largest recorded Antarctic ozone hole was recorded in 2006 .
" I did n't think that the Montreal Protocol would work as well as it has , but I was pretty naive about the politics , " Stolarski added .
" The Montreal Protocol is a remarkable international agreement that should be studied by those involved with global warming and the attempts to reach international agreement on that topic . "

WASHINGTON , May 26 ( UPI ) -- A Democratic congressional member has re-introduced legislation that would reverse a ban on Internet gambling enacted when Republicans led the U.S. Congress .
The measure Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , introduced earlier in May would allow the U.S. Treasury department to license and regulate online gambling companies used by customers in the United States , The New York Times reported Tuesday .
Currently , financial institutions are banned from handling transactions from Internet gambling sites .

Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said the federal government could collect increased tax revenues if Internet gambling was regulated .
He also characterized online gambling as an activity activity the government should neither encourage nor prohibit , because it was a matter of personal liberty .
The legislation Frank introduced in 2007 never advanced from committee .
Frank said he thought lobbying by poker players and other fans of online gambling could help roll back the ban .
He said he intends to move the bill through his committee before Congress breaks in August .
Opponents , including social conservatives , and professional and amateur sports organizations , said more gambling opportunities pose a threat to the integrity of their competition , the Times said .
Over the years , I ’ve met lots of GMs who ’ve created and lovingly detailed their own campaign settings , most often for D&D .
These settings are usually extensively developed , complete with maps , country write - ups , elaborate histories — the whole nine yards .
But as much as enjoy writing setting material , I ’ve never actually done this myself .
I ’ve dabbled — drawn detailed maps for fantasy worlds , written chunks of material for specific cities , etc .
But I ’ve never had what I consider to be one of the quintessential GMing experiences : creating a rich homebrewed campaign setting of my own , and elaborating on it — running games in it , writing new material for it — in little bits over many years .
Maybe that comes down partly to personality — something in my wiring that keeps me jumping from game to game , and expanding on published setting material more often than I write my own from scratch .
But I do n’t think so — I think it ’s because it ’s always sounded like fun , but also seemed like a good way to do a lot of prep work on stuff that might never see any use at the gaming table .
I ’m a big believer that with limited time available for game prep , you should focus your limited time on prepping game material that ’s very likely to get used .
( See Start Small for more on this philosophy . )
And an idea hit me the other day that grew into the topic of this article :
Why not create setting material with a modular approach ?
The product of this approach is a modular campaign setting — a system - agnostic , genre - specific game world created in discrete , reusable pieces .
Modular Campaign Settings
Let ’s break down the three components of a modular campaign setting :
System -agnostic .
By divorcing your homebrewed setting from any game mechanics , you save yourself work upfront and avoid creating additional work for yourself down the road .
You can mention mechanical elements in terms of generalities ( “ This dude is a badass fighter ” ) , and then flesh out the specifics depending on the game system you happen to be running at the time .

Genre -specific .
Very few settings are genre - agnostic .
Although concepts can often be easily ported from genre to genre , generally the strongest settings are designed for a specific genre .
And while the traditional homebrewed setting is fantasy , there ’s no reason yours has to be ; any genre is an option , but you need to have one in mind .

Discrete , reusable pieces .
Most homebrewed settings I ’ve had contact with seem to have been created hodge - podge — whatever their creators were most interested in creating at the time is what got done .
There ’s nothing wrong with that approach , but with just a few small tweaks you can retain the benefits of following your sparks of inspiration without the downsides of haphazard setting creation .
Sound good ?
Then let ’s kick the tires and see how this might actually work in practice .
Creating a Modular Campaign Setting
To create a modular campaign setting , you pick a genre , leave out everything mechanical , and focus on creating it piece - by - piece .
You start with whatever grabs you — let ’s say for a fantasy setting , that happens to be a major city that ’s located partially underwater .
You develop as much of that city as you can ( taking notes on other aspects of your budding setting as inspiration strikes , but not straying from your core task — developing the city ) , from maps to NPCs to neighborhoods and cultural traits .
The goal is to create a city that can stand more or less on its own , but that has some ties to the larger setting , as well .
After giving this city a fairly comprehensive treatment , you move on to whatever part of the setting grabs you next — but you have the city in your back pocket now , ready to use at any time , for any game system you like .
And whatever portion of your world you develop next is approached in the same way , with the same goal : creating a discrete chunk of setting material that you can connect to other elements of the setting , but that can also be dropped into another setting , easily reused in another game , or moved around as needed .
Then when you sit down to run a game in that setting — whether it ’s weeks , months , or years after you started developing it — you just pull together several pieces of setting material that you ’ve created , add in game mechanics where required , and start the game .
As your campaign progresses , you can pull in additional material — juggling it in whatever way best suits the game at hand .
If your players throw you a curveball and bypass that underwater city you created , no worries :
Because you designed it to be modular , you can use it again in another game — that prep time was n’t wasted .
You can also plop that city anywhere you like with relatively little lead time , putting it in whatever coastal location makes the most sense as your campaign unfolds .
If you return to this world in your spare time , creating more modular components over the years , you ’ll wind up with an enormous amount of highly usable setting material .
And that material can be mixed and matched , dropped into other settings , and even developed into a published campaign setting of your own .
By combining different elements of your modular campaign setting , you can create the world you need for the specific campaign you ’re planning .
You ’ll need to fill in the corners , change a few things , and flesh some stuff about — but if you do that in a similarly modular way , you ’ll have more reusable pieces available for future games .
I ’ve seen published material that draws on aspects of the modular campaign setting concept : Goodman Games ’ Points of Light series details modular fantasy setting elements , and White Wolf ’s Mysterious Places is full of drop - in locations , as is HERO Games ’ Thrilling Places , while WotC ’s Mysteries of the Moonsea tackles the Moonsea region through modular adventures .
But I ’ve never seen an entire setting built using this modular approach — although I ’d love to .
Have you used a modular approach like this one when creating your own campaign settings ?
Do you have a setting bible for a world you ’ve been building since you were a little kid ?
Do you hate the idea of systematizing the creative process of setting creation in this way ?
I guess if one is a well - paid member of Congress with full benefits and a good retirement package — and a staff that caters to your every whim , it ’s hard to grasp that people back home are suffering .
But , the Republicans are very proud of voting against the economic recovery package .
They ’ve made Rush Limbaugh happy .
And , the DC media elite think this was a victory .
So , the question that should be asked of every member who voted against the package is :
Why did you vote against more jobs for your state ?
Why ?
The Obama administration prepared a breakdown of the impacts by state at Recovery.gov .
I posted the breakdown below ( click on each photo for larger image . )
It ’s kind of hard to argue against job creation these days — unless one is a Rush Limbaugh Republican .

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS , improvised explosive devices , the tactic of choice for Iraqi insurgents , have spread to the Afghan roadside in a big way :
At last count , IEDs accounted for more than 70 percent of US combat casualties in Iraq and half of those in Afghanistan .
Since 2003 , according to Pentagon documents , the Army ’s Joint IED Defeat Organization ( JIEDDO ) and its predecessors have spent $ 14 billion trying to do what JIEDDO ’s name implies , including $ 2.3 billion for high - tech countermeasures “ to thwart simple , cheap triggering devices such as two - way radios or garage door openers . ”
In Afghanistan , the pricey gear has helped coalition troops find and clear nearly three times as many bombs in 2008 as in 2006 .
But the insurgents have kept pace : Casualties from IEDs have increased by nearly the same margin .
As for whether the money might not be better spent on , say , humanitarian and development efforts , the IED chasers note that US forces will now likely face this guerrilla tactic wherever they go .
“ IEDs are a weapon , ” notes JIEDDO ’s 2008 report to Congress .
“ They are not the enemy . ”

IEDS IN AFGHANISTAN
Their savings in shambles from the economic downturn , jobless seniors are dusting off their briefcases and trying to head back to work .
Many , like Jim Mitchell , a 63 - year - old former sales executive , are finding a merciless job market where decades of experience are n’t necessarily an asset .
The Long Beach resident rises daily before dawn and dresses neatly in business attire to keep himself motivated .
He pops in brilliant blue contacts to brighten his eyes and combs back his graying hair to look more youthful .
Not that it matters .
He ’s not getting much face time .
Many recruiters these days want only e-mail applications and refuse to take phone calls .
Mitchell is at sea when it comes to using online sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook for networking .
He leaves his college graduation date off his resume .
But in two years of full - time job hunting , he has n’t gotten a single callback .

“ I do n’t want to think it ’s about age , but sometimes you suspect it is , ” he said .
“ But 60 is supposed to be the new 40 .
I just want a fair hearing . ”
The recession has not been kind to older workers .
With their 401 ( k ) s battered , home values deflated and healthcare costs rising , many have resigned themselves to staying on the job indefinitely .
The trend was well underway before the downturn as many continued working to pad their savings or to stay active .
Now it ’s about necessity .
Over the last two years , the number of Americans age 55 and older who are still working has climbed by nearly 1.5 million to just over 26 million in March , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Those are the lucky ones .

The number of people 55 and older who want a job but ca n’t find one has more than doubled over the same period to nearly 1.8 million .
Many are struggling in a largely digital job search process that ’s vastly different from what they have experienced before .
Millions entered the workforce straight from high school or college , earning steady promotions and salary increases .
Some , like Mitchell , had n’t updated their resumes in years .
There was no need .
But with unemployment the highest it has been in more than a quarter of a century -- 8.5 % nationally in March and 10.5 % in California in February -- older job seekers are competing with younger , cheaper rivals .
“ You better know that the kids are chasing your job , that they want your $ 95,000 salary , ” said Tom Fallon , 62 , of Seal Beach .
He has been searching for a sales position in material handling for three months .

America ’s youngest workers are n’t faring well either .
In March , the unemployment rate for U.S. workers ages 16 to 24 hit 16.3 % .
But these youths are n’t saddled with mortgages and dependents to the same degree as their elders , nor do they have the same medical and retirement concerns .
And though joblessness among older workers is lower than that of the overall labor force , it is growing much faster .
In March , 6.2 % of workers 55 and older were unemployed , up from 3.4 % in March 2008 .
For mature workers who spent years building up stellar credentials and largely defined themselves by their careers , the ego - crushing inactivity of unemployment can be unbearable , said Steven J. Greenberg , founder of Jobs 4.0 , a listings site for job seekers over age 40 .
“ For many , it ’s a brutal experience -- like going through a divorce , ” he said .

Up until two years ago , Mitchell had worked steadily since joining General Motors Corp. in 1968 as a production foreman straight out of college .
He eventually gravitated to sales and marketing , where he figures he has sold more than $ 150 million worth of consumer products over the years , including toothpaste and trash bags .
In 2006 when his brother took ill , Mitchell took a leave from his job as a national sales manager at a brokerage representing pharmaceutical and healthcare products suppliers to run the family grocery business in Connecticut .
When he returned to Southern California the next year , he said , he found himself squeezed out of the full - time job that had paid more than $ 100,000 annually .
He ’s been looking ever since .
The daily hunt begins around 7 a.m. in his tidy home office , where Mitchell scans online job leads .
He admits he is n’t a whiz with computers .
Secretaries at his previous posts handled that .
Many positions now require Excel and PowerPoint fluency , skills he ’s trying to master with help from friends .

“ It ’s not that I did n’t want to learn -- I just never needed it , ” he said .
Robust and gregarious , he projects the earnest enthusiasm of a born salesman .
But gone are the days of cornering an executive in an elevator and pitching yourself in person .
Over the last two years , Mitchell has blown through $ 80,000 in retirement savings to cover his mortgage and living expenses .
He has retreated from his large social network , save for the occasional Friday - morning coffee with friends .
The sunny mask is starting to slip .
“ The hardest time is at night , when the TV goes off and the lights go down and it ’s quiet and there ’s nothing else in my head , ” he said .
“ I have to think positively then , because otherwise the agony will come out in phone conversations . ”

Older employees are often wrongly perceived as being overqualified , overpriced , technologically challenged and inflexible , said Gene Burnard , publisher of the job - listing website Workforce50.com .
Some recruiters assume that because older applicants are vying for jobs that pay less than their previous positions , they ’ll jump ship as soon as the economy improves .
“ In this market , it ’s twice as hard for older job seekers , because however desirable they were at 27 , they just are n’t as much at 54 , ” said Greenberg of Jobs 4.0 .
“ Recruiters do n’t give much of an opportunity to go into your life story .
They give your resume two seconds . ”
Jeanne Feder has felt the sting despite a “ resume that could choke a horse . ”
At 59 , she worries that she ’s past an unspoken cutoff age .

Tips for job seekers over 50
UPDATE AND REJUVENATE

Spruce up your resume by keeping it short and emphasizing skills and achievements instead of the length of your experience .
Be aware of your health and appearance .
Recruiters can sense depression and illness .
And a look that is too stylish or too dowdy can ruin a first impression .
YOUR AGE IS NOT THE FOCUS
Do n’t distract yourself with suspicions of age discrimination -- just keep a positive , confident attitude .
Advertisement
Keep your college graduation dates off your resume , and avoid discussing activities that might date you .
If you seem overqualified , recruiters might make assumptions about how much you want to be paid .
If a company wants 15 years of experience , trim descriptions of your 40 - year career .
BUT USE YOUR AGE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
Stress your loyalty and dedication to a company .
Recruiters will contrast that against younger workers ’ tendency to hop between jobs and prioritize personal time over work engagements .

When legal therapies let them down , some teens turn to cannabis .
A new study , published in BioMed Central 's open access journal Substance Abuse , Treatment , Prevention and Policy suggests that around a third of teens who smoke cannabis on a regular basis use it as a medication , rather than as a means of getting high .
Joan Bottorff worked with a team of researchers from the University of British Columbia , funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , to conduct in - depth interviews with 63 cannabis - using adolescents .
Of these , 20 claimed that they used cannabis to relieve or manage health problems .
Bottorff said , " Marijuana is perceived by some teens to be the only available alternative for those experiencing difficult health problems when legitimate medical treatments have failed or when they lack access to appropriate health care " .
The most common complaints recorded were emotional problems ( including depression , anxiety and stress ) , sleep difficulties , problems with concentration and physical pain .
The teens ' experiences with the medical system were uniformly negative .
The authors said , " Youth who reported they had been prescribed drugs such as Ritalin , Prozac or sleeping pills , stopped using them because they did not like how these drugs made them feel or found them ineffective .
For these kids , the purpose of smoking marijuana was not specifically about getting high or stoned " .
The authors emphasize that the unmet medical needs of these teens are of key importance in these findings .
In contrast to the unpleasant side effects of prescribed medications and long , ineffective legal therapies , cannabis provided these adolescents with immediate relief for a variety of health concerns .
Of course , cannabis is n't completely harmless , but as one of the respondents noted , " It 's not good for you , but then again , neither is McDonald 's and a lot of other things " .

Jerry Moyes arrives at U.S. bankruptcy court for a hearing in Phoenix on Tuesday .
Moyes has agreed that he was the owner of the Phoenix Coyotes when taking the team into bankruptcy and when acceding to a sale to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie .
(( Ross D. Franklin / Associated Press ) )
An Arizona bankruptcy judge had some harsh words for the National Hockey League and representatives for Phoenix Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes as he ordered the two sides into mediation in an attempt to untangle the team 's ownership situation and potential sale .
Judge Redfield T. Baum questioned why the dispute had reached his court without any apparent attempts to settle the matter before that stage , and he ordered a report on the progress of mediation by May 27 .
Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes put the team into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 5 and declared his intent to sell it for $ 212.5 million US to PSE Sports and Entertainment , led by Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie .

Mediating Coyotes mess
A mediator will attempt to help facilitate an agreement between the NHL and Phoenix Coyotes majority owner Jerry Moyes regarding control of the hockey team .
During a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday , U.S. Judge Redfield T. Baum ordered both parties into mediation in the hope of resolving the ownership and sale issues .
Baum wants a progress report by May 27 .
The mediator " is a neutral person whose job , if he can do it , is to get the people to settle on a mutual agreement , " Rob Becker , a New York attorney specializing in sports law , told CBCSports.ca .
" He 'll try and get the two sides to meet on common ground and come up with creative compromises . "
Unlike an arbitrator , the mediator can't make a ruling on the case .
" In arbitration , a decision is made by a neutral person , whether it's the arbitrator or the judge , " Becker said .
" He 's going to listen to the arguments from both sides , and then he 's going to make a ruling .
That 's not the case here . "
If the parties can come to an agreement , then a written deal would settle the issue .
If the mediator can't get the parties to settle , then Baum will rule on which side has control of the Coyotes , a decision Becker expects would take no longer than a day or two after the May 27 deadline .
Baum can also agree to an extension at the mediator 's request .
" Let 's say the mediator feels he 's making a lot of progress and feels ' I 've got them very close but can't get it done by [ May 27 ] , ' " Becker said .
" What I would assume would happen is the mediator would go to the judge and ask for [ an extension ] .
I would say that the judge would certainly say yes , because the mediator is neutral . "
Balsillie plans to relocate the club to Hamilton if successful .
The co-CEO of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd. , who was not present at the hearing , issued a statement Tuesday night after the proceedings wrapped up .
" I appreciate the court 's careful consideration of the facts at hand and I respect Judge Baum 's decision to recommend mediation for the Coyotes and NHL on the issue of current ownership , " Balsillie said .
" I will also be filing formal applications to the NHL both for transfer of ownership and for relocation to Southern Ontario to my chosen Hamilton Copps Coliseum venue , " he added .
Baum deemed the relocation aspect of the sale the " hot button " issue .
The judge said he will allow further briefs on the sale and relocation of the team by June 12 , hearing oral arguments 10 days later .
The extended timeline seemingly makes it more difficult for the club to be moved from Arizona before next season .
" It 's our position that we can't schedule a team outside of Glendale for next year , " NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said after the hearing , adding that the league was prepared to abide by whatever the court ruled .
Daly said last week that if the league prevailed , it could keep the Coyotes in bankruptcy court to find a buyer — and that still may be where the impasse is headed .
" What we did resolve today is that , subject to how we decide to determine the control issue going forward , that we 're committed to going through a sale auction that 's overseen by the court , so we 're prepared to do that , " he said .
The NHL submitted in court that it wanted to ability to vet those who bid for the team .
Thom Salerno , an attorney for Moyes , expressed great skepticism in session whether mediation would work , a skepticism that was not warmly received by the judge .
The four - hour hearing was jammed with a contingent of mostly Canadian media , requiring a second room to house reporters .
Wildly varying accounts
The NHL claims the agreement Moyes reached with Balsillie is an end - around to circumvent the league 's rules involving relocation , and Baum asked aloud why the pair did n't take their proposed deal to the league .
Baum early on in the hearing guaranteed the saga would continue on for at least several more days when he said he needed more time to sift through documents submitted to the court , which number in the hundreds .
" To save the suspense , I 'm not going to rule from the bench today , " he said .
Since a brief hearing two weeks ago , wildly varying accounts of what has transpired in recent months with the NHL team were submitted to the court .
The NHL has contended that it took over the club through proxy documents it signed with Moyes last November , and that any ownership change must be approved through its board of governors .
" The NHL did not manage , control , run or direct Coyotes hockey , the Coyotes hockey team or any of their related operations , nor to my knowledge did it attempt to do so , " Moyes countered in a filing .
Baum disagreed strongly with NHL attorney Tony Clark 's assessment that the proxy documents clearly demonstrated league control .
Balsillie was represented by lawyer Susan Freeman .
The judge agreed with Freeman that the league was wearing " many hats " in the dispute .
Moyes has characterized himself as a reluctant owner who began his involvement in the team with a small loan to previous owner Steve Elkman , before ultimately pouring more than $ 300 million US of his money into the franchise .
He says he 's hoping to recoup approximately $ 100 million through the sale to Balsillie , and he has said it was the only serious offer that would satisfy the team 's many creditors .
But Baum seemed to take some of the shine off the Balsillie bid by stressing that it would n't satisfy all creditors .
Earl Scudder , a lawyer for Moyes , said the Coyotes lost a combined $ 74 million in 2007 and 2008 .
Balsillie offered a sop to the league in a recent filing , saying he'd be amenable to keeping the club in Phoenix another season , although it came with the proviso that the league cover all operating costs .
The Coyotes have n't made the playoffs since 2002 , and some hockey observers have argued that the club 's continued history of losing has prevented obtaining an accurate gauge of the prospects in the local market for the Coyotes .
Jeff Shumway , CEO of the team for nearly three years , until January , has said the hockey team was not a financially viable entity in the Phoenix area .
The Phoenix Coyotes have struggled on and off the ice over the past seven years .
( ( Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press ) )
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman , who was not present on Tuesday , has admitted that the lease at Jobing.com Arena in nearby Glendale is prohibitive , and has tried to get millions in concessions from the city .
The league had said it was taken surprise by the Moyes - Balsillie agreement and that it was in the process of arranging a prospective sale of the team , to a group headed by Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf .
The White Sox owner built the baseball team 's spring training facility not far from Glendale .
Baum shot down attempts by the Moyes side on Tuesday to make public the details of Reinsdorf 's or any other prospective ownership bids .
Balsillie has called southern Ontario an unserved hockey market in media interviews and has tried to stir up the nation 's passion for hockey through a website , MakeitSeven.ca .
Bettman — portrayed by some hockey fans as anti-Canadian — was alleged in a filing to have said to Moyes 's lawyer in early April that if the league headed north of the border again , it would be to Winnipeg , the original home of the franchise under the name the Jets .
It was not clear if that alleged statement was sincere or a reflection of his disinterest in a Hamilton location .
Bettman has repeatedly said the issue of whether another team could succeed in southern Ontario was unrelated to the matter of the Coyotes .
It is Balsillie 's third swing at owning an NHL club .
He previously attempted to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins and Nashville Predators , but negotiations broke down .
The NBA , NFL and Major League Baseball filed statements on Monday saying a ruling in favour of Moyes could undermine stability in North America 's pro sports leagues .
As I step off the train at Heysel , in the shadow of the notorious football stadium , the vast art deco structure of the Palais du Centenaire rises like a cathedral .
With its four soaring buttresses topped by statues , the Palais forms the centrepiece of the Parc des Expositions in Brussels - a trade - fair complex built in the 1930s to commemorate a century of independence from the Netherlands .
This is the temporary home of thousands of fish products from around the world as 23,000 delegates descend from 80 countries for the annual European Seafood Exposition - the world 's largest seafood trade show and a grim reminder of man 's dominion over the oceans .
" If I wanted people to understand the global fishing crisis , I would bring them here , " says Sally Bailey , a marine programme officer with the World Wide Fund for Nature , one of the more moderate NGOs combating the exploitation of the seas .
Last year , one of the more militant groups - Greenpeace - managed to " close down " five exhibitors trading in critically endangered bluefin tuna , by deploying 80 activists to drape their stands in fishing nets , chain themselves to fixtures and put up banners that read : " Time and tuna are running out " .
Their main target was the Mitsubishi Corporation , the Japanese car manufacturer that is also the world 's largest tuna trader , controlling 60 % of the market and accounting for 40 % of all bluefin tuna imported into Japan from the Mediterranean .
The other companies were Dongwon Industries ( Korea ) , Moon Marine ( Taiwan / Singapore ) , Azzopardi Fisheries ( Malta ) and Ricardo Fuentes & Sons ( Spain ) .
The day I am there , Greenpeace activists are stalking EU fisheries ministers and waiting for a chance to unfurl their banners - but the security guards thwart them .
However , the gargantuan catch on display speaks for itself .
At the stand run by the Sea Wealth Frozen Food Company of Thailand , the shelves are groaning with jauntily designed packets of frozen squid , surimi ( minced fish ) dumplings , spring rolls , samosas and deep - fried cones with shrimp tails poking out of them .
In the next aisle , a frenetic chef is wok - frying prawns from Madagascar , dipping them in little square dishes of cumin , coriander , chilli powder , salt , cinnamon and garlic .
At the Taiwan Pavilion , the cabinets are full of chilled and frozen tilapia , barramundi , sushi , eel and vacuum packs of tobiko - orange flying - fish roe , salty , crunchy as granola and served by a young woman in national dress who literally has not heard of sustainability .
" All the boats are out there catching fish with roe , " she tells me .
" With so many after the same species , this is a very difficult business for us . "
These halls take several hours to negotiate , and the stands seemingly go on forever - 1,650 businesses in all , together peddling most of the 147m tonnes of seafood produced globally every year .
Of this , 100 m tonnes is caught in the wild while the rest is farmed to satisfy an insatiable demand .
Already , 1.2bn people depend on fish in their diet - and in Europe we each consume 20kg per year on average , compared to 5 kg per person in India .
However , as the emergent middle classes in Asia develop a taste , and a budget , for seafood - considered a luxury item until now - demand will rocket further .
What the organisers must know , but are keeping mum about , is that the oceans are in a parlous state .
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 70 % of the world 's fisheries are now fully exploited ( ie , fished to the point where they can only just replenish themselves ) , overexploited or depleted .
The majority of fish populations have been reduced by 70 - 95 % , depending on the species , compared to the level they would be at if there were no fishing at all .
In other words , only five per cent of fish are left in some cases .
In more practical terms , fishermen are catching one or two fish per 100 hooks , compared to 10 fish per 100 hooks where a stock is healthy and unexploited - a measure of sustainability once used by the Japanese fleet .
In England and Wales , we are landing one fish for every 20 that we landed in 1889 , when government records began , despite having larger vessels , more sophisticated technology and trawl nets so vast and all - consuming that they are capable of containing 12 Boeing 747 aircraft .
Where have all those other fish gone ?
In short , we have eaten them .
" Tens of thousands of bluefin tuna used to be caught in the North Sea every year , " says Callum Roberts , professor of marine conservation at the University of York .
" Now , there are none .
Once , there were millions of skate - huge common skate , white skate , long - nosed skate - being landed from seas around the UK .
The common skate is virtually extinct , the angel shark has gone .
We have lost our marine megafauna as a consequence of exploitation . "
Then there are the devastating effects of bottom trawling around our coasts , which began with the advent of the steam trawler 130 years ago .
" Sweeping backwards and forwards across the seabed , they removed a whole carpet of invertebrates , " Professor Roberts says , " such as corals , sponges , sea fans and seaweeds .
On one map , dating from 1883 , there is a huge area of the North Sea roughly the size of Wales , marked ' Oyster beds ' .
The last oysters were fished there commercially in the 1930s ; the last live oyster was taken in the 1970s .
We have altered the marine environment in a spectacular way . "
Worse still , after stripping our own seas bare , we have " exported fishing capacity to the waters of developing countries " , Professor Roberts warns .
Off Mauritania , Senegal and other West African countries , fleets from the rich industrial north are " fishing in a totally unsustainable way with minimal oversight by European countries " .
In return for plundering the oceans , which deprives local people of food , and artisanal fishermen of their livelihood , these vessels pay minimal fees that impoverished countries are happy to accept .
" It is a mining operation , " Professor Roberts says , " a rerun of the exploitation of terrestrial wealth that happened in colonial days .
This is colonialism in a new guise , albeit with a respectable cloak in the form of access agreements . "
Such is the human feeding frenzy , there may come a time when there are no fish left to catch .
In 2006 , a study in the US journal Science warned that every single species we exploit would have collapsed by 2048 if populations continued to decline as they had since the 1950s .
By 2003 , nearly a third of all species had collapsed , the study found - meaning their numbers were down 90 % or more on historic maximum catch levels .
Extrapolate that on a graph , and the downward curve reaches 100 % just before 2050 .
That prognosis - now disputed - was based on a four - year study of fish populations , catch records and ocean ecosystems .
" We really see the end of the line now , " said the author Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , at the time .
" It will be in our lifetime .
Our children will see a world without seafood , if we do not change things . "
Many imagined a world where there would be no fish protein left to eat apart from jellyfish and marine algae .
What the study did not make sufficiently clear was that some fish populations had bounced back as a result of drastic measures by the authorities .
In countries such as Iceland , Norway , the United States , New Zealand and Australia , fisheries management has been strengthened by controls that limit fishing effort ( the number of boats out there , the time they spend at sea and the areas where they are allowed to fish ) .
Another management approach , especially in Europe , is to control output ( the amount of fish landed ) using Total Allowable Catch quotas , or TACs .
These are designed to maintain a stock 's biomass - the estimated weight of fish left in the sea after fishing and natural deaths are taken into account .
It should never be allowed to fall so low that a species is unable to spawn a healthy generation the following year .
Drawn up by scientists and organisations such as Ices ( the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ) , these quotas are discussed by fisheries ministers and fishermen at forums such as the EU .
Both have vested interests , whether political or commercial .
" If you put the fox in charge of the henhouse , " Professor Roberts says , " decisions will be based on short - term constraints , such as paying the mortgage on the boat .
Politicians , too , make choices that are beneficial to them or their constituents in the short term . "
In other words , such gatherings often ride roughshod over the scientists ' recommendations - as happened at a meeting of ICCAT ( the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ) in Luxembourg in 2007 , where quotas were being thrashed out for bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean .
Scientists recommended an annual catch of 15,000 tonnes a year , with a preference for 10,000 tonnes - but EU ministers agreed a quota of 29,000 tonnes , enough to guarantee the collapse of the species .
( Last year , quotas for 2009 were again set far higher than scientists were advising . )
In fact , the real amount of bluefin landed was 61,000 tonnes - four times what scientists had recommended - due to illegal and unreported fishing .
Last month , the European Commission implemented a two - year control and inspection programme for bluefin tuna fisheries in seven Mediterranean countries , to clamp down on things such as illegal spotter planes used to track down tuna schools .
Globally , black - market fishing is worth US $ 25 bn ( £ 17bn ) a year .
In Europe , 50 % of the cod we eat has been caught illegally .
Those figures , and the Luxembourg debacle , are recorded in The End of the Line - the documentary , based on Charles Clover 's book of that name , to be screened in UK cinemas from 8 June .
However , the blatant disregard for science it portrays is not an isolated case .
" We have analysed the decision - making of European fisheries ministers over the past 20 years , " says Professor Roberts , " and systematically , year on year , they have set quotas that are 25 to 35 % higher than the levels recommended by scientists . "
How can our politicians get away with it ?
" There is no obligation upon them to take scientific advice , " Professor Roberts explains .
" What they will tell you is that it is only one of the things they have to consider .
While they might be protecting a fisherman 's livelihood in the term of one or two years , short - term decision - making like that guarantees stock collapse .
It is not just a possibility , it is a certainty .
The only uncertainty is how long it will take . "
According to Professor Roberts : " What politicians should be deciding is how the catch is allocated within different nations .
That is politics .
What they should n't be deciding is how big the catch should be in the first place .
That is science . "
In Norway and the US , " they respect the advice of scientists " , he adds - the best example being New England , where stocks of ground fish were in serious decline in the mid-1990s , but enlightened management brought them back .
" At Georges Bank , they created a closed area of 20,000 square kilometres that was off - limits to mobile fishing gear [ such as trawl nets ] , " Professor Roberts explains .
They also cut fishing effort by a draconian 50 % - putting many fishermen out of business .
In the past 10 years , however , there has been " a spectacular recovery " of key economic species , Roberts says .
" The haddock has bounced back , the flounder has bounced back , the scallops have bounced back , so it has been a great success story . "
What this demonstrates is that , where there is political will , the tide can be turned on overfishing .
In the US , a piece of 1976 legislation called the Magnuson - Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act has recently been reauthorised , requiring the industry to end overfishing in all federal waters by 2011 .
There is no such legislation in Europe .
Under the existing Act , fisheries in Alaska and the North Pacific are already well managed - which is why wild Pacific salmon , Pacific cod and pollock from Alaska were prime candidates for certification by the Marine Stewardship Council ( MSC ) , the international NGO that created a standard for sustainable fisheries in the late 1990s and upholds it .
Why do these US fisheries tick all the boxes ?
" They have very progressive management under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council , " Professor Roberts says , " with precautionary targets - so they go for a relatively low fraction of the fish population each year .
They have closures to protect habitats and valued species such as Steller sea lions and sea otters [ which can get caught in fishing gear ] plus extensive areas that are closed to protect deep - water corals from destruction by bottom trawling .
" The authorities also impose quotas for bycatch - other species caught by mistake - to protect them from exploitation .
These are the kinds of issues the MSC is looking at when certifying fisheries .
So far , 43 have been certified , including 10 in Britain , while more than 100 are under assessment - but what exactly does that mean ?
" Right from the start , the idea was that fisheries would be independently assessed by a third party , " says James Simpson , communications officer at the MSC , " so although we set the standard , we do n't carry out the assessments .
That is important , because it means we do n't have any influence over the results . "
Instead , marine scientists from certifying bodies such as Food Certification International and Moody Marine do the work , delving into every aspect of sustainability and producing a report up to 900 pages long .
" They look at stock levels , based on historical records , " says Simpson , " at the impact fishing is having on the environment and at the management plan for the fishery . "
A score of 80 or more must be achieved against each of these three criteria for a fishery to be certified .
The initial assessment is peer - reviewed by fellow scientists , stakeholders such as environmental groups have their say - and the fishery gets to carry the eco-label on its products .
" To do that , you have to be able to trace the fish all the way through the supply chain , " says Simpson , " because you do n't want any non-certified species or illegally caught fish slipping into an MSC batch . "
The science may be rigorous , but will the MSC label change the world ?
With some species , the label is making a big difference : 42 % of the world 's wild salmon catch is MSC - certified , and 40 % of its prime white fish catch .
Altogether , five million tonnes of seafood are certified by the MSC every year .
However , that is just five per cent of the wild - caught seafood market , which is why Professor Roberts believes the label itself " can only change a small number of well - informed people who actually care " .
The big effect , he says , is that supermarkets " have taken on board what the MSC is saying and have developed better fish sourcing policies of their own .
They are the ones who can buy or not buy from a particular supplier , so they have a lot of power . "
Sainsbury 's - the largest retailer of MSC - certified seafood in the UK - has pledged that , by the end of 2010 , it will source 80 % of its seafood from MSC - certified fisheries or from the " green list " of species approved by the Marine Conservation Society .
Marks & Spencer has promised that , by 2012 , all its seafood will be either MSC - certified or from other independently certified fisheries .
In May , it will launch a new range of prepared meals for outdoor eating and barbecues , based around gurnard , John Dory and black bream .
Caught in season in British waters , these are a more sustainable choice than the " Big Five " overfished species - the cod , haddock , prawns , tuna and plaice that account for 80 % of all seafood sold in Britain .
If we take the pressure off these overexploited stocks , they will hopefully recover .
However , the MSC programme is about far more than shopping .
In Europe , the growing number of certified fisheries has transformed the mood of EU fishing negotiations .
The Dutch based Pelagic Freezer - Trawler Association ( PFA ) was the first North Sea herring fishery to be MSC - certified in May 2006 , and the Swedish , Danish and Scottish herring fleets followed .
Their representatives meet regularly in Brussels to talk about fisheries management .
" All the major herring players in Europe are MSC - certified or under assessment , " says Gerard van Balsfoort , president of the PFA , " and this has led to a certain kind of behaviour in the advisory process .
From the point of view of stocks , you can't just ask for a higher quota if it is n't scientifically based .
You can't just shout for what you want . "
In the seas around South Georgia - a remote Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom 1,300 km from the Falkland Islands - the Patagonian toothfish fishery was required by MSC certifiers to initiate research that would locate deep - coral areas vulnerable to damage by trawl gear .
If such areas were found , efforts to protect them " should be considered " , the certifiers said .
In fact , the fishery went further .
It identified three deep - coral areas that needed protecting and closed them to fishing vessels entirely .
That way , fish and fragile habitats would have a chance to recover .
In South Africa and New Zealand , too , MSC - certified fisheries ( for hake and hoki respectively ) have helped create Marine Protected Areas ( MPAs ) where trawling is banned , either by funding research or by lobbying the government .
In New Zealand , 30 % of the Exclusive Economic Zone - an area extending 220 miles out to sea over which it has rights - has been closed with fishing industry approval .
Such closures could provide the answer to the fishing crisis , allowing our children and our grandchildren to eat fish with a clear conscience .
In Iceland , Canada and the US , the creation of MPAs " has brought real increases in fish populations and real recovery of seabed habitats " , Professor Roberts reports .
" Populations of exploited species have increased five- , 10 - or even 20 - fold within five , 10 or 20 years , " he says .
" What you see is the flourishing of life . "
Over time , this explosion of fecundity spreads to other parts of the ocean .
" The benefits of protection flow to the surrounding fishing grounds through the emigration of animals from protected areas , and the export of their offspring on ocean currents , " Professor Roberts says .
" The eggs and larvae of these protected animals are transported to fishing grounds and can replenish them . "
In his view , 30 % of the world 's oceans should be protected " to set the clock back 200 years " and reverse the fishing crisis .
After that , responsible fisheries management " in the North Pacific mould " could avert the 2048 scenario .
The trouble is , only 0.8 % of the oceans are currently closed to fishing - despite the efforts of former President George W Bush , who " single - handedly created MPAs , dotted throughout the Pacific Ocean , which now constitute 31 % of all MPAs worldwide " , Professor Roberts says .
In Britain , too , MPAs are seen as part of the solution .
The Marine Bill is grinding its way through Parliament , with a provision to create MPAs in territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles from our coast .
Britain and Europe have pledged to create networks of MPAs by 2012 .
Far from campaigning for a total ban on fishing , Professor Roberts believes it should be allowed .
If properly regulated , it will increase global fish production rather than decimate it .
" Fisheries science suggests that a species is healthiest when you reduce its population size by 50 % , " he says .
" That way , you remove the larger , older , slower - growing animals and the population becomes dominated by smaller , faster - growing fish .
For them , the availability of food increases and they thrive .
That gives you a boost in population growth rate , which gives you a higher rate of production to exploit . "
Perversely , fishing could swamp the world with fish protein rather than starve it - but it has to be done differently .
" We should abandon quotas , " Professor Roberts believes , limiting fishing effort rather than output .
" If you 're not out there catching fish , they 're not going to die . "
At present , EU vessels that exceed their quota have to dump fish overboard dead , rather than land it illegally .
" You 've got one or two times as many fish being killed and discarded , sometimes , as are being landed , " Professor Roberts says .
" That is no way to manage a fishery ; that is not sensible at all .
You have to land all your catch . "
Reforms such as this will require " a major change of political direction on this side of the Atlantic " , Professor Roberts warns - " but if we have that , we can turn back the clock within 20 years , to the point where a lot of species are in a far more productive state .
None of this is rocket science .
Perhaps we need good old George W Bush back ... the world 's greatest marine conservationist ! "

The US government has built a fusion energy power plant which uses lasers to create temperatures even hotter than the centre of the sun .
Adam Brookes has been to California to find out more .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Warren Buffett ’s insurance and investment company , barely broke even in the fourth quarter because of losses on derivatives contracts tied to the stock market .
Warren Buffett , CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , takes part in a conversation on leadership and the economy at The Women 's Conference 2008 in Long Beach , California October 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
Profit fell 96 percent , the fifth straight quarterly decline , and Berkshire ’s net worth tumbled $ 10.9 billion in the year ’s final three months .
Net worth per share fell 9.6 percent in 2008 , only the second decline since Buffett began running Berkshire in 1965 .
It fell 6.2 percent in 2001 .
In his eagerly anticipated annual letter to Berkshire shareholders , Buffett also offered a gloomy economic outlook , saying “ the economy will be in shambles throughout 2009 -- and for that matter , probably well beyond . ”
Still , despite what he called “ paralyzing fear ” resulting from the credit crisis and falling housing and stock prices , he remained optimistic about American resilience , and praised government efforts to avoid a “ cataclysmic ” breakdown in the financial system .
“ Though the path has not been smooth , our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time , ” he said .
“ It has unleashed human potential as no other system has , and it will continue to do so .
America ’s best days lie ahead .
Berkshire generates about half its results from insurance , including auto insurer Geico Corp , but operates more than 70 businesses that offer such things as carpeting , ice cream , paint , real estate services and underwear .
Buffett is one of the world ’s most - admired investors , and Forbes magazine last year called him the second - richest American .
Quarterly net income for Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire sank to $ 117 million , or $ 76 per Class A share , from $ 2.95 billion , or $ 1,904 , a year earlier .
Revenue fell 12 percent to $ 24.59 billion .
Excluding $ 3.25 billion of investment losses , more than double the previous nine months combined , operating profit rose 43 percent to $ 3.37 billion , or $ 2,175 per Class A share , from $ 2.35 billion , or $ 1,518 .
The amount in part reflected underwriting gains at Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group , and investment gains and a termination fee related to an aborted effort to buy Constellation Energy Group Inc .
“ They are doing better than many rivals in a very difficult investment and operating environment , ” said Bill Bergman , senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc in Chicago .
“ We had a 5 - star rating , the highest we have , on Berkshire , and after reading the letter I feel better than I did yesterday . ”
Buffett said insurance and utility results helped offset his mistakes , including a decision to buy shares of oil company ConocoPhillips when oil and gas prices were near their peak .
He said his “ terrible timing ” cost Berkshire “ several billion dollars . ”
Buffett said he has also lost most of a $ 244 million investment in shares of two Irish banks .
Berkshire ’s book value , or assets minus liabilities , fell to $ 109.27 billion at year end from $ 120.16 billion at the end of September , and from $ 120.73 billion at the end of 2007 .
DERIVATIVE LOSSES
Results were battered by $ 4.61 billion of pretax losses on about 251 derivative contracts largely tied to the longer - term performance of four stock market indexes and the credit quality of higher - risk “ junk ” bonds .
A deteriorating economy and tight credit led to steep declines in stock prices and an increase in junk bond defaults , resulting in losses for Berkshire .
While the losses exist on paper , accounting rules require Berkshire to report them with earnings .
Buffett revealed for the first time which stock indexes he has been using : the Standard & Poor ’s 500 , Britain ’s FTSE 100 , Europe ’s Euro Stoxx 50 , and the Nikkei 225 in Japan .
In his letter , Buffett said he believed each contract that Berkshire owns was “ mispriced ” at the outset , and that the ups and downs “ neither cheer nor bother ” him .
Berkshire nevertheless got billions of dollars of upfront payments from parties on the other side of the contracts , which the company can invest as it wishes .
This , he has said , makes the contracts different from the “ financial weapons of mass destruction ” that he has called other derivatives .
“ The income statement understates the benefits Buffett gets by putting the upfront premiums to work , ” said Thomas Russo , a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster , Pennsylvania , whose largest investment is Berkshire stock .
Berkshire ended the year with $ 25.54 billion of cash , down from $ 44.33 billion a year earlier .
It said it made roughly $ 6 billion of acquisitions in 2008 , and spent $ 14.5 billion on fixed - income securities from General Electric Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr Co. Buffett sold some stocks to fund the latter purchases .
For all of 2008 , profit at Berkshire fell 62 percent to a six - year low of $ 4.99 billion , or $ 3,224 per share , from $ 13.21 billion , or $ 8,548 .
Revenue fell 9 percent to $ 107.8 billion .
Berkshire Class A shares closed Friday at $ 78,600 on the New York Stock Exchange .
They have fallen 44 percent since the end of February 2008 , while the Standard & Poor ’s 500 has dropped 45 percent .
Debian and keyboard mapping copyrights
[ Distributions ] Posted Mar 18 , 2009 15:16 UTC ( Wed ) by corbet
The debian - legal list often serves as an early warning system for interesting copyright issues .
Currently , the project is discussing the fate of a French Dvorak keyboard mapping which is evidently subject to a copyright claim by one Francis Leboutte , who says it can only be used under a Creative commons noncommercial , no-derivatives license .
That license , being non-free , would exclude the this keyboard mapping ( which is implemented entirely in free software ) from the Debian distribution .
But there is a clear question here : can a keyboard layout be copyrighted at all ?

It is difficult to describe the predicament facing the people of Kinglake .
On the one hand they are deep in grief over the loss of friends and relatives , neighbours and acquaintances from their town .
They have got a massive clean - up in front of them , funerals to attend and children to care for .
And then there are other old echoes of their previous lives .
Different banks seem to have different ideas about how the bushfire survivors should go about resuming mortgage repayments on houses that no longer exist .
Matt Falla says he is lucky his house survived , but just when he is getting back on his feet , he has had to worry about his mortgage .
" My wife went to the Commonwealth Bank who we have a mortgage with and spoke to the manager about some relief assistance with our mortgage , " he said .
" I'm a sub - contract carpenter so I am unable to work at the moment .
" My wife does work part - time but she is unable to work .
We are caring for our daughter because there is no schooling .
" We 've been told that we can have a suspension of repayments for a period of three months , but at the end of that three months we need to repay the interest in full . "
Mr Falla says should his mortgage line of credit go over its limit during that time , the excess amount will be charged at double the normal rate of interest .
" I relayed the story to our neighbour , Justin , who we fought the fire with on Saturday .
He banks with the Bendigo Bank and they have suspended their mortgage for a period of three months on their principal and interest and they do n't have to pay anything after that period . "
Commonwealth Bank 's national spokesman Steve Batton says the bank assesses each customer on an individual basis .
" Some customers have different needs to others , " he said .
" What we are looking at in the interim is a three - month moratorium .
" However as mentioned , we will look at individual customers ' needs and assess whether or not there is a requirement for an extension . "
Fiona Leadbeater , who lost her home in the fires , said her mortgage was the last thing on her mind .
" I have been too concerned about friends and family who have lost loved ones and just trying to help get the community back on its feet , " she said .
" I am in a fortunate position that I do n't have a house any more but only have a small mortgage .
" I feel very sorry for people that have got a large one because it must be a huge burden on top of everything else that has happened to them . "
Mr Falla says a compulsion to stay and help his fellow residents outweighs any pressure to earn money to pay off his mortgage .
" I can't with my conscience , hop into my car , drive down to Melbourne to work to pay for a mortgage when I have got dead friends still on the ground , " he said .
" Others who have no home .
Others who are hurting and are injured and I am a builder and a carpenter and I can help here .
" I just ca n't do it . "
For the last few months , I 've ben away from the Ruby land , doing first a Java and now a .NET project .
I also had to write a few hundred lines of Python .
Hold on with condolences - it was n't a bad thing at all .
I actually loved the opportunity to tinker with other mainstream platforms and see how things are there these days .
Besides , JetBrains makes wonderful tools .
Besides , next time someone tells me Rails has too much magic , I 'll be laughing - compared to Spring / Hibernate ?
- give me a break !
But I digress .
This is to report that recent Java /.NET experience has GREATLY improved my appreciation of the usefulness , maintainability and sheer beauty of a well - written Rake build .
A build in a real programing language is AWESOME .
It is my [ now well - informed ] opinion that this is one of the things corporate IT sector should learn in the build / deployment area - replace Ant and MSBuild with tools that use real programming languages for expressing the build logic .
I.e. , Rake or similar .
Why would you want to do it ?
Here is an example .
On the aforementioned Java project we needed to include a piece of logic into the build that would behave roughly as follows : * Grab build artefacts for a specified build from Cruise *
Copy them to one or several servers ( one for test environments , several for production ) *
Unpack some of them on the target box ( - es ) *
Flip the symlinks *
Gracefully handle a failure of any step *
Be mindful about the fact that the target environment may or may not be a cluster .
This task was handled by a fellow ThoughtWorker , very smart guy with substantial platform experience in the Java land .
Since the client asked us to avoid introducing too many alien artifacts , he did it all in Ant .
As far as I remember , it took something like two days to sort it all out .
The last two bullet points proved particularly hard .
Apparently ( and what a surprise ! ) , XML is not the best way to describe loops and conditional statements .
Certain parts of the solution were a great laugh ( of a bitter / cynical variety ) .
The Daily WTF does n't have a Hall of Fame , but if it did , this stuff should be featured there .
Once again , we are talking about a very smart guy - many programmers could not even find a way to do it , I suspect .
If we were not constrained in the choice of tools , we would go for Rake Vlad , and be done with it in under two hours , conservatively speaking - been there , done that .
Overall , I think that a Rake build for that project ( fairly straightforward Java web app ) , would be four to five times smaller , an equivalent number of times cheaper to create , and noticeably easier to maintain , too , despite being an alien artifact for the support team .
Benefits of using
Ant ( which supposedly makes it easier to compile a bunch of Java classes and make a war file out of them ) proved imaginary as soon as we started addressing automated deployment requirements .
Two days extra work is not such a big deal , if it is just an isolated incident - but it was n't .
Couple of days here , a day there - these costs do accumulate .
By the way , before anyone asks - yes , we did look into Maven 2 .
Outcome : it 's quite possible to coerce me into using
Ant for another Java project , but I would flatly refuse to touch Maven with a ten feet pole - consultant ethics demand it .
And yes , I do have logical arguments to support this position with .
It just is n't the subject of my post .
If memory serves , it 's been 5 or 6 years since the creator of Ant publicly stated that programming in angled brackets was a bad idea .
And for at least five years we have some great alternatives to it coming from the dynamic languages community .
These things are neither new , nor unproven anymore .
They offer very tangible benefits - that 's the point .
Once you know about these alternatives , the only real reason to continue using Ant ( or Nant , or MSBuild ) for any build that goes beyond " compile and run unit tests " is inertia .
Which , up to some point , is a perfectly good reason - new shiny toys tend to have nasty flipside .
But that point for switching from things like Ant to things like Rake is past us , in this pundit 's opinion .
Question is , when are we , as an industry , finally going to do it ?

A SPECTRE is haunting the United States — the spectre of Europe .
Republicans such as Newt Gingrich , the grand old man of the party , and Mike Pence , one of its firebrands , say that Barack Obama 's Democrats are imposing “ European - style socialism ” on America .
“ As they try to pull us in the direction of government - dominated Europe , ” says Mitt Romney , arguably the front - runner for the Republican nomination in 2012 , “ we 're going to have to fight as never before to make sure that America stays America . ”
This sort of sentiment is not confined to the cave - dwellers of the right .
Roger Cohen , a liberal New York Times columnist , worries that “ one France is enough ” .
Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard economist , says “ I take the 2008 US elections as marking a turn toward continental Europe . ”
Six years after Robert Kagan claimed that “ Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus ” , there is a growing feeling that the two planets are destined to merge .
But are they ?
They are certainly getting a bit closer .
Mr Obama is raising taxes on the rich , bailing out failed businesses , tackling climate change and dramatically increasing public spending .
A decade ago American government spending stood at 34.3 % of GDP compared with 48.2 % in the euro zone , a gap of 14 points ; in 2010 it is expected to be 39.9 % of GDP compared with 47.1 % , a gap of less than eight points , according to Newsweek .
What is more , Mr Obama 's rise has coincided with a softening of American exceptionalism .
America is unlikely to repeat George Bush 's America über alles foreign policy in the near future .
A growing number of states have imposed moratoriums on the death penalty .
Support is growing for everything leftish , from tackling global warming to letting gays marry .
Still , the two planets have a very long way to travel before they meet .
Consider a horrific event at a First Baptist Church in Illinois on March 8th .
An unknown assailant pulled out a semi-automatic weapon and started firing at the preacher .
The preacher managed to deflect the gunman 's first four rounds using his Bible , sending a confetti- like spray of paper into the air , but was eventually felled .
That is not the sort of thing that goes on of a Sunday in Tunbridge Wells .
There is nothing particularly “ European ” or “ socialist ” about Mr Obama 's stimulus package .
Countries the world over are spending public money in a bid to boost demand and shore up the banks .
Indeed , some of the most stubborn resistance to deficit financing has come from Europe , particularly from Germany and the EU finance ministers .
Messrs Gingrich and Romney might note that the man who set this ball rolling was not Mr Obama but Mr Bush , the most un -European politician imaginable .
What about Mr Obama 's plans to raise taxes and redirect social policy ?
There are plenty of plausible criticisms of these ( such as the fact that his numbers do not add up ) , but the idea that they entail “ full - scale Europeanisation ” , as Mark Steyn , a columnist , argues , is one of the least persuasive .
Mr Obama 's budget will return the top tax rates to 36 % and 39.6 % — back to where they were during Bill Clinton 's administration .
Mr Clinton ended up presiding over the high - tech boom and a surge in the number of small businesses .
Mr Obama has eschewed the single - payer model of health - care reform long advocated by the European - minded left ; he wants to use public insurance to supplement the private system , not supplant it .
Many of the strongest supporters of his health - care reforms are business people who are being crushed by the exorbitant cost of health care .
For all Europe 's Obamamania Mr Obama is , in fact , one of the least European - minded of American presidents .
JFK studied at the London School of Economics with Harold Laski , a leading British socialist .
Bill Clinton went to Oxford University and surrounded himself with Rhodes scholars who liked to discuss the German educational model .
John Kerry was famously not just French - speaking but also “ French - looking ” .
Mr Obama 's roots lie in Kenya , Indonesia and Kansas — any continent but Europe .
His two books hardly mention Europe at all .
“ The Audacity of Hope ” includes a disparaging reference to the idea that America should “ round up the United Kingdom and Togo ” as supporters — and then do as it pleases .
The only European country that gets a mention in the index under “ Foreign policy , US ” is Ukraine — and that nation gets less space than Indonesia .
Consider the converse
The fury about “ European socialism ” is not just wrong as a matter of fact .
It is foolish as a matter of policy .
Europe has plenty of things to teach the United States ( particularly about running a welfare state ) , just as America has plenty to teach Europe ( particularly about igniting entrepreneurialism ) .
Indeed , a more telling criticism of the Obama administration is not that it is borrowing too much from Europe but that it is learning too little .
Sweden and the Netherlands have a comprehensive system of school choice ( the Dutch even allow public money to flow to religious schools ) .
Switzerland and the Netherlands have a market - based system of health care which uses private insurers , covers everyone , and does so at a much lower cost than the American system .
Britain has taken contracting - out in the public sector much further than America has done .
Europeans and Americans are never likely to coalesce : their cultural traditions are too strong and their solutions to the problem of regulating capitalism too distinctive .
But they nevertheless have plenty in common — ageing populations , exploding entitlements and above all , at the moment , a wrenching recession .
Europeans have thankfully toned down the America - bashing that was popular a few years ago .
Americans might consider returning the compliment .

Russia Today Interviews Gerald Celente
The merger of corporate and government powers in modern America is plain and simple fascism , believes Gerald Celente , the founder of the Trends Research Institute and publisher of Trends Journal .
Celente takes an in - depth look at what AIG and Goldman Sachs really are and the people behind them ; explains the policies of Obamas administration , and the moral basis for a forthcoming new American Revolution .
RT : Id like to begin by talking about the Treasury department .
Theyve decided to extend bailout funds to a number of struggling life insurance policies .
This is in addition to the auto industry and the banks .
Do you think Americans are aware of whats going on ?
G.C. : They know about it , its a new trend .
America is going from what used to be the major capitalistic country in the world of free market  a crusader  into what Mussolini would have called fascism : the merger of state and corporate powers .
So it is not socialism as people believe , it is socialisms egalitarianism .
It s not communism where the state controls monopolies  its fascism , plain and simple .
The merger of corporate and government powers .
State - controlled capitalism is called fascism , and fascism has come to America in broad daylight .
But they re feeding them it in little bits and pieces .
First AIG was too big to fail .
Mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were too big to fail .
Banks too big to fail and auto companies .
And now we give money to the people that make the auto parts .
And now theres talk about the technology companies , wanting their piece of the action .
The merger of state and government is called fascism .
Take it from Mussolini ; he knew a thing or two about it .
RT : What can Americans do if they are opposed to the road that government officials are bringing them down ?
G.C. :
The people dont really have a choice , there is no ballot box .
Im of Italian descent and Ive heard enough of mafia stories for the rest of my life .
If you want to look at a mafia , you can call it a republican and democratic party .
And if you want to look at the two families , the heads of the mafia , all you have to do is to look at the Bushes and the Clintons .
Theyve been running the show now for some 24 years .
We heard about Obama who is going to bring in change .
A change you could believe in if he is dumb , stupid and blind .
Look who hes brought in as his chief policy makers .
Retreads from the old Clinton administration .
It s a two - headed one - party system .
So it s very difficult for the people to vote in a new administration that is nt part of the old one .
RT : Can you tell me one thing that you like about President Obama ?
G.C. : In the Trends Journal , the top trends of 2009 , one of our trends was that people are going to be putting out recession gardens .
And now as we see the Obamas , they are planting their own garden , and that trend is taking hold .
So he is doing that in positive ways , hes bringing an element of dignity back to society .
Those are positives .
But now let me look at whether its true or the hypocrisy .
So , they are talking about planting their own gardens .
And they are talking about buying local .
Oh , all that is wonderful , but on the other side of the coin they are pushing genetically modified foods while they re eating organic .
So it s like let them eat Frankenfoods   this is the message .
So I see hypocrisy at every level .
When they show me truth and justice , and the real American way  then Ill believe .

The Best of Gerald Celente
The 2008 Minnesota Senate Election officially has a winner , at least according to the Election Contest Tribunal .
The three judge ECC issued a 68 page order late Monday declaring Franken the winner .
The body of the order is excerpted below :
ORDER FOR JUDGMENT
Based on the above findings of fact and conclusions of law , and pursuant to Minn .
Stat . § 209.12 , the Court DECIDES , DECLARES , AND ADJUDGES that Contestee Al Franken is the party to the contest who received the highest number of votes legally cast in the 2008 United States Senate general election and is therefore entitled to receive the certificate of election .
Accordingly , IT IS ORDERED that : 1 . Contestants ' Notice of Contest is dismissed with prejudice ; 2 . Contestee 's Counterclaims are dismissed without prejudice as moot ; 3 . Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 209.07 , subd .
3 , costs of the contest must be paid by Contestants , and Contestee and the Court shall prove up the applicable costs by affidavit after all proceedings in this matter are concluded ; and 4 .
For the reasons stated in the Court 's Order of March 2 , 2009 , imposing a sanction on Contestants , Contestee is awarded his reasonable costs and attorneys ' fees in connection with Contestants ' failure to disclose , such costs and fees to be proved up by affidavit .
5 . Any request for relief in these proceedings not specifically granted herein is denied .
There being no just reason for delay , LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY Dated : April 13 2009 Source : Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Before the above order , the ECC presented 157 individual findings of fact over 24 pages .
Finding # 120 addresses the missing ballots in Minneapolis W3 - P1 and findings # 137 and # 138 detail the voters whose ballots were opened and counted on April 7th :
120 .
Given the evidence presented , the Court finds that 132 ballots from Minneapolis Precinct 3 - 1 were cast and properly counted on Election Day and were lost at some point after they were counted on Election Day but before the administrative recount .
... 137 . The evidence was sufficient to prove that the absentee ballots of the persons identified in Attachment A were legally cast and wrongfully rejected .
138 .
The following additions shall be made to the vote totals certified by the Board on January 5 , 2009 : 111 additional votes for Coleman and 198 additional votes for Franken .
Source : Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Attachment A contains the names and counties of 351 voters , along with a reference to the exhibit or court document in which they were originally presented .
A greater majority of the exhibit reference appear to begin with an " F , " meaning that the Franken campaign originally presented that voter 's absentee ballot .
This is not however a scientific analysis , simply a brief observation .
I 'll digitize the document later and provide an exact count at a later date .
Follwing the findings of fact , the court then presented two memorandums addressing specific , yet unresolved issues .
The first memorandum is entitled " RULE 9 / DOUBLE COUNTING MEMORANDUM " and can be characterized from the following excerpts on page 30 and 31 of the order , respectively :
Any argument that Contestants did not realize that Rule 9 might lead to possible " double counting " of ballots has been waived by their conduct and delay in raising this issue .
This court emphasized in earlier orders that this is an expedited proceeding .
Contestants ' unreasonably delayed raising their claim and are now barred from asserting it .
...
This Court received evidence that it is not uncommon for discrepancies to exist between the number of ballots cast in a precinct and the number of voters shown on Election Day rosters .
These Election Day discrepancies can be caused by voters failing to sign rosters before voting and election judges failing to mark the acceptance of absentee ballots on the rosters .
The Court cannot conclude that double counting occurred simply because the number of votes counted during the recount is greater than the number of voters on the rosters .
Source : Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Basically the court acknowledged that discrepancies between the number of physical voters and the number of physical votes existed , but the court was unmoved by the Contestant 's [ Coleman ] attempts to prove that these discrepancies were caused by double counting .
The next memorandum is entitled " EQUAL PROTECTION MEMORANDUM , " and as you might guess , deals with Coleman 's equal protection claim .
The court first summarized Coleman 's argument on page 33 and then states , on page 37 , that the proper jurisdiction for this argument lies within the US Senate :
I. Introduction Contestants argue that similarly - situated absentee ballots were treated differently throughout Minnesota 's counties and cities , and that this inconsistent treatment implicates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions .
The Court reviewed this argument respectfully in light of the mandates of the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution that all persons similarly - situated be treated alike under the law .
See U.S. CONST . amend .
XIV , § 1 ; MINN .
CONST .
Art. 1 , § 2 . ... Thus , to the extent Contestants ' equal protection argument alleges " deliberate , serious , and material violation [s ] " of Minnesota 's election laws , this Court lacks jurisdiction to make findings or conclusions on these points and the matter is preserved for the United States Senate .
See Minn. Stat . § 209.12 ( " Evidence ... including ... the question of the right of any person to nomination or office on the ground of deliberate , serious , and material violation of the provisions of the Minnesota Election Law , must be taken and preserved by the judge trying the contest .
.. . " ) ; U.S. CONST .
Art. 1 , § 5 , Cl. 1 ( " Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections , Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . " ) ; see also Odegard v. Olson , 119 N.W.2d 717 , 719 ( Minn. 1963 ) .
The Minnesota Supreme Court recently addressed this issue directly and ruled as follows :
When the election contest concerns a congressional office , the only question to be decided is which candidate received the highest number of votes legally cast at the election .
Minn. Stat. § 209.12 ( 2008 ) .
Nevertheless , evidence on any other issues specified in the notice of election contest is to be preserved and forwarded to the presiding officer of the Senate or House of Representatives of the United States , as the case may be .
Id. Coleman v. Ritchie , 762 N.W.2d 218 , 226 ( Minn. 2009 ) .

The equal protection memorandum continues until page 56 and addresses many of Coleman 's additional claim 's by essentially stating that the 2008 Minnesota Senate Election administration was conducted in accordance with the US Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution .
The ECC concluded their order by stating the following :
The citizens of Minnesota should be proud of their election system .
Minnesota has one of the highest voter - participation rates in the country .
The Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State and election officials throughout Minnesota 's counties and cities are well - trained , fair , and conscientious and performed their duties admirably .
Minnesota could not conduct elections without the hard work and diligence of its dedicated professionals and citizen volunteers , and the Court is proud of their service .

All that remains is for Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) and SOS Mark Ritchie ( D ) to sign the Election Certificate as directed , although not legally obligated , by the above order .
Coleman has 10 days to file an appeal to the MN Supreme Court , but the ECC states that the US Senate has the ultimate jurisdiction .
Al Franken officially received more votes than any other candidate , but his path to the US Senate may still be lined with political obstacles .
The Coleman campaign has already acknowledged their intent to appeal , and there are rumors that Tim Pawlenty may not sign the certificate until the appeals process has ended .
In any case , Al Franken received the most votes , by 312 , for US Senate in the State of Minnesota on November 4th , 2008 .
Update [ 3:08 AM CT ] : I went ahead and parsed through Attachment A [ CSV ] and the results were mildly surprising :
Record # Ballots Coleman : 110 Franken : 193 ( 194 ) Nauen : 36 ( 37 ) Contestee 's SJ : 10 Testimony : 1 Total : 351
The parentheses denote a voter who was listed within both a Franken Exhibit and a Nauen Summary Judgment order .
More than half of the 351 absentee ballots contained within Attachment A originated from evidence presented by the Franken Campaign .
It 's interesting to note that the number of ballots accepted from each campaign almost identically replicates the final result of the 351 ballots ; the final allocation was Coleman 111 , Franken 198 and 42 to Other .
The most interesting inclusion does however come from a Coleman presented witness .
If you recall from the litigation proceedings , Robert Peter DeMuth filled out his voter registration form with the aid of a computer by digitally signing his absentee ballot request form .
Mr. DeMuth 's ballot was included in the ECC certified result as the ECC only required that the voter sign the physical envelope ; which Mr. DeMuth apparently did .

Unless the title has something like civilization or craft in it or it belongs to a popular franchise , attracting a large enough audience for it to create a buzz is quite difficult .
Regardless of this fact though , it ’s a challenge that Demigod is prepared to take on .

Link of the day - I will pay you $ 25 , if you come up with a cool domain name for me .
He has been called a " born creative thinker " and " a man of extraordinarily high principle " .
Others consider his inventions frivolous and derivative .
Not that Frederick Bailier Richardson III - aka Ric Richardson - particularly cares .
As of last week , the 47 - year - old inventor , surfer and one - time dirt - biker stands to reap the lion 's share of a $ US388 million ( $ 537 million ) damages award from Microsoft , after a US jury found the software giant had stolen his technology .
Mr Richardson , who grew up in Lane Cove and never studied beyond year 12 at Hunters Hills High , is the founder of Uniloc , which sued Microsoft in 2003 for violating its patent relating to anti-piracy technology .
" I would love to tell you how much money I 'll get , " he told the Herald , " but frankly I do n't know .
I do n't get into the operational side of the business .
To me , the money is important only in so far as it allows me to further my ideas . "
Despite his low profile , Mr Richardson , who divides his time between Sydney and Huntington Beach , California , is the inventor of dozens of patents .
Recent projects include adapting the carbon scrubbing technology found in submarines to car exhaust pipes and collaborating with friend and Nobel nominee Peter Rentzepis , from the University of California , on the use of lasers to achieve atomic level computing .
" Ric is scarily intelligent , and he works crazy hours , " Brad Davis , chief executive of Uniloc USA , said .
" He 's the kind of guy who can become an expert on something in about eight seconds . "
The son of a freelance cameraman , Mr Richardson began inventing early ,
experimenting in the mid 1970s with bicycle design .
" I would disappear into Dad 's garage , putting different forks on the front of Dragsters and cutting off bicycle seats and putting on motorcycle handlebars and trying only a back brake . "
He had , without knowing , invented the BMX .
" Then one day I opened American Dirt Bike magazine and saw a BMX and realised that I 'd been beaten to it .
I ask them if I could at least be BMX's Australian distributor , but a container of bikes cost $ 8000 , and Mum and Dad were n't willing to give me that . "
In his early teens , he alternated between teaching guitar and helping his father on shoots .
" Dad was a stringer cameraman for the ABC .
Whenever stories broke outside the normal hours , they would call us .
As soon as I was strong enough , Dad had me going out at 3 am with him , lugging around the old reel - to - reel tape recorders . "
fundraising , listening , reputation management , Twitter
I am a casual donor .
I do n’t donate regularly to the same causes , but try to spread my limited funds around .
When I received an email today from charity : water with the heading “ See the First Twestival Well Drilled , ” I became more than a casual donor .
Charity : water sent me a personal invitation to ask questions about how the Twestival funds are being allocated , view the drilling for new wells in Africa via daily videos , follow the drilling via Twitter updates , and hear answers to the most popular questions on April 13th .
Now that is stakeholder engagement .
When was the last time you were asked to by a charity to engage in conversation ?
I was one of the organizers of the February 12th Jerusalem Twestival , a gathering of local Twitter fans to raise funds for charity : water .
At the time I proposed the idea , I thought it would be a great way to meet more people and help Jerusalemites give to another part of the globe .
Like most stakeholders and donors , I assumed that my money would be used towards the stated purpose ( drill wells in Africa near villages without access to potable water ) , but I did n’t know much else .
What did I expect from my one - time donation ?
My excuse to throw a party and meet others at a fundraiser ?
Not much , honestly .
I expected a thank - you note of some sort .
I expected to be solicited for further donations .
I certainly expected a year - end update .
But I never expected to be involved .
Here are the opportunities I now have to get involved :
As charity : water goes from village to village drilling wells , I can watch four daily short videos of the drilling .
I can follow the drilling updates via a twitter stream update
I can ask questions of the local drilling team during the five days of drilling , via email or twitter
The local charity : water drill team will answer the top five questions on video April 13th
Brilliant .
What has charity : water done ?
Involved me in the funds disbursement .
Offered transparency .
Made me part of the success story .
The recent Community Philanthropy 2.0 survey of social media power users by Mashable indicates that donors want to be involved .
According to Mashable ,
These online donors aged 30 - 49 want conversation about the following :
• 80 % organizational impact
• 74 % success stories
• 71 % learning more about the organizations they are participating with
• 70 % want information on causes they care about
• 43 % want information on financial accountability
Furthermore , donors aged 50 and above want the same sort of information , but prioritized differently .
According to Mashable , “ verifying this opportunity for content sources , 71 percent of 30 - 49 - year - olds directly looked to the charity they support for information , and 63 percent trust referrals from friends .
In comparison , 78 percent of those 50 and older directly look to their charities and 72 percent trust friends . ”
Charity : water is giving its donors exactly what they want : success stories , videos of the impact of donations , and information about financial accountability .
The study also shows that these same donors are already chatting online about philanthropy .
Charity : water has is taking advantage of this trend ( see chart below ) .
Their twestival page offers simple button press options to “ tweet about the facts ” and “ tweet about the live drill . ”
Charity : water understands its Twestival donors are actively involved in social networks ( many become involved through Twitter ) , understands online giving , and understands donor engagement .
From this one email Twestival update , I ’m engaged and excited to talk about charity : water in my online networks and …guess what ?
Give again .

i Visit , a audio and video conferencing company , is showing off an interesting technology using mobile phones that act as virtual eyes to help visually challenged users .
The technology called SeeScan allows users to point their cellphones at an object and have it identified in real - time .
For instance users can point a phone at a at a can of Coke or a pack of frosted flakes or a bottle of shampoo and have the name of it read loud to them near - instantaneously .
The concept known as augmented reality , or a field that blends real world and computer generated data , is something companies are increasingly focusing on .
SeeScan though works only with packaged goods including currency but what 's interesting to see is how iVisit has been able to make real - time object recognition work with a mobile processor .
There are approximately 11.4 million people with vision loss in the United States , ten percent of who are legally blind , says iVisit .
The company claims it has tested the prototype with about 30 visually impaired users .
i Visit plans to release beta versions of the service in the U.S. later this year .
The company says it will be available on major 3G networks and Windows Mobile phones including HTC 6800 ( Mogul ) , HTC Flip , HTC Touch , HTC 6700 , Samsung i760 , Treo 700 Wx and LG Dominator .
iVisit says it is working on Symbian and iPhone versions .

Spoiler Alert Near the end of last Friday 's finale of Battlestar Galactica , two of the characters most responsible for touching off the genocidal campaign that nearly wiped out civilization - or their " angels , " if you believe in that kind of thing - reflect on the events taking hold on Earth , the planet called home since taking refuge there 150,000 years earlier .
" Commercialism , decadence , technology run amok , " the reincarnation of a particularly diabolical version of the Number Six Cylon model observes to her Gaius Baltar counterpart as the pair strolls through a city populated by poverty , portable music players , and , yes , robots .
" Remind you of anything ? "
Of course , the vices look just like all the other times the human race has allowed its hunger for convenience and comfort to blind its better judgment .
After all , this is a show with the refrain " All this has happened before , and all this will happen again . "
As the credits begin to roll , the last images are those of a Sony Dream Robot dancing to the beat of Jimi Hendrix performing " All Along the Watchtower . "
In so doing , the sci - fi thriller that for more than six years has riveted millions of viewers around the world concluded the saga much as it began .
Back then , as portrayed in a miniseries that first aired in 2003 , the Cylon war was believed to be over .
A badly aging Galactica was about to be decommissioned .
If the ship was worth saving at all , it was for the entertainment value it delivered to a people who had yet to learn history 's most pertinent lessons .
" You 'll see things here that look odd or even antiquated to modern eyes , " a tour guide says as he points out the battlestar 's brick - sized phones , " computers that barely deserve the name , " and crude doors with valve latches .
" It was all designed to operate against an enemy who could infiltrate and disrupt even the most basic computer systems , " the guide , whom we later learn is an undercover Cylon , continues .
" Galactica is a reminder of a time when we were so frightened by our enemies that we literally looked backward for protection . "
One of the things that made the story so captivating was its sense of timelessness and a never - ending series of contradictions .
The race of robots , which humans created to " make life easier on the colonies , " are so advanced they can only be kept at bay by regressing into a retro reality .
Aboard Galactica , computers are expressly forbidden from being networked .
Radio communications are hopelessly garbled .
The message seems to be that the more things change , the more they stay the same .
No doubt , Battlestar Galactica was so much more than a cautionary tale about unfettered confidence in our technological prowess .
Like Herman Melville 's Moby Dick , the narrative operated on a variety of levels .
Adventure story .
Social commentary .
Religious parable .
Existential treatise on the role of destiny versus free will .
Along the way , it explored the roles of atheism , monotheism , and polytheism in sustaining morale and hoodwinking the masses and asked whether the rule of law was strong enough to prevail over the chaos of the mob , especially one that 's threatened with extinction .
Even as Galactica 's commander , William Adama , committed his life to saving mankind , he asked " Why are we as a people worth saving ? "
It 's a question that 's crucial to answer , since as we learned earlier this season , humans throughout the ages and in galaxies separated by millions of light years have repeatedly manufactured cybernetic organisms , and each time the robots have visited genocidal war on their creators .
The answer comes in people 's ability to take a leap of faith and decide to chart a new course that breaks the cycle .
" We can give them the best part of ourselves , but not the baggage , not the ships , the equipment , the technology , the weapons , " Commander Adama 's son , Lee , says of the new human race they plan spawn .
" If there 's one thing we should have learned , it 's that you know our brains have always outraced our hearts .
Our science charges ahead .
Our souls lag behind .
Let 's start anew . "
EU president declares US economic policy is the “ road to hell ”
By Stefan Steinberg
27 March 2009
One day after being ousted as head of the Czech government Mirek Topolanek , who currently holds the revolving chair of the European Union , openly criticised the financial policy of the US government , telling European parliamentary deputies that America was on the " road to hell " .
Speaking before the European Parliament on Wednesday , Topolanek warned that the massive costs of the stimulus plans and financial bailouts implemented by the US administration led by President Barack Obama would " undermine the stability of the global financial market " .
The EU president then declared that the US government was guilty of protectionism and that the Obama administration risked repeating the errors of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Topolanek 's comments , made in his official capacity as the spokesman for the EU , represent an unprecedented challenge to the US administration and its policies just one week before European leaders are due to meet with Obama to discuss measures to tackle the world economic crisis at the G - 20 summit in London .
Topolanek himself is due to greet the American president when Obama visits the Czech capital of Prague next week for his first NATO summit .
While a handful of EU deputies rushed to criticise Topolanek 's remarks , there can be no doubt that the former Czech prime minister was expressing sentiments shared by many EU deputies and European heads of state who are increasingly alarmed at the aggressive financial policies being employed by the US administration .
Already , at their spring summit at the end of last week , EU leaders agreed to reject the US demand for increased stimulus packages , with some EU officials openly criticising the " bullying " tactics of the American side .
The EU summit was followed by a flurry of diplomatic activity on both sides of the Atlantic , with both the European and US sides intensifying their respective campaigns .
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on March 23 , the head of the European Central Bank , President Jean - Claude Trichet , defended the decision by European states — headed by Germany and France — not to pump more money into their economies in the form of massive stimulus programs .
Employing a phrase that has been repeatedly used by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Trichet declared , " It is not a race ! " over which country introduces the biggest stimulus package .
Trichet pointed out that public - sector spending is already much higher in Europe than in the US and hinted that the EU was worried that too much investment to combat the crisis could weaken fiscal discipline and ultimately revive inflation .
Trichet urged the US side to implement its own plans as soon as possible , while at the same time playing down any divisions with Europe : " What I would recommend for the US is to , now , as efficiently and rapidly as possible , do what has been decided ....
Let 's do it !
Quick implementation , quick disbursement is what is needed .
Not embarking on useless and counterproductive quarrels which fortunately are over now " .
At the same time , however , Trichet made clear that Europe would not follow the same road .
One day after the Trichet interview , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown delivered a speech to the EU parliament in which he called upon European legislators to increase their stimulus spending .
" We can together deliver the biggest fiscal stimulus " , Brown declared .
At the EU spring summit Brown had reluctantly fallen in behind other leading European powers and agreed to the final communiqué , which ruled out new stimulus programs in the near future .
Now , however , Brown is attempting to use the last few days before the G - 20 summit to break down European resistance to the type of massive " quantitative easing " types of spending programs introduced by his own government .
The American president also intervened into the dispute with his own contribution on Tuesday evening .
In a news conference , Obama implicitly criticized those countries that were resisting new stimulus programs .
Obama said , " We do n't want a situation in which some countries are making extraordinary efforts and other countries are n't , with the hope that somehow the countries that are making those important steps lift everybody up " .
Topolanek 's criticisms of the US measures were made on the next day .
While political commentators have sought to play down the significance of his remarks by pointing out that the Czech politician is renowned for his confrontational style , there is broad support in European political circles for his stance .
European leaders are concerned that the massive infusion of money by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks into the world banking system could threaten the EU 's system of strict levels limiting state indebtedness which in turn underpins the stability of the euro .
At the same time , with US borrowing taking up so much of the funds available globally European governments anticipate they will have increasing difficulty providing for their own capital requirements .
In addition European politicians , and especially the German political establishment , are concerned about the potential inflationary consequences of a policy based on printing money .
In this respect , EU countries — with Germany to the fore — have stressed that the upcoming G - 20 summit must above all take effective measures to tighten up international financial regulation .
The issues at stake in the growing dispute between Europe and the US were spelt out in an editorial in the Czech newspaper Hospodářské noviny .
Commenting on last week 's EU spring summit , the paper wrote on March 23 , " The EU decided to not follow Barack Obama 's call , and will pump no further billions into the economy .
Germany and the Czech Republic , which now holds the EU Council presidency , were among the minimalists from day one .
Now the others have also joined them .
The Europeans were not lured by the message of Obama 's economic advisor Larry Summers that every dollar invested by the state will be transformed into a dollar and a half 's worth of economic growth .
Europe 's reticence will help it avoid being caught in a debt trap .
It can not afford such a luxury , because otherwise a number of countries would be threatened with state bankruptcy .
The Old World and the New World are drifting apart in their attitudes to the measures necessary to stimulate the economy .
That does not bode well for the prospect of a common crisis concept from the G - 20 summit in London " .
The latest comments by Mirek Topolanek only serve to ratchet up the tensions between the US and Europe prior to the G - 20 summit .
There is a further important political aspect to the remarks made by the former Czech prime minister .
In the decades following the reintroduction of capitalism in the countries belonging to the former Stalinist Soviet bloc , the US was able to bank on considerable political support and good will from Eastern European states .
At the end of the 20th and at the start of the 21st century the US and its unbridled free - market system was regarded as a role model for Eastern Europe and the Baltic states .
In the course of its war against Iraq , for example , the US could rely on the backing of a number of Eastern European countries .
Former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld even sought to put pressure on Western European nations ( " old Europe " ) by stressing the harmonious relations between the US and so - called " new Europe " , i.e. , the Eastern European countries .
The international financial crisis , however , is redrawing the political map with a layer of politicians in Eastern European countries now openly taking sides with leading Western European nations such as Germany and France against the US .
For their part the latter countries feel that their hand is strengthened when it comes to standing up against Washington .
The growing war of words across the Atlantic reflects imponderable and growing political differences between the US and Europe , which rule out any sort of binding agreement at next week 's G - 20 summit .
In the Part I on Simple sustainable living in the city I was writing about the reasons to make your life greener .
Part II has some simple green ideas to start your sustainable living .
Where to start to make your life more sustainable ?
Sustainable living does n’t mean giving up all the luxuries of the modern era and changing the lifestyle completely .
It ’s rather adapting it to green living .
So , you would like to give a sustainable living a go , but , where to start ?
The most important moment , in my opinion , is the realization , the need to become environmentally aware and willingness to take action , whatever the reason for turning green .
It might be global warming , economic downturn , health or something else .
As the old saying goes :
When the student is ready , the teacher will appear .
Our turning point was becoming parents .
We had the urge to change so many things in a short period .
Then we realized that sustainable living is not something you can do overnight ; it ’s a learning process , a gradual step - by - step approach , it ’s a way of living .
And we are loving it !
If you are new to the idea of sustainable living , start with things you can do easily .
There are numerous green tips that do n’t involve a lot of effort , time or money .
Most of them can be implemented immediately .
Make a few changes at the time to suite your priorities and situation .

I applaud these two letters - to - the - editor appearing in today ’s Wall Street Journal :
In regard to the appearance of French economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez in President Barack Obama ’s budget ( “ The Obama Rosetta Stone , ” by Daniel Henninger , Wonder Land , March 12 ) :
In their use of statistics of the top 1 % of income earners , Messrs .
Piketty and Saez make the same false assumptions that the Internal Revenue Service does .
In 1980 income disparity began to take off in the U.S. leaving the top 1 % of income earners with a greater share of the income pie .
Like the IRS , these French economists use “ household ” income as their measure .
But consider that 1980 was about the time when large percentages of college - educated women began to enter the workforce .
Many of these professional women would go on to marry other professionals .
This in effect created a doubling of “ household ” income for many families .
At the same time out - of - wedlock birth rates and divorce began to skyrocket creating large percentages of single - parent households .
It should be no surprise that a two income household has a much higher income than a single - income household even if all workers make exactly the same income .
Surgeons will always make more than janitors , as anyone who has ever gone “ under the knife ” will agree with , and their income should not be distorted because they are married to a fellow surgeon .
My working wife and I often find ourselves in this 1 % bracket , but if we were to divorce we would never come close .
It ’s ironic that the left decries the income disparity between men and women , but in the instance when women earn equal pay it is used to inflame class warfare .
Steve Walde

President Obama ’s new era of responsibility budget makes it clear that 5 % of the population ( the rich ) must assume more financial responsibility for the other 95 % .
Fair enough , but is there some new responsibility that the other 95 % also must assume ?
If not , that seems somewhat irresponsible .
Efforts to countermand the laws of nature to create a completely fair society mean forcing equality of outcomes , an end result that is n’t fair , healthy or sustainable .
History tells us that this type of class warfare never has a happy ending .

Queen of the USA Oprah gave out coupons to the whole world for a free KFC lunch today .
And guess what :
As we speak , there are Riots and Sit - Ins and Furor at KFC .
BREAKING :
Reports are pouring in from the scene of the melee :
I just returned from my lunch break hoping to use the attached coupon
to score some free KFC grilled chicken at the mid town location 47 E .
42nd Street .
Well I guess around 200 people also had the same idea
with coupons in hand .
When I finally gave up ( after 30 minutes of aguing with other
customers ) a small RIOT started going on outside the store with people
screaming at the manager while he wont let them use their free KFC
coupons ( issued by OPRAH )
Another tipster warns of possible RACIAL VIOLENCE :
I went over to our nearest KFC a few minutes ago ( this was around 42nd and Park ) and chaos ensued .
Despite the very visible grilled chicken behind the register , the manager told everyone with coupons to leave and that the promotion was over for the day .
The people there are currently holding a sit-in and refusing to leave until they get their free chicken ... or the cops are called .
Racial epithets were being spewed , people who actually wanted to pay for chicken were facing a potential beatdown , and the manager ran from the screaming horde .
Oprah , what have ye wrought ?
Great Oprah , just great .
Look what you 've done .
We will continue to cover this breaking potential race riot and / or political uprising , at KFC .
We beg you :
If you are on the scene , send us photos and reports at once .

Alan Watts ( 1915 - 1973 )
Lecture on Zen
by Alan Watts
http://www.deoxy.org/w_lectur.htm
Once upon a time , there was a Zen student who quoted an old Buddhist poem to his teacher , which says :
The voices of torrents are from one great tongue , the lions of the hills are the pure body of Buddha .
' Is n't that right ? ' he said to the teacher .
' It is , ' said the teacher , ' but it 's a pity to say so . '
It would be , of course , much better , if this occasion were celebrated with no talk at all , and if I addressed you in the manner of the ancient teachers of Zen , I should hit the microphone with my fan and leave .
But I somehow have the feeling that since you have contributed to the support of the Zen Center , in expectation of learning something , a few words should be said , even though I warn you , that by explaining these things to you , I shall subject you to a very serious hoax .
Because if I allow you to leave here this evening , under the impression that you understand something about Zen , you will have missed the point entirely .
Because Zen is a way of life , a state of being , that is not possible to embrace in any concept whatsoever , so that any concepts , any ideas , any words that I shall put across to you this evening will have as their object , showing you the limitations of words and of thinking .
Now then , if one must try to say something about what Zen is , and I want to do this by way of introduction , I must make it emphatic that Zen , in its essence , is not a doctrine .
There 's nothing you 're supposed to believe in .
It 's not a philosophy in our sense , that is to say a set of ideas , an intellectual net in which one tries to catch the fish of reality .
Actually , the fish of reality is more like water -- it always slips through the net .
And in water you know when you get into it there 's nothing to hang on to .
All this universe is like water ; it is fluid , it is transient , it is changing .
And when you 're thrown into the water after being accustomed to living on the dry land , you 're not used to the idea of swimming .
You try to stand on the water , you try to catch hold of it , and as a result you drown .
The only way to survive in the water , and this refers particularly to the waters of modern philosophical confusion , where God is dead , metaphysical propositions are meaningless , and there 's really nothing to hang on to , because we 're all just falling apart .
And the only thing to do under those circumstances is to learn how to swim .
And to swim , you relax , you let go , you give yourself to the water , and you have to know how to breathe in the right way .
And then you find that the water holds you up ; indeed , in a certain way you become the water .
And so in the same way , one might say if one attempted to -- again I say misleadingly -- to put Zen into any sort of concept , it simply comes down to this :
That in this universe , there is one great energy , and we have no name for it .
People have tried various names for it , like God , like * Brahmin , like Tao , but in the West , the word God has got so many funny associations attached to it that most of us are bored with it .
When people say ' God , the father almighty , ' most people feel funny inside .
So we like to hear new words , we like to hear about Tao , about Brahmin , about Shinto , and __-__-__ , and such strange names from the far East because they do n't carry the same associations of mawkish sanctimony and funny meanings from the past .
And actually , some of these words that the Buddhists use for the basic energy of the world really do n't mean anything at all .
The word _tathata_ , which is translated from the Sanskrit as ' suchness ' or ' thusness ' or something like that , really means something more like ' dadada , ' based on the word _tat_ , which in Sanskrit means ' that , ' and so in Sanskrit it is said _tat lum asi_ , ' that thou art , ' or in modern America , ' you 're it . '
But ' da , da ' -- that 's the first sound a baby makes when it comes into the world , because the baby looks around and says ' da , da , da , da ' and fathers flatter themselves and think it 's saying ' DaDa , ' which means ' Daddy , ' but according to Buddhist philosophy , all this universe is one ' dadada . '
That means ' ten thousand functions , ten thousand things , one suchness , ' and we 're all one suchness .
And that means that suchess comes and goes like anything else because this whole world is an on - and - off system .
As the Chinese say , it 's the _yang_ and the _yin_ , and therefore it consists of ' now you see it , now you do n't , here you are , here you are n't , here you are , ' because that the nature of energy , to be like waves , and waves have crests and troughs , only we , being under a kind of sleepiness or illusion , imagine that the trough is going to overcome the wave or the crest , the _yin_ , or the dark principle , is going to overcome the _yang_ , or the light principle , and that ' off ' is going to finally triumph over ' on . '
And we , shall I say , bug ourselves by indulging in that illusion .
' Hey , supposing darkness did win out , would n't that be terrible ! '
And so we 're constantly trembling and thinking that it may , because after all , is n't it odd that anything exists ?
It 's most peculiar , it requires effort , it requires energy , and it would have been so much easier for there to have been nothing at all .
Therefore , we think ' well , since being , since the ' is ' side of things is so much effort ' you always give up after a while and you sink back into death .
But death is just the other face of energy , and it 's the rest , the not being anything around , that produces something around , just in the same way that you can't have ' solid ' without ' space , ' or ' space ' without ' solid . '
When you wake up to this , and realize that the more it changes the more it 's the same thing , as the French say , that you are really a train of this one energy , and there is nothing else but that that is you , but that for you to be always you would be an insufferable bore , and therefore it is arranged that you stop being you after a while and then come back as someone else altogether , and so when you find that out , you become full energy and delight .
As Blake said , ' Energy is eternal delight . '
And you suddenly see through the whole sham thing .
You realize you 're That -- we wo n't put a name on it -- you 're That , and you can't be anything else .
So you are relieved of fundamental terror .
That does n't mean tht you 're always going to be a great hero , that you wo n't jump when you hear a bang , that you wo n't worry occasionally , that you wo n't lose your temper .
It means , though , that fundamentally deep , deep , deep down within you , you will be able to be human , not a stone Buddha - - you know in Zen there is a difference made between a living Buddha and a stone Buddha .
If you go up to a stone Buddha and you hit him hard on the head , nothing happens .
You break your fist or your stick .
But if you hit a living Buddha , he may say ' ouch , ' and he may feel pain , because if he did n't feel something , he would n't be a human being .
Buddhas are human , they are not devas , they are not gods .
They are enlightened men and women .
But the point is that they are not afraid to be human , they are not afraid to let themselves participate in the pains , difficulties and struggles that naturally go with human existence .
The only difference is -- and it 's almost an undetectable difference -- it takes one to know one .
As a Zen poem says , ' when two Zen masters meet each other on the street , they need no introduction .
When fiends meet , they recognize one another instantly . '
So a person who is a real cool Zen understands that , does not go around ' Oh , I understand Zen , I have satori , I have this attainment , I have that attainment , I have the other attainment , ' because if he said that , he would n't understand the first thing about it .
So it is Zen that , if I may put it metaphorically , * Jon -Jo said ' the perfect man employs his mind as a mirror .
It grasps nothing , it refuses nothing .
It receives but does not keep . '
And another poem says of wild geese flying over a lake , ' The wild geese do not intend to cast their reflection , and the water has no mind to retain their image . '
In other words this is to be -- to put it very strictly into our modern idiom -- this is to live without hang - ups , the word ' hang - up ' being an almost exact translation of the Japanese _bono_ and the Sanskrit _klesa_ , ordinarily translated ' worldly attachment , ' though that sounds a little bit -- you know what I mean -- it sounds pious , and in Zen , things that sound pious are said to stink of Zen , but to have no hang - ups , that is to say , to be able to drift like a cloud and flow like water , seeing that all life is a magnificent illusion , a plane of energy , and that there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of .
Fundamentally .
You will be afraid on the surface .
You will be afraid of putting your hand in the fire .
You will be afraid of getting sick , etc .
But you will not be afraid of fear .
Fear will pass over your mind like a black cloud will be reflected in the mirror .
But of course , the mirror is n't quite the right illustration ; space would be better .
Like a black cloud flows through space without leaving any track .
Like the stars do n't leave trails behind them .
And so that fundamental -- it is called ' the void ' in Buddhism ; it does n't mean ' void ' in the sense that it 's void in the ordinary sense of emptiness .
It means void in that is the most real thing there is , but nobody can conceive it .
It 's rather the same situation that you get between the speaker , in a radio and all the various sounds which it produces .
On the speaker you hear human voices , you hear every kind of musical instrument , honking of horns , the sounds of traffic , the explosions of guns , and yet all that tremendous variety of sounds are the vibrations of one diaphragm , but it never says so .
The announcer doens't come on first thing in the morning and say ' Ladies and gentlemen , all the sounds that you will hear subsequentally during the day will be the vibration of this diaphragm ; do n't take them for real . '
And the radio never mentions its own construction , you see ?
And in exactly the same way , you are never able , really , to examine , to make an object of your own mind , just as you can't look directly into your own eyes or bite your own teeth , because you ARE that , and if you try to find it , and make it something to possess , why that 's a great lack of confidence .
That shows that you do n't really know your ' it ' .
And if you 're ' it , ' you do n't need to make anything of it .
There 's nothing to look for .
But the test is , are you still looking ?
Do you know that ?
I mean , not as kind of knowledge you possess , not something you 've learned in school like you 've got a degree , and ' you know , I 've mastered the contents of these books and remembered it . '
In this knowledge , there 's nothing to be remembered ; nothing to be formulated .
You know it best when you say ' I do n't know it . '
Because that means , ' I 'm not holding on to it , I 'm not trying to cling to it ' in the form of a concept , because there 's absolutely no necessity to do so .
That would be , in Zen language , putting legs on a snake or a beard on a eunuch , or as we would say , gilding the lily .
Now you say , ' Well , that sounds pretty easy .
You mean to say all we have to do is relax ?
We do n't have to go around chasing anything anymore ?
We abandon religion , we abandon meditations , we abandon this , that , and the other , and just live it up anyhow ?
Just go on . '
You know , like a father says to his child who keeps asking ' Why ?
Why , Why , Why , Why , Why ?
Why did God make the universe ?
Who made God ?
Why are the trees green ? ' and so on and so forth , and father says finally , ' Oh , shut up and eat your bun . '
It is n't quite like that , because , you see , the thing is this :
All those people who try to realize Zen by doing nothing about it are still trying desperately to find it , and they 're on the wrong track .
There is another Zen poem which says , ' You cannot attain it by thinking , you cannot grasp it by not thinking . '
Or you could say , you cannot catch hold of the meaning of Zen by doing something about it , but equally , you cannot see into its meaning by doing nothing about it , because both are , in their different ways , attempts to move from where you are now , here , to somewhere else , and the point is that we come to an understanding of this , what I call suchness , only through being completely here .
And no means are necessary to be completely here .
Neither active means on the one hand , nor passive means on the other .
Because in both ways , you are trying to move away from the immediate now .
But you see , it 's difficult to understand language like that .
And to understand what all that is about , there is really one absolutely necessary prerequisite , and this is to stop thinking .
Now , I am not saying this in the spirit of being an anti-intellectual , because I think a lot , talk a lot , write a lot of books , and am a sort of half - baked scholar .
But you know , if you talk all the time , you will never hear what anybody else has to say , and therefore , all you 'll have to talk about is your own conversation .
The same is true for people who think all the time .
That means , when I use the word ' think , ' talking to yourself , subvocal conversation , the constant chit - chat of symbols and images and talk and words inside your skull .
Now , if you do that all the time , you 'll find that you 've nothing to think about except thinking , and just as you have to stop talking to hear what I have to say , you have to stop thinking to find out what life is about .
And the moment you stop thinking , you come into immediate contact with what Korzybski called , so delightfully , ' the unspeakable world , ' that is to say , the nonverbal world .
Some people would call it the physical world , but these words ' physical , ' ' nonverbal , ' are all conceptual , not a concept either , it 's ( bangs stick ) .
So when you are awake to that world , you suddenly find that all the so - called differences between self and other , life and death , pleasure and pain , are all conceptual , and they 're not there .
They do n't exist at all in that world which is ( bangs stick ) .
In other words , if I hit you hard enough , ' ouch ' does n't hurt , if you 're in a state of what is called no - thought .
There is a certain experience , you see , but you do n't call it ' hurt . '
It 's like when you were small children , they banged you about , and you cried , and they said ' Do n't cry ' because they wanted to make you hurt and not cry at the same time .
People are rather curious about the things the do like that .
But you see , they really wanted you to cry , the same way if you threw up one day .
It 's very good to throw up if you 've eaten soemthing that is n't good for you , but your mother said ' Eugh ! ' and made you repress it and feel that throwing up was n't a good thing to do .
Because then when you saw people die , and everybody around you started weeping and making a fuss , and then you learned from that that dying was terrible .
When somebody got sick , everybody else got anxious , and you learned that getting sick was something awful .
You learned it from a concept .
So the reason why there is in the practice of Zen , what we did before this lecture began , to practice Za-zen , sitting Zen .
Incidentally , there are three other kinds of Zen besides Za-zen .
Standing Zen , walking Zen , and lying Zen .
In Buddhism , they speak of hte three dignities of man .
Walking , standing , sitting , and lying .
And they say when you sit , just sit .
When you walk , just walk .
But whatever you do , do n't wobble .
In fact , of course , you can wobble , if you really wobble well .
When the old master * Hiakajo was asked ' What is Zen ? ' he said ' When hungry , eat , when tired , sleep , ' and they said , ' Well is n't that what everybody does ?
Are n't you just like ordinary people ? '
' Oh no , ' he said , ' they do n't do anything of the kind .
When they 're hungry , they do n't just eat , they think of all sorts of things .
When they 're tired , they do n't just sleep , but dream all sorts of dreams . '
I know the Jungians wo n't like that , but there comes a time when you just dream yourself out , and no more dreams .
You sleep deeply and breathe from your heels .
Now , therefore , Za-zen , or sitting Zen , is a very , very good thing in the Western world .
We have been running around far too much .
It 's all right ; we 've been active , and our action has achieved a lot of good things .
But as Aristotle pointed out long ago -- and this is one of the good things about Aristotle .
He said ' the goal of action is contemplation . '
In other words , busy , busy , busy , busy , busy , but what 's it all about ?
Especially when people are busy because they think they 're GOING somewhere , that they 're going to get something and attain something .
There 's quite a good deal of point to action if you know you 're not going anywhere .
If you act like you dance , or like you sing or play music , then you 're really not going anywhere , you 're just doing pure action , but if you act with a thought in mind that as a result of action you are eventually going to arrive at someplace where everything will be alright .
Then you are on a squirrel cage , hopelessly condemned to what the Buddhists call _samsara_ , the round , or rat -race of birth and death , because you think you 're going to go somewhere .
You 're already there .
And it is only a person who has discovered that he is already there who is capable of action , because he does n't act frantically with the thought that he 's going to get somewhere .
He acts like he can go into walking meditation at that point , you see , where we walk not because we are in a great , great hurry to get to a destination , but because the walking itself is great .
The walking itself is the meditation .
And when you watch Zen monks walk , it 's very fascinating .
They have a different kind of walk from everybody else in Japan .
Most Japanese shuffle along , or if they wear Western clothes , they race and hurry like we do .
Zen monks have a peculiar swing when they walk , and you have the feeling they walk rather the same way as a cat .
There 's something about it that is n't hesitant ; they 're going along all right , they 're not sort of vagueing around , but they 're walking just to walk .
And that 's walking meditation .
But the point is that one cannot act creatively , except on the basis of stillness .
Of having a mind that is capable from time to time of stopping thinking .
And so this practice of sitting may seem very difficult at first , because if you sit in the Buddhist way , it makes your legs ache .
Most Westerners start to fidget ; they find it very boring to sit for a long time , but the reason they find it boring is that they 're still thinking .
If you were n't thinking , you would n't notice the passage of time , and as a matter of fact , far from being boring , the world when looked at without chatter becomes amazingly interesting .
The most ordinary sights and sounds and smells , the texture of shadows on the floor in front of you .
All these things , without being named , and saying ' that 's a shadow , that 's red , that 's brown , that 's somebody 's foot . '
When you do n't name things anymore , you start seeing them .
Because say when a person says ' I see a leaf , ' immediately , one thinks of a spearhead - shaped thing outlined in black and filled in with flat green .
No leaf looks like that .
No leaves - - leaves are not green .
That 's why Lao - Tzu said ' the five colors make a man blind , the five tones make a man deaf , ' because if you can only see five colors , you 're blind , and if you can only hear five tones in music , you 're deaf .
You see , if you force sound into five tones , you force color into five colors , you 're blind and deaf .
The world of color is infinite , as is the world of sound .
And it is only by stopping fixing conceptions on the world of color and the world of sound that you really begin to hear it and see it .
So this , should I be so bold as to use the word ' discipline , ' of meditation or Za-zen lies behind the extraordinary capacity of Zen people to develop such great arts as the gardens , the tea ceremony , the caligraphy , and the grand painting of the Sum Dynasty , and of the Japanese Sumi tradition .
And it was because , especially in tea ceremony , which means literally ' cha - no - yu ' in Japanese , meaning ' hot water of tea , ' they found in the very simplest of things in everyday life , magic .
In the words of the poet * Hokoji , ' marvelous power and supernatural activity , drawing water , carrying wood . '
And you know how it is sometimes when you say a word and make the word meaningless , you take the word ' yes ' -- yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes .
It becomes funny .
That 's why they use the word ' mu ' in Zen training , which means ' no . '
Mu .
And you get this going for a long time , and the word ceases to mean anything , and it becomes magical .
Now , what you have to realize in the further continuence of Za-zen , that as you --
Well , let me say first in a preliminary way , the easiest way to stop thinking is first of all to think about something that does n't have any meaning .
That 's my point in talking about ' mu ' or ' yes , ' or counting your breath , or listening to a sound that has no meaning , because that stops you thinking , and you become fascinated in the sound .
Then as you get on and you just -- the sound only -- there comes a point when the sound is taken away , and you 're wide open .
Now at that point , there will be a kind of preliminary so - called satori , and you will think ' wowee , that 's it !'
You 'll be so happy , you 'll be walking on air .
When Suzuki Daisetz was asked what was it like to have satori , he said ' well , it 's like ordinary , everyday experience , except about two inches off the ground . '
But there 's another saying that the student who has obtained satori goes to hell as straight as an arrow .
No satori around here , because anybody who has a spiritual experience , whether you get it through Za-zen , or through LSD , or anything , you know , that gives you that experience .
If you hold on to it , say ' now I 've got it , ' it 's gone out of the window , because the minute you grab the living thing , it 's like catching a handful of water , the harder you clutch , the faster it squirts through your fingers .
There 's nothing to get hold of , because you do n't NEED to get hold of anything .
You had it from the beginning .
Because you can see that , by various methods of meditation , but the trouble is that people come out of that an brag about it , say ' I 've seen it . '
Equally intolerable are the people who study Zen and come out and brag to their friends about how much their legs hurt , and how long they sat , and what an awful thing it was .
They 're sickening .
Because the discipline side of this thing is not meant to be something awful .
It 's not done in a masochistic spirit , or a sadistic spirit : suffering builds character , therefore suffering is good for you .
When I went to school in England , the basic premise of education was that suffering builds character , and therefore all senior boys were at liberty to bang about the junior ones with a perfectly clear conscience , because they were doing them a favor .
It was good for them , it was building their character , and as a result of this attitude , the word ' discipline ' has begun to stink .
It 's been stinking for a long time .
But we need a kind of entirely new attitude towards this , because without that quiet , and that non- striving , a life becomes messy .
When you let go , finally , because there 's nothing to hold onto , you have to be awfully careful not to turn into loose yogurt .
Let me give two opposite illustrations .
When you ask most people to lie flat on the floor and relax , you find that they are at full attention , because they do n't really believe that the floor will hold them up , and therefore they 're holding themselves together ; they 're uptight .
They 're afraid that if they do n't do this , even though the floor is supporting them , they 'll suddenly turn into a gelatinous mass and trickle away in all directions .
Then there are other people who when you tell them to relax , they go like a limp rag .
But you see , the human organism is a subtle combination of hardness and softness .
Of flesh and bones .
And the side of Zen which has to do with neither doing nor not doing , but knowing that you are It anyway , and you do n't have to seek it , that 's Zen - flesh .
But the side in which you can come back into the world , with this attitude of not seeking , and knowing you 're It , and not fall apart -- that requires bones .
And one of the most difficult things -- this belongs to of course a generation we all know about that was running about some time ago -- where they caught on to Zen , and they started anything - goes painting , they started anything - goes sculpture , they started anything - goes way of life .
Now I think we 're recovering from that today .
At any rate , our painters are beginning once again to return to glory , to marvelous articulateness and vivid color .
There 's been nothing like it since the stained glass at Chartre ( sp ) .
That 's a good sign .
But it requires that there be in our daily use of freedom , and I 'm not just talking about political freedom .
I 'm talking about the freedom which comes when you know that you 're It , forever and ever and ever .
And it 'll be so nice when you die , because that 'll be a change , but it 'll come back some other way .
When you know that , and you 've seen through the whole mirage , then watch out , because there may still be in you some seeds of hostility , some seeds of pride , some seeds of wanting to put down other people , or wanting to just defy the normal arrangements of life .
So that is why , in the order of a Zen monastary , various duties are assigned .
The novices have the light duties , and the more senior you get , the heavy duties .
For example , the Roshi very often is the one who cleans out the _benjo_ , the toilet .
And everything is kept in order .
There is a kind of beautiful , almost princely aestheticism , because by reason of that order being kept all of the time , the vast free energy which is contained in the system does n't run amok .
The understanding of Zen , the understanding of awakening , the understanding of -- Well , we 'll call it mystical experiences , one of the most dangerous things in the world .
And for a person who cannot contain it , it 's like putting a million volts through your electric shaver .
You blow your mind and it stays blown .
Now , if you go off in that way , that is what would be called in Buddhism a pratyeka- buddha - -' private buddha ' .
He is one who goes off into the transcendental world and is never seen again .
And he 's made a mistake from the standpoint of Buddhism , because from the standpoint of Buddhism , there is no fundamental difference between the transcendental world and this everyday world .
The _bodhisattva_ , you see , who does n't go off into a nirvana and stay there forever and ever , but comes back and lives ordinary everyday life to help other beings to see through it , too , he does n't come back because he feels he has some sort of solemn duty to help mankind and all that kind of pious cant .
He comes back because he sees the two worlds are the same .
He sees all other beings as buddhas .
He sees them , to use a phrase of G.K. Chesterton's , ' but now a great thing in the street , seems any human nod , where move in strange democracies the million masks of god . '
And it 's fantastic to look at people and see that they really , deep down , are enlightened .
They 're It .
They 're faces of the divine .
And they look at you , and they say 'oh no , but I 'm not divine .
I 'm just ordinary little me . '
You look at them in a funny way , and here you see the buddha nature looking out of their eyes , straight at you , and saying it 's not , and saying it quite sincerely .
And that 's why , when you get up against a great guru , the Zen master , or whatever , he has a funny look in his eyes .
When you say ' I have a problem , guru .
I 'm really mixed up , I do n't understand , ' he looks at you in this queer way , and you think 'oh dear me , he 's reading my most secret thoughts .
He 's seeing all the awful things I am , all my cowardice , all my shortcomings . '
He is n't doing anything of the kind ; he is n't even interested in such things .
He 's looking at , if I may use Hindu terminology , he 's looking at Shiva , in you , saying ' my god , Shiva , wo n't you come off it ? '
So then , you see , the _bodhisattva_ , who is -- I 'm assuming quite a knowledge of Buddhism in this assembly -- but the _bodhisattva_ as distinct from the pratyeka - buddha , bodhisattva does n't go off into nirvana , he does n't go off into permanant withdrawn ecstasy , he does n't go off into a kind of catatonic _samadhi_ .
That 's all right .
There are people who can do that ; that 's their vocation .
That 's their specialty , just as a long thing is the long body of buddha , and a short thing is the short body of buddha .
But if you really understand that Zen , that buddhist idea of enlightenment is not comprehended in the idea of the transcendental , neither is it comprehended in the idea of the ordinary .
Not in terms with the infinite , not in terms with the finite .
Not in terms of the eternal , not in terms of the temporal , because they 're all concepts .
So , let me say again , I am not talking about the ordering of ordinary everyday life in a reasonable and methodical way as being schoolteacherish , and saying ' if you were NICE people , that 's what you would do . '
For heaven 's sake , do n't be nice people .
But the thing is , that unless you do have that basic framework of a certain kind of order , and a certain kind of discipline , the force of liberation will blow the world to pieces .
It 's too strong a current for the wire .
So then , it 's terribly important to see beyond ecstasy .
Ecstasy here is the soft and lovable flesh , huggable and kissable , and that 's very good .
But beyond ecstasy are bones , what we call hard facts .
Hard facts of everyday life , and incidentally , we should n't forget to mention the soft facts ; there are many of them .
But then the hard fact , it is what we mean , the world as seen in an ordinary , everyday state of consciousness .
To find out that that is really no different from the world of supreme ecstasy , well , it 's rather like this :
Let 's suppose , as so often happens , you think of ecstasy as insight , as seeing light .
There 's a Zen poem which says
A sudden crash of thunder .
The mind doors burst open ,
and there sits the ordinary old man .
See ?
There 's a sudden vision .
Satori !
Breaking !
Wowee !
And the doors of the mind are blown apart , and there sits the ordinary old man .
It 's just little you , you know ?
Lightning flashes , sparks shower .
In one blink of your eyes , you 've missed seeing .
Why ?
Because here is the light .
The light , the light , the light , every mystic in the world has ' seen the light . '
That brilliant , blazing energy , brighter than a thousand suns , it is locked up in everything .
Now imagine this .
Imagine you 're seeing it .
Like you see aureoles around buddhas .
Like you see the beatific vision at the end of Dante 's ' Paradiso . '
Vivid , vivid light , so bright that it is like the clear light of the void in the Tibetan Book of the Dead .
It 's beyond light , it 's so bright .
And you watch it receeding from you .
And on the edges , like a great star , there becomes a rim of red .
And beyond that , a rim of orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet .
You see this great mandela appearing this great sun , and beyond the violet , there 's black .
Black , like obsidian , not flat black , but transparent black , like lacquer .
And again , blazing out of the black , as the _yang_ comes from the _yin_ , more light .
Going , going , going .
And along with this light , there comes sound .
There is a sound so tremendous with the white light that you can't hear it , so piercing that it seems to annihilate the ears .
But then along with the colors , the sound goes down the scale in harmonic intervals , down , down , down , down , until it gets to a deep thundering base which is so vibrant that it turns into something solid , and you begin to get the similar spectrum of textures .
Now all this time , you 've been watching a kind of thing radiating out .
' But , ' it says , ' you know , this is n't all I can do , ' and the rays start dancing like this , and the sound starts waving , too , as it comes out , and the textures start varying themselves , and they say , well , you 've been looking at this this as I 've been describing it so far in a flat dimension .
Let 's add a third dimension ; it 's going to come right at you now .
And meanwhile , it says , we 're not going to just do like this , we 're going to do little curlicues .
And it says , ' well , that 's just the beginning !'
Making squares and turns , and then suddenly you see in all the little details that become so intense , that all kinds of little subfigures are contained in what you originally thought were the main figures , and the sound starts going all different , amazing complexities if sound all over the place , and this thing 's going , going , going , and you think you 're going to go out of your mind , when suddenly it turns into ...
Why , us , sitting around here .
Thank you very much .

The Nature of Consciousness
by Alan Watts
http://www.deoxy.org/w_nature.htm
I find it a little difficult to say what the subject matter of this seminar is going to be , because it 's too fundamental to give it a title .
I 'm going to talk about what there is .
Now , the first thing , though , that we have to do is to get our perspectives with some background about the basic ideas that , as Westerners living today in the United States , influence our everyday common sense , our fundamental notions about what life is about .
And there are historical origins for this , which influence us more strongly than most people realize .
Ideas of the world which are built into the very nature of the language we use , and of our ideas of logic , and of what makes sense altogether .
And these basic ideas I call myth , not using the word ' myth ' to mean simply something untrue , but to use the word ' myth ' in a more powerful sense .
A myth is an image in terms of which we try to make sense of the world .
Now , for example , a myth in a way is a metaphore .
If you want to explain electricity to someone who does n't know anything about electricity , you say , well , you talk about an electric current .
Now , the word ' current ' is borrowed from rivers .
It 's borrowed from hydrolics , and so you explain electricity in terms of water .
Now , electricity is not water , it behaves actually in a different way , but there are some ways in which the behavior of water is like the behavior of electricty , and so you explain it in terms of water .
Or if you 're an astronomer , and you want to explain to people what you mean by an expanding universe and curved space , you say , ' well , it 's as if you have a black balloon , and there are white dots on the black balloon , and those dots represent galaxies , and as you blow the balloon up , uniformly all of them grow farther and farther apart .
But you 're using an analogy -- the universe is not actually a black balloon with white dots on it .
So in the same way , we use these sort of images to try and make sense of the world , and we at present are living under the influence of two very powerful images , which are , in the present state of scientific knowledge , inadequate , and one of the major problems today are to find an adequate , satisfying image of the world .
Well that 's what I 'm going to talk about .
And I 'm going to go further than that , not only what image of the world to have , but how we can get our sensations and our feelings in accordance with the most sensible image of the world that we can manage to conceive .
All right , now -- the two images which we have been working under for 2000 years and maybe more are what I would call two models of the universe , and the first is called the ceramic model , and the second the fully automatic model .
The ceramic model of the universe is based on the book of Genesis , from which Judaism , Islam , and Christianity derive their basic picture of the world .
And the image of the world in the book of Genesis is that the world is an artifact .
It is made , as a potter takes clay and forms pots out of it , or as a carpenter takes wood and makes tables and chairs out of it .
Do n't forget Jesus is the son of a carpenter .
And also the son of God .
So the image of God and of the world is based on the idea of God as a technician , potter , carpenter , architect , who has in mind a plan , and who fashions the universe in accordance with that plan .
So basic to this image of the world is the notion , you see , that the world consists of stuff , basically .
Primoridial matter , substance , stuff .
As parts are made of clay .
Now clay by itself has no intelligence .
Clay does not of itself become a pot , although a good potter may think otherwise .
Because if you were a really good potter , you do n't impose your will on the clay , you ask any given lump of clay what it wants to become , and you help it to do that .
And then you become a genious .
But the ordinary idea I 'm talking about is that simply clay is unintelligent ; it 's just stuff , and the potter imposes his will on it , and makes it become whatever he wants .
And so in the book of Genesis , the lord God creates Adam out of the dust of the Earth .
In other words , he makes a clay figurine , and then he breathes into it , and it becomes alive .
And because the clay become informed .
By itself it is formless , it has no intelligence , and therefore it requires an external intelligence and an external energy to bring it to life and to bring some sense to it .
And so in this way , we inherit a conception of ourselves as being artifacts , as being made , and it is perfectly natural in our culture for a child to ask its mother ' How was I made ? ' or ' Who made me ? '
And this is a very , very powerful idea , but for example , it is not shared by the Chinese , or by the Hindus .
A Chinese child would not ask its mother ' How was I made ? '
A Chinese child might ask its mother ' How did I grow ? ' which is an entirely different procedure form making .
You see , when you make something , you put it together , you arrange parts , or you work from the outside in , as a sculpture works on stone , or as a potter works on clay .
But when you watch something growing , it works in exactly the opposite direction .
It works from the inside to the outside .
It expands .
It burgeons .
It blossoms .
And it happens all of itself at once .
In other words , the original simple form , say of a living cell in the womb , progressively complicates itself , and that 's the growing process , and it 's quite different from the making process .
But we have thought , historically , you see , of the world as something made , and the idea of being -- trees , for example -- constructions , just as tables and houses are constructions .
And so there is for that reason a fundamental difference between the made and the maker .
And this image , this ceramic model of the universe , originated in cultures where the form of government was monarchial , and where , therefore , the maker of the universe was conceived also at the same time in the image of the king of the universe .
' King of kings , lords of lords , the only ruler of princes , who thus from thy throne behold all dwellers upon Earth . '
I 'm quoting the Book of Common Prayer .
And so , all those people who are oriented to the universe in that way feel related to basic reality as a subject to a king .
And so they are on very , very humble terms in relation to whatever it is that works all this thing .
I find it odd , in the United States , that people who are citizens of a republic have a monarchial theory of the universe .
That you can talk about the president of the United States as LBJ , or Ike , or Harry , but you can't talk about the lord of the universe in such familiar terms .
Because we are carrying over from very ancient near - Eastern cultures , the notion that the lord of the universe must be respected in a certain way .
Poeple kneel , people bow , people prostrate themselves , and you know what the reason for that is : that nobody is more frightened of anybody else than a tyrant .
He sits with his back to the wall , and his guards on either side of him , and he has you face downwards on the ground because you can't use weapons that way .
When you come into his presence , you do n't stand up and face him , because you might attack , and he has reason to fear that you might because he 's ruling you all .
And the man who rules you all is the biggest crook in the bunch .
Because he 's the one who succeeded in crime .
The other people are pushed aside because they -- the criminals , the people we lock up in jail -- are simply the people who did n't make it .
So naturally , the real boss sits with his back to the wall and his henchmen on either side of him .
And so when you design a church , what does it look like ?
Catholic church , with the alter where it used to be -- it 's changing now , because the Catholic religion is changing .
But the Catholic church has the alter with it 's back to the wall at the east end of the church .
And the alter is the throne and the priest is the chief vizier of the court , and he is making abeyance to the throne , but there is the throne of God , the alter .
And all the people are facing it , and kneeling down .
And a great Catholic cathederal is called a basilica , from the Greek ' basilikos , ' which means ' king . '
So a basilica is the house of a king , and the ritual of the church is based on the court rituals of Byzantium .
A Protestant church is a little different .
Basically the same .
The furniture of a Protestant church is based on a judicial courthouse .
The pulpit , the judge in an American court wears a black robe , he wears exactly the same dress as a Protestant minister .
And everybody sits in these boxes , there 's a box for the jury , there 's a box for the judge , there 's a box for this , there 's a box for that , and those are the pews in an ordinary colonial - type Protestant church .
So both these kinds of churches which have an autocratic view of the nature of the universe decorate themselves , are architecturally constructed in accordance with politcal images of the universe .
One is the king , and the other is the judge .
Your honor .
There 's sense in this .
When in court , you have to refer to the judge as ' your honor . '
It stops the people engaged in litigation from losing their tempers and getting rude .
There 's a certain sense to that .
But when you want to apply that image to the universe itself , to the very nature of life , it has limitations .
For one thing , the idea of a difference between matter and spirit .
This idea does n't work anymore .
Long , long ago , physicists stopped asking the question ' What is matter ? '
They began that way .
They wanted to know , what is the fundamental substance of the world ?
And the more they asked that question , the more they realized the could n't answer it , because if you 're going to say what matter is , you 've got to describe it in terms of behavior , that is to say in terms of form , in terms of pattern .
You tell what it does , you describe the smallest shapes of it which you can see .
Do you see what happens ?
You look , say , at a piece of stone , and you want to say , ' Well , what is this piece of stone made of ? '
You take your microscope and you look at it , and instead of just this block of stuff , you see ever so many tinier shapes .
Little crystals .
So you say , ' Fine , so far so good .
Now what are these crystals made of ? '
And you take a more powerful instrument , and you find that they 're made of molocules , and then you take a still more powerful instrument to find out what the molocules are made of , and you begin to describe atoms , electrons , protons , mesons , all sorts of sub - nuclear particles .
But you never , never arrive at the basic stuff .
Because there is n't any .
What happens is this : ' Stuff ' is a word for the world as it looks when our eyes are out of focus .
Fuzzy .
Stuff -- the idea of stuff is that it is undifferentiated , like some kind of goo .
And when your eyes are not in sharp focus , everything looks fuzzy .
When you get your eyes into focus , you see a form , you see a pattern .
But when you want to change the level of magnification , and go in closer and closer and closer , you get fuzzy again before you get clear .
So everytime you get fuzzy , you go through thinking there 's some kind of stuff there .
But when you get clear , you see a shape .
So all that we can talk about is patterns .
We never , never can talk about the ' stuff ' of which these patterns are supposed to be made , because you do n't really have to suppose that there is any .
It 's enough to talk about the world in terms of patterns .
It describes anything that can be described , and you do n't really have to suppose that there is some stuff that constitutes the essence of the pattern in the same way that clay constitutes the essence of pots .
And so for this reason , you do n't really have to suppose that the world is some kind of helpless , passive , unintelligent junk which an outside agency has to inform and make into intelligent shapes .
So the picture of the world in the most sophisticated physics of today is not formed stuff -- potted clay -- but pattern .
A self - moving , self - designing pattern .
A dance .
And our common sense as individuals has n't yet caught up with this .
Well now , in the course of time , in the evolution of Western thought .
The ceramic image of the world ran into trouble .
And changed into what I call the fully automatic image of the world .
In other words , Western science was based on the idea that there are laws of nature , and got that idea from Judaism and Christianity and Islam .
That in other words , the potter , the maker of the world in the beginning of things laid down the laws , and the law of God , which is also the law of nature , is called the ' loggos . ? , .'
And in Christianity , the loggos is the second person of the trinity , incarnate as Jesus Christ , who thereby is the perfect exemplar of the divine law .
So we have tended to think of all natural phenomena as responding to laws , as if , in other words , the laws of the world were like the rails on which a streetcar or a tram or a train runs , and these things exist in a certain way , and all events respond to these laws .
You know that limerick ,
There was a young man who said ' Damn , For it certainly seems that I am A creature that moves In determinate grooves .
I 'm not even a bus , I 'm a tram . '
So here 's this idea that there 's kind of a plan , and everything responds and obeys that plan .
Well , in the 18th century , Western intellectuals began to suspect this idea .
And what they suspected was whether there is a lawmaker , whether there is an architect of the universe , and they found out , or they reasoned , that you do n't have to suppose that there is .
Why ?
Because the hypothesis of God does not help us to make any predictions .
Nor does it --
In other words , let 's put it this way : if the business of science is to make predictions about what 's going to happen , science is essentially prophecy .
What 's going to happen ?
By examining the behavior of the past and describing it carefully , we can make predictions about what 's going to happen in the future .
That 's really the whole of science .
And to do this , and to make successful predictions , you do not need God as a hypothesis .
Because it makes no difference to anything .
If you say ' Everything is controlled by God , everything is governed by God , ' that does n't make any difference to your prediction of what 's going to happen .
And so what they did was drop that hypothesis .
But they kept the hypothesis of law .
Because if you can predict , if you can study the past and describe how things have behaved , and you 've got some regularities in the behavior of the universe , you call that law .
Although it may not be law in the ordinary sense of the word , it 's simply regularity .
And so what they did was got rid of the lawmaker and kept the law .
And so the conceived the universe in terms of a mechanism .
Something , in other words , that is functioning according to regular , clocklike mechanical principles .
Newton 's whole image of the world is based on billiards .
The atoms are billiard balls , and they bang each other around .
And so your behavior , every individual around , is defined as a very , very complex arrangement of billiard balls being banged around by everything else .
And so behind the fully automatic model of the universe is the notion that reality itself is , to use the favorite term of 19th century scientists , blind energy .
In say the metaphysics of Ernst Hegel , and T.H.
Huxley , the world is basically nothing but energy -- blind , unintelligent force .
And likewise and parallel to this , in the philosophy of Freud , the basic psychological energy is libido , which is blind lust .
And it is only a fluke , it is only as a result of pure chances that resulting from the exuberance of this energy there are people .
With values , with reason , with languages , with cultures , and with love .
Just a fluke .
Like , you know , 1000 monkeys typing on 1000 typewriters for a million years will eventually type the Encyclopedia Britannica .
And of course the moment they stop typing the Encyclopedia Britannica , they will relapse into nonsense .
And so in order that that shall not happen , for you and I are flukes in this cosmos , and we like our way of life -- we like being human -- if we want to keep it , say these people , we 've got to fight nature , because it will turn us back into nonsense the moment we let it .
So we 've got to impose our will upon this world as if we were something completely alien to it .
From outside .
And so we get a culture based on the idea of the war between man and nature .
And we talk about the conquest of space .
The conquest of Everest .
And the great symbols of our culture are the rocket and the bulldozer .
The rocket -- you know , compensation for the sexually inadequate male .
So we 're going to conquer space .
You know we 're in space already , way out .
If anybody cared to be sensitive and let outside space come to you , you can , if your eyes are clear enough .
Aided by telescopes , aided by radio astronomy , aided by all the kinds of sensitive instruments we can devise .
We 're as far out in space as we 're ever going to get .
But , y'know , sensitivity is n't the pitch .
Especially in the WASP culture of the United States .
We define manliness in terms of agression , you see , because we 're a little bit frightened as to whether or not we 're really men .
And so we put on this great show of being a tough guy .
It 's completely unneccesary .
If you have what it takes , you do n't need to put on that show .
And you do n't need to beat nature into submission .
Why be hostile to nature ?
Because after all , you ARE a symptom of nature .
You , as a human being , you grow out of this physical universe in exactly the same way an apple grows off an apple tree .
So let 's say the tree which grows apples is a tree which apples , using ' apple ' as a verb .
And a world in which human beings arrive is a world that peoples .
And so the existence of people is symptomatic of the kind of universe we live in .
Just as spots on somebody 's skin is symptomatic of chicken pox .
Just as hair on a head is symptomatic of what 's going on in the organism .
But we have been brought up by reason of our two great myths -- the ceramic and the automatic -- not to feel that we belong in the world .
So our popular speech reflects it .
You say ' I came into this world . '
You did n't .
You came out of it .
You say ' Face facts . '
We talk about ' encounters ' with reality , as if it was a head - on meeting of completely alien agencies .
And the average person has the sensation that he is a someone that exists inside a bag of skin .
The center of consciousness that looks out at this thing , and what the hell 's it going to do to me ?
You see ?
' I recognize you , you kind of look like me , and I 've seen myself in a mirror , and you look like you might be people . '
So maybe you 're intelligent and maybe you can love , too .
Perhaps you 're all right , some of you are , anyway .
You 've got the right color of skin , or you have the right religion , or whatever it is , you 're OK .
But there are all those people over in Asia , and Africa , and they may not really be people .
When you want to destroy someone , you always define them as ' unpeople . '
Not really human .
Monkeys , maybe .
Idiots , maybe .
Machines , maybe , but not people .
So we have this hostility to the external world because of the superstition , the myth , the absolutely unfounded theory that you , yourself , exist only inside your skin .
Now I want to propose another idea altogether .
There are two great theories in astronomy going on right now about the origination of the universe .
One is called the explosion theory , and the other is called the steady state theory .
The steady state people say there never was a time when the world began , it 's always expanding , yes , but as a result of free hydrogen in space , the free hydrogen coagulates and makes new galaxies .
But the other people say there was a primoridial explosion , an enormous bang billions of years ago which flung all the galazies into space .
Well let 's take that just for the sake of argument and say that was the way it happened .
It 's like you took a bottle of ink and you threw it at a wall .
Smash !
And all that ink spread .
And in the middle , it 's dense , is n't it ?
And as it gets out on the edge , the little droplets get finer and finer and make more complicated patterns , see ?
So in the same way , there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread .
And you and I , sitting here in this room , as complicated human beings , are way , way out on the fringe of that bang .
We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it .
Very interesting .
But so we define ourselves as being only that .
If you think that you are only inside your skin , you define yourself as one very complicated little curlique , way out on the edge of that explosion .
Way out in space , and way out in time .
Billions of years ago , you were a big bang , but now you 're a complicated human being .
And then we cut ourselves off , and do n't feel that we 're still the big bang .
But you are .
Depends how you define yourself .
You are actually -- if this is the way things started , if there was a big bang in the beginning -- you 're not something that 's a result of the big bang .
You 're not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process .
You are still the process .
You are the big bang , the original force of the universe , coming on as whoever you are .
When I meet you , I see not just what you define yourself as -- Mr so - and - so , Ms so - and - so , Mrs so - and - so -- I see every one of you as the primordial energy of the universe coming on at me in this particular way .
I know I 'm that , too .
But we 've learned to define ourselves as separate from it .
And so what I would call a basic problem we 've got to go through first , is to understand that there are no such things as things .
That is to say separate things , or separate events .
That that is only a way of talking .
If you can understand this , you 're going to have no further problems .
I once asked a group of high school children ' What do you mean by a thing ? '
First of all , they gave me all sorts of synonyms .
They said ' It 's an object , ' which is simply another word for a thing ; it does n't tell you anything about what you mean by a thing .
Finally , a very smart girl from Italy , who was in the group , said a thing is a noun .
And she was quite right .
A noun is n't a part of nature , it 's a part of speech .
There are no nouns in the physical world .
There are no separate things in the physical world , either .
The physical world is wiggly .
Clouds , mountains , trees , people , are all wiggly .
And only when human beings get to working on things -- they build buildings in straight lines , and try to make out that the world is n't really wiggly .
But here we are , sitting in this room all built out of straight lines , but each one of us is as wiggly as all get - out .
Now then , when you want to get control of something that wiggles , it 's pretty difficult , is n't it ?
You try and pick up a fish in your hands , and the fish is wiggly and it slips out .
What do you do to get hold of the fish ?
You use a net .
And so the net is the basic thing we have for getting hold of the wiggly world .
So if you want to get hold of this wiggle , you 've got to put a net over it .
A net is something regular .
And I can number the holes in a net .
So many holes up , so many holes across .
And if I can number these holes , I can count exactly where each wiggle is , in terms of a hole in that net .
And that 's the beginning of calculus , the art of measuring the world .
But in order to do that , I 've got to break up the wiggle into bits .
I 've got to call this a specific bit , and this the next bit of the wiggle , and this the next bit , and this the next bit of the wiggle .
And so these bits are things or events .
Bit of wiggles .
Which I mark out in order to talk about the wiggle .
In order to measure and therfore in order to control it .
But in nature , in fact , in the physical world , the wiggle is n't bitted .
Like you do n't get a cut - up fryer out of an egg .
But you have to cut the chicken up in order to eat it .
You bite it .
But it does n't come bitten .
So the world does n't come thinged ; it does n't come evented .
You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean .
The ocean waves , and the universe peoples .
And as I wave and say to you ' Yoo - hoo ! ' the world is waving with me at you and saying ' Hi !
I 'm here !'
But we are consciousness of the way we feel and sense our existence .
Being based on a myth that we are made , that we are parts , that we are things , our consciousness has been influenced , so that each one of us does not feel that .
We have been hypnotized , literally hypnotized by social convention into feeling and sensing that we exist only inside our skins .
That we are not the original bang , just something out on the end of it .
And therefore we are scared stiff .
My wave is going to disappear , and I 'm going to die !
And that would be awful .
We 've got a mythology going now which is , as Father Maskell . ? , put it , we are something that happens between the maternity ward and the crematorium .
And that 's it .
And therefore everybody feels unhappy and miserable .
This is what people really believe today .
You may go to church , you may say you believe in this , that , and the other , but you do n't .
Even Jehovah 's Witnesses , who are the most fundamental of fundamentalists , they are polite when they come around and knock on the door .
But if you REALLY believed in Christianity , you would be screaming in the streets .
But nobody does .
You would be taking full - page ads in the paper every day .
You would be the most terrifying television programs .
The churches would be going out of their minds if they really believed what they teach .
But they do n't .
They think they ought to believe what they teach .
They believe they should believe , but they do n't really believe it , because what we REALLY believe is the fully automatic model .
And that is our basic , plausible common sense .
You are a fluke .
You are a separate event .
And you run from the maternity ward to the crematorium , and that 's it , baby .
That 's it .
Now why does anybody think that way ?
There 's no reason to , because it is n't even scientific .
It 's just a myth .
And it 's invented by people who want to feel a certain way .
They want to play a certain game .
The game of god got embarrassing .
The idea if God as the potter , as the architect of the universe , is good .
It makes you feel that life is , after all , important .
There is someone who cares .
It has meaning , it has sense , and you are valuable in the eyes of the father .
But after a while , it gets embarrassing , and you realize that everything you do is being watched by God .
He knows your tiniest innermost feelings and thoughts , and you say after a while , ' Quit bugging me !
I do n't want you around . '
So you become an athiest , just to get rid of him .
Then you feel terrible after that , because you got rid of God , but that means you got rid of yourself .
You 're nothing but a machine .
And your idea that you 're a machine is just a machine , too .
So if you 're a smart kid , you commit suicide .
Camus said there is only one serious philosophical question , which is whether or not to commit suicide .
I think there are four or five serious philosophical questions .
The first one is ' Who started it ? '
The second is ' Are we going to make it ? '
The third is ' Where are we going to put it ? '
The fourth is ' Who 's going to clean up ? '
And the fifth , ' Is it serious ? '
But still , should you or not commit suicide ?
This is a good question .
Why go on ?
And you only go on if the game is worth the gamble .
Now the universe has been going on for an incredible long time .
And so really , a satisfactory theory of the universe has to be one that 's worth betting on .
That 's very , it seems to me , elementary common sense .
If you make a theory of the universe which is n't worth betting on , why bother ?
Just commit suicide .
But if you want to go on playing the game , you 've got to have an optimal theory for playing the game .
Otherwise there 's no point in it .
But the people who coined the fully automatic theory of the universe were playing a very funny game , for what they wanted to say was this : all you people who believe in religion -- old ladies and wishful thinkers -- you 've got a big daddy up there , and you want comfort , but life is rough .
Life is tough , as success goes to the most hard - headed people .
That was a very convenient theory when the European and American worlds were colonizing the natives everywhere else .
They said ' We 're the end product of evolution , and we 're tough .
I 'm a big strong guy because I face facts , and life is just a bunch of junk , and I 'm going to impose my will on it and turn it into something else .
I 'm real hard . '
That 's a way of flattering yourself .
And so , it has become academically plausible and fashionable that this is the way the world works .
In academic circles , no other theory of the world than the fully automatic model is respectable .
Because if you 're an academic person , you 've got to be an intellectually tough person , you 've got to be prickly .
There are basically two kinds of philosophy .
One 's called prickles , the other 's called goo .
And prickly people are precise , rigorous , logical .
They like everything chopped up and clear .
Goo people like it vague .
For example , in physics , prickly people believe that the ultimate constituents of matter are particles .
Goo people believe it 's waves .
And in philosophy , prickly people are logical positivists , and goo people are idealists .
And they 're always arguing with each other , but what they do n't realize is neither one can take his position without the other person .
Because you would n't know you advocated prickles unless there was someone advocating goo .
You would n't know what a prickle was unless you knew what a goo was .
Because life is n't either prickles or goo , it 's either gooey prickles or prickly goo .
They go together like back and front , male and female .
And that 's the answer to philosophy .
You see , I 'm a philosopher , and I 'm not going to argue very much , because if you do n't argue with me , I do n't know what I think .
So if we argue , I say ' Thank you , ' because owing to the courtesy of your taking a different point of view , I understand what I mean .
So I can't get rid of you .
But however , you see , this whole idea that the universe is nothing at all but unintelligent force playing around and not even enjoying it is a putdown theory of the world .
People who had an advantage to make , a game to play by putting it down , and making out that because they put the world down they were a superior kind of people .
So that just wo n't do .
We 've had it .
Because if you seriously go along with this idea of the world , you 're what is technically called alienated .
You feel hostile to the world .
You feel that the world is a trap .
It is a mechanism , it is electronic and neurological mechanisms into which you somehow got caught .
And you , poor thing , have to put up with being put into a body that 's falling apart , that gets cancer , that gets the great Siberian itch , and is just terrible .
And these mechanics -- doctors -- are trying to help you out , but they really can't succeed in the end , and you 're just going to fall apart , and it 's a grim business , and it 's just too bad .
So if you think that 's the way things are , you might as well commit suicide right now .
Unless you say , ' Well , I 'm damned .
Because there might really be after all eternal damnation .
Or I identify with my children , and I think of them going on without me and nobody to support them .
Because if I do go on in this frame of mind and continue to support them , I shall teach them to be like I am , and they 'll go on , dragging it out to support their children , and they wo n't enjoy it .
They 'll be afraid to commit suicide , and so will their children .
They 'll all learn the same lessons . '
So you see , all I 'm trying to say is that the basic common sense about the nature of the world that is influencing most people in the United States today is simply a myth .
If you want to say that the idea of God the father with his white beard on the golden throne is a myth , in a bad sense of the word ' myth , ' so is this other one .
It is just as phony and has just as little to support it as being the true state of affairs .
Why ?
Let 's get this clear .
If there is any such thing at all as intelligence and love and beauty , well you 've found it in other people .
In other words , it exists in us as human beings .
And as I said , if it is there , in us , it is symptomatic of the scheme of things .
We are as symptomatic of the scheme of things as the apples are symptomatic of the apple tree or the rose of the rose bush .
The Earth is not a big rock infested with living organisms any more than your skeleton is bones infested with cells .
The Earth is geological , yes , but this geological entity grows people , and our existence on the Earth is a symptom of this other system , and its balances , as much as the solar system in turn is a symptom of our galaxy , and our galaxy in its turn is a symptom of a whole company of other galaxies .
Goodness only knows what that 's in .
But you see , when , as a scientist , you describe the behavior of a living organism , you try to say what a person does , it 's the only way in which you can describe what a person is , describe what they do .
Then you find out that in making this description , you cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin .
In other words , you cannot talk about a person walking unless you start describing the floor , because when I walk , I do n't just dangle my legs in empty space .
I move in relationship to a room .
So in order to describe what I 'm doing when I 'm walking , I have to describe the room ; I have to describe the territory .
So in describing my talking at the moment , I can't describe it as just a thing in itself , because I 'm talking to you .
And so what I 'm doing at the moment is not completely described unless your being here is described also .
So if that is necessary , in other words , in order to describe MY behavior , I have to describe YOUR behavior and the behavior of the environment , it means that we 've really got one system of behavior .
Your skin does n't separate you from the world ; it 's a bridge through which the external world flows into you , and you flow into it .
Just , for example , as a whirlpool in water , you could say because you have a skin you have a definite shape you have a definite form .
All right ?
Here is a flow of water , and suddenly it does a whirlpool , and it goes on .
The whirlpool is a definite form , but no water stays put in it .
The whirlpool is something the stream is doing , and exactly the same way , the whole universe is doing each one of us , and I see each one of you today and I recognize you tomorrow , just as I would recognize a whirlpool in a stream .
I 'd say ' Oh yes , I 've seen that whirlpool before , it 's just near so - and - so's house on the edge of the river , and it 's always there . '
So in the same way when I meet you tomorrow , I recognize you , you 're the same whirlpool you were yesterday .
But you 're moving .
The whole world is moving through you , all the cosmic rays , all the food you 're eating , the stream of steaks and milk and eggs and everything is just flowing right through you .
When you 're wiggling the same way , the world is wiggling , the stream is wiggling you .
But the problem is , you see , we have n't been taught to feel that way .
The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe , but only parts of it , only in it , only confronting it -- aliens .
And we are , I think , quite urgently in need of coming to feel that we ARE the eternal universe , each one of us .
Otherwise we 're going to go out of our heads .
We 're going to commit suicide , collectively , courtesy of H - bombs .
And , all right , supposing we do , well that will be that , then there will be life making experiments on other galaxies .
Maybe they 'll find a better game .

ALAN WATTS : THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS , part 2 of 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well now , in the first session this afternoon , I was discussing two of the great myths or models of the universe , which lie in the intellictual and psychological background of all of us .
The myth of the world as a political , monarchial state in which we are all here on sufferance as subject to God .
In which we are MADE artifacts , who do not exist in our own right .
God alone , in the first myth , exists in his own right , and you exist as a favor , and you ought to be grateful .
Like your parents come on and say to you , ' Look at all the things we 've done for you , all the money we spent to send you to college , and you turn out to be a beatnik .
You 're a wretched , ungrateful child . '
And you 're supposed to say , ' Sorry , I really am . '
But you 're definitely in the position of being on probation .
This arises out of our whole attitude towards children , whereby we do n't really acknowledge that they 're human .
Instead , when a child comes into the world , and as soon as it can communicate in any way , talk language , you should say to a child , ' How do you do ?
Welcome to the human race .
Now my dear , we are playing a very complicated game , and we 're going to explain the rules of it to you .
And when you have learned these rules and understand what they are , you may be able to invent better ones .
But in the meantime , this is the thing we 're doing . '
Instead of that , we either treat a child with a kind of with a kind of ' blah - blah - blah ' attitude , or ' coochy - coochy - coochie , ' y'know ?
and do n't treat the thing as a human being at all -- as a kind of doll .
Or else as a nusiance .
And so all of us , having been treated that way , carry over into adult life the sense of being on probation here .
Either the god is somebody who says to us ' coochy - coochy - coochie , ' or ' blah - blah - blah . '
And that 's the feeling we carry over .
So that idea of the royal god , the king of kings and the lord of lords which we inherit from the political structures of the Tigres - Euphrates cultures , and from Egypt .
The Pharoah , Amenhotep IV is probably , as Freud suggested , the original author of Moses ' monotheism , and certainly the Jewish law code comes from Hammarabi in Chaldea .
And these men lived in a culture where the pyramid and the ziggurat -- the ziggurat is the Chaldean version of the pyramid , indicating somehow a hierarchy of power , from the boss on down .
And God , in this first myth that we 've been discussing , the ceramic myth is the boss , and the idea of God is that the universe is governed from above .
But do you see , this parallels -- goes hand in hand with the idea that you govern your own body .
That the ego , which lies somewhere between the ears and behind the eyes in the brain , is the governer of the body .
And so we can't understand a system of order , a system of life , in which there is n't a governer .
' O Lord , our governor , how excellent is thy name in all the world . '
But supposing , on the contrary , there could be a system which does n't have a governor .
That 's what we are supposed to have in this society .
We are supposed to be a democracy and a republic .
And we are supposed to govern ourselves .
As I said , it 's so funny that Americans can be politically republican -- I do n't mean republican in the party sense -- and yet religiously monarchial .
It 's a real strange contradiction .
So what is this universe ?
Is it a monarchy ?
Is it a republic ?
Is it a mechanism ?
Or an organism ?
Becuase you see , if it 's a mechanism , either it 's a mere mechanism , as in the fully automatic model , or else it 's a mechanism under the control of a driver .
A mechanic .
If it 's not that , it 's an organism , and an organism is a thing that governs itself .
In your body there is no boss .
You could argue , for example , that the brain is a gadget evolved by the stomach , in order to serve the stomach for the purposes of getting food .
Or you can argue that the stomach is a gadget evolved by the brain to feed it and keep it alive .
Whose game is this ?
Is it the brain 's game , or the stomach 's game ?
They 're mutual .
The brain implies the stomach and the stomach implies the brain , and neither of them is the boss .
You know that story about all the limbs of the body .
The hand said ' We do all our work , ' the feet said ' We do our work , ' the mouth said ' We do all the chewing , and here 's this lazy stomach who just gets it all and does n't do a thing .
He did n't do any work , so let 's go on strike . '
And the hands refused to carry , the feet refused to walk , the teeth refused to chew , and said ' Now we 're on strike against the stomach . '
But after a while , all of them found themselves getting weaker and weaker and weaker , because they did n't realize that the stomach fed them .
So there is the possibility then that we are not in the kind of system that these two myths delineate .
That we are not living in a world where we ourselves , in the deepest sense of self , are outside reality , and somehow in a position that we have to bow down to it and say ' As a great favor , please preserve us in existence . '
Nor are we in a system which is merely mechanical , and which we are nothing but flukes , trapped in the electrical wiring of a nervous system which is fundamentally rather inefficiently arranged .
What 's the alternative ?
Well , we could put the alternative in another image altogether , and I 'll call this not the ceramic image , not the fully automatic image , but the dramatic image .
Consider the world as a drama .
What 's the basis of all drama ?
The basis of all stories , of all plots , of all happenings -- is the game of hide and seek .
You get a baby , what 's the fundamental first game you play with a baby ?
You put a book in front of your face , and you peek at the baby .
The baby starts giggling .
Because the baby is close to the origins of life ; it comes from the womb really knowing what it 's all about , but it can't put it into words .
See , what every child psychologist really wants to know is to get a baby to talk psychological jargon , and explain how it feels .
But the baby knows ; you do this , this , this and this , and the baby starts laughing , because the baby is a recent incarnation of God .
And the baby knows , therefore , that hide and seek is the basic game .
See , when we were children , we were taught ' 1 , 2 , 3 , ' and ' A , B , C , ' but we were n't set down on our mothers ' knees and taught the game of black and white .
That 's the thing that was left out of all our educations , the game that I was trying to explain with these wave diagrams .
That life is not a conflict between opposites , but a polarity .
The difference bewteen a conflict and a polarity is simply -- when you think about opposite things , we sometimes use the expression , ' These two things are the poles apart . '
You say , for example , about someone with whom you totally disagree , ' I am the poles apart from this person . '
But your very saying that gives the show away .
Poles .
Poles are the opposite ends of one magnet .
And if you take a magnet , say you have a magnetized bar , there 's a north pole and a south pole .
Okay , chop off the south pole , move it away .
The piece you 've got left creates a new south pole .
You never get rid of the south pole .
So the point about a magnet is , things may be the poles apart , but they go together .
You can't have the one without the other .
We are imagining a diagram of the universe in which the idea of polarity is the opposite ends of the diameter , north and south , you see ?
That 's the basic idea of polarity , but what we 're trying to imagine is the encounter of forces that come from absolutely opposed realms , that have nothing in common .
When we say of two personality types that they 're the poles apart .
We are trying to think eccentrically , instead of concentrically .
And so in this way , we have n't realized that life and death , black and white , good and evil , being and non-being , come from the same center .
They imply each other , so that you would n't know the one without the other .
Now I 'm not saying that that 's bad , that 's fun .
You 're playing the game that you do n't know that black and white imply each other .
Therefore you think that black possibly might win , that the light might go out , that the sound might never be heard again .
That there could be the possibility of a universe of pure tragedy , of endless , endless darkness .
Would n't that be awful ?
Only you would n't know it was awful , if that 's what happened .
The point that we all forget is that the black and the white go together , and there is n't the one without the other .
At the same time , you see , we forget , in the same way as we forget that these two go together .
The other thing we forget , is that self and other go together , in just the same way as the two poles of a magnet .
You say ' I , myself ; I am me ; I am this individual ; I am this particular , unique instance . '
What is other is everything else .
All of you , all of the stars , all of the galaxies , way , way out into infinite space , that 's other .
But in the same way as black implies white , self implies other .
And you do n't exist without all that , so that where you get these polarities , you get this sort of difference , that what we call explicitly , or exoterically , they 're different .
But implicitely , esoterically , they 're one .
Since you can't have the one without the other , that shows there 's a kind of inner conspiracy bewteen all pairs of opposites , which is not in the open , but it 's tacit .
It 's like you say ' Well , there are all sorts of things that we understand among each other tacitly , that we do n't want to admit , but we do recognize tacity there 's a kind of secret between us boys and girls , ' or whatever it may be .
And we recognize that .
So , tacitly , all of you really inwardly know -- although you wo n't admit it because your culture has trained you in a contrary direction -- all of you really inwardly know that you as an individual self are inseparable from everything else that exists , that you are a special case in the universe .
But the whole game , especially of Western culture , is to coneal that from ourselves , so that when anybody in our culture slips into the state of consciousness where they suddenly find this to be true , and they come on and say ' I 'm God , ' we say ' You 're insane . '
Now , it 's very difficult -- you can very easily slip into the state of consciousness where you feel you 're God ; it can happen to anyone .
Just in the same way as you can get the flu , or measles , or something like that , you can slip into this state of consciousness .
And when you get it , it depends upon your background and your training as to how you 're going to interpret it .
If you 've got the idea of god that comes from popular Christianity , God as the governor , the political head of the world , and you think you 're God , then you say to everybody , ' You should bow down and worship me . '
But if you 're a member of Hindu culture , and you suddenly tell all your friends ' I 'm God , ' instead of saying ' You 're insane , ' they say ' Congratulations !
At last , you found out . '
Becuase their idea of god is not the autocratic governor .
When they make images of Shiva , he has ten arms .
How would you use ten arms ?
It 's hard enough to use two .
You know , if you play the organ , you 've got to use your two feet and your two hands , and you play different rhythms with each member .
It 's kind of tricky .
But actually we 're all masters at this , because how do you grow each hair without having to think about it ?
Each nerve ?
How do you beat your heart and digest with your stomach at the same time ?
You do n't have to think about it .
In your very body , you are omnipotent in the true sense of omnipotence , which is that you are able to be omni-potent ; you are able to do all these things without having to think about it .
When I was a child , I used to ask my mother all sorts of ridiculous questions , which of course every child asks , and when she got bored with my questions , she said ' Darling , there are just some things which we are not meant to know . '
I said ' Will we ever know ? '
She said ' Yes , of course , when we die and go to heaven , God will make everything plain . '
So I used to imagine on wet afternoons in heaven , we 'd all sit around the throne of grace and say to God , ' Well why did you do this , and why did you do that ? ' and he would explain it to us .
' Heavenly father , why are the leaves green ? ' and he would say ' Because of the chlorophyll , ' and we 'd say ' Oh . '
But in he Hindu universe , you would say to God , ' How did you make the mountains ? ' and he would say ' Well , I just did it .
Because when you 're asking me how did I make the mountains , you 're asking me to describe in words how I made the mountains , and there are no words which can do this .
Words cannot tell you how I made the mountains any more than I can drink the ocean with a fork .
A fork may be useful for sticking into a piece of something and eating it , but it's of no use for imbibing the ocean .
It would take millions of years .
In other words , it would take millions of years , and you would be bored with my description , long before I got through it , if I put it to you in words , because I did n't create the mountains with words , I just did it .
Like you open and close your hand .
You know how you do this , but can you describe in words how you do it ?
Even a very good physiologist can't describe it in words .
But you do it .
You 're conscious , are n't you .
Do n't you know how you manage to be conscious ?
Do you know how you beat your heart ?
Can you say in words , explain correctly how this is done ?
You do it , but you can't put it into words , because words are too clumsy , yet you manage this expertly for as long as you 're able to do it . '
But you see , we are playing a game .
The game runs like this : the only thing you really know is what you can put into words .
Let 's suppose I love some girl , rapturously , and somebody says to me , ' Do you REALLY love her ? '
Well , how am I going to prove this ?
They 'll say , ' Write poetry .
Tell us all how much you love her .
Then we 'll believe you . '
So if I 'm an artist , and can put this into words , and can convince everybody I 've written the most ecstatic love letter ever written , they say ' All right , ok , we admit it , you really do love her . '
But supposing you 're not very articulate , are we going to tell you you DON 'T love her ?
Surely not .
You do n't have to be Heloise and Abyla to be in love .
But the whole game that our culture is playing is that nothing really happens unless it's in the newspaper .
So when we 're at a party , and it 's a great party , somebody says ' Too bad we did n't bring a camera .
Too bad there was n't a tape recorder .
And so our children begin to feel that they do n't exist authentically unless they get their names in the papers , and the fastest way to get your name in the paper is to commit a crime .
Then you 'll be photographed , and you 'll appear in court , and everybody will notice you .
And you 're THERE .
So you 're not there unless you 're recorded .
It really happened if it was recorded .
In other words , if you shout , and it does n't come back and echo , it did n't happen .
Well that 's a real hangup .
It 's true , the fun with echos ; we all like singing in the bathtub , because there 's more resonance there .
And when we play a musical instrument , like a violin or a cello , it has a sounding box , because that gives resonance to the sound .
And in the same way , the cortex of the human brain enables us when we 're happy to know that we 're happy , and that gives a certain resonance to it .
If you 're happy , and you do n't know you 're happy , there 's nobody home .
But this is the whole problem for us .
Several thousand years ago , human beings devolved the system of self - consciousness , and they knew , they knew .
There was a young man who said ' though
It seems that I know that I know ,
What I would like to see
Is the I that sees me
When I know that I know that I know . '
And this is the human problem : we know that we know .
And so , there came a point in our evolution where we did n't guide life by distrusting our instincts .
Suppose that you could live absolutely spontaneously .
You do n't make any plans , you just live like you feel like it .
And you say ' What a gas that is , I do n't have to make any plans , anything .
I do n't worry ; I just do what comes naturally . '
The way the animals live , everybody envies them , because look , a cat , when it walks -- did you ever see a cat making an aesthetic mistake .
Did you ever see a badly formed cloud ?
Were the stars ever misarranged ?
When you watch the foam breaking on the seashore , did it ever make a bad pattern ?
Never .
And yet we think in what we do , we make mistakes .
And we 're worried about that .
So there came this point in human evolution when we lost our innocence .
When we lost this thing that the cats and the flowers have , and had to think about it , and had to purposely arrange and discipline and push our lives around in accordance with foresight and words and systems of symbols , accountancy , calculation and so on , and then we worry .
Once you start thinking about things , you worry as to if you thought enough .
Did you really take all the details into consideration ?
Was every fact properly reviewed ?
And by jove , the more you think about it , the more you realize you really could n't take everything into consideration , becauase all the variables in every decision are incalculable , so you get anxiety .
And this , though , also , is the price you pay for knowing that you know .
For being able to think about thinking , being able to feel about feeling .
And so you 're in this funny position .
Now then , do you see that this is simultaneously an advantage and a terrible disadvantage ?
What has happened here is that by having a certain kind of consciousness , a certain kind of reflexive consciousness -- being aware of being aware .
Being able to represent what goes on fundamentally in terms of a system of symbols , such as words , such as numbers .
You put , as it were , two lives together at once , one representing the other .
The symbols representing the reality , the money representing the wealth , and if you do n't realize that the symbol is really secondary , it does n't have the same value .
People go to the supermarket , and they get a whole cartload of goodies and they drive it through , then the clerk fixes up the counter and this long tape comes out , and he 'll say ' $ 30 , please , ' and everybody feels depressed , because they give away $ 30 worth of paper , but they 've got a cartload of goodies .
They do n't think about that , they think they 've just lost $ 30 .
But you 've got the real wealth in the cart , all you 've parted with is the paper .
Because the paper in our system becomes more valuable than the wealth .
It represents power , potentiality , whereas the wealth , you think oh well , that 's just necessary ; you 've got to eat .
That 's to be really mixed up .
So then .
If you awaken from this illusion , and you understand that black implies white , self implies other , life implies death -- or shall I say , death implies life -- you can conceive yourself .
Not conceive , but FEEL yourself , not as a stranger in the world , not as someone here on sufferance , on probation , not as something that has arrived here by fluke , but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental .
What you are basically , deep , deep down , far , far in , is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself .
So , say in Hindu mythology , they say that the world is the drama of God .
God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne , that has royal perogatives .
God in Indian mythology is the self , ' Satchitananda . '
Which means ' sat , ' that which is , ' chit , ' that which is consciousness ; that which is ' ananda ' is bliss .
In other words , what exists , reality itself is gorgeous , it is the fullness of total joy .
Wowee !
And all those stars , if you look out in the sky , is a firework display like you see on the fourth of July , which is a great occasion for celebration ; the universe is a celebration , it is a fireworks show to celebrate that existence is .
Wowee .
And then they say , ' But , however , there 's no point in just sustaining bliss . '
Let 's suppose you were able , every night , to dream any dream you wanted to dream , and that you could for example have the power to dream in one night 75 years worth of time .
Or any length of time you wanted to have .
And you would , naturally , as you began on this adventure of dreams , fulfill all your wishes .
You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive .
And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each , you would say ' Well , that was pretty great .
But now let 's have a surprise .
Let 's have a dream which is n't under control , where something is going to happen to me that I do n't know what it 's going to be . '
And you would dig that , and come out of it and say ' That was a close shave , now was n't it ? '
Then you would get more and more adventurous , and you would make further and further gambles as to what you would dream , and finally you would dream where you are now .
You would dream the dream of the life that you are actually living today .
That would be within the infinite multiplicity of the choices you would have .
Of playing that you were n't God .
Because the whole nature of the godhead , according to this idea , is to play that he 's not .
The first thing that he says to himself is ' Man , get lost , ' because he gives himself away .
The nature of love is self - abandonment , not clinging to oneself .
Throwing yourself out , for instance as in basketball ; you 're always getting rid of the ball .
You say to the other fellow ' Have a ball . '
See ?
And that keeps things moving .
That 's the nature of life .
So in this idea , then , everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality .
Not God in a politically kingly sense , but God in the sense of being the self , the deep - down basic whatever there is .
And you 're all that , only you 're pretending you 're not .
And it 's perfectly OK to pretend you 're not , to be perfectly convinced , because this is the whole notion of drama .
When you come into the theater , there is an arch , and a stage , and down there is the audience .
Everybody assumes their seats in the theater , gone to see a comedy , a tragedy , a thriller , whatever it is , and they all know as they come in and pay their admissions , that what is going to happen on the stage is not for real .
But the actors have a conspiracy against this , because they 're going to try and persuade the audience that what is happening on the stage IS for real .
They want to get everybody sitting on the edge of their chairs , they want you terrified , or crying , or laughing .
Absolutely captivated by the drama .
And if a skillful human actor can take in an audience and make people cry , think what the cosmic actor can do .
Why he can take himself in completely .
He can play so much for real that he thinks he really is .
Like you sitting in this room , you think you 're really here .
Well , you 've persuaded yourself that way .
You 've acted it so damn well that you KNOW that this is the real world .
But you 're playing it .
As well , the audience and the actor as one .
Because behind the stage is the green room , offscene , where the actors take off their masks .
Do you know that the word ' person ' means ' mask ' ?
The ' persona ' which is the mask worn by actors in Greco - Roman drama , because it has a megaphone - type mouth which throws the sound out in an open - air theater .
So the ' per ' -- through - -' sona ' -- what the sound comes through - - that 's the mask .
How to be a real person .
How to be a genuine fake .
So the ' dramatis persona ' at the beginning of a play is the list of masks that the actors will wear .
And so in the course of forgetting that this world is a drama , the word for the role , the word for the mask has come to mean who you are genuinely .
The person .
The proper person .
Incidentally , the word ' parson ' is derived from the word ' person . '
The ' person ' of the village .
The ' person ' around town , the parson .
So anyway , then , this is a drama , and what I want you to is -- I 'm not trying to sell you on this idea in the sense of converting you to it ; I want you to play with it .
I want you to think of its possibilities .
I 'm not trying to prove it , I 'm just putting it forward as a possibility of life to think about .
So then , this means that you 're not victims of a scheme of things , of a mechanical world , or of an autocratic god .
The life you 're living is what YOU have put yourself into .
Only you do n't admit it , because you want to play the game that it 's happened to you .
In other words , I got mixed up in this world ; I had a father who got hot pants over a girl , and she was my mother , and because he was just a horny old man , and as a result of that , I got born , and I blame him for it and say ' Well that 's your fault ; you 've got to look after me , ' and he says ' I do n't see why I should look after you ; you 're just a result . '
But let 's suppose we admit that I really wanted to get born , and that I WAS the ugly gleam in my father 's eye when he approached my mother .
That was me .
I was desire .
And I deliberately got involved in this thing .
Look at it that way instead .
And that really , even if I got myself into an awful mess , and I got born with syphilis , and the great Siberian itch , and tuberculosis in a Nazi concentration camp , nevertheless this was a game , which was a very far out play .
It was a kind of cosmic masochism .
But I did it .
Is n't that an optimal game rule for life ?
Because if you play life on the supposition that you 're a helpless little puppet that got involved .
Or you played on the supposition that it's a frightful , serious risk , and that we really ought to do something about it , and so on , it 's a drag .
There 's no point in going on living unless we make the assumption that the situation of life is optimal .
That really and truly we 're all in a state of total bliss and delight , but we 're going to pretend we are n't just for kicks .
In other words , you play non -bliss in order to be able to experience bliss .
And you can go as far out in non-bliss as you want to go .
And when you wake up , it 'll be great .
You know , you can slam yourself on the head with a hammer because it 's so nice when you stop .
And it makes you realize how great things are when you forget that 's the way it is .
And that 's just like black and white : you do n't know black unless you know white ; you do n't know white unless you know black .
This is simply fundamental .
So then , here 's the drama .
My metaphysics , let me be perfectly frank with you , are that there the central self , you can call it God , you can call it anything you like , and it 's all of us .
It 's playing all the parts of all being whatsoever everywhere and anywhere .
And it 's playing the game of hide and seek with itself .
It gets lost , it gets involved in the farthest - out adventures , but in the end it always wakes up and comes back to itself .
And when you 're ready to wake up , you 're going to wake up , and if you 're not ready you 're going to stay pretending that you 're just a ' poor little me . '
And since you 're all here and engaged in this sort of enquiry and listening to this sort of lecture , I assume you 're all in the process of waking up .
Or else you 're pleasing yourselves with some kind of flirtation with waking up which you 're not serious about .
But I assume that you are maybe not serious , but sincere , that you are ready to wake up .
So then , when you 're in the way of waking up , and finding out who you are , you meet a character called a guru , as the Hindus say ' the teacher , ' ' the awakener . '
And what is the function of a guru ?
He 's the man that looks you in the eye and says ' Oh come off it .
I know who you are . '
You come to the guru and say ' Sir , I have a problem .
I 'm unhappy , and I want to get one up on the universe .
I want to become enlightened .
I want spiritual wisdom . '
The guru looks at you adn says ' Who are you ? '
You know Sri-Ramana - Maharshi , that great Hindu sage of modern times ?
People used to come to him and say ' Master , who was I in my last incarnation ? '
As if that mattered .
And he would say ' Who is asking the question ? '
And he'd look at you and say , go right down to it , ' You 're looking at me , you 're looking out , and you 're unaware of what 's behind your eyes .
Go back in and find out who you are , where the question comes from , why you ask . '
And if you 've looked at a photograph of that man -- I have a gorgeous photograph of him ; I look by it every time I go out the front door .
And I look at those eyes , and the humor in them ; the lilting laugh that says ' Oh come off it .
Shiva , I recognize you .
When you come to my door and say ` I 'm so - and - so , ' I say ` Ha-ha , what a funny way God has come on today . ''
So eventually -- there are all sorts of tricks of course that gurus play .
They say ' Well , we 're going to put you through the mill . '
And the reason they do that is simply that you wo n't wake up until you feel you 've paid a price for it .
In other words , the sense of guilt that one has .
Or the sense of anxiety .
It 's simply the way one experiences keeping the game of disguise going on .
Do you see that ?
Supposing you say ' I feel guilty . '
Christianity makes you feel guilty for existing .
That somehow the very fact that you exist is an affront .
You are a fallen human being .
I remember as a child when we went to the serves of the church on Good Friday .
They gave us each a colored postcard with Jesus crucified on it , and it said underneath ' This I have done for thee .
What doest thou for me ? '
You felt awful .
YOU had nailed that man to the cross .
Because you eat steak , you have crucified Christ .
Mythra .
It 's the same mystery .
And what are you going to do about that ?
' This I have done for thee , what doest thou for me ? '
You feel awful that you exist at all .
But that sense of guilt is the veil across the sanctuary .
' Do n't you DARE come in !'
In all mysteries , when you are going to be initiated , there 's somebody saying ' Ah - ah - ah , do n't you come in .
You 've got to fulfill this requirement and that requirement , THEN we 'll let you in . '
And so you go through the mill .
Why ?
Because you 're saying to yourself ' I wo n't wake up until I deserve it .
I wo n't wake up until I 've made it difficult for me to wake up .
So I invent for myself an eleborate sytem of delaying my waking up .
I put myself through this test and that test , and when I convince myself it 's sufficiently arduous , THEN I at last admit to myself who I really am , and draw aside the veil and realize that after all , when all is said and done , I am that I am , which is the name of god . '

ALAN WATTS : THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS , pt 3 of 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In last night 's session , I was discussing an alternative myth to the Ceramic and Fully Automatic models of the universe , I 'll call the Dramatic Myth .
The idea that life as we experience it is a big act , and that behind this big act is the player , and the player , or the self , as it's called in Hindu philosophy , the _atman_ , is you .
Only you are playing hide and seek , since that is the essential game that is going on .
The game of games .
The basi
PHP 5.3 will have a lot of exciting new features .
One of the most important one for me is the introduction of lambda functions and closures support .
I wo n't talk too much about what lambda functions or closures are , as you can find many good blog posts describing them in great details .
To sum up , a lambda function is an anonymous PHP function that can be stored in a variable and passed as an argument to other functions or methods .
A closure is a lambda function that is aware of its surrounding context .
The first obvious use for lambda functions and closures is in conjunction with the array_map ( ) , array_reduce ( ) , and array_filter ( ) native PHP functions :
$ input = array ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) ; $ output = array_filter ( $ input , function ( $ v ) { return $ v > 2 ; } ) ;
The above example filters the input array by removing all values greater than 2 :
$ output == array ( 2 => 3 , 3 => 4 , 4 => 5 )
function ( $ v ) { return $ v > 2 ; } is the lambda function definition and it can be stored in a PHP variable to be reusable :
$ max_comparator = function ( $ v ) { return $ v > 2 ; } ; $ input = array ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) ; $ output = array_filter ( $ input , $ max_comparator ) ;
But what if I want to change the maximum number allowed in the filtered array ?
I can either create another lambda function or use a closure :
$ max_comparator = function ( $ max ) { return function ( $ v ) use ( $ max ) { return $ v > $ max ; } ; } ; $ input = array ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) ; $ output = array_filter ( $input , $ max_comparator ( 2 ) ) ;
Now , the $ max_comparator function takes the maximum allowed number and returns a function that is different according to this maximum .
Even for such a contrived example , I hope you see the great power it gives you !
Closures also opens up a lot of great possibilities , like the implementation of the cryptic Y - combinator , as demonstrated by Stanislav Malyshev in one of his recent blog post :
function Y( $ F ) { $ func = function ( $f ) { return $ f ( $f ) ; } ; return $ func( function ( $ f ) use ( $ F ) { return $ F ( function ( $x ) use ( $f ) { $ ff = $ f ( $f ) ; return $ ff ( $x ) ; } ) ; } ) ; }
Today , I want to talk about yet great another example on how to use lambda functions and closures .
You will see that it can simplify your code a lot when used appropriately .
If you have read my blog recently , you know that I am quite obsessed with dependency injection these days .
This post will show you how to implement a very simple but still full - featured dependency injection container , thanks to the new features of PHP 5.3 .
A dependency injection container must be able to manage two different kind of data : objects and parameters .
And objects must be created on - demand the first time they are accessed from the container .
Using a simple class that implements the magic __get ( ) and __set ( ) methods , we can easily manage both the objects and the parameters :
class DIContainer { protected $ values = array ( ) ; function __set ( $ id , $ value ) { $ this -> values [ $id ] = $ value ; } function __get ( $ id ) { return is_callable ( $ this -> values [ $id ] ) ?
$ this -> values [ $ id ] ( $ this ) : $ this -> values [ $id ] ; } }
Using the container is quite simple :
$ container = new DIContainer ( ) ; // define the parameters $ container ->cookie_name = ' SESSION_ID ' ; $ container->storage_class = ' SessionStorage ' ; // defined the objects $ container - > storage = function ( $ c ) { return new $ c->storage_class ( $ c-> cookie_name ) ; } ; $ container - > user = function ( $ c ) { return new User ( $c -> storage ) ; } ; // get the user object $ user = $ container - > user ; // the above call is roughly equivalent to the following code : // $ storage = new SessionStorage ( ' SESSION_ID ' ) ; // $ user = new User ( $storage ) ;
The examples I use in this article are the same as the one I have used in my series on dependency injection .
The definition of an object is done by defining a lambda function that returns an instance of the object .
The __get ( ) method checks if the value associated with a key is a PHP callable ( and lambda functions are callables ) to make the difference between an object definition and a parameter .
Also notice how we call the lambda :
$ this -> values [ $ id ] ( $ this )
The trick here is to pass the container as an argument of the lambda function so that it can use the container to access parameters and other objects managed by the container .
We can make the container a bit better by adding error support :
class DIContainer { protected $ values = array ( ) ; function __set ( $ id , $ value ) { $ this -> values [ $ id ] = $ value ; } function __get ( $ id ) { if ( ! isset ( $ this -> values [ $id ] ) ) { throw new InvalidArgumentException ( sprintf ( ' Value " %s " is not defined . ' , $ id ) ) ; } return is_callable ( $ this -> values [ $id ] ) ?
$ this -> values [ $ id ] ( $ this ) : $ this -> values [ $id ] ; } }
Defining objects with lambda functions is great because the developer can do whatever he wants to actually create and configure instances .
But we still need to implement one important feature of any dependency injection container : shared instances .
This can be done manually like this :
$ container - > user = function ( $ c ) { static $ object ; if ( is_null ( $ object ) ) { $ object = new User ( $ c -> storage ) ; } return $ object ; } ;
By declaring a static variable in the lambda function , the first time it is called , the object is created and returned .
For all subsequent calls , the same instance will always be returned .
It works as expected , but this is quite repetitive , tedious , and error prone .
For all instances that must be unique , we need to add this boilerplate code .
Instead , I want to support shared instances as a native feature of the container itself .
Thanks to closures , that 's quite easy to accomplish :
class DIContainer { // ... function as Shared ( $ callable ) { return function ( $ c ) use ( $ callable ) { static $ object ; if ( is_null ( $ object ) ) { $ object = $ callable ( $c ) ; } return $ object ; } ; } }
The asShared ( ) method wraps the given lambda function to add the needed logic we have seen before .
Declaring an object as unique for a given container is now dead simple :
$ c->user = $ c -> asShared ( function ( $ c ) { return new User ( $c -> storage ) ; } ) ;
In less than 30 lines of PHP , we have coded a full - featured dependency injection container .
Quite impressive !
If we remove the need for shared instance , and if we define parameters and objects as lambdas , we can even compact the code so that it fits in a tweet :
class Container { protected $ s=array ( ) ; function __set ( $k , $ c ) { $ this - > s [ $k ] =$ c ; } function __get ( $k ) { return $ this - > s [ $k ] ( $ this ) ; } }
I have called this tweet container twittee , and it has its own dedicated website and github repository .
PHP 5.3 is really a great step forward for the PHP language .

Eleven pirates were intercepted on Wednesday east of the Kenyan coast Eleven Somali pirates captured this week by a French warship are being taken to Kenya for trial , the French defence ministry has said .
The pirates will be tried under an agreement between the EU and Kenya , French officials said .
They were captured by a warship from an EU force deployed to tackle a recent surge in piracy .
Meanwhile , Somalia 's prime minister warned in a BBC interview that pirates could only be defeated on land .
They would always find ways of evading patrolling warships , he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
' International tribunal '
The French warship Nivose captured 11 pirates on Wednesday about 550 miles ( 900 km ) east of the Kenyan port of Mombasa .
On Thursday , a French defence ministry spokesman told AFP news agency that it was expected to arrive in Mombasa within four days .
Its speed was limited by the fact that it was towing captured pirate vessels , he said .
I think the best way to actually fight the piracy is to tackle these things from the land
Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke
Somali Prime Minister
In the past year , French forces have captured more than 71 suspected Somali pirates , and killed three others , AFP reports .
Fifteen of the pirates are awaiting trial in France because they attacked French ships .
Most of the others have been handed over to the authorities in Somalia 's semi-autonomous region of Puntland .
In recent months Britain , the US , and the European Union have signed memorandums of understanding with Nairobi that Kenya will act as a kind of international tribunal for pirate crimes .
Several Somali pirates turned over by the US and Germany are already facing legal action there .
Short of funds Despite anti-piracy patrols being conducted by various countries , attacks against ships have increased in the past few days .
Pirates have vowed to avenge the deaths of those killed in recent rescue operations by US and French forces .
What to do with a captured pirate Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke warned that international patrols could not defeat piracy .
" I think the best way to actually fight the piracy is to tackle these things from the land , " he said .
" You cannot tackle piracy from the sea no matter how many naval ships you put into the waters .
These pirates will try to move . "
Mr Sharmake said Somalia was formulating a rapid reaction force that would stop pirates before they got to the sea , but he acknowledged that his country was having difficulty raising funds to bolster its security structure .
" So far we have not been successful in getting [ sufficient ] financial support , " he said .
" We 're trying to actually be a self - reliant country , we are trying to generate as much as we can through our own ports , throughout the country and also from our property tax and in land . "
Somalia has not had a functioning national government since 1991 and Islamist insurgents control much of the south and centre of the country .

Increasing " Excess Reserves "
The demise of fiat - money regimes around the world has become unmistakable .
They can only be kept alive by central banks creating ever greater amounts of base money and governments underwriting commercial banks ' liabilities .
The US Federal Reserve , for instance , increased the stock of the monetary base — which includes banks ' demand deposits held with the Fed , plus coins and notes in circulation — from $ 870.9 billion in August 2008 to $ 1735.3 billion in January 2009 .
Banks ' " excess reserves " — banks ' base - money holdings minus required reserves — rose from $ 1.9 billion to $ 798.2 billion .
These excess reserves allow the banking sector , which operates under fractional reserves , to increase the credit and money supply manifold .
The monetary base expands when the central bank takes over the troubled assets of commercial banks in order to extend new credit to those banks .
This process is gaining momentum : on March 18 , 2009 , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) announced that it will increase base money by purchasing another $ 1,150 billion of securities .
It is also considering increasing base money by extending credit to private households and small businesses .
Causing Inflation
What the Fed does is produce inflation — and this is a truth that stands in sharp contrast to what mainstream economists say , namely that the rise in base money will just increase the liquidity in the interbank market and will not affect the money holdings in the hands of consumers , firms , and the government , which — they admit — could then inflate consumer prices .
In contrast , Austrian economists stress that inflation is a result of a rise in the stock of money .
This viewpoint rests on sound economics , firmly rooted in the notion that , first and foremost , value is a subjective concept .
Money is a good , like any other , and it is therefore subject to the law of diminishing marginal utility .
A rise in the money stock necessarily reduces the marginal utility of a money unit — and therefore its value — from the viewpoint of the individual ; likewise , the marginal utility of a money unit — and therefore its value — would increase if the money stock declines .
Changes in the value individuals assign to a money unit are reflected in prices for vendible items .
For instance , if the money stock in the hands of an individual rises , he may wish to increase his holdings of other goods .
As he exchanges money against vendible items , the prices of the latter are bid up .
In that sense , the change in the money stock is what must be called inflation , while changes in the prices for goods and services are just symptoms of the underlying cause , which is the change in the stock of money .
What the rise in base money has done so far is prevent prices of banks ' security holdings to decline to free - market levels .
In other words , the money injection helps to keep asset prices at artificially elevated levels , thereby preventing prices in financial markets , credit markets in particular , from adjusting .
The Path Toward Ever-Higher Inflation
The government controlled fiat - money regime is highly inflationary , as it allows for an increase in the stock of money mostly through bank credit in excess of real savings ( circulation credit ) .
The rising money stock pushes up prices — be it consumer or asset prices ( such as stocks , housing , etc. ) .
Expanding the money stock through circulation credit sets into motion an illusionary boom , leading to malinvestment .
However , the latter does not come to the surface as long as the credit and money supply keeps growing .
If money supply growth slows down all of a sudden , however , investor expectations are disappointed , and investment projects , which were — in a world of ever more money and rising prices — considered economically viable , become unprofitable .
The slowing down of money growth reveals that the production structure does not comply with actual demand , thereby unmasking the squandering of scarce resources .
And so the artificial boom , induced by new money injections , turns into bust .
A policy of holding up the artificial boom would require ever - greater increases in money .
Ludwig von Mises saw that this would lead to disaster :
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . [ 1 ]
Schemes for Producing Inflation
In an attempt to keep credit and money supply from slowing down and the economies from going into recession , monetary policies around the world are about to push short - term interest rates towards zero and expand the stock of base money , and thereby banks ' excess reserves , drastically .
Commercial banks can be expected to put their excess reserves to use , because base - money balances do not yield any interest : banks need to generate income to be in a position to pay interest on their liabilities ( demand , time and savings deposits , and debentures ) .
Extending loans is one option .
However , in an economic environment of financially overstretched borrowers , banks might be hesitant to increase their loan exposure vis -à - vis households and firms .
In fact , it might be increasingly difficult for banks to do so given that equity capital has become increasingly scarce and costly .
So commercial banks may wish to monetize government debt , as the latter does not require putting equity capital to use .
The government then spends the additionally created money stock on politically expedient projects ( unemployment benefits , infrastructure , defense , etc. ) , and the money stock in the hands of households and firms rises .
If , however , commercial banks decide to refrain from additional lending , and even call in loans falling due , the government may decide — as another drastic , but logically consequential step of interventionism — to nationalize the banking industry ( or at least a great part of it ) .
By doing so , it can make the banks increase the credit and money supply .
Alternatively , the central bank could print additional money , distributing it to households and firms as a transfer payment .
[ 2 ]
Under a fiat - money regime , this can be done at any time and without limit , as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke made unmistakably clear in a notorious speech in 2002 :
[ T ]he U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . [ 3 ]
The Way Toward Hyperinflation
Government - controlled fiat money is fraudulent money .
It is money that is created out of thin air , in violation of property rights : fiat - money production does n't require any of the wealth - producing activities characteristic of the free market .
It is and will always be , by construction , fraudulent money .
What is more , fiat money created through bank credit expansion necessarily causes boom - and - bust cycles , inducing governments to push back free - market forces to prop up the economy and keep the fiat - money regime afloat ; in fact , fiat money will increasingly undermine the free - market order .
Mises was well aware of the final consequences of a monetary regime that rests on ever - greater increases in the money stock produced by banks ' expanding circulation credit .
It would , at some point , lead to bankruptcies on the grandest scale , resulting in a contraction of the credit and money supply ( deflation ) .
Or it would end in hyperinflation :
But if once public opinion is convinced that the increase in the quantity of money will continue and never come to an end , and that consequently the prices of all commodities and services will not cease to rise , everybody becomes eager to buy as much as possible and to restrict his cash holding to a minimum size .
For under these circumstances the regular costs incurred by holding cash are increased by the losses caused by the progressive fall in purchasing power .
The advantages of holding cash must be paid for by sacrifices which are deemed unreasonably burdensome .
This phenomenon was , in the great European inflations of the ' twenties , called flight into real goods ( Flucht in die Sachwerte ) or crack - up boom ( Katastrophenhausse ) . [ 4 ]
Mises knew very well what he was referring to .
He had lived through the period of great inflation that started in Europe in 1914 with World War I .
This finally led to hyperinflation and a complete destruction of Germany 's Reichsmark in 1923 .
On a technical level , Germany 's hyperinflation was the result of the German Reichsbank monetizing the growing government debt , issued for financing social benefits , subsidies , and reparation payments .
In Age of Inflation ( 1979 ) , reviewing Germany 's hyperinflation from a political - economic viewpoint , Hans F. Sennholz asked , " Who would inflict on a great nation such evil which had ominous economic , social , and political ramifications not only for Germany but for the whole world ? " [ 5 ]
His sobering answer was that
[ e]very mark was printed by Germans and issued by a central bank that was governed by Germans under a government that was purely German .
It was German political parties , such as the Socialists , the Catholic Centre Party , and the Democrats , forming various coalition governments that were solely responsible for the policies they conducted .
Of course , admission of responsibility for any calamity cannot be expected from any political party . [ 6 ]
That said , the German hyperinflation was the result of a policy that considered the financing of government debt by an accelerating increase in the money stock as the politically least unfavorable method .
It seems that the state of opinion has n't actually changed much .
Today , there is great public support when it comes to expanding the base - money stock for financing ailing banks , insurance companies and , most important , rising government debt .
" The doctrines and theories that led to the German monetary destruction have since then caused destruction in many other countries .
In fact , they may be at work right now all over the western world . " [ 7 ]
Austrian economics would rightly maintain that current fiat - money polices have become increasingly inflationary — and they should have little doubt that the forces and instruments that can pave the way towards hyperinflation are already in place and gaining strength by the day .
The solution to a destruction of the currency is the return to sound money — free - market money — as outlined by Mises and further developed by Murray N. Rothbard .
It would presumably , at least in the initial stage , result in gold - backed money under 100 % reserves .
The edging up of the gold price seems to support the view that people consider gold as the ultimate means of payment — a status that will become increasingly obvious once people fear that the exchange value of fiat money will be eroded substantially .
It appears a court showdown is in the works between the NHL and Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie over the fate of the Phoenix Coyotes .
A spokesperson for the league said lawyers for the NHL would appear in federal bankruptcy court in Phoenix on Thursday , according to the Associated Press .
Spokesperson Frank Brown would not say what action the NHL would take in court - but earlier Wednesday NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said whether team owner Jerry Moyes had the authority to file for bankruptcy is " something we 're going to look into . "
Bettman wants to keep the Coyotes in Arizona .
He expressed doubt on Wednesday that Balsillie could convince league owners to allow him to purchase the team .
Balsillie made a $ 212.5 - million offer on Tuesday to purchase the ailing NHL franchise , on the condition that he can move the team to Southern Ontario .
The offer has not impressed Bettman , who has clashed with Balsillie in the past over his previous attempts to purchase an NHL franchise .
" I do n't know whether or not he could get approved , " Bettman said Wednesday during a meeting of commissioners from the four major professional sports leagues .
" That 's , as I said , something I do n't get a vote on .
If in fact it becomes an issue for board consideration , the board of governors of the league will make that decision . "
The NHL stripped current Coyotes owner , Jerry Moyes , of his duties running the day - to - day operations of the franchise after he announced Tuesday that the team filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
According to Bettman , the bankruptcy filing did not occur because creditors wanted to be paid , but because of Balsillie 's offer to buy and move the team .
The league will investigate whether Moyes had the authority to file the bankruptcy petition , Bettman said , before adding that the league would prefer to find new local owners rather than relocate the franchise .
" We think when a franchise is in trouble , you try and fix the problems , " Bettman said .
" That 's what we did in Pittsburgh and Ottawa and Buffalo prior to our work stoppage .
That 's what we did when the perception was that five out of the six Canadian franchises around the turn of the century were in trouble .
We fixed the problems .
We do n't run out on cities . "
Reports suggest that , in order to hasten the process , Balsillie has told Coyotes coach Wayne Gretzky that if he is able to purchase and move the team , he will build a new arena and name it after Gretzky 's father .
Sports writer Howard Bloom , publisher of Sports Business News , said he has heard that Balsillie has offered Gretzky a stake in the team worth between 10 and 15 per cent .
Bloom also reported speculation that Balsillie would build a new arena for the team named for Gretzky patriarch , Walter .
The overtures to Gretzky show Balsillie will do what it takes to become the owner of an NHL franchise , Bloom said , and the moves may just work .
" It 's not that far - fetched .
But as far as Gretzky , never say never , " Bloom said Wednesday on CTV Newsnet .
" And you know one thing about Wayne Gretzky : his heart is in hockey .
His heart is in his country .
And I 'm sure Wayne Gretzky , who has also stated that he believes there should be a second NHL franchise in Southern Ontario , would want to be a part of it . "
In addition to reaching out to the Great One , Balsillie has sweetened the deal for the NHL by offering $ 17 million in bridge financing to keep the team alive before the sale goes through .
His offer also stipulates that every investor in the team gets " 100 cents on the dollar the money they are owed , " Bloom said .
" You gotta like Jim Balsillie if for no other reason his tenacious desire to do this , " Bloom said .
" You do n't get to be a billionaire by being a bad businessman . "
Balsillie , the 48 - year - old co-CEO of Waterloo , Ont. - based Research in Motion -- which makes the BlackBerry wireless device -- has tried twice before to purchase an NHL team and move it to Canada .
In 2007 , he tried to purchase and move the Nashville Predators to Hamilton , Ont .
That offer was rebuffed .
Before that , he expressed interest in purchasing the Pittsburgh Penguins .
If Balsillie 's offer is accepted , the Coyotes would become the NHL's seventh Canadian franchise .
It would also be the team 's second stint in Canada .
The team was formerly the Winnipeg Jets between 1979 and 1996 .
Buying the team an ' exciting opportunity '
At a news conference on Tuesday night , Balsillie declined to say which city would host the team .
" What I will say is , I think this is an enormously exciting opportunity , " he said .
" I do n't have to tell anyone here it 's the greatest game in the whole wide world . "
Balsillie has launched a website , www.makeitseven.ca, for fans to show their support for his endeavour .
Coyotes captain Shane Doan , who was with the team when it moved from Winnipeg , said Wednesday that speculation the team may be moving yet again is upsetting , but part of the game .
" There 's a reason why I 've stayed there and a reason why I 've been in Phoenix for that long , " said Doan , a native of Halkirk , Alta. , who is currently competing for Canada at the IIHF World Hockey Championships in Switzerland .
" It 's not like I just got there .
This is home for my family and my kids .
" Obviously , it 'd be tough .
But that 's part of hockey and you deal with it . "
The head of the NHL Players ' Association , Paul Kelly , said the issue must be settled quickly because a new season starts in five months .
" You ca n't let the thing linger I would say much past the end of the month of June , " Kelly told The Canadian Press in Switzerland .
" I 'm hopeful the sides can either come together or the court will make the time to resolve these issues . "
Kelly added that he has long advocated for another team for the healthy Southern Ontario hockey market , be it in the Hamilton / Kitchener area , or a second team in Toronto .
Meanwhile , Canadian politicians are expressing their support of a second NHL team for Southern Ontario .
" I 'd love another NHL team in Canada . . . particularly Southern Ontario can support another team , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday in Prague , where he is engaged in trade talks with the European Union .
Harper would not comment specifically on the Balsillie deal , but did say he has spoken to some NHL owners about the possibility of another team in the region , in addition to the Toronto Maple Leafs .
And Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said Wednesday he would cheer for any new team in the province and believes that there are enough fans across the region to support more than one team .
But he added that he would not intervene in Balsillie 's efforts to purchase the Coyotes and would not offer taxpayer funds to help move the franchise .

First impressions and adventures in Nepal
March 6 , 2009 --
And here I am .
After too long speculating from the sidelines ( and sidelines 10,000 kilometres away ) I have finally arrived in the land of Mountains and Maoists .
On Tuesday night at about 10 pm , I landed in Kathmandu to see with my own eyes the processes unfolding here .
This is less of an in - depth analysis and more of a account of my personal experiences so far , which have been really intense .
I was met at the airport by a political comrade of mine , Narendra Jung Peter .
He has been an amazing help so far , and amongst many other things has helped arrange a room to stay , a sim card and introductions to already a mind - boggling amount of people .
So it was n't until Wednesday that I got to look around Kathmandu a little bit .
It 's an amazing place , and so unbelievably different to the comforts of the West .
To describe it best I think all that really needs to be said that it is loud , chaotic but amazingly open and friendly .
I 've been lost a few times already , but everywhere I go there are people more than happy to help me out , and have a chat which has been great .
There is a lot of political graffiti and posters on the walls in Kathmandu .
Most of it , at least where I am staying , is just residual stuff left over from previous events .
There is still a lot of stuff left over from the election , most of it Maoist [ United Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) -- UCPN ( Maoist ) ] .
I have some good photos .
Their are also a lot of posters , where I am they are mostly related to the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) UML congress that was held two weeks ago .
There was also some I saw in another part of the city advertising a program for the Newari ( an ethnic group ) National Liberation Front .
I am pretty sure this is a Maoist group , but unfortunately it has already taken place , so I could n't attend .
There have also been posters around where I am staying for the local shopkeepers ' union , but I have not yet found anyone to translate them for me .
There is some more recent stuff , there was a big slogan on one wall from the Maoists women 's group , which is organising something in regards to International Women 's Day , which I saw around , but the areas near the schools and universities are saturated with material , due to the ongoing student elections .
Hopefully I will be able to make contact with some of these students and get an insight to the student movements , as the struggle here has been fierce , often escalating into confrontations .
The last few days have been amazingly intense .
I have n't had time to think , it 's been really crazy , but so amazingly rewarding .
Again , Comrade Narendra Jung Peter has been an invaluable contact , and I already owe him more than I thought possible .
Yesterday I got up early to go see the Dabur Square .
It is an amazing place , it is the central square of Kathmandu and has temples and other architecture dating back literally over a thousand years .
It is an amazing mix of Nepali culture and architecture which is so amazingly impressive , with smaller additions and influences taken from other cultures that passed through the valley , as Kathmandu is on what was the traditional trade route between India and Tibet / China .
The exception to this rule of subtle influences is the domination of the beastly building that is sort of tacked onto the side of the old royal palace which is based on the Bank of England building in London .
There is nothing subtle about the imposition of this palace extension , and if endemic of the fact that while as a independent nation Nepal was able to resist becoming a part of the British Empire , the cultural ( and economic ) imperialism was n't able to be stopped at the border .
After seeing the Darbur Square Narendra called me and invited me to a meeting at the Ministry of Communications and Information on the need to spread responsibility and accountability within the media of Nepal .
Present at the meeting where ex-ministers , heads of journalist federations , veteran and respected journos , academics and editors ... and me .
Needless to say I felt a little out of my depth , especially as I do n't speak a word of Nepali , but it was still a good experience that I am very grateful for .
Their are many issues in the media at the moment .
Firstly and foremost , there is the issue of the Army integration , which has recently flared up .
The ( ex - royal ) Nepali Army recently went ahead and recruited several thousand new members , despite it being against the interim constitution , the peace agreement , the supreme court and the directions of the government and defence ministries .
However only in the last couple of days , in response to this , has the People 's Liberation Army also started a process of recruitment .
The right - wing media is now starting a shit storm about how the PLA is putting the peace process in jeopardy and the UCPN ( M ) is at fault .
It is a ridiculous argument , and the root cause of a the current issues is that the army is still loyal to the royals and the opposition , and not to the government .
There is also the issue of the load shedding .
Kathmandu is without power for up to 16 hours a day , which naturally is causing massive disruption to people 's lives and to the economy .
While Nepal is a Third World country and it definitely has issues with energy , there has recently ( since the Maoists formed government ) has been a noticeable increase in the problem .
While there no doubt has been chronic underfunding from the government for energy for years , I think that the recent increase in the problem is suspicious to say the least .
I will try and write articles on all the issues and also try and get some interviews done .
I also need to go to the countryside and see things a bit better as well and meet the rural people .
On a final note , the comrades I have spoken too here have really enjoyed Green Left Weekly .
I highly recommend it , it 's a great paper and that will be writing for it .
The PLA recruits -- what is the future of the peace process ?
March 8 , 2009 -- On March 3 , the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) of Nepal , which fought a ten - year war against what was then the Hindu Kingdom of Nepal started recruiting new soldiers to fill vacancies within this force .
This has been hailed by the media and political opposition ( both inside and outside of the government ) as a major hit to the integration of the armies and has been said to put the peace process in jeopardy .
However to come to these conclusions one has to disregard the facts and the real issues surrounding this recent controversy .
This recruitment has been in response to a recruitment by the ( ex - Royal ) Nepal Army .
The recruitment by the army took place against the instructions and orders of the defence ministry , the government , the Supreme Court , yet did not receive the same condemnation from the various political parties in opposition .
The political opposition , lea by the Nepali Congress , has called for this recruitment to be stopped , and has demanded that the United Communist Party ( Maoist ) halt the recruitment .
However the UCPN ( M ) is not in a position to do so , as the PLA no longer the military wing of that party .
It has repeatedly been stressed by both the UCPN ( M ) and the PLA that the PLA now takes its directions from and is loyal to the civilian government .
The PLA and the UCPN ( M ) both continue to reconfirm their commitment to the ongoing peace process and the process of creating the new Nepal .
It is the Nepal Army , with the political support of the opposition , which is putting the peace process in jeopardy and continues to move against the spirit of the people 's movement of 2006 and the mandate given to the Maoist - led government in the constituent assembly elections last year .
When placed in a position where despite its commitment to the peace process and the government , its opponent in the Nepali Army continues to grow and build its strength , the PLA is left with no option but to follow suit .
The peace process only can be brought to a logical conclusion when the two forces are integrated into a new , democratised national army , loyal only to the new Nepal .
Contrary to the opinion of the political opposition , the most pressing need in this matter is not to rehabilitate the PLA into the community , but ( as this whole episode shows ) to bring the rogue army back under the control of the civilian government , and dissolve both of these forces and then reintegrate them into a new national army for the new Nepal .
This however will be a struggle for the Maoist - led government as those inside and outside the army will fight tooth and nail to preserve it in its current state as insurance for the status quo .
It is clear to most observers that while the king may be gone and the constitution is still being written , the shape and form of the new Nepal is anything but certain , and is still to be played out in the future .
Some pictures and thoughts from the Peoples Liberation Army .
March 28 , 2009 --
For the last week I have been with the JanaMukti Sena , the Peoples Liberation Army .
Mostly with the 3rd Division , Kalyan / Anish Memorial Brigade .
This is the Peoples / Military Hospital .
Set up by the Peoples Liberation Army , it now serves both it and the public .
It has many facilities , including a pharmacy , an operating room for minor surgeries , a pre- and post-natal care facility and a female ward .
It was built by the PLA , and runs at next to no cost for the people of the area .
( I also fell ill at the camp , and it cost me 10 rupees , about 20 Australian cents , which included my medication . )
These were two married comrades ( please forgive , I only briefly met them and did n't record their names ) .
He was tending to their child while she was studying for her school - leaving certificate .
They are representative of many in the camp .
Many of the people I spoke to were studying .
As many members left school to join the PLA , many of them are now not qualified .
Many others just simply did n't have access to any real sort of schooling .
The PLA is now like a university -- everywhere people are studying something .
This is also a common scene , men often spend a lot of time tending to the children .
In fact in my time there I saw no division of labour based on sex -- women often could be seen with axes and saws in hand going off to cut wood while the men stayed to cook , clean and care for the children .
From left to right , Comrade Rakess , Comrade Sasila , myself and Comrade Agragg .
All aged in their early 20s , from the 6th Battalion .
Rakess left his wife and family in the village in order to fight .
Agragg has recently had his first child with his wife , who is an activist with the All Nepal Women 's Organisation ( Revolutionary ) .
Sasila came from a relatively wealthy background , but rebelled against it to join the fight against the caste system and injustice in her country .
Their interview of me went for at least as long as my interview with them .
Once they found out I was a progressive journalist they were full of questions about Australia , the struggle here , how strong the socialists are , our government , our government 's relations with Nepal and with the United States , the nature of imperialism , and what were the conditions for people in Australia .
Many journalists come to these camps and hear political talk from people , who were previously peasants , and write it off as ``brainwashing '' by some evil party .
These people are often uneducated , but they are not stupid .
They know exactly what they are doing and why .
They are thinking things through , and they crave information .
People who want to write off the " simple " people of Nepal -- do so at your own peril .
Women with guns .
Enough said .
This brigade was made up of a little over 20 % women , which is below the average for the PLA .
But while women were a minority , and are still under represented in the higher ranks , they are in my experience much more serious as a general rule .
Some of the male comrades were sometimes a little hazy , but the women were often the most political and well read .
Men on guard duty would often talk to me if I asked , while on duty the women would direct me on to someone else .
Left to right are Comrade Sedanta , ( comrade 's name unknown ) and Comrade Krishna .
Sedanta was a medic in the rebel army , but was wounded himself .
All three are currently studying , the books in the foreground are test papers for the coming exams .
The middle comrade is a Bhutanese refugee .
Almost 20 years ago Bhutan violently expelled a sixth of its population who were ethnic Nepalis .
His dream is that after helping the struggle here in Nepal , he will be able to return to his homeland and help the struggle against the violent and racist monarchy there .

WiFi Rail announces execution of BART contract .
Press Release
WiFi Rail Installing the First US High - Speed Mobile WiFi Network on BART
San Francisco , January 19 , 2009 : WiFi Rail Inc. and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District ( BART ) have finalized a 20 - year agreement to provide high speed mobile Wi-Fi access throughout the BART transit system and on all BART commuter trains .
WiFi Rail Inc. has designed and engineered a high - bandwidth network to provide mobile WiFi access throughout mass transit environments , with special focus on commuter rail lines and trains .
The company has demonstrated consistent network speeds capable of providing video to and from the train , Internet VPN , VOIP , train telemetry and a host of other applications that a giant wireless LAN can offer .
The company installed a demonstration network on 2.2 miles of the BART Hayward test track and in the four downtown San Francisco stations .
During the year of testing , more than 15,000 consumers registered and used the system more than 85,000 times , including live streaming video from the trains , proving the utility of the network .
Tests on trains moving at over 81 MPH have consistently demonstrated upload and download speeds in excess of 15 M bps .
Service on BART is scheduled to begin on selected segments during 2009 .
Four downtown San Francisco stations and some segments of the tunnels are already fully functional , and have been providing premium service free to subscribers for the past year .
“ We are thrilled to showcase our technology in the network designed for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit system , it is a great partnership , ” said Cooper Lee , CEO and inventor of the patent pending technology .
“ This is a unique opportunity to demonstrate what high - speed WiFi access , interconnected by a huge fiber - optic backbone , can mean to a transit system and its passengers . ”
The WiFi Rail deployment in the BART system will become the largest high bandwidth mobile Internet LAN in the United States .
Completion of network construction is planned for the end of 2010 .
The WiFi Rail network design can be expanded to provide a parallel network capable of a wide variety of network functions to support public safety and security needs , including those of Homeland Security .
Other transit operations , such as customer information services , and customer train car telemetry applications for maintenance management can be expanded through the network deployment .
The WiFi Rail network utilizes standards - based technologies which include a collapsed fiber - optic backbone , Cisco wireless Access Points , Routers , and Switches , and Apple OS - X servers .
Demographic studies indicate that approximately 71 % of commuter rail travelers carry a laptop , PDA or WiFi capable device and would utilize the services of mobile wireless connections .
Annual growth of WiFi capable handsets has been projected at 1300 % by 2010 .
With the explosion of data accessed by devices such as the iPhone and iPod touch , currently estimated to be 30 to 50 times that of legacy smart phone devices , and more WiFi capable devices on the way , mobile WiFi networks will be a key component of a connected world .
The WiFi Rail business model is based on network subscriptions - daily , monthly , and annually - as well as technology license arrangements .
WiFI Rail , Inc. , founded in late 2005 , has developed a high - speed wireless network design that is protected by pending patents in the US and abroad .
The WiFi Rail broadband wireless solution is uniquely tailored to address specific technical needs of commuter rail systems .
WiFi Rail has recently become a Cisco Advanced Technology Development Partner ( ATDP ) and is working tightly with the Advanced Technology and Research group allowing WiFi Rail to further enhance the underlying technology of the mobile network .

Jeff Goldberg has an interview with Binyamin Netanyahu that is probably more depressing than alarming , since you ’ve got to figure that the new Israeli prime minister is mostly blowing smoke when it comes to his over - the - top talk about Iran .
( He ’s entitled to blow , by the way , so long as the mullahs go around talking about Israel as a “ cancerous tumor . ” )
Netanyahu ’s view–if this effusion actually reflects his view–stands in opposition to much that is known about Iran and its leaders .
For one thing , they are a dismal , hateful , occasionally violent lot , but they have no history of behaving irrationally in international affairs .
As the 2007 NIE on Iran ’s bomb program found , the Mullahs will respond to international pressure–and Netanyahu seems to agree , here , when Goldberg catches him in an inconsistency :
“ I think the Iranian economy is very weak , which makes Iran susceptible to sanctions that can be ratcheted up by a variety of means . ”
When I suggested that this statement contradicted his assertion that Iran , by its fanatic nature , is immune to pressure , Netanyahu smiled thinly and said , “ Iran is a composite leadership , but in that composite leadership there are elements of wide - eyed fanaticism that do not exist right now in any other would - be nuclear power in the world .
That ’s what makes them so dangerous . ”
There are other notable examples of Netanyahu ’s ignorance and myopia in the interview .
This , for example , is vile to the point of borderline racism :
Iran “ wasted over a million lives without batting an eyelash …
It did n’t sear a terrible wound into the Iranian consciousness .
It was n’t Britain after World War I , lapsing into pacifism because of the great tragedy of a loss of a generation .
You see nothing of the kind . ”
It is also wildly untrue .
The impact of the Iraq war remains an open , searing wound in Iran .
You can see the victims on the streets in Iran , shaking and tearing uncontrollably , begging , with signs saying “ chemical victim of the war ” around their necks–or , at least , you could when I last visited in 2001 .
In fact , it is the memory of that war –Iran ’s helplessness against the rockets that fell in Tehran and Saddam ’s chemical attacks on the battlefield –that is a prime motivation for the desire to have a bomb as deterrence .
It is also a reason why those Iranians who are most opposed to the government do not resort to violence : “ We ’ve had too much of violence , ” a reform newspaper editor told me .
“ Every one of us has lost some one .
We want reform , not revolution . ”
Netanyahu is also completely wrong when he says that Iran , with a bomb , will be able to coerce Arab neighbors to its side .
The precise opposite is true : Iran with a bomb would touch off an Arab arms race .
The very prospect of Iran with a bomb is freaking out the Arabs now–in private , your average Egyptian , Jordanian or Saudi diplomat is far more passionate about the threat from Iran than the “ atrocities ” Israel undertook in Gaza .
So , what ’s going on here ?
A smokescreen , I suspect .
Netanyahu–who is opposed to a Palestinian state–is trying to draw attention away from illegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank , which continue to grow and threaten the possibility of a two - state solution .
He is also playing to the minority of American Jews who support neoconservative positions , especially the notion that Iran having a bomb would be somehow different , and more threatening , than Pakistan having a bomb–the idea that Iran is run by mad mullahs , who behave irrationally .
In truth , the Iranian factions that want to resume the bomb program are behaving with utmost rationality .
The single fact on the ground that makes an Iranian bomb extremely likely , if not inevitable , is the existence of Israel ’s bomb .
As long as the Israeli Prime Minister goes around threatening to attack Iran , the Mullahs are going to want some way to counter that .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Ashton Kutcher --
Twitter 's top tweeter -- warned he may pull the plug on his tweeting if the micro- blogging service partners on a reality TV show .
Ashton Kutcher said he might give up Twitter if the Web site 's parent company participates in a reality show .
" It 's all fun and games until somebody gets stalked , " Kutcher wrote in a Twitter posting late Monday .
Variety magazine reported Monday that San Francisco - based Twitter.com had partnered with TV producers Reveille and Brillstein Entertainment on an unscripted show that would be " putting ordinary people on the trail of celebrities in a revolutionary competitive format . "
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said there was " no official Twitter TV show " in the works , but " we have a lightweight , non-exclusive , agreement with the producers which helps them move forward more freely . "
Kutcher used Twitter to post a link to a news report about the partnership along with this message : " Wow I hope this is n't true .
I really do n't like being sold out .
May have to take a twitter hiatus . "
The actor , who boasts a record 2 million Twitter followers , frequently posts updates that take fans behind the scenes of his life and his current movie production -- " Five Killers . "
" Five Killers " director Robert Luketic , who caught Kutcher 's Twitter addiction , also suggested he would disappear from the Twitterverse .
" Ahh yeah .
If this is true my shop is closed , " Luketic tweeted in response to Kutcher 's message .
Kutcher challenged CNN last month in a race to 1 million Twitter followers , which he won .
His following has almost doubled that in the five weeks since .
His wife , actress Demi Moore , also threatened to shut down her Twitter account , which has more than 1 million followers .
" I hope this is n't true -- if it is , our Twitter time may come to a quick and sad end ! "
Moore tweeted Monday .
Moore 's willingness to let fans into her private life is illustrated by photos she posted last week showing her smile -- minus one front tooth .
They were taken while she was undergoing dental surgery .
Few stars in the past have allowed such images to be published , much less publishing them themselves .
She and Kutcher gained attention earlier this year when he posted a photo of his wife 's rear -- minus pants .
As Twitter 's popularity zoomed in recent months , more celebrities have joined -- some happily and others reluctantly .
While Kutcher has used Twitter as a direct way to communicate with fans -- upstaging tabloids and the paparazzi -- he tweeted to one fan Monday his reasons for opposing the TV show idea .
" Um how about ... I do n't want to be stalked !!! "
Kutcher tweeted .
Stone , who started Twitter just three years ago with co-founder Jack Dorsey , published a blog Monday saying that Twitter is " very open " and that " openness is not limited to the Web or even to mobile phones . "
" In dealing with networks and production companies we sometimes have simple agreements , " Stone wrote .
" Regarding the Reveille and Brillstein project reported today , we have a lightweight , non-exclusive , agreement with the producers which helps them move forward more freely . "
And , he wrote , " Twitter 's open approach might have the power to transform television -- the dominant communications receiver worldwide .
We 're very excited to see where these experiments take us . "
America and Russia are two major holdouts in the signing of a landmark agreement banning cluster bombs which both nations have used in the past with lethal effect to kill and maim children in Afghanistan .
Britain – a convert to the treaty – is among the 107 nations committed to signing the treaty which opened for signature today in Oslo .
It was the result of a determined “ coalition of the willing ” whose campaign to ban the bombs began after Israel ’s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon .
According to the UN , the Israeli cluster bombs used in that conflict scattered 4,000,000 bomblets which can be triggered by children attracted to their bright colours .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , cluster bombs have been used in recent conflicts despite the drive to ban them .
Both Russia and Georgia – equipped by Israel – are accused of having used cluster bombs in the Georgia conflict last summer .
According to Human Rights
Watch , the bombs , which fire dozens of bomblets when detonated , killed 17 civilians during the brief , bloody war and wounded dozens more .
“ Today we confirm that cluster bombs are banned for ever , ” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as he opened the conference in Norway , the nation leading the movement .
“ Banning cluster bombs took too long .
Too many people lost arms and legs . ”
The next to sign today were Laos – another convert which has had to deal with 400,000 unexploded munitions – and Lebanon .
The treaty will come into effect once ratified by 30 nations .
The campaign was inspired by the successful drive to ban landmines , which went outside the UN with the support of non-government organisations to deliver a treaty in 1997 .
This was despite strong resistance from a group of states which wanted to keep the weapons .
Campaigners hope that the cluster bomb treaty holdouts will be shamed into restricting their use or observing a moratorium , as happened with the 1997 Ottawa treaty .
The notable holdouts on cluster bombs – Russia , the US , China and Israel – are the same nations who refused to sign the Ottawa pact .
Snap Judgment Police Arrest , Ban Man from REI for Taking Photo
The Seattle Police Department is reviewing an incident on Friday , May 8 , in which officers arrested a 29 - year - old man and banned him from the Eastlake REI store after he used his phone to photograph two armored - car security guards who were servicing an ATM inside the store .
Shane Becker , a Seattle web designer , says he was standing in line at REI , getting ready to purchase a lock for his car 's bike rack , when he saw two Loomis security guards refilling the ATM .
Becker walked over and took a picture of the security guards and the open ATM with his phone .
On his blog , iamshane.com , Becker wrote that he took the photo because he's " fascinated by the insides of things that we do n't normally get to see . "
According to Becker , the armed security guards confronted him about the photo and threatened to tackle him if he tried to leave the store .
" Loomis wanted my ID so that they could write a report internally , " Becker says .
" They said they did n't know who I was or what I intended to do with the photograph or why I would want to take it . "
Becker refused to show the Loomis employees his ID , REI security got involved , and the police were called .
According to a police report , when officers arrived , one of the armed Loomis guards told police he was " concerned about his safety and was not sure if Becker was going to attempt to grab the money that was going into the ATM machine . "
Police claim Becker was " uncooperative " and refused to give them his ID , and they arrested him .
Becker acknowledges he would n't give police his ID , but says he was afraid they 'd hand it over to Loomis .
Police took Becker to the West Precinct and held him for about half an hour before requiring him to sign a " trespass admonishment " card barring him from returning to REI for a year .
On the morning of Tuesday , May 12 , Becker received an e-mail from SPD's Office of Professional Accountability informing him that a complaint had been filed against the officers on his behalf .
Kara Stone , general manager at REI 's Eastlake store , says the incident was " super unfortunate " and claims Becker was not banned from the store at the request of REI staff , although SPD records indicate otherwise .
" Shane is welcome to come into our store , " she says .
An employee named Frank who answered the phone at Loomis 's office would not comment on the incident or whether Loomis has any company policies about photography of staff members .
Doug Klunder , Privacy Project director at the Seattle branch of the American Civil Liberties Union , says cases like Becker 's are becoming more frequent .
" These come up all the time , and the ultimate answer ends up being yes [ the photographer ] had the right to take the photo and should not have been arrested and detained .
It would be really nice if officers would start realizing that [ before making an arrest ] rather than going through this rigmarole . "
Spotlight works great most of the time , but occasionally you may need to do a bit of tinkering to get it to work properly .
Most of us have probably had a problem where Spotlight wo n’t find a file you know is there .
Here are a few Terminal commands for changing hidden Spotlight settings , performing more complicated searches and updating the index .
Add a file to the Spotlight index
In theory , all files are added to the Spotlight index when they are created .
However , every now and again something goes wrong and a stubborn file might refuse to show up .
To manually add it to the index , you can use the following command .
Start by opening up Terminal ( located in Applications / Utilities ) .
Type in mdimport and then hit the space bar .
Next , find the file you want to add in the Finder , and drag it onto the Terminal window .
Terminal should automatically type in the path to the file for you .
Of course , if you know the path you can type it in manually yourself .
Finally , hit return and the file should now show up in you Spotlight searches .
Add a folder to the Spotlight index
Adding a folder works in exactly the same way as with a file .
However , in Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger and earlier , the command is slightly different if you want the contents of the folder to be indexed too .
In that case use mdimport -f instead .
You might want to use this to add the System folder with mdimport -f / System as it is n't searchable by default .
Search Spotlight from the Terminal
Considering Spotlight is so quick and easy to access , you will probably only use this if you are already working in the Terminal and want to find a file , or if you want some extra options .
To do a search , just type mdfind query where query is what you want to search for .
To limit this to a specific folder , instead use mdfind - onlyin ~/ Desktop query replacing ~/ Desktop with the path to your folder .
To run a “ live ” search which will update the results as users add files , use mdfind - live query .
Control - C will stop it updating .
To see all the other options , look at the man page by typing man mdfind into Terminal .
Re-index an entire drive
If you are having problems with your Spotlight index , you might want to start over and re-index your hard drive .
In the Terminal , type sudo mdutil - E / and hit return .
You may have to enter your password .
The existing Spotlight index will be deleted , and Spotlight will start creating a new index in the background .
You can re-index other hard drives by changing the command to include their name , like sudo mdutil - E / Volumes / OtherHardDrive .
Re-index a specific file format
When Spotlight adds a file to the index , it checks to see if it recognises the file type and then uses an mdimporter plugin to index the contents if it does .
Each file format has its own plugin , and most are located in Macintosh HD / System / Library / Spotlight or Macintosh HD / Library / Spotlight .
Double clicking on a plugin will give you the option to re-index all the files associated with it .
Alternatively , you can do this from the Terminal with the command mdimport -r .
For example , mdimport -r / System / Library / Spotlight / Chat. mdimporter would cause all of your chat files to be re-indexed .
Add a new file format to the Spotlight index
One of the great things about Spotlight is that it will index the contents of many types of files .
For example you can search for a word written in a PDF document or the telephone number of one of your contacts .
Many third party applications require plugins to make Spotlight index their file 's contents , which are available on the Apple Spotlight plugins page .
Make Spotlight index source code
Apple 's developer tools come with a source code mdimporter plugin that allows Spotlight to search the contents of your source code .
However , if do n't want to install the developer tools ( it 's a big download ) then you can just modify the rich text mdimporter plugin to handle the same job .
Go to Macintosh HD / System / Library / Spotlight and find the RichText . mdimporter file .
Right - click on it and choose " Show Package Contents " .
Inside the Contents folder , double - click on the info . plist file to open it in TextEdit .
Near the top you will see a list that looks like this :
< string>public.rtf</string > < string>public.html</string > < string>public.xml</string > < string>public.plain-text</string > < string>com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text</string > < string>com.apple.rtfd</string > < string>com.apple.webarchive</string > < string>org.oasis-open.opendocument.text</string > < string>org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document</string >
You can add any of the following lines to the end of this list to enable Spotlight to index the contents of the specified format :
< string>public.c-header</string > < string>public.c-plus-plus-header</string > < string>public.c-source</string > < string>public.objective-c-source</string > < string>public.c-plus-plus-source</string > < string>public.objective-c-plus-plus-source</string > < string>com.sun.java-source</string > < string>public.perl-script</string > < string>public.python-script</string > < string>public.csh-script</string > < string>public.shell-script</string > < string>public.ruby- script</string > < string>public.php-script</string > < string>com.netscape.javascript-source</string >
When you are done , you will want to double - click on RichText .
mdimporter to re-index all these file formats .
If you have another file format that is a really just a text file under the hood , you can find out what to add to the info .
plist file by running mdimport -n - d1 somefile.ext in the Terminal .
The output should contain a " type " that looks something like the items in the list above .
Remove something from the Spotlight index
This is really straightforward , but I thought I 'd include it for completeness .
Simply go to System Preferences and click on Spotlight .
In the Privacy tab , click the plus (+ ) and choose your file or just drag it from the Finder .
Rambutan is a tropical fruit native to Indonesia and the Phillipines that we seldom see on the mainland .
The name either means " hairy " in Indonesian , or " weird hairy red pods from an alien life form , " I forget which .
It sure tastes good though .
When you cut the hairy pod open there 's a white fruit inside that tastes a lot like lichee .
To celebrate my first day of vacation in Kona today , I had rambutan for breakfast along with a loco moco .
Loco moco is a favorite Hawaiian breakfast .
It 's a plate of rice topped with a hamburger patty , smothered in mushroom gravy and garnished with a fried egg .
I like my loco moco with Spam , but the resort where I am staying claimed they did n't have any .
So I 'll have to save the breakfast Spam for another day .

We all know that there are infiltrators into the various patriot movements .
Old news .
But that is not what I discuss in this article .
I may be wrong , but I think something far more serious is going on : I think that the biggest , strongest patriot movements ( Alex Jones and the Truth Movement , Campaign for Liberty , etc. ) are about to completely damaged or hijacked so that they no longer exist , and are completely destroyed .
This is the New World Order tactic , so none of us should be surprised , just like I was not surprised when the Ron Paul Presidential run was run off the road and taken over almost effortlessly , it seems , before the first votes in New Hampshire were cast .
So let ’s get into this issue …
A telltale sign : Ann Coulter now supports Ron Paul .
If Ann Coulter is so ‘ awake ’ now , endorsing Ron Paul and stating that he was right about everything , why wo n’t she then talk about the things that Ron Paul discusses : the Fed , Codex Alimentarius , the North American Union , the WTO and IMF , what the Second Amendment really is all about , and so on ?
There is something funny going on here … and I think I know what .
If Glen Beck is such a patriot and such a rebel of the mass media now , also promoting Ron Paul , why ca n’t his research team , after searching for over a week as Beck said , simply find any of the dozens of news articles in Newsweek , the New York Times , the Houston Chronicle , and so on , about the massive FEMA camps all over ?
Answer : he ’s lying .
Why is the mass media moving into our territory now , discussing some of the same issues we Truthers and patriots discuss , all of a sudden ?
If this keeps up , even as Alex Jones hinted at last week , his radio show “ could become passé ” .
In other words , the movement will be hijacked from Jones , Ron Paul , and other leaders in the genuine patriot movements by the mass media ( and the New World Order that controls the mass media ) , and the mass media will have control of them , just as they almost effortlessly took over the Ron Paul Presidential run ’s momentum in the days before the New Hampshire Primary .
Let me explain what I think is really going on .
Consider these facts :
1 . All of a sudden , starting around late last fall , right when the stock market crash was going on , with a vengeance , the mass corporatist media began telling us that there is a New World Order and a coming world government .
And since then , the mass media tells us either that this New World Order and coming world government is great , or they would tell us that it ’s bad and it ’s only about the bankers — they do n’t tell us , for example , that it ’s project of the occultist and militaristic corporatists behind the scenes , or that it traces back to Hitler — I did n’t hear Beck cover that story !
2 . That same mass media is telling us that the old system is the cause of the economic collapse , and “ oh no [ ‘ wink wink ] , the people might revolt against it ( against system and / or the bankers ) ” .
That “ old system ” referred to in 2 is , we are told by the thought - controlling mass media , not the country the Founders set up for us , but rather :
3. our current system of government ( which is far from the libertarian Founders ’ government , and which is now actually a corporatist system where the government is a ceremonial government , like the Roman Congress was in ancient Rome ) , 4 . the banks ( but not the globalist banks , IMF , etc. ) , 5 . capitalism ( sure we never really have had it in the past 150 years — instead we ’ve only had corporatism — but what traces of capitalism we ’ve had are now being castigated [ ‘ GM ’s failed business model ’ , etc. ] or called nonexistent by the mass media , needing to be replaced by socialistic systems , such as with the NewsWeek cover story : “ We Are All Socialists Now ” )
And there are other odd things going on , such as
6 . Ann Coulter , who has been unwavering and incredibly rabid and virulent in her pro-war hate for Middle Eastern people , all of a sudden is supporting the most anti-war presidential candidate in decades , saying he was right all along — um … did I hear that right ?
There are other examples , but these are all stunning , and they are quite new in the mass media .
Is any of this making any sense ?
Because it ’s really confusing me —
Anne Coulter has never used reason , but now suddenly she wants to ?
I think it ’s all sounding more like the old “ wolf in sheep ’s clothing ” than anything else .
To understanding the conclusions I am going to bring out in this article , you will have to interconnect all these points , 1 - 6 , at once .
Let ’s continue …
We are being told in the mass media in various ways that these systems ( 1 - 3 ) have failed us , that ’s really the problem , and those systems need to be changed ( eradicated ) in one way or another .
But all this ( and so much more ) has been going on all along for centuries — the banks robbing us , etc . — so why now does the mass media all - at - once decide to announce a few of these tid- bits to us that they ’ve covered up for decades ?
If the mass media suddenly wants to tell us how the banks have ripped us all off , well why did n’t they tell us that in 1913 , the 1980s , or maybe even just in 2007 ?
And why not tell us that Obama supported it all ?
But more importantly , why all - at - once , right at this particular point in time , are we getting these few tid- bits from the mass media ?
Answer : look what it is doing to the patriot movements ; it ’s becoming them .
Now , also consider that the mass media is telling us a few more things simultaneously , in addition to 1 - 6 :
7. world government is the solution to the failed systems and to the economic collapse , and 8 .
The “ conspiracy people ” were right about a all along .
Now , notice , again , that 1 - 8 are all happening at once !
Coincidence ?
Hard to believe .
The robots and extremists of the mass media ( Beck , Hannity , Savage , Limbaugh , Coulter , O’Reilly , and others . ) have been such robotic and unfathomable traitors through the years that they can only be carrying out an agenda now too , not trying to report news , attract an audience , or keep their ratings high .
Why else would they bring all this up at the very same time ?
Perhaps Alex Jones is correct , and these propagandists are suddenly just worried about their ratings and their competition from the alternative media .
This may be true , but as I said , my theory is that there ’s something more serious going on .
[ efoods ]
Here ’s the issue : the New World Order wants worldwide rioting , mass death , economic collapse , sacrifice of lower minions and freemasons of the New World Order , compliance with the climate change laws and servitude , and a set up of a Brave New World , all over the course of the next decade or decades .
What better way is there to do this than to shock and clean - the - slate of the populace of the world ( often called “ shock doctrine , ” as a recent book discussed ) to get them ready for big changes and compliance with a new world , right when the populace is getting desperate and un - thought - out due to their desperation and increasing poverty , than by introducing them with information about how evil the world leaders are and world system is ( but all along keeping the real completely unseen master corporatists out of the picture ) ?
Answer : you merely implement 1 - 8 , where a key element in that and to cause revolt is to hijack the real patriot movements with the vacuous , uninformed , undirected , and undisciplined false “ patriotism ” of Beck , Coulter , and the rest , by simply taking over their discussions , as seems to be starting right now with Coulter , Beck , and others .
There !
That ’s the issue , and it could easily result in a quick total hijacking of the power the patriot movements have accumulated .
Proof that the New World Order wants to use the Truth Movement and similar movements for the aforementioned aims was possibly even seen last weekend when some news agencies said that the Pittsburgh police shooting was due to the shooter listening to the words of Glen Beck and Alex Jones ( notice how those two were coupled together ) , not because of , for example , the violent tendencies of the shooter ( he was accused of assaulting a girlfriend in the past ) , his economic hardships , or some other cause .
As if Alex Jones has ever promoted violence against police , rather than mild civil disobedience , and / or taking over the government by the people ( the latter being the often - mentioned trademarked “ Alex Jones solution ” to the New World Order takeover of the country ) .
( Also note that if this is true , there also may be an additional divide - and - conquer maneuver already being set up as 1 - 8 are implemented : set the revolting parts of the populace against the non-revolting parts . )
If Ann Coulter is so “ awake ” and patriotic now , why does n’t she point out that alcohol and Big Pharma kills hundreds of thousands each year , many times what violence does , or violence with guns , and not listening to Alex Jones or Glen Beck ?
Answer : because she ’s carrying out the typical Big Media agenda that she ’s ordered to .
Nothing new .
Now , also remember before 9/11 , when Alex Jones predicted it a few weeks before ?
He was able to do that because the mass media — the mouthpiece and brainwashing device of the New World Order — was telling us it was going to happen .
Does n’t it seem like the mass media is again telling us something here , also , when you interconnect points 1 - 8 ?
They are telling us that 1 - 8 will happen , that the old world and our current way of life will be destroyed , that We the People will destroy it with our riots , with our contributing to the economic problems , and through our adherence to the old system of government ( described above ) , so that the new communism will inevitably set in — it ’s all the fault of We the People .
Now where have we heard this sort of a story before !
( Hint : after World War II , we were told that the war was caused by the mass madness of the world citizenry , not by the New World Order , and thus Truman had to set up all those mental health acts that he did in order that We the People could be cured of our irrationalism . )
So , the mass media , again , is merely telling us what is going to happen , that it ’s all our fault .
So , let me summarize : it is clear to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that the corporatist New World Order is now using what most of us think of as the most hard - core of the patriot movements in order to carry out their agenda .
LET ME SAY THAT IN DIFFERENT WORDS SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM GETTING ACROSS TO YOU :
The real patriot movements are getting so large , so powerful , so pervasive , that the New World Order has no choice but to fully hijack these movements if they are to carry out their planned Brave New World agendas .
More specifically : the New World Order is going to make our Truth and Patriot movements their primary tools of operation to carry out Eugenics and so forth .
That ’s my theory , and my prediction .
How , you might ask , will it all work ?
Well , if you want to get a revolt going , why not disclose false flag terror ( such as Michael Savage started to do recently for the first time on his radio show where he foretold Obama ’s upcoming Reichstag ) ?
That sure would do it if the mass media went that far and all - at - once got this the real - ness of false flag terror into the minds of the sappy and unfocussed citizenry , shocking them to the core by totally upsetting their established belief system , all right when that citizenry was destitute , in a depression , filled with bird flu epidemic fears , with millions living tent cities , hungry and cold , and so on , as is most likely going to be the case this fall or winter .
Was Savage ’s recent comment a prelude to this ?
It is quite obvious the New World Order is pushing for violence , as Alex Jones has been pointing out .
The New World Order , through our city , state and Federal governments , is pushing the populace so hard now , more and more each day , with impossible taxation ( who can pay all the taxes as we fall into massive depression ? ) , with crazy new laws ( banning home - schooling , etc. ) , police taserings , making home gardens illegal ( just like the King in the book Robin Hood banned hunting deer ) , announcing that the bankers are robbing us , announcing that the government is not helping the economic crisis but is fuelling it ( of course they do n’t disclose all the details with this ) , and most importantly , getting ready to remove the Second Amendment and all of the Constitution .
They are creating a system where we are not Americans , but where we are all living like the slaves on the plantations in the 1800s , where only revolt ( violence ) could follow , because it is being pre-planned , and our movements are going to be used to fuel the violent revolts , unless we wake up to this possibility and start discussing these issues with urgency .
Do n’t forget how quickly the Ron Paul Presidential run was hijacked !
So what does the New World Order want with all the rioting ?
Well , there are several things .
Firstly , this is part of the New World Order ’s religious festival : spread as much mayhem , panic , misery and pure blood chaos as possible — this is a ‘ work of art ’ to the New World Order ; it is like listening to Beethoven to them .
Some of you may find this difficult to understand , but they attain their religious experience by this “ theater ” , as they often call it ( remember Iraq was called a “ theater ” around the time of Shock and Awe ?
Notice the word “ Awe ” there , also ) .
If you still have trouble believing this , then ask yourself a question :
What is the New World Order waiting for in killing billions ?
They ’ve had super technology to kill as many of us as they want to for decades .
They are building up our numbers in order to slaughter us , because the slaughter itself is their art , their high , just like the ancient hallucinatory ballgame ( the ‘ pitzlawal ’ , as it ’s called by the Maya ) of death - entertainment was for the Mayan shaman kings , a little like the ancient Roman gladiator fights , and a lot like the carnage in Iraq .
What is beautiful to the New World Order is a world of deformed , sickened , ultra-violent , unintelligent desperate people , like the Island of Dr. Moreau .
That ’s the religious festival of the New World Order , and the aforementioned rioting is a key issue involved .
If we want to be free , to be kings of ourselves , we have to realize this , to know the enemy as best we can , or else we will just go along the pitzlawal we are all currently caught in .
The way to be kings of ourselves is to become intelligent , knowledgeable , deeply and genuinely religious , and self - sufficient in the way the Indians used to be — that ’s the sort of civil disobedience we need , and which Henry David Thoreau lived when he wrote his influenial book on civil disobedience .
Ok , so a New World Order religious festival is the first point of the rioting .
Another is that the rioting is the way to transform the nation into a shock state , and thus bring about an entry of the Brave New World .
The old world has to be destroyed in order to set up the new world , and that means that our minds , our memories , our ways of life , and our peaceful day - to - day lifestyles of American comfort , the security for our families , and so on , all have to be destroyed , sending us into a mass state of shock ( “ shock doctrine ” ) .
I think a lot of people in our movement are oblivious to this intention , this plan , this hijacking of our movement .
But is n’t that what they always do ?
So , what should we do ?
Do we panic and start fighting with all the other patriots and Truthers for every little thing we disagree over ?
I disagree with other Truthers about many ideas , so should I fight with them about that constantly ?
Or should I fight the enemy ?
We of course must focus on the fight .
But what is the fight ?
The fight is the fight for truth .
But what is the truth ?
The truth is what we can experience and see with our eyes , right in front of our face .
And what we see is the destruction of the Constitution and of the nation we live in .

Updated , May 6 , 5:15 p.m. | Bruce Riedel , who was chairman of President Obama ’s strategic review of United States policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this year , says that , while not inevitable , a jihadist state in Pakistan is a real possibility .
Updated , May 6 , 11:15 a.m. | Michael E. O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution offers his views on a pre-emptive strike against Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons .
As the Pakistani military launched a new offensive against the Taliban in the country ’s North - West Frontier Province , officials and former officials in Washington continued to discuss what the American response should be to the heightened conflict .
How should the United States respond ?
And how secure are Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons ?
Averting the Worst
Bruce Riedel , a former C.I.A. officer , is a senior fellow in the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution .
He was chairman of President Obama ’s strategic review of United States policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this year .
Just before her murder in December 2007 former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said , “ I now think Al Qaeda can be marching on Islamabad in two to four years . ”
Today her prophecy seems all too real .
The mayor of Karachi , a mega city of 18 million , tells me the Taliban alliance is now threatening to take over his city .
Al Qaeda ’s allies in Pakistan , the Taliban , Lashkar e Tayyba , and other extreme jihadists , are becoming increasingly powerful .
They are no longer confined to the tribal belt along the Afghan border but have built strong bases of support in the nation ’s heartland , the Punjab , and in the major cities .
The mayor of Karachi , a mega city of 18 million , tells me the Taliban alliance is now threatening to take over his city , the country ’s only major port and NATO ’s logistical supply line for the war in Afghanistan .
A jihadist state in Pakistan is neither imminent nor inevitable , it may not be likely , but it is a real possibility .
A jihadist Pakistan would be a strategic nightmare for America , south Asia and the world .
It would provide al Qaeda and other terrorist groups with the ultimate sanctuary in the worlds ’ second largest Muslim state , protected by nuclear weapons , with a global diplomatic presence and Pakistani Diaspora that could be used to support terror .
A jihadist takeover would make the NATO mission in Afghanistan increasingly untenable .
It would be a direct threat to both Hindu India and Shia Iran , encouraging both to expand and accelerate their own nuclear programs .
Thus it is critical that the United States do what it can now to strengthen the Pakistani moderate center which is resisting the jihadist Frankenstein .
Congress should pass the Kerry - Lugar legislation that triples economic aid and the Pentagon ’s proposals for increasing counter - insurgency assistance to Pakistan with a minimum of conditionality .
Trying to legislate changes in Pakistani behavior is a recipe for disaster — as the history of U.S. - Pakistan relations demonstrates — now is the time to support Pakistanis who are ready to resist extremism and jihadism .
Two Worrisome Cases
Rolf Mowatt - Larssen , a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School ’s Belfer Center , is a former director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former senior C.I.A. intelligence officer .
Pakistani nuclear weapons fall under the control of the military , which is the most professional , disciplined and competent institution in the country .
It takes nuclear security extremely seriously , and will surely adopt heightened measures to protect these weapons .
That said , authorities in every country possessing nuclear weapons worry about the possibility of insiders who are willing to assist terrorists steal a weapon or gain access to facilities containing nuclear weapons and materials .
The United States , for example , has invested considerable resources in measures to prevent terrorists from recruiting people at nuclear sites .
One security risk comes from extremists collaborating with insiders to exploit a lapse in the defenses .
But the U.S. does not have to secure nuclear weapons and materials amid rising extremism and instability in the country .
No matter how assuring Pakistani authorities may sound publicly , one hopes they are quietly preparing to face possible sudden and unanticipated challenges to their control over nuclear weapons and facilities .
They face two fundamental problems in this regard .
First , there is no such thing as perfect security : the loss of one weapon or takeover of one nuclear facility would precipitate a crisis .
The chain of security across a dispersed line of nuclear assets is only as strong as its weakest link .
The risk is that extremists collaborating with insiders are able to seize an opportunity to exploit a lapse in the defenses .
Second , the insider threat is not theoretical .
Twice since the 9/11 attacks , the U.S. taken action to break up networks inside Pakistan ’s nuclear establishment who were collaborating with outsiders in efforts to help them build bombs .
In both cases , rogue senior officials and their cohorts in the nuclear establishment were not caught by Pakistan ’s military , security and intelligence establishment .
The network run by the father of the Pakistani bomb , Abdul Qadeer Khan , channeled sensitive nuclear technologies to Libya , North Korea and Iran for years under the noses of the Pakistani establishment , before it was taken down in 2003 .
( Credit : Associated Press )
The second case involved the Umma - Tameer - E- Nau , which was founded by Pakistani nuclear scientists with close ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
It was headed by Bashiruddin Mahmood , a retired senior Pakistan Atomic Energy Agency official who had headed Pakistan ’s Khushab Atomic Reactor .
He discussed Al Qaeda ’s nuclear aspirations with Osama bin Laden .
In assuring the security of nuclear weapons in Pakistan , we should remind ourselves that the insider threat is the key wild card .
The record is troubling , especially when one considers the probable outcome had the U.S. not intervened as it did to neutralize threats as they became known .
The next time a nuclear threat emerges , will Pakistani authorities catch it in time ?
The U.S. should do everything in its power to ensure they can .
Nuclear terrorism is not just a problem for Pakistan and the region .
Terrorist acquisition and movement of nuclear materials represents a real and growing global threat , because the detonation of one nuclear bomb in any city in the world would change the course of history .
Other Threats : A Coup or Chaos
Karin von Hippel is co-director of the Post - Conflict Reconstruction Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
A Taliban and Al Qaeda takeover of Pakistan , along with its nuclear arsenal , pose the worst - case scenario for Western policymakers and far too many Pakistanis .
But two other , less extreme scenarios also cause serious concern .
The first would be yet another military coup , potentially led by junior officers with sympathy for the Islamist militants .
Many of these junior officers are largely unknown to their counterparts in the West , unlike the senior military officers .
This lack of familiarity is the result of U.S. sanctions placed on Pakistan between the end of the Cold War and Sept. 11 , 2001 , moves that were intended to punish the country for its nuclear program and , later , for a military coup .
The second nightmare scenario would be continued state disintegration , resulting in competing militias , terrorist groups and criminal gangs in charge of most of Pakistan ’s provinces and territories , with the government exercising only nominal control over parts of the capital city and — maybe — some of the nuclear weapons .
Any of these scenarios will have enormous consequences for the South Asia region , home to nearly half the world ’s population .
Any of these formulations will have direct and enormous consequences not only for the people and governments in the greater South Asia region — home to nearly half the world ’s population and several nuclear - armed states — but also further afield in Europe and North America .
In contrast , the best case scenario would be a full embrace by the Pakistani security forces of counter - insurgency doctrine –- notably protection of the civilian population , improved delivery of social services and successful application of the rule of law –- along with much - needed political and economic reforms throughout the country .
What should the United States and its allies do to help move the country in the right direction ?
While the top levels of the U.S. government –- in both the military and civilian spheres –- are already working very closely with their counterparts in Pakistan and in the region , greater efforts also need to be made to align the Pakistani people with their own government and these external efforts .
In Pakistan ( and to a degree in Afghanistan ) , too many citizens still think they are being asked to fight America ’s war , and are not fully convinced that they are facing an internal security threat from the Taliban , Al Qaeda , narco - criminals , warlords or other militia groups .
Many also view their own government as corrupt and incapable of providing even basic justice .
To enhance diplomatic , development and military efforts , the U.S. government should support an extensive countrywide campaign that personalizes the victims and the heroes , telling the stories of those who were butchered by the Taliban and those who successfully resisted .
This should be paired with extensive support for the very robust civil society organizations operating throughout the country .
No Consistent U.S. Response
Danielle Pletka is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute .
American South Asia policy is terminally afflicted by strategic attention deficit disorder ( SADD ) .
In the three decades since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , the United States has trusted the Pakistanis ( and allowed the ISI to run mujahedeen operations ) , mistrusted the Pakistanis ( and sanctioned them for developing the nuclear weapons they developed five years before the sanctions ) , trusted the Pakistanis ( and climbed into bed with Pervez Musharraf as the terror fighting hero of the post 9/11 era ) , dumped Musharraf , embraced Benazir Bhutto and then her widower , and now we ’re about to dump the widower .
Neither Bush or Obama were interested in scrutinizing where U.S. aid goes and what it achieves , preferring to trumpet mere expenditure as policy .
In light of the fact that successive American directors of the C.I.A. have labeled South Asia the world ’s most dangerous nuclear flashpoint , the fact that 9/11 was plotted in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan , that Islamists affiliated with al Qaeda now dominate significant swaths of Pakistani territory , and that we have two nuclear armed nations eying each other warily , the administration ’s confusion is staggering .
What ’s the nightmare scenario ?
This is it .
We have another president in Washington who believes that if he only finds the right president ( of Pakistan , Afghanistan , whatever ) , the situation on the ground will improve .
Another president who believes that more troops equals better strategy .
Another president who believes that nuclear weapons and the creeping domination of territory is something that can be managed by better diplomacy .
Another president that has been persuaded , as Secretary Gates said today , that Saudi Arabia can help manage our problems .
These problems are n’t going to be solved by having special envoys with better titles , or subcontracting American defense to Saudi Arabia .
We need clear indications of long term American commitment to the region , training and equipping of the Pakistani military , and effectively integrated military and aid programs .
And what of the billions that have already been spent ?
Like soldiers , money should not be obligated without a strategy .
Neither Bush or Obama were interested in scrutinizing where U.S. aid goes and what it achieves , preferring to trumpet the mere expenditure as policy .
Absent these changes , we are inviting our enemies to believe again in American weakness .
And we know where that led the last time .
The Risks With Bombing
Michael E. O’Hanlon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
What could we do if Pakistan collapsed and the security of its roughly 100 nuclear weapons could no longer be vouched for ?
The answer , in most scenarios , is that we could only usefully do what the Pakistanis themselves ( or whatever fraction of their government and military remained intact at the time ) might ask us to do .
Unilateral American action would probably be too little , too late .
Some might say , are n’t Pakistani nuclear weapons in easily identified sites that we could target with air power or special forces , and destroy , if necessary ?
Such an option might be worth considering if the alternative were to allow nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of extremists .
A lot could be done if a joint U.S. - Pakistan mission were created to secure perimeters around nuclear sites .
But the timing and the logistics would be challenging .
We would not want to bomb sites that remained in government hands , even if Pakistani forces seemed to be gradually losing control of the situation .
Yet if we waited even an hour or two after the sites were seized , the weapons could already have been removed .
The flight time for American bombers operating from the military base Diego Garcia might be too long , even if the aircraft had been predeployed and authorized to strike the sites .
There is also the danger that our weapons would not penetrate the hardened facilities , mostly likely underground .
( In theory , U.S. special forces could in theory penetrate almost any site if they could be deployed in adequate numbers to fend off insurgents , and fast enough to beat the insurgents to the bombs .
But those assumptions might be dubious . )
Moreover , there could be weapons in sites we do n’t know about , since the Pakistanis do n’t trust us entirely and the locations of all their weapons are unlikely to be fully known .
As American officials have noted , some weapons could be in transit at a given moment , especially if the Pakistanis came to believe that the security of their nuclear bunkers was in jeopardy .
On the other hand , if Pakistan and its leaders were willing to ask for help to create secure perimeters around nuclear sites , the United States could do a lot .
Such a joint mission would also be a useful deterrent against possible Indian actions against such sites .
I doubt things will get this bad , but if they do , let ’s hope Islamabad has the good sense to request our collaboration on the ground .
Needed : Patience and Restraint
Ellen Laipson is president of the Stimson Center , a nonprofit , nonpartisan institution dedicated to international security issues .
She was vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council from 1997 to 2002 .
After years of the much touted cooperation on “ terrorism , ” it is not clear if the United States and Pakistan have a sufficient convergence of interests .
In the last several weeks , confidence in Pakistan ’s ability to manage its many challenges has eroded .
Violence from the western provinces intrudes into the urban centers , the civilian elected government has made some regrettable choices that have damaged consensus about democracy and the rule of law , and the true intentions of the military and its subordinate intelligence units toward the radical Islamists including the Taliban are enduring concerns .
But a security breakdown at the nuclear facilities and total takeover of the state by the Taliban are exceedingly low probability scenarios , and should not be the main focus of American attention and concern .
Rather , we still need to devote time and effort to building trust in our long - term intentions , and avoid antagonizing Pakistan ’s tense leadership .
For example , the Obama - Biden plan to expand funding for education and basic human needs may help counter some of the acute anti-Americanism that sees Washington , even under Obama , pursuing a military strategy that has harmed Pakistani civilians .
We are a supporting cast player in Pakistan ’s strategy for economic development and political reform ; we should have no illusions that we will be able to determine the pace or outcomes of change .
But such engagement may be critical to putting the immediate security cooperation into a context that is more palatable for Pakistan ’s people and its leaders .
The Civilian - Driven Solution
Parag Khanna , senior research fellow in the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation , is the author of “ The Second World : How Emerging Powers are Redefining Global Competition in the Twenty - First Century . ”
Gen. David Petraeus , head of the United States Central Command , has stated that the next two weeks are crucial to Pakistan ’s survival , while David Kilcullen , the counterinsurgency expert , has said that the country could collapse within six months .
General Kiyani , Pakistan ’s
Army chief , could declare martial law imminently if his counter - offensives in the Swat region prove ineffective in stemming Taliban infiltration into the Punjab .
For counterinsurgency , boost police recruitment and training and corral civilian forces to build roads , schools , hospitals and government offices .
But that action will mean little unless the Pakistani government can regain control of the restive Pashtun - dominated provinces , or risk losing its nominal authority over those areas forever .
On the political level , the National Assembly must pass a constitutional amendment to integrate the Federally Administered Tribal Areas into the Northwest Frontier Province and mandate a fresh round of provincial elections .
This would give the government some way to replace gradually the Frontier Crimes Regulation , the British - era laws that were imposed to control the Pashtun tribal areas and which have abetted the Taliban ’s rise in those regions .
President Zardari must also allow the sign the Political Parties Act to allow the formation of political groups in those areas .
These steps would allow the government to assert sovereignty and justify a strengthened presence of the Frontier Corps and police to monitor elections , while forcing the Taliban to consider secular options .
A smarter balance between military and police efforts is also needed .
Pakistan needs to launch its own indigenous version of the NATO - led Provincial Reconstruction Teams , which have had some success in maintaining local order , building relationships with district - level authorities , and stimulating small - scale economic activity .
Yet while the focus to date has been almost exclusively on military - driven counterinsurgency , this requires boosting police recruitment and training while corralling civilian forces to oversee the construction of roads , schools , hospitals , and government offices .
For its part , the military must now focus on internal defense , disrupting militant networks which have gained strength even in the Punjabi heartland .
If the recent protests against Talibanization rippling across continent are any indication , the secular elites are becoming quite vocal .
This sliver of the population together with Pakistan ’s wealthy diaspora could play an influential role in restoring unity among Pakistan ’s many factions .
The future of transportation is now available for lease .
In the next few weeks , 450 consumers in California , New York and New Jersey will begin picking up fully electric Mini coupes , charging them at home and using them as their daily commuters for the next year .
They ’ll pay $ 850 a month , plus taxes and insurance , for the right to drive the first highway - legal electric cars that do n’t cost more than $ 100,000 to hit the streets in more than a dozen years .
As such , they ’ll serve as pioneers in what ’s being hailed as the next great moment in automobile history : the electric car era .
Never mind the fact that the lease cost on a Mini E is twice that of a regular Mini or that since the battery fills up the back seat , it fits just two people , said Nick Howell , a Pacific Palisades - based technology consultant who ’s getting one .

“ I ’m just excited to get a real car that is only powered by electricity , ” he said .
Howell , his wife , and several hundred other soon - to - be Mini E drivers got a first look at the car one evening last week in Los Angeles at the California Science Center , where BMW , which owns Mini , threw a party reminiscent of a pep rally .
Drink in hand , Howell stared across a room full of giddy fellow lessees savoring a buffet dinner and gushing over the cheery little electric vehicles , or EVs , which zip to 60 miles per hour in 8.5 seconds and top out at 95 mph .
“ This is going to be an adventure , ” Howell said .
Nearly a decade after the short - circuiting of the first modern attempt to jump - start electric transportation -- in the form of the EV1 from General Motors Corp. , Toyota Motor Corp .'s RAV4 EV and other electric test cars , most of which were destroyed after their leases expired -- the auto industry is back on the switch .

The one - year Mini E pilot program is a precursor to what experts say could be an explosion of relatively affordable electric cars in the near future .
“ This is a sign of what ’s coming , ” said Edward Kjaer , director of the Electric Transportation Division at Southern California Edison , which is working with automakers including BMW and Ford Motor Co. to develop electric vehicles and infrastructure .
“ The real fun is going to start next year . ”
That ’s when General Motors Corp. is slated to release its much - anticipated plug - in electric Volt sedan .
Hot on its heels is Ford , which last week said it would invest $ 550 million to retool a Michigan factory that will make electric versions of its Focus compact , due out in 2011 .
Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co. is targeting 2012 for mass - production of its sub -$ 33,000 electric car , while Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is set to begin selling its own EV in Japan in 2010 .

For its part , BMW does not plan to make a mass - produced version of the Mini E. Instead , it will use data from the lease program to help produce an electric vehicle it plans to sell in the U.S. in 2012 .
Meanwhile , a group of start - ups are racing to deliver their own electron - fired vehicles .
Among them are Fisker Automotive , an Irvine company that promises a plug - in hybrid in about a year ’s time , and Santa Monica ’s Miles Automotive , which in two weeks will unveil the prototype of its Chinese - made sedan that ’s expected to sell for $ 45,000 when it debuts late next year .
Then there ’s Tesla Motors of San Carlos , Calif. , which last year began selling the $ 109,000 Roadster , the first all - electric , highway - legal vehicle to be sold ( rather than leased ) in the U.S. since before World War II .
To date , about 400 of the sleek vehicles have been delivered , and last month Tesla showed off the design of its next electric car , the Model S , due in 2012 .
“ We believe electric vehicles are a big part of the future of this industry , ” said Mark Perry , Nissan ’s North American director of advanced technology .
He said limited numbers of Nissan ’s electric vehicle may hit the streets as soon as late next year .

The industry ’s electric vehicle push is being aided by the Obama administration , which included $ 2.4 billion in funding for the vehicles in the stimulus bill passed earlier this year .
And on Thursday the administration cut funding for development of hydrogen fuel cell technology , the main challenger to battery - powered electric vehicles , on grounds that it would n’t be practical for at least a decade .
Consumer awareness of electric vehicles is also rising , helped in part by the spike in gasoline prices a year ago , as well as growing buzz online .
At least half a dozen of the people selected to lease the Mini E have launched blogs detailing the experience .
“ Transportation technology is vital to our future , ” Bill Nye , a TV actor known for an eponymous children ’s science show , said at the event .
He will put aside his Toyota Prius for a year in order to drive a Mini E .

“ It was the first electric car I could get my hands on , and the Tesla is a little too rich for my blood , ” he said .
There are a number of roadblocks between the gasoline - fueled present and the electrified future .
The big ones , such as developing batteries that can survive years of charging and not cost a fortune , are fairly well known .
For start - ups , raising enough money to keep going can be hard , as Phoenix Motorcars of Ontario discovered .
The company ’s plans to begin producing an electric pickup in late 2007 were pushed back several times , suppliers sued and , late last month , Phoenix filed for bankruptcy protection .
Smaller hurdles also abound .

In the case of the Mini E , BMW discovered that although its range was lab - tested at 156 miles per charge , real - world driving put it closer to 100 .
Installing a 240 - volt charger in every driver ’s garage also proved tricky , since many of the houses did n’t have sufficient capacity to support the load .
Then there was the plug , almost an afterthought .
It turned out that certifying the cable connecting car to charger -- a minor but necessary bit of red tape -- took so long that it delayed the Mini E rollout by more than two months .
“ We knew we would have some obstacles to overcome , ” said Richard Steinberg , Mini ’s head of product strategy in the U.S.
“ They turned out to be a little bigger than we thought . ”
Such concerns did n’t seem to register among the more than 200 people who showed up at the Science Center to gawk at the electric cars that they would soon be driving .

Chad Robertson and Kathy Bakken of Los Angeles brought their 12 - year - old son , Weston , to inspect the goods .
Bakken , an entertainment advertising designer , leased a GM EV1 in the late 1990s and , heartbroken when the company took it away from her , has pined for an electric car ever since .
“ The minute I saw this car , I was like , ‘ I want it now ! ’ ” Bakken said , watching Weston sit behind the wheel , a grin spreading across his youthful face .

Advertisement Dressed in see - through PVC suits and bright yellow Marigold rubber gloves , they look like Michelin Men on a mission .
But this is not a spoof .
The members of this small group of specialists are taking part in a training exercise , gearing up for what is potentially one of the most dangerous jobs in the world - the dismantling and demolition of the most complex nuclear facility ever created .
" The suits are worn in highly contaminated environments to prevent the breathing of contaminated air , " explains team manager Maurice Tierney as his men seal each others ' suits with ordinary green sticky tape .
Intricate challenge
These days , neither electricity nor weapons are produced at the Sellafield nuclear plant .
Nevertheless , some 10,000 staff and 2,000 contractors work here - considerably more than the 8,000 or so people who worked in nuclear research and development during the industry 's heyday , in the early 1980s .
Work routines are learnt through drills before entering contaminated areas .
They carry out very little productive work - instead , their job is positively destructive : they are demolishing long - since closed nuclear power plants and atomic weapons research facilities , many of them contaminated by nuclear waste after more than half a century of energy and weapons production .
The structures were initially erected without any serious thought about how they would eventually be taken down .
One is a 10 - storey building with a 12 - metre chimney stack on top , a concrete monstrosity that is truly as menacing as it looks .
Demolition required
The view from the roof of this former nuclear plant is breathtaking ; to the east lies the Lake District national park , a favourite with tourists .
To the west , the choppy Irish Sea .
Looking straight down from the building reveals something else ; an intricate spaghetti of buildings and structures , pipe works and roads , clearly created with functionality in mind rather than to attract architectural admiration .
Getting the building down would normally be relatively easy , had it not been for the buildings around it , which could suffer from a straightforward explosive demolition job .
Add to that the complication of nuclear contamination , which has penetrated deep into the building 's concrete and steel structure , and there is no wonder that it will take years before all traces of Sellafield and the UK 's nuclear legacy waste have been removed .
The 120 - metre tall building is clearly an eyesore , but where it currently stands it poses no threat to anyone .
At least , not yet .
The entire structure is crumbling and corroding after years of exposure to acid and other chemicals , so there is only one solution : it has to be demolished before becomes unstable .
But first , its murky interior must be cleaned out .
That is the job at hand for the men in PVC suits .
Slow work Armed with angle grinders and other tools , the men regularly enter atomic cells and caves , so contaminated by nuclear waste that everything in them , even the walls themselves , have been turned into hazardous material .
The work is hot and uncomfortable , and potentially very dangerous .
This is where they ply their trades - for tradesmen is what they are , such as metal workers or fitters .
Removing contaminated equipment from the cells and caves is only part of the job .
In many cases , they also have to chip and grind layers of concrete off the contaminated walls to make sure no nuclear waste escapes when it eventually comes to dismantling the building .
The work is slow ; much slower than what you would normally see at an ordinary construction site .
It takes at least 15 minutes to get ready and change into the suits , each fitted with an independent supply of oxygen , and they can only be worn for a short while .
The suits are totally sealed , so all the sweat that is designed to reduce the body temperature , is trapped within the PVC suit , making it even hotter .
" Normally , if you 're cutting up or grinding , you 're getting wet , and you feel quite tired when you come out , " says fitter Jordan Rumney .
" You can only wear this for anything from half - an - hour to an - hour - and - a - half , so it takes a lot longer to do things this way . "
Special routines
It is also labour intensive .
Inside the caves , the men always work in pairs who are supported by a team outside .
Dismantling the nuclear installations at Sellafield will take years .
In total , teams consist of eight or nine people , each with specialist jobs .
Each team will enter cells and caves only about three times per week , so even small tasks can take a long time to carry out .
While working , each team member has a specific responsibility to carry out .
How the work is done is well prepared through drills in training centres to make sure no time is wasted on site - and to make sure all safety requirements are met .
Some are dressing the chaps in the protective PVC suits , others monitor air panels to make sure the workers get enough oxygen .
When the workers are ready to come out , they need help showering any contaminated dust off their suits before they are assisted in getting them off .
Many things can go wrong ; most notably , the workers may injure themselves with their tools .
If they do , there are special procedures to follow to evacuate them , and special first aid routines to follow .
For instance , if someone cuts themselves with an angle grinder out in the real world , the key thing is to stop the bleeding .
Here , in the case of a cut , it is better to let it bleed since as long as the blood is coming out , the radioactive contamination cannot get into the body via the wound .
There are also strict controls and health checks once the workers are back outside the contaminated areas .
Equipment is checked and double - checked every time it is taken to and from the site - though most of it is not moved at all .
Random urine and faeces samples are carried out to make sure the workers are not contaminated .
And yet , in spite of such harsh - sounding conditions , the men working in this team have all been here for years .
Most of them have done this work for more than a decade , some of them for more than two .
For them , this is a steady job that pays better than comparable work in the construction industry .
Besides , the work they do is essential to clean up the mess left behind by decades of nuclear weapons and power production at Sellafield .
" I am proud of the work we do in this building , " says one worker .
" Even though we are taking it down . "

Only in Russia .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard is reporting that the CIA ’s Information and Privacy Coordinator has rejected Cheney ’s request to declassify documents Cheney insists prove that torture worked .
As the CIA explained in what is an apparently leaked excerpt from their letter to Cheney :
In researching the information in question , we have discovered that it is currently the subject of pending FOIA litigation ( Bloche v. Department of Defense , Amnesty International v. Central Intelligence Agency ) .
Therefore , the document is excluded from Mandatory Declassification Review .
Essentially , the CIA ’s response is that the form of Cheney ’s request is improper – though they are not excluding it ’s release by other means .
Though the Obama administration could have reached out and helped out Cheney by intervening and ( technically independent of Cheney ’s request ) releasing the documents , they chose not to at this time .
This is what is actually going on behind the blaring headlines : White House Snubs Cheny !
In requesting these documents be released , Cheney was echoing Mark Danner , a journalist for the New York Review of Books who published the leaked Red Cross memos that documented the torture conducted by the Bush administration .
Danner explained why we needed to declassify any relevant documents – even if they proved torture worked :
Mr. Cheney ’s politics of torture looks , Janus - like , in two directions : back to the past , toward exculpation for what was done under the administration he served , and into the future , toward blame for what might come under the administration that followed .
Put forward at a time when Republicans have lost power and popularity — and by the man who is perhaps the least popular figure in American public life — these propositions seem audacious , outrageous , even reckless ; yet the political logic is insidious and , in the aftermath of a future attack , might well prove compelling …
The only way to defuse the political volatility of torture and to remove it from the center of the “ politics of fear ” is to replace its lingering mystique , owed mostly to secrecy , with authoritative and convincing information about how it was really used and what it really achieved .
Danner argues :
This is the only way we can begin to come to a true consensus about torture .
By all accounts , it is likely that the intelligence harvest that can be attributed directly to the “ alternative set of procedures ” is meager .
But whatever information might have been gained , it must be assessed and then judged against the great costs , legal , moral , political , incurred in producing it .
Torture ’s harvest , whatever it may truly be , is very unlikely to have outweighed those costs .
As Dawn Johnsen , who Obama has appointed to head the office that under Bush authorized torture , wrote for Slate :
Our constitutional democracy cannot survive with a government shrouded in secrecy , nor can our nation ’s honor be restored without full disclosure .
All of this demonstrates why Obama must release these memos – for only with full disclosure , with the Bush torture program subjected to the only disinfectant a democracy has – the sunlight of public opinion and inspection – only then can we come to a consensus on torture .
This is the inevitable logical end of Obama ’s stated positions .
And there is reason to suspect this is still the plan .
Those who have reviewed these documents ( aside from Cheney ) have said they do not prove what Cheney insists they do .
As Stephen Bradbury , the compliant head of the Bush Office of Legal Counsel in 2005 who replaced the right - wing but independent Jack Goldsmith , concluded in a still classified memo ( which seems to be referencing the memos in question ) :
[ I]t is difficult to determine conclusively whether interrogations have provided information critical to interdicting specific imminent attacks …
So – if these memos do n’t support the Cheney position – or offer only qualified support for it – why has n’t Obama called Cheney ’s bluff and just released them ?
Mus n’t he be hiding something ?
The one thing I have learned paying attention to Obama over these past few years is that it is often easiest to figure out what he means by listening to what he says .
Obama has a way of setting a goal – then compromising , pushing deadlines off , hedging , keeping his mouth shut , and moving steadily forward – all while his opponents shriek and the media analyzes every small signal for portents of what is to come – until everyone misses the story and Obama ’s goal is accomplished .
This is the story of how Obama beat Hillary and McCain and of how the stimulus was passed .
On the issue of torture , Obama has been clear .
He has ended the practice .
He wishes to move on – but he does not wish to sweep the crimes of the Bush administration under the rug .
He cannot appear eager to prosecute anyone – and he does n’t seem to be .
But he realizes that in a liberal democracy such as ours , there must be accountability .
What is required is a balancing act – as he tackles the essentially political task of achieving a national consensus on the issue that will survive in the aftermath of the next crisis .
For Cheney , the political logic is also clear .
He believes a crisis requires a strong executive empowered to do whatever is necessary .
In defending this belief in the way he is , Cheney is setting Obama up to be politically kneecapped in the immediate aftermath of the next attack .
Cheney is preemptively blaming Obama for the next significant terrorist attack – and preemptively politicizing the aftermath of that attack , preparing the ground for a resurgence of the Cheney model of the executive ( which is in essence an elected tyrant ) .
This is a truly dangerous game Cheney is playing .
Obama is struggling with how to counter this .
He knows it is likely that America will be attacked in his first year in office .
Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were tested in this way in the beginning of their presidencies .
Obama must demonstrate that he is not going too far too fast in pushing back the Cheney model – lest that push be blamed for the next attack as Cheney wants it to be .
Yet the Bush - Cheney policies are being legally challenged on every front – and even to delay rolling them back , Obama must defend them .
What Obama needs is a gradual , thoughtful , public process .
My suspicion is that Obama will let Cheney continue to promise more openness and accountability .
Cheney has already promised to testify before Congress ; he is pressuring for the release of classified documents ; he is making his case in the public arena .
Cheney ’s insistence on fighting this out in public will give Obama cover to convene a truth commission – perhaps Cheney himself may even call for one .
This strategy would effectively deal with the very real threat that Cheney ’s preemptive politicization of the next attack poses to the country and to the presidency .
And it means the photos just held back must be released ; it means we must get to the bottom of what Nancy Pelosi knew and when she knew it ; it means we must figure out what the well - timed leaks about Jane Harman and Nancy Pelosi were meant to accomplish ; it means we must know how effective torture was or was not ; it means we must have a truth commission .

In the 1950s Jonas Salk was working on a cure for polio in the basement of a Pittsburgh laboratory .
Stymied and discouraged , he went to Assisi , Italy and wandered around a 13rd - century monastery .
There , among the cloisters , he felt his mind unwind .
Fresh lines of pursuit came to him , including the breakthrough that led to the vaccine .
Salk was convinced that the monastery had influenced his mind .
So convinced , in fact , that he solicited the architect Louis Kahn to design the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , in hopes that other scientists might benefit from serene surroundings .
Sixty years later Salk ’s hunch is now backed up by empirical evidence as new research in neuroscience hints at how our surroundings affect feelings and behavior .
In the current issue of Scientific American Mind , Emily Anthes describes how ceiling height , colors and other design factors influence attention and creativity .
Scientists are just beginning to address these questions , in part by studying changes in brain activity as subjects make their way through virtual reality rooms .
The neuroscience of design is still in its infancy , but it has its own organization , The Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture in San Diego , and some architecture schools now include some basic neuroscience in their curriculum .
Are we on the verge of a new field of emotionally intelligent design ?
Here are few early findings :
Sheriff Joe Arpaio has a new reality show on Fox scheduled to debut : " Smile ! You 're Under Arrest " .
The grand concept is " ' Cops ' meets ' Punk'd ' . "
Here are some details :
From creator Scott Satin ( Who Wants to Marry My Dad ? , Who Wants to be a Superhero ? ) , the show features law officers in Phoenix setting up grandiose sting operations to lure criminals with warrants into their waiting hands , and cameras .
“ It is a reverse Punk’d , ” says Fox President of Alternative Entertainment Mike Darnell .
“ Instead of the worst day of your life and then a joke at the end , this is the reverse .
This is the best day of your life , and then we arrest you . ”
One of three set - ups just shot in Arizona features the cops luring a criminal to a movie set with the promise of making him an extra and paying him a couple hundred dollars .
An elaborate film set is staged and filming begins on a faux movie .
The set - up continues as the director then gets mad at the lead actor , fires him and replaces him with the law - breaking extra .
The scene escalates with the fake director introducing the mark to a supposed studio mogul and continuing to create this dream - comes - true sequence .
Finally , all the participants are revealed as officers of the law , and the criminal is apprehended ( before signing waivers to let the footage be used in the show ) .
Yes , the Sheriff Joe featured in this show is the same Maricopa County sheriff who 's made a career out of arresting just about every Latino in sight , while driving law enforcement in the county right into the ground , with hundreds of crimes going uninvestigated -- all while nakedly violating federal regulations .
Moreover , he 's also incurred the wrath of the ACLU by attempting to terminate a federal consent decree mandating that he maintain conditions at the county jail that meet constitutional minimums ; he also was taken to court in an attempt to force him to live up to a court order to transport female prisoners to abortion appointments .
America 's Voice ( which made the above video ) notes :
2,700 lawsuits have been filed against Arpaio
Joe prioritizes immigrant sweeps over prosecuting felons ( there are 40,000 outstanding warrants in his county )
The Sheriff discriminates against Latinos , as found in an Arizona Republic study
Joe even staged a phony murder plot against himself !
The Immigration Policy Center
[ pdf file ] has a fact sheet with even more info on Sheriff Joe .
It notes that he " has transformed his police department into an immigration - enforcement agency . "
This was explored in detail in a report from the Goldwater Institute -- not exactly a hotbed of liberalism -- which found that Arpaio 's tenure has been a disaster for Maricopa County :
MCSO falls seriously short of fulfilling its mission in all three areas .
Although MCSO is adept at self - promotion and is an unquestionably “ tough ” law - enforcement agency , under its watch violent crime rates recently have soared , both in absolute terms and relative to other jurisdictions .
It has diverted resources away from basic law - enforcement functions to highly publicized immigration sweeps , which are ineffective in policing illegal immigration and in reducing crime generally , and to extensive trips by MCSO officials to Honduras for purposes that are nebulous at best .
Profligate spending on those diversions helped produce a financial crisis in late 2007 that forced MCSO to curtail or reduce important law - enforcement functions .
In terms of support services , MCSO has allowed a huge backlog of outstanding warrants to accumulate , and has seriously disadvantaged local police departments by closing satellite booking facilities .
MCSO ’s detention facilities are subject to costly lawsuits for excessive use of force and inadequate medical services .
Compounding the substantive problems are chronically poor record - keeping and reporting of statistics , coupled with resistance to public disclosure .
And now he 's devoting his energies to one of the more noxious - sounding " reality shows " yet devised -- like something from a Phil Dick novel .
I ’m almost embarrassed to admit that I traveled 2,500 miles in large measure to snap a photo of a reclusive bureaucrat .
Well , I guess I can blame it on TPTB –they drove me to it .
Here ’s the story .
For many months I ’ve been trying to obtain information about John Sheehan , director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ’s Division of Plant and Dairy Food Safety .
I ’ve taken to referring to him as the nation ’s Milk Czar , since he has been orchestrating much of the anti-raw - milk activity that ’s been going on around the country the last few years , and is notable for his frequent quote , “ Drinking raw milk is like playing Russian roulette with your health . ”
Early this year , I made a formal request of FDA to interview him in connection with the book I am writing about raw milk .
No surprise — I was turned down .
But what was curious to me was that the agency provided only the sketchiest of biographical information .
In its six sentences , it said Sheehan was a patent lawyer who joined the FDA in 2000 after serving as “ a mid-level manager within the dairy industry for 17 years .
He has worked for some of America ’s largest and most progressive dairy foods organizations . ”
When I asked for the names of these “ most progressive dairy foods organizations , ” it refused to provide them .
It also said it had no photograph of him .
If you do a Google search on Sheehan , you do n’t find much .
Nothing about his career , and no photos .
( There was one site that supposedly had photos of him at a dairy gathering in Poland , but there were two different guys identified as Sheehan . )
Then , in February , I went to the raw milk symposium outside Washington sponsored by the International Association for Food Safety , where Sheehan was scheduled to be a speaker , expecting to meet him .
Lo and behold , I was told he canceled out the Friday before without giving a reason .
( An FDA spokesperson later said he did n’t attend because there is outstanding litigation — would n’t say what — but presumably a civil suit still pending against Organic Pastures Dairy Co. )
By this time , I ’m beginning to wonder :
Is this guy for real , or just a fun-loving figment of the bureaucracy ’s imagination ?
So when I heard about the gathering of the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments being held this weekend in Orlando , I figured what the heck , let ’s give it another shot .
Yes , I did want to see Mark McAfee of Organic Pastures make his pitch for lifting the ban on interstate shipments of raw milk ( more on that in anoter post ) .
But this thing with Sheehan was becoming something of an obsession .
Sheehan did n’t attend Mark McAfee ’s presentation early this morning , but an associate of his , Cindy Leonard , the presenter of the notorious 2005 FDA slide presentation that slams raw milk , was on the committee hearing the McAfee proposal .
Afterwards , I tried to engage Leonard , but she refused , saying there was litigation that prevented her from commenting , and she walked away from me .
A few minutes later , I saw her in the hallway , and tried again , saying I just wanted to ask her about the Division of Dairy and Plant Food Safety .
This time , she turned and actually started running from me , which was a tad awkward , since she was wearing high heels .
But at a general session following McAfee ’s presentation , I got someone to point out my real prey , John Sheehan .
I had to listen a lengthy presentation about parliamentary rules , but finally , I got my chance .
I decided to snap my photos first , before engaging in conversation , and you can see the results .
( The blog software is n’t cooperating fully ; the bottom photo happened first . )
I wish I could say Sheehan was being cute by putting the notebook in front of his face , but I do n’t think he was .
The photo taken immediately after he relented I think was just an effort on his part to keep from embarrassing himself in front of other people there .
The reason I do n’t think he ’s being funny is because this was my conversation with Sheehan after taking the photos :
“ Hi , I ’m David Gumpert . ”
“ Yes , I know who you are . ”
“ I wonder if we could chat for just a few moments . ”
“ No . ”
“ Why not ? ”
“ Because I do n’t want to . ”
Well , you have to give the guy credit for being honest .
No more funny stuff about “ pending litigation . ”
He just does n’t want to be f**** ing bothered .
If a guy does n’t want to talk to you , not much you can do , even if you do help pay his salary .
But at least I do know one thing : John Sheehan really does exist .

" Wolfram| Alpha is n't sure what to do with your input . "
I 've been seeing that phrase a lot lately , as I spent a bit of this weekend trying to figure out what the self - styled computational knowledge engine was good for .
The conclusion I 'm reaching , at least in part based on the frequent appearance of that text , is that the answer will wind up being " not a whole lot , " at least not if you 've got a general interest in science , as I do .
That 's not because I have a fear of math or expect that the folks behind it will never overcome some of its current limitations .
Instead , I think that Wolfram 's approach with this new tool is such that Alpha will largely be limited to producing information that , on a fundamental level , is trivial .
Before trashing the service , though , I should spend a bit of time on its good points .
The natural language parser appears to be quite impressive ; if it has an answer for something , it seems to be able to take you to that answer using a variety of linguistic approaches .
The graphing production is both first class and fast , and there are definitely times that the pictures it produces are worth a thousand words .
For a variety of items , the unit conversions are the same : on target and informative .
That 's not to say it 's designed to handle anything you throw at it , as it's important not to have unrealistic expectations for the service .
This is something that fundamentally deals with numbers , not concepts .
So , for example , plugging something like " RNA world " into it is a nonsensical thing to do , and it's no surprise that doing so elicits another case of " Wolfram| Alpha is n't sure what to do with your input . "
So , in essence , Wolfram 's asking you to outsource all the sanity - checking that should be done when obtaining information — does it come from a reliable source ?
Is it in keeping with other figures that are available ?
You 're just supposed to trust that the folks that populated the databases behind Alpha have done their job well .
The avoidance of concepts is n't complete , though .
If you plug in the RNA base " uracil , " for example , it recognizes that uridine ( the form that 's hooked up to ribose ) is likely to be what you 're after .
Alpha also helpfully offers to treat it like a word , which gives you a one - sentence description of its base - pairing behavior when part of RNA .
But Wolfram 's tendency to treat everything like a value rears its ugly head here .
The fact that biologists abbreviate it as U causes Alpha to lump it in a synonym network with Uranium and atomic number 92 , which are completely unrelated .
Beyond that , the entry has some useful reference values like melting point and density , but I 'd generally trust Wikipedia to get those sorts of trivial details right .
There are a number of rough spots that may be possible to fix or at least improve .
If , for example , I was interested in " global bioethanol production , " I 'd get the dreaded " is n't sure what to do with your input " message .
Does that mean it does n't recognize bioethanol ?
That it does but does n't have global figures ?
That it 's not sure what to make of my use of " production " in this context ?
Currently , Alpha gives me no clue .
There 's also no way to find out if a given term ever does appear without checking back every month in the hope that someone 's decided to parse a source that contains it .
Another problem became apparent when I plugged in " 25 Gigatons carbon dioxide , " which produced a small section of comparisons .
None of these were precisely the figure I was interested in , namely a comparison with the US automotive output of carbon dioxide , and Alpha offers no way to search for other comparisons .
Again , this can be fixed in an update , but the problem of useful comparisons was small change compared to the bigger issue the page revealed : a problem of accurate comparisons .
Data on my search result page indicated that , in 2003 , global human activity led to 27 Gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions .
But it also indicated that , in 2000 , the US produced 40 Gigatons during cement production alone .
One of these has got to be wrong , and Alpha gives you absolutely no way of finding out which ; the page does n't have a link to the source of its data .
Even where it ostensibly does link sources , the links are n't very informative .
Returning to ethanol ( which I 'm prone to do ) , it 's possible to follow links that eventually lead to Mathematica 's list of ChemicalData sources .
That lists about 25 items as " among " the principal sources , but gives you no clue as to what information on a given page came from where .
So , for example , even if you find that a page has data from a usually reliable source like the CIA 's World Factbook , there 's no way of knowing which data on the page comes from there .
So , in essence , Wolfram 's asking you to outsource all the sanity - checking that should be done when obtaining information — does it come from a reliable source ?
Is it in keeping with other figures that are available ?
You 're just supposed to trust that the folks that populated the databases behind Alpha have done their job well .
If they have n't , it 's up to you to figure that out .
Given my initial experiences with Alpha , there seem to be at least three things that make it less useful than a general Web search .
For one , Alpha is entirely dependent upon the ability of Wolfram 's employees to draw in data and , unless Alpha earns the company a GDP - sized income , said employees will always be outpaced by the production of not only new data , but by new data storage formats .
That necessarily means some searches will fail , which brings us to problem number two : it 's not obvious that there 's a way to make them fail usefully .
A bad Web search typically brings up results that help you refine your search terms ; a bad Alpha search returns nothing , and it's not clear that there 's an easy way to fix that .
But the biggest issue is that , in the process of creating the data store behind Alpha , all the context behind a number — who produced it , what were their methods , how was the raw data obtained , is the number actually relevant for a given analysis , etc. — is stripped ( or , if it 's there , you ca n't tell from the results ) .
And , for most things other than trivial figures like density and melting point , the source and other contextual information is every bit as important as the number itself .
This is why I said at the start that Alpha is only good for trivial uses .
If I can ever figure out which one of the numbers Alpha fed me on carbon emissions is right , though , I 'd be happy to have Wolfram produce a nice graph of it for me .
Yesterday , I saw the above advert on the side of a bus , and I had to ask around to make sure I was n’t hallucinating .
I just want to be absolutely clear here .. I ’m getting used to being left behind by changes in modern mores–but is this really OK with everyone ?
We ’re all cool with the Standard using this term to describe the recent G20 clashes ?
Are the police and those who were injured by the police happy to have this image and slogan used ?
Are Londoners OK with seeing this kind of violence compared to a football match , a match we can all enjoy when it ‘ kicks off ’ again ?
( The inference being that it surely will ) .
But what I really want to know is whether the new editors of the Evening Standard , fresh from a campaign where they ( quite rightly ) apologised for being shit , are happy to sell newspapers in this way ?
Even though Ian Tomlinson , one of their own vendors , was fucking KILLED during this trouble ?
Because if they are , then their apology counts for nothing , as they obviously intend to continue to be a negative , and now inflammatory , influence on London life .
( Thanks to @badjournalism for reminding me about the Tomlinson connection . )
MUSIC NEWS - After nearly a dozen shows cancelled on its current tour , electronic rockers , Depeche Mode have cancelled and / or postponed immediate shows on their world tour as singer Dave Gahan has undergone cancer surgery .
The 47 year old has suffered continued health problems , having previously being diagnosed with gastroenteritis before additional tests revealed what was described as a " low - grade malignant tumour " on his bladder .
In a statement on Depeche Mode 's official website , Mr Gahan " sincerely thanks his fans for their support , understanding and patience " .
The group also said they " deeply regret any problems or inconveniences the cancellations and postponements may have caused " , however the changes were necessary as " At doctors ' orders Dave Gahan must take a break until June 8th , to ensure that he makes a full recovery " .
Their world tour ' Tour of The Universe ' , in support of their new Sounds of the Universe album , will resume as normal in Leipzig , Germany on June 8 and the concerts scheduled after that ; including June 10 in Berlin and June 12 in Frankfurt , will go on as originally scheduled .
MNN wishes Mr Gahan a speedy recovery !
“ A LOT of good cyclists come out of Portland just because you can ride year - round , ” said Bruce Rogers , an athletic - shoe designer visiting from his home in Hailey , Idaho .
“ I love coming back because I love the biking , no matter what time of year it is .
More than fitness , it ’s a fun outlet .
As long as you have decent rainwear you can ride in any weather . ”
Careering through streets on a bicycle in Portland , Ore. , this time of year can be an easy weekend adventure that mixes showers , sunbursts , cafes and a robust bicycle culture .
And equipped with a sturdy rain jacket , booties , fenders and a bike map ( a waterproof version that folds to the size of a credit card is handy ) , visitors can enjoy the city the way locals do .
On a recent misty Friday evening , bicyclists wearing blinking safety lights formed a spontaneous , festive parade across the Hawthorne Bridge .
The impromptu peloton flashed by like a line of flickering fireflies .
Tourists will find that Portlanders seem to know how to avoid the biggest gushers , perfecting the art of ducking into a cafe at the moment that passing showers soak the streets .
“ I ’ve seen a lot of double rainbows this winter , ” said Andrew Butterfield , a teacher at da Vinci Arts Middle School , who was drinking a coffee in the Hollywood neighborhood during one cloudburst .
Last month , artists Michael Di Liberto and Sunia Boneham moved into a two - story , three - bedroom house in Cleveland 's Collinwood neighborhood , where about 220 homes out of 5,000 sit vacant and boarded up .
They lined their walls with Ms. Boneham 's large , neon - hued canvases , turned a spare bedroom into a graphic - design studio and made the attic a rehearsal space for their band , Arte Povera .
The couple used to live in New York , but they were drawn to Cleveland by cheap rent and the creative possibilities of a city in transition ....
As the boy ducked into a tailor shop , Hart recognized that this narrative was not exclusive to his “ wonderful city ” — it was one that could happen anywhere in , and only in , America .
“ A surge of shamefaced patriotism overwhelmed me , ” Hart wrote in his memoir , Act One .
“ I might have been watching a victory parade on a flag - draped Fifth Avenue instead of the mean streets of a city slum .
A feeling of patriotism , however , is not always limited to the feverish emotions called forth by war .
It can sometimes be felt as profoundly and perhaps more truly at a moment such as this . ”
Hart , like so many before and after him , was overcome by the power of the American Dream .
As a people , we Americans are unique in having such a thing , a more or less Official National Dream .
( There is no correspondingly stirring Canadian Dream or Slovakian Dream . )
It is part of our charter — as articulated in the second sentence of the Declaration of Independence , in the famous bit about “ certain unalienable Rights ” that include “ Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness ” — and it is what makes our country and our way of life attractive and magnetic to people in other lands .
But now fast - forward to the year 2009 , the final Friday of January .
The new president is surveying the dire economy he has been charged with righting — 600,000 jobs lost in January alone , a gross domestic product that shrank 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the worst contraction in almost 30 years .
Assessing these numbers , Barack Obama , a man who normally exudes hopefulness for a living , pronounces them a “ continuing disaster for America ’s working families , ” a disaster that amounts to no less , he says , than “ the American Dream in reverse . ”
In reverse .
Imagine this in terms of Hart ’s life : out of the taxicab , back on the subway , back to the tenements , back to cramped cohabitation with Mom and Dad , back to gray mornings and the grim smell of actual want .
You probably do n’t even have to imagine , for chances are that of late you have experienced some degree of reversal yourself , or at the very least have had friends or loved ones get laid off , lose their homes , or just find themselves forced to give up certain perks and amenities ( restaurant meals , cable TV , salon haircuts ) that were taken for granted as recently as a year ago .
These are tough times for the American Dream .
As the safe routines of our lives have come undone , so has our characteristic optimism — not only our belief that the future is full of limitless possibility , but our faith that things will eventually return to normal , whatever “ normal ” was before the recession hit .
There is even worry that the dream may be over — that we currently living Americans are the unfortunate ones who shall bear witness to that deflating moment in history when the promise of this country began to wither .
This is the “ sapping of confidence ” that President Obama alluded to in his inaugural address , the “ nagging fear that America ’s decline is inevitable , and that the next generation must lower its sights . ”
But let ’s face it :
If Moss Hart , like so many others , was able to rally from the depths of the Great Depression , then surely the viability of the American Dream is n’t in question .
What needs to change is our expectation of what the dream promises — and our understanding of what that vague and promiscuously used term , “ the American Dream , ” is really supposed to mean .
In recent years , the term has often been interpreted to mean “ making it big ” or “ striking it rich . ”
( As the cult of Brian De Palma ’s Scarface has grown , so , disturbingly , has the number of people with a literal , celebratory read on its tagline : “ He loved the American Dream .
With a vengeance . ” )
Even when the phrase is n’t being used to describe the accumulation of great wealth , it ’s frequently deployed to denote extreme success of some kind or other .
Last year , I heard commentators say that Barack Obama achieved the American Dream by getting elected president , and that Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel achieved the American Dream by leading his team to its first World Series title since 1980 .

The lure of the forbidden can be seen nowhere more clearly than the Parent 's Television Council 's filthy TV page .
Here is the organization that has been responsible for generating millions of complaints to the FCC , and they make it possible to watch those delectably decadent moments over and over again .
In the 1930 's the Nazis had the same love / hate relationship with swing music .
They outlawed it on their homefront , throwing it into the category of " degenerate " art .
But at the same time , they employed it in the service of the fatherland .
Joseph Goebbels , Hitler 's propaganda minister , assembled a fairly competent swing band called Charlie and His Orchestra to perform Nazified versions of the jazz hits of the day .
Led by an English speaking German , Karl Schwendler , Charlie and His Orchestra broadcast on the medium - wave and short - wave bands throughout the 1930s to Canada , the US and Britain .
The idea was to lure the masses in with the irrestible tonic of swing music and then slyly work in the anti-Jewish , American and British lyrics after the second or third verse .
The broadcasts of Charlie and His Orchestra were not available in the Fatherland proper , but that only enhanced their legend , and they picked up an underground following in Germany as well .
The popularity of Twitter has really exploded in the past few months .
The service poses a simple question : “ What are you doing ? ” Users respond in 140 characters or less .
The 140 - character limit comes from the 160 - character limit of SMS messages , minus a few characters for things like the user ’s screen name .
Twitter could probably best be described as “ micro- blogging . ”
It ’s kind of a cross between blogging and instant messaging .
People use Twitter for all kinds of reasons , everything from staying in touch with friends to receiving announcements and support from companies with a presence on Twitter .
Here are a few examples :
" Ca n't wait to see Nigel , Laura and Ben later . "
" Who 's up for cutting class today and hitting 18 holes ? and the 19th too . "
" Research Project Manager , Seattle , WA , United States : Penn , Schoen and Berland Associates is currently seeking qu. .

That last one trails off a bit due to the 140 - character limit .
Status messages ( “ tweets ” ) can be posted from the web , a mobile phone , or any number of desktop or mobile applications built specifically to interact with Twitter via its API .
Twitter ’s REST API is particularly interesting because it allows many operations to be performed using simple HTTP queries that return XML documents .
Recall that Mathematica can do HTTP ( via Import or J / Link ) and can also import XML .
You can probably guess where I ’m going with this : Twittering with Mathematica .
We ’ll begin with a simple example that does n’t require any authentication , the public timeline .
This URL returns an XML document containing a list of 20 of the most recent posts to Twitter by all users .
Here are the users who made the posts in that document :
We can also get a list of status messages from ( and replies to ) a specific user — in this case WolframResearch .
The textual contents of the tweets are found in the “ text ” XML element .
Not all of the data on Twitter is publicly available .
Certain things require authentication for a particular user account .
Import handles these cases as well .
It will prompt the user for login credentials if necessary .
Here we will log in as WolframResearch .
Let ’s say we want to retrieve a list of users who are following us .
Most Twitter APIs return a fixed number of results .
For status messages it ’s usually 20 results at a time .
For user lists like this it ’s usually 100 results at a time .
This returned a full 100 results , so let ’s get more results from page 2 .
Keep going …
Page 5 returned 0 results , so we ’re done .
Now we get to the fun part : setting your status programmatically from Mathematica .
The tricky thing about this is that it requires the HTTP POST method .
So far we ’ve been using the HTTP GET method , and Import always uses the GET method .
No matter .
J/ Link provides access to all of Java from within Mathematica , and we can make use of Java to perform the HTTP POST necessary to set our Twitter status .
The first step is to initialize J / Link and create an HttpClient object .
Next we create a credentials object with a user name and password .
Set the authorization scope to twitter.com port 443 .
We could just as easily use port 80 with HTTP , but it ’s better to send the password over the network encrypted , so we ’ll use port 443 with HTTPS instead .
Next we encode the tweet into percent - escaped UTF - 8 bytes .
Create the HTTP POST method .
Finally , execute the HTTP POST method .
A result of 200 means the post was successful .
Let ’s get the resulting data and import it as XML .
The other Twitter API function that requires the HTTP POST method is the one that deletes a status message .
Let ’s create a new HTTP POST method with the URL to destroy a tweet .
Then we ’ll execute it using the same client as before , as this client has already been authenticated .
Success .
Now that we ’ve seen the guts of the code necessary to interact with Twitter , it would be helpful to simplify things with some reusable functions that encapsulate this code .
I have written a Mathematica package ( Twitter . m — click to download at the end of this post ) which does exactly that .
It incorporates all of the functionality we ’ve seen so far and more .
Let ’s try a few things with it .
The first thing we ’ll do is create a session to hold our login credentials .
The user name and password can be passed explicitly to TwitterSessionOpen ; if they are not , the function will prompt for them with a password dialog .
We store the result in a variable called session .
Most of the Twitter package functions require a session value to be passed as the first argument .
It is possible to open multiple sessions simultaneously .
Pull out the user associated with this session .
Display a user interface element depicting the user , with image , text , hyperlink , and tooltip .
Find out information about the user .
Next , get a list of the user ’s tweets .
Find out information about the tweets .
Display a user interface element for the status message .
Let ’s do a quick analysis of our friends and followers .
We ’ll take a look at the Union , Complement , and so on of our lists of friends and followers .
We ’ll have to use the unique ID values instead of the actual TwitterUser object wrappers , because the wrappers are not necessarily unique .
So we can tell that 48 % of our friends also follow us , while 50 % of our followers are also our friends .
Next , let ’s find out which group of users associated with us tweets the most .
In this case we ’ll need to map the unique ID values back to the wrapper objects .
Comparing all of our friends and followers shows us that the chattiest group ( highest average number of tweets per user ) are those which are our friends - but - not - followers .
The next - chattiest group are those who are both - friends - and - followers .
The least - chatty group are those who are only our followers - but - not - friends .
Let ’s combine the friends and followers into a single list of all the users associated with us .
So it looks like just a few of our friends and followers are responsible for the vast majority of the whole groups ’ tweets .
Now let ’s get the dates all these users joined Twitter and group them together by month .
Most of our friends and followers appear to have joined Twitter recently , but there are a few old - timers in that list .
Many of the features available in the Twitter API are accessible through this Twitter package .
Feel free to explore them all .
Now that we ’re done we can close the session .
This step is optional .
The ability to analyze Twitter data and to tweet programmatically opens the door to many interesting possibilities .
Imagine running a long computation that notifies you via Twitter when it finishes .
Imagine finding new friends by programmatically determining friends of friends or friends of friends of friends .
Want more followers ?
Perhaps you could analyze the Twittering habits of popular users to see what might make them so popular .
The possibilities are endless , as they usually are with data explorations in Mathematica .

NEW YORK , March 19 ( Reuters ) - Although U.S. stocks have rallied from 12 - year lows for six of the last seven sessions , data suggests investor sentiment may still have further to fall before the end of the crisis .
Outright bears accounted for 44 percent of the market in the second week of March , shortly after stock indexes hit fresh multi- year lows , according to data from Investors Intelligence .
That compares to a ratio of nearly 50 percent bears the week after stocks first hit 12 - year lows in the current crisis on Nov. 21 last year .
And since the crisis began , the proportion of outright bears peaked at 54 percent two days after the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing in history -- the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers on Sept. 15 .
Investors Intelligence , which has been collecting data from investor news letters for its Sentiment Index since 1963 , says that historically , sustained changes in market direction have been accompanied by an extreme of sentiment in the opposite direction .
That means stocks may have further to fall .
“ Our view is that we are still in a bear market , ” says Todd Salamone , vice president of research at Schaeffer ’s Investment Research .
“ We have got to have an extreme negative to hit bottom . ”
“ We took out November lows but did not pass November sentiment levels , which is a cause for concern , ” he said in an interview this week .
The S&P 500 index .SPX hit a 12 - year low in late November , and plumbed fresh 12 - year lows in early March .
The S&P has rallied 10 percent in the last seven days while the blue chip Dow industrials .
DJI climbed 8 percent .
In addition Salamone says that the VIX volatility index .VIX , known as Wall Street 's fear gauge , has remained below levels seen last November , albeit partly because the latest slide in stocks has been more orderly .
“ We would like to see the technical background improve or sentiment indicators that we track hit new lows -- until we get that we have to be skeptical about new rallies , ” says Salamone .

Britain 's longest living married couple have celebrated their 81st wedding anniversary .
Frank and Anita Milford , who live together in a nursing home in Plymouth , Devon , exchanged vows on 26 May , 1928 .
Frank is 101 and Anita will be 101 next month .
In February they will break the record to become the longest married couple in Britain .
They say they still have little arguments , but will always have a kiss and cuddle before they go to bed .
The pair , who said there was no " magic secret " to a happy marriage , met at a YMCA dance in the St Budeaux area of Plymouth in 1926 and were married two years later at Torpoint register office .
Blitz escape
Mr Milford worked at Devonport dockyard until his retirement at the age of 60 .
The couple stayed in Plymouth throughout World War II .
During the Blitz they narrowly escaped two bombs , including one which fell on their house .
They have two children , five grandchildren and seven great grandchildren .
Their 74 - year - old son , also called Frank , said the main secret of his parents ' wedded bliss was simply being happy with each other .
" They 've enjoyed themselves , enjoyed their lives very much but they 've been always very content with their lot , " he said .
Brand of carbonated drinks
Fanta is a brand of fruit - flavored carbonated soft drinks created by Coca - Cola Deutschland under the leadership of German businessman Max Keith .
There are more than 100 flavors worldwide .
Fanta originated as a Coca - Cola substitute during the American trade embargo of Nazi Germany , which affected the availability of Coca - Cola ingredients , in 1940 ; the current version was created in Italy .
History [ edit ]
Origins [ edit ]
During the Second World War , the US established a trade embargo against Germany — making the export of Coca - Cola syrup difficult .
[ 2 ]
To circumvent this , Max Keith , the head of Coca - Cola Deutschland ( Coca - Cola GmbH ) , decided to create a new product for the German market , using only ingredients available in Germany at the time , including beet sugar , whey , and apple pomace — the " leftovers of leftovers " , as Keith later recalled . [ 2] [ 3 ]
The name was the result of a brainstorming session , which started with Keith 's exhorting his team to " use their imagination " ( Fantasie in German ) , to which one of his salesmen , Joe Knipp , retorted " Fanta ! " . [ 3 ]
The plant was cut off from Coca - Cola headquarters following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .
After the war , The Coca - Cola Company regained control of the plant , formula , and the trademarks to the new Fanta product — as well as the plant profits made during the war . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
In 1943 alone , 3 million cases of Fanta were sold .
Many bottles were not drunk , but used to add sweetness and flavor to soups and stews , since wartime sugar was severely rationed . [ 2] [ 3 ]
During the war the Dutch Coca - Cola plant in Amsterdam ( N.V. Nederlandsche Coca - Cola Maatschappij ) suffered the same difficulties as the German Coca - Cola plant .
Max Keith put the Fanta brand at the disposal of the Dutch Coca - Cola plant , of which he had been appointed the official caretaker .
Dutch Fanta had a different recipe from German Fanta , elderberries being one of the main ingredients . [ 4 ]
Fanta production was discontinued when the German and Dutch Coca - Cola branches were reunited with their parent company .
Following the launch of several drinks by the Pepsi corporation in the 1950s , Coca - Cola relaunched Fanta in 1955 .
The drink was heavily marketed in Europe , Asia , Africa , and South America . [ 5 ]
The orange Fanta of today was produced for the first time in Italy , in Naples , in 1955 , when a local bottling plant started producing it using locally sourced oranges . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Marketing [ edit ]

Fanta Shokata with labels upside down as part of the " turn the world upside down " ad campaign
United States [ edit ]
Fanta is known for its upbeat colorful advertising ; in the United States , it showcases The Fantanas , a group of young female models , each of whom promotes an individual Fanta flavor .
For the re-introduction of Fanta in the United States , Coca - Cola worked with the ad agency Ogilvy ( NYC ) in 2001 .
After a brainstorming session , the Ogilvy creative team of Andrea Scaglione , Andrew Ladden and Bill Davaris created the tagline " Wanta Fanta ! " which became the jingle for the Fantanas in the broadcast campaign .
The campaign lasted from mid-2001 , in the form of a successful trial run , to October 1 , 2006 .
Three years later , in June 2009 , Fanta re-launched the campaign .
Germany [ edit ]
75th anniversary version [ edit ]
In February 2015 , a 75th - anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany .
Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original wartime flavor including 30 % whey and pomace , it is described on the packaging as " less sweet " and a German original .
An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca - Cola company wanted to bring back " the feeling of the Good Old Times " which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule .
The ad was subsequently replaced . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
International availability [ edit ]
Fēndá ( 芬达 ) in the Chinese market .
Variations of Fanta or ( 芬达 ) in the Chinese market .
There are more than 90 flavors worldwide .
In Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Poland , Serbia , Turkey , Romania , Russia , Sweden and some other countries , there is Fanta Shokata ( a wordplay between " soc " which is " elderberry " in Romanian , and " shock " ) based on an elderflower blossom extract drink .
Orange Fanta is available in Canada .
The formula differs from its American counterpart in that it contains orange juice [ 12 ] and the American version contains none . [ 13 ]
The other variants available in Canada are Grape and Cream Soda , both made with grape juice . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
In the UK , Fanta flavours include Orange , Lemon , and Fruit Twist .
Sugar Free flavours include : Orange , Icy Lemon , Fruit Twist , Pink Grapefruit , Grape , Raspberry , and # WhatTheFanta ( Limited Edition ) .
Primary competitors to Fanta have included Tango , Mirinda , Sunkist , Slice , Sumol , Crush , Faygo , Tropicana Twister , and Orangina .
Fanta is the second drink to have been produced by Coca - Cola , after the original Coca - Cola .
In New Zealand , unlike the rest of Australasia , Fanta is visually branded with the original logo used since 2008 .
The New Zealand market includes the Fanta variants Fanta Blueberry , Fanta Sour Watermelon , and Fanta Strawberry Sherbet . [ 16 ]
The comedian Gabriel Iglesias has made references to Fanta having a substantial fan base in India and Mexico . [ 17 ]

Last week the Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life released poll data revealing the relationships between religious commitment and support for the use of torture against terror suspects .
Those who rarely attend religious services are the least likely to support torture .
The more one attends religious service , the greater the level of support .
And white evangelical Protestants offered the greatest amount of support for torture with a majority ( 62 % ) of respondents believing that torture can at least sometimes be justified .
I am sickened but not terribly shocked .
This glib view of the brutality and inhumanity of torture is bound up in a particular strand of American Christian theology that ’s been a growing force for over a century .
Muscular Christianity in America has minimized the vice of torture and extolled the virtue of the Heroic One who endures for a greater cause .
The crucified body of Jesus is held up as a paragon of strength , virtue and virility .
This is true not because Jesus offered an alternative conception of society where the first shall be last or the last shall be first .
Not because Jesus found virtue rather than vice in the “ least of these ” among us .
And not because Jesus inverted assumptions about authority by his willingness to humbly wash the feet of those who would otherwise worship him .
Rather , Jesus is a moral exemplar because “ he was wounded for our transgressions , by his wounds we are healed , and by his blood we are made whole . ”
Jesus is worshiped as the ultimate “ strong man ” who could overcome the pain and sting of death for the sake of righteousness .
The horror of inflicted suffering is theologically interpreted as an efficient cause toward bringing forth the greater good and thus torture becomes divinely utilitarian .
Is it a wonder why , then , on Sunday morning it is often hard to tell the difference between Jesus and Jack Bauer on Fox ’s megahit “ 24 ? ”
Like a long list of American messianic masculine archetypes ( John Wayne , Clint Eastwood , and Mel Gibson ) , Jesus is situated in this tradition of bulletproof heroes who mock the machinations of torture .
What is more , like Jack Bauer , anyone who is willing to endure torture for others is that much more justified in dishing it out .
And , unfortunately , since muscular evangelicals so identify with the mutilated body of Jesus who “ suffered for the sins of the world , ” it is only right that they , too , would condone the suffering of others in order to purge our world of “ evil . ”

Did I create that sky ?
Yes , for , if it was anything other than a conception in my mind I wouldnt have said " Sky " - That is why I am the golden eternity .
There
are not two of us here , reader and writer , but one , one golden eternity , One - Which - It - Is , That - Which - Everything - Is .
2
The awakened Buddha to show the way , the chosen Messiah to die in the degradation of sentience , is the golden eternity .
One that is what is , the golden eternity , or , God , or , Tathagata - the name .
The Named One .
The human God. Sentient Godhood .
Animate Divine .
The Deified One . The Verified One . The Free One . The Liberator .
The Still One .
The settled One . The Established One. Golden Eternity .
All is Well .
The Empty One . The Ready One . The Quitter .
The Sitter .
The Justified One . The Happy One .
3
That sky , if it was anything other than an illusion of my mortal mind I wouldnt have said " that sky . "
Thus I made that sky , I am the golden eternity .
I am Mortal Golden Eternity .
4
I was awakened to show the way , chosen to die in the degradation of life , because I am Mortal Golden Eternity .
5
I am the golden eternity in mortal animate form .
6
Strictly speaking , there is no me , because all is emptiness .
I am empty , I am non-existent .
All is bliss .
7
This truth law has no more reality than the world .
8
You are the golden eternity because there is no me and no you , only one golden eternity .
9
The Realizer .
Entertain no imaginations whatever , for the thing is a no - thing .
Knowing this then is Human Godhood .
10
This world is the movie of what everything is , it is one movie , made of the same stuff throughout , belonging to nobody , which is what everything is .
11
If we were not all the golden eternity we wouldnt be here .
Because we are here we cant help being pure .
To tell man to be pure on account of the punishing angel that punishes the bad and the rewarding angel that rewards the good would be like telling the water " Be Wet " - Never the less , all things depend on supreme reality , which is already established as the record of Karma earned - fate .
12
God is not outside us but is just us , the living and the dead , the never - lived and never - died .
That we should learn it only now , is supreme reality , it was written a long time ago in the archives of universal mind , it is already done , there 's no more to do .
13
This is the knowledge that sees the golden eternity in all things , which is us , you , me , and which is no longer us , you , me .
14
What name shall we give it which hath no name , the common eternal matter of the mind ?
If we were to call it essence , some might think it meant perfume , or gold , or honey .
It is not even mind .
It is not even discussible , groupable into words ; it is not even endless , in fact it is not even mysterious or inscrutably inexplicable ; it is what is ; it is that ; it is this .
We could easily call the golden eternity " This . "
But " what 's in a name ? " asked Shakespeare .
The golden eternity by another name would be as sweet .
A Tathagata , a God , a Buddha by another name , an Allah , a Sri Krishna , a Coyote , a Brahma , a Mazda , a Messiah , an Amida , an Aremedeia , a Maitreya , a Palalakonuh , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would be as sweet .
The golden eternity is X , the golden eternity is A , the golden eternity is /\ , the golden eternity is O , the golden eternity is [ ] , the golden eternity is t-h-e - g-o-l -d-e -n-e-t-e - r- n - i - t-y .
In the beginning was the word ; before the beginning , in the beginningless infinite neverendingness , was the essence .
Both the word " god " and the essence of the word , are emptiness .
The form of emptiness which is emptiness having taken the form of form , is what you see and hear and feel right now , and what you taste and smell and think as you read this .
Wait awhile , close your eyes , let your breathing stop three seconds or so , listen to the inside silence in the womb of the world , let your hands and nerve - ends drop , re-recognize the bliss you forgot , the emptiness and essence and ecstasy of ever having been and ever to be the golden eternity .
This is the lesson you forgot .
15
The lesson was taught long ago in the other world systems that have naturally changed into the empty and awake , and are here now smiling in our smile and scowling in our scowl .
It is only like the golden eternity pretending to be smiling and scowling to itself ; like a ripple on the smooth ocean of knowing .
The fate of humanity is to vanish into the golden eternity , return pouring into its hands which are not hands .
The navel shall receive , invert , and take back what 'd issued forth ; the ring of flesh shall close ; the personalities of long dead heroes are blank dirt .
16
The point is we 're waiting , not how comfortable we are while waiting .
Paleolithic man waited by caves for the realization of why he was there , and hunted ; modern men wait in beautified homes and try to forget death and birth .
We 're waiting for the realization that this is the golden eternity .
17
It came on time .
18
There is a blessedness surely to be believed , and that is that everything abides in eternal ecstasy , now and forever .
19
Mother Kali eats herself back .
All things but come to go .
All these holy forms , unmanifest , not even forms , truebodies of blank bright ecstasy , abiding in a trance , " in emptiness and silence ' as it is pointed out in the Diamond - cutter , asked to be only what they are : GLAD .
20
The secret God -grin in the trees and in the teapot , in ashes and fronds , fire and brick , flesh and mental human hope .
All things , far from yearning to be re-united with God , had never left themselves and here they are , Dharmakaya , the body of the truth law , the universal Thisness .
21
" Beyond the reach of change and fear , beyond all praise and blame , " the Lankavatara Scripture knows to say , is he who is what he is in time and time - less - ness , in ego and in ego - less - ness , in self and in self - less - ness .
22
Stare deep into the world before you as if it were the void : innumerable holy ghosts , buddhies , and savior gods there hide , smiling .
All the atoms emitting light inside wavehood , there is no personal separation of any of it .
A hummingbird can come into a house and a hawk will not : so rest and be assured .
While looking for the light , you may suddenly be devoured by the darkness and find the true light .
23
Things dont tire of going and coming .
The flies end up with the delicate viands .
24
The cause of the world 's woe is birth , The cure of the world 's woe is a bent stick .
25
Though it is everything , strictly speaking there is no golden eternity because everything is nothing : there are no things and no goings and comings : for all is emptiness , and emptiness is these forms , emptiness is this one formhood .
26
All these selfnesses have already vanished .
Einstein measured that this present universe is an expanding bubble , and you know what that means .
27
Discard such definite imaginations of phenomena as your own self , thou human being , thou 'rt a numberless mass of sun-motes : each mote a shrine .
The same as to your shyness of other selves , selfness as divided into infinite numbers of beings , or selfness as identified as one self existing eternally .
Be obliging and noble , be generous with your time and help and possessions , and be kind , because the emptiness of this little place of flesh you carry around and call your soul , your entity , is the same emptiness in every direction of space unmeasurable emptiness , the same , one , and holy emptiness everywhere : why be selfy and unfree , Man God , in your dream ?
Wake up , thou 'rt selfless and free .
" Even and upright your mind abides nowhere , " states Hui Neng of China .
We 're all in heaven now .
28
Roaring dreams take place in a perfectly silent mind .
Now that we know this , throw the raft away .
29
Are you tightwad and are you mean , those are the true sins , and sin is only a conception of ours , due to long habit .
Are you generous and are you kind , those are the true virtues , and they 're only conceptions .
The golden eternity rests beyond sin and virtue , is attached to neither , is attached to nothing , is unattached , because the golden eternity is Alone .
The mold has rills but it is one mold .
The field has curves but it is one field .
All things are different forms of the same thing .
I call it the golden eternity - what do you call it , brother ?
for the blessing and merit of virtue , and the punishment and bad fate of sin , are alike just so many words .
30
Sociability is a big smile , and a big smile is nothing but teeth .
Rest and be kind .
31
There 's no need to deny that evil thing called GOOGOO , which doesnt exist , just as there 's no need to deny that evil thing called Sex and Rebirth , which also does n't exist , as it is only a form of emptiness .
The bead of semen comes from a long line of awakened natures that were your parent , a holy flow , a succession of saviors pouring from the womb of the dark void and back into it , fantastic magic imagination of the lightning , flash , plays , dreams , not even plays , dreams .
32
" The womb of exuberant fertility , " Ashvhaghosha called it , radiating forms out of its womb of exuberant emptiness .
In emptiness there is no Why , no knowledge of Why , no ignorance of Why , no asking and no answering of Why , and no significance attached to this .
33
A disturbed and frightened man is like the golden eternity experimentally pretending at feeling the disturbed - and - frightened mood ; a calm and joyous man , is like the golden eternity pretending at experimenting with that experience ; a man experiencing his Sentient Being , is like the golden eternity pretending at trying that out too ; a man who has no thoughts , is like the golden eternity pretending at being itself ; because the emptiness of everything has no beginning and no end and at present is infinite .
34
" Love is all in all , " said Sainte Therese , choosing Love for her vocation and pouring out her happiness , from her garden by the gate , with a gentle smile , pouring roses on the earth , so that the beggar in the thunderbolt received of the endless offering of her dark void .
Man goes a -beggaring into nothingness .
" Ignorance is the father , Habit - Energy is the Mother . "
Opposites are not the same for the same reason they are the same .
35
The words " atoms of dust " and " the great universes " are only words .
The idea that they imply is only an idea .
The belief that we live here in this existence , divided into various beings , passing food in and out of ourselves , and casting off husks of bodies one after another with no cessation and no definite or particular discrimination , is only an idea .
The seat of our Immortal Intelligence can be seen in that beating light between the eyes the Wisdom Eye of the ancients : we know what we 're doing : we 're not disturbed : because we 're like the golden eternity pretending at playing the magic cardgame and making believe it 's real , it 's a big dream , a joyous ecstasy of words and ideas and flesh , an ethereal flower unfolding a folding back , a movie , an exuberant bunch of lines bounding emptiness , the womb of Avalokitesvara , a vast secret silence , springtime in the Void , happy young gods talking and drinking on a cloud .
Our 32,000 chillicosms bear all the marks of excellence .
Blind milky light fills our night ; and the morning is crystal .
36
Give a gift to your brother , but there 's no gift to compare with the giving of assurance that he is the golden eternity .
The true understanding of this would bring tears to your eyes .
The other shore is right here , forgive and forget , protect and reassure .
Your tormenters will be purified .
Raise thy diamond hand .
Have faith and wait .
The course of your days is a river rumbling over your rocky back .
You 're sitting at the bottom of the world with a head of iron .
Religion is thy sad heart .
You 're the golden eternity and it must be done by you .
And means one thing : Nothing - Ever-Happened .
This is the golden eternity .
37
When the Prince of the Kalinga severed the flesh from the limbs and body of Buddha , even then the Buddha was free from any such ideas as his own self , other self , living beings divided into many selves , or living beings united and identified into one eternal self .
The golden eternity isnt " me . "
Before you can know that you 're dreaming you 'll wake up , Atman .
Had the Buddha , the Awakened One , cherished any of these imaginary judgments of and about things , he would have fallen into impatience and hatred in his suffering .
Instead , like Jesus on the Cross he saw the light and died kind , loving all living things .
38
The world was spun out of a blade of grass : the world was spun out of a mind .
Heaven was spun out of a blade of grass : heaven was spun out of a mind .
Neither will do you much good , neither will do you much harm .
The Oriental imperturbed , is the golden eternity .
39
He is called a Yogi , his is called a Priest , a Minister , a Brahmin , a Parson , a Chaplain , a Roshi , a Laoshih , a Master , a Patriarch , a Pope , a Spiritual Commissar , a Counselor , and Adviser , a Bodhisattva - Mahasattva , an Old Man , a Saint , a Shaman , a Leader , who thinks nothing of himself as separate from another self , not higher nor lower , no stages and no definite attainments , no mysterious stigmata or secret holyhood , no wild dark knowledge and no venerable authoritativeness , nay a giggling sage sweeping out of the kitchen with a broom .
After supper , a silent smoke .
Because there is no definite teaching : the world is undisciplined .
Nature endlessly in every direction inward to your body and outward into space .
40
Meditate outdoors .
The dark trees at night are not really the dark trees at night , it 's only the golden eternity .
41
A mosquito as big as Mount Everest is much bigger than you think : a horse 's hoof is more delicate than it looks .
An altar consecrated to the golden eternity , filled with roses and lotuses and diamonds , is the cell of the humble prisoner , the cell so cold and dreary .
Boethius kissed the Robe of the Mother Truth in a Roman dungeon .
42
Do you think the emptiness of the sky will ever crumble away ?
Every little child knows that everybody will go to heaven .
Knowing that nothing ever happened is not really knowing that nothing ever happened , it 's the golden eternity .
In other words , nothing can compare with telling your brother and your sister that what happened , what is happening , and what will happen , never really happened , is not really happening and never will happen , it is only the golden eternity .
Nothing was ever born , nothing will ever die .
Indeed , it didnt even happen that you heard about golden eternity through the accidental reading of this scripture .
The thing is easily false .
There are no warnings whatever issuing from the golden eternity : do what you want .
43
Even in dreams be kind , because anyway there is no time , no space , no mind .
" It 's all not - born , " said Bankei of Japan , whose mother heard this from her son did what we call " died happy . "
And even if she had died unhappy , dying unhappy is not really dying unhappy , it 's the golden eternity .
It 's impossible to exist , it 's impossible to be persecuted , it 's impossible to miss your reward .
44
Eight hundred and four thousand myriads of Awakened Ones throughout numberless swirls of epochs appeared to work hard to save a grain of sand , and it was only the golden eternity .
And their combined reward will be no greater and no lesser than what will be won by a piece of dried turd .
It 's a reward beyond thought .
45
When you 've understood this scripture , throw it away .
If you cant understand this scripture , throw it away .
I insist on your freedom .
46
O everlasting Eternity , all things and all truth laws are no- things , in three ways , which is the same way : AS THINGS OF TIME they dont exist because there is no furthest atom than can be found or weighed or grasped , it is emptiness through and through , matter and empty space too .
AS THINGS OF MIND they dont exist , because the mind that conceives and makes them out does so by seeing , hearing touching , smelling , tasting , and mentally - noticing and without this mind they would not be seen or heard or felt or smelled or tasted or mentally - noticed , they are discriminated that which they 're not necessarily by imaginary judgments of the mind , they are actually dependent on the mind that makes them out , by themselves they are no - things , they are really mental , seen only of the mind , they are really empty visions of the mind , heaven is a vision , everything is a vision .
What does it mean that I am in this endless universe thinking I 'm a man sitting under the stars on the terrace of earth , but actually empty and awake throughout the emptiness and awakedness of everything ?
It means that I am empty and awake , knowing that I am empty and awake , and that there 's no difference between me and anything else .
It means that I have attained to that which everything is .
47
The - Attainer - To - That - Which - Everything - Is , the Sanskrit Tathagata , has no ideas whatever but abides in essence identically with the essence of all things , which is what it is , in emptiness and silence .
Imaginary meaning stretched to make mountains and as far as the germ is concerned it stretched even further to make molehills .
A million souls dropped through hell but nobody saw them or counted them .
A lot of large people isnt really a lot of large people , it 's only the golden eternity .
When St. Francis went to heaven he did not add to heaven nor detract from earth .
Locate silence , possess space , spot me the ego .
" From the beginning , " said the Sixth Patriarch of the China School , " not a thing is . "
48
He who loves all life with his pity and intelligence isnt really he who loves all life with his pity and intelligence , it 's only natural .
The universe is fully known because it is ignored .
Enlightenment comes when you dont care .
This is a good tree stump I 'm sitting on .
You cant even grasp your own pain let alone your eternal reward .
I love you because you 're me .
I love you because there 's nothing else to do .
It 's just the natural golden eternity .
49
What does it mean that those trees and mountains are magic and unreal ?-
It means that those trees and mountains are magic and unreal .
What does it mean that those trees and mountains are not magic but real ?- it means that those trees and mountains are not magic but real .
Men are just making imaginary judgments both ways , and all the time it 's just the same natural golden eternity .
50
If the golden eternity was anything other than mere words , you could not have said " golden eternity . "
This means that the words are used to point at the endless nothingness of reality .
If the endless nothingness of reality was anything other than mere words , you could not have said " endless nothingness of reality , " you could not have said it .
This means that the golden eternity is out of our word - reach , it refuses steadfastly to be described , it runs away from us and leads us in .
The name is not really the name .
The same way , you could not have said " this world " if this world was anything other than mere words .
There 's nothing there but just that .
They 've long known that there 's nothing to life but just the living of it .
It Is What It Is and That 's All It Is .
51
There 's no system of teaching and no reward for teaching the golden eternity , because nothing has happened .
In the golden eternity teaching and reward havent even vanished let alone appeared .
The golden eternity doesnt even have to be perfect .
It is very silly of me to talk about it .
I talk about it simply because here I am dreaming that I talk about it in a dream already ended , ages ago , from which I 'm already awake , and it was only an empty dreaming , in fact nothing whatever , in fact nothing ever happened at all .
The beauty of attaining the golden eternity is that nothing will be acquired , at last .
52
Kindness and sympathy , understanding and encouragement , these give : they are better than just presents and gifts : no reason in the world why not .
Anyhow , be nice .
Remember the golden eternity is yourself .
" If someone will simply practice kindness , " said Gotama to Subhuti , " he will soon attain highest perfect wisdom . "
Then he added : " Kindness after all is only a word and it should be done on the spot without thought of kindness . "
By practicing kindness all over with everyone you will soon come into the holy trance , infinite distinctions of personalities will become what they really mysteriously are , our common and eternal blissstuff , the pureness of everything forever , the great bright essence of mind , even and one thing everywhere the holy eternal milky love , the white light everywhere everything , emptybliss , svaha , shining , ready , and awake , the compassion in the sound of silence , the swarming myriad trillionaire you are .
53
Everything 's alright , form is emptiness and emptiness is form , and we 're here forever , in one form or another , which is empty .
Everything 's alright , we 're not here , there , or anywhere .
Everything 's alright , cats sleep .
54
The everlasting and tranquil essence , look around and see the smiling essence everywhere .
How wily was the world made , Maya , not - even - made .
55
There 's the world in the daylight .
If it was completely dark you wouldnt see it but it would still be there .
If you close your eyes you really see what it 's like : mysterious particle - swarming emptiness .
On the moon big mosquitos of straw know this in the kindness of their hearts .
Truly speaking , unrecognizably sweet it all is .
Do n't worry about nothing .
56
Imaginary judgments about things , in the Nothing - Ever - Happened wonderful void , you dont even have to reject them , let alone accept them .
" That looks like a tree , let 's call it a tree , " said Coyote to Earthmaker at the beginning , and they walked around the rootdrinker patting their bellies .
57
Perfectly selfless , the beauty of it , the butterfly doesnt take it as a personal achievement , he just disappears through the trees .
You too , kind and humble and not - even - here , it wasnt in a greedy mood that you saw the light that belongs to everybody .
58
Look at your little finger , the emptiness of it is no different that the emptiness of infinity .
59
Cats yawn because they realize that there 's nothing to do .
60
Up in heaven you wont remember all these tricks of yours .
You wont even sigh " Why ? "
Whether as atomic dust or as great cities , what 's the difference in all this stuff .
A tree is still only a rootdrinker .
The puma 's twisted face continues to look at the blue sky with sightless eyes , Ah sweet divine and indescribable verdurous paradise planted in mid-air !
Caitanya , it 's only consciousness .
Not with thoughts of your mind , but in the believing sweetness of your heart , you snap the link and open the golden door and disappear into the bright room , the everlasting ecstasy , eternal Now .
Soldier , follow me !
- there never was a war .
Arjuna , dont fight !
- why fight over nothing ?
Bless and sit down .
61
I remember that I 'm supposed to be a man and consciousness and I focus my eyes and the print reappears and the words of the poor book are saying , " The world , as God has made it " and there are no words in my pitying heart to express the knowless loveliness of the trance there was before I read those words , I had no such idea that there was a world .
62
This world has no marks , signs , or evidence of existence , nor the noises in it , like accident of wind or voices or heehawing animals , yet listen closely the eternal hush of silence goes on and on throughout all this , and has been gong on , and will go on and on .
This is because the world is nothing but a dream and is just thought of and the everlasting eternity pays no attention to it .
At night under the moon , or in a quiet room , hush now , the secret music of the Unborn goes on and on , beyond conception , awake beyond existence .
Properly speaking , awake is not really awake because the golden eternity never went to sleep ; you can tell by the constant sound of Silence which cuts through this world like a magic diamond through the trick of your not realizing that your mind caused the world .
63
The God of the American Plateau Indian was Coyote .
He says : " Earth !
those beings living on your surface , none of them disappearing , will all be transformed .
When I have spoken to them , when they have spoken to me , from that moment on , their words and their bodies which they usually use to move about with , will all change .
I will not have heard them . "
64
I was smelling flowers in the yard , and when I stood up I took a deep breath and the blood all rushed to my brain and I woke up dead on my back in the grass .
I had apparently fainted , or died , for about sixty seconds .
My neighbor saw me but he thought I had just suddenly thrown myself on the grass to enjoy the sun .
During that timeless moment of unconsciousness I saw the golden eternity .
I saw heaven .
In it nothing had ever happened , the events of a million years ago were just as phantom and ungraspable as the events of now , or the events of the next ten minutes .
It was perfect , the golden solitude , the golden emptiness , Something - Or- Other , something surely humble .
There was a rapturous ring of silence abiding perfectly .
There was no question of being alive or not being alive , of likes and dislikes , of near or far , no question of giving or gratitude , no question of mercy or judgment , or of suffering or its opposite or anything .
It was the womb itself , aloneness , alaya vijnana the universal store , the Great Free Treasure , the Great Victory , infinite completion , the joyful mysterious essence of Arrangement .
It seemed like one smiling smile , one adorable adoration , one gracious and adorable charity , everlasting safety , refreshing afternoon , roses , infinite brilliant immaterial gold ash , the Golden Age .
The " golden " came from the sun in my eyelids , and the " eternity " from my sudden instant realization as I woke up that I had just been where it all came from and where it was all returning , the everlasting So , and so never coming or going ; therefore I call it the golden eternity but you can call it anything you want .
As I regained consciousness I felt so sorry I had a body and a mind suddenly realizing I did n't even have a body and a mind and nothing had ever happened and everything is alright forever and forever and forever , O thank you thank you thank you .
65
This is the first teaching from the golden eternity .
66
The second teaching from the golden eternity is that there never was a first teaching from the golden eternity .
So be sure .

In a recent post on the PlayStation Forums , CyndoniaX detailed PlayStation Home ’s 1.21 update .
But what really grabbed everyone ’s interest is the fact that she briefly spoke about picture frames .
And guess what ?
They are coming …
Just not in the 1.21 update .
However , CyndoniaX did hint that it ’s coming very soon , and will be part of the Home application once E3 rolls around .
She also discussed the items that vary in all the different PlayStation Homes .
She explains that every different region has its own business deals , which means that items available in Japan may not make it to the North American Home .

The risks of piracy mean little to people accustomed to violence Searching for satellite images of the pirate village of Eyl in Somalia , you are confronted not with palaces and piles of arms but a few crumbling houses and rows of battered boats along the beach .
Even here , where pirate millions first reach Somalia , desperate poverty is everywhere and insecurity is the norm .
US President Barack Obama has said that Somali piracy must be brought under control .
But the world 's attention is for the most part fixed on the ocean , while the real challenges lie ashore .
What we are seeing in the Gulf of Aden and western Indian Ocean is just the visible tip of a complex web of challenges inside Somalia , a web that reaches across the country , the region and the world .
Somalia is one of the poorest , most violent , least stable countries anywhere on Earth .
It suffers from severe drought and its people face hunger and violence on a daily basis .
This is not a new situation , Somalia , especially the south , has been in this state for many years .
The risks associated with piracy can be seen as little worse than those faced every day
What is new is that the world is now once again concerned with the goings on of this collapsed state .
Somalis have learnt to live in circumstances under which many might be expected to give up .
In the face of overwhelming adversity they have created thriving businesses , operating entirely in the informal sector , and hospitals built and maintained with money sent home by the diaspora .
However , people who have been forgotten by the world and who hear of toxic waste being dumped on their beaches and foreigners stealing their fish have difficulty being concerned when representatives of that world are held to ransom .
And for many who have grown up surrounded by constant insecurity and bloodshed , violence and the risk of death are unexceptional hazards .
For this reason the current attempts to fight piracy from the sea are only dealing with symptoms .
They do not address the reasons why young men are prepared to risk their lives chasing ships around the ocean .
Deadly country Somalia 's poverty leads many to flee , seeking a better or safe life abroad Piracy is in essence a law and order issue , and in Somalia there is virtually no authority to carry out the kind of policing that could effectively disrupt pirate operations .
What government there is in Somalia has bigger problems .
The ongoing battle with the hard line Al Shabaab militia that controls Kismaayo and the deep south threatens not just the security of the state but has made Mogadishu one of the deadliest places on earth .
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad heads a fairly broad coalition but his opponents have men , weapons and money and are in a fierce struggle to gain control of the country .
When the internationally recognised government is fighting for control of its own capital city , combating pirates must seem a somewhat lower priority .
Even in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland in the north east , from where most pirate attacks are launched , the local government is contending with massive problems .
Boats laden with desperate refugees fleeing the war in Somalia leave almost daily , heading towards Yemen .
The smugglers often dump their human cargoes in the sea to avoid capture and leave them to drown .
Even for those who make it to the other side , life as second class citizens in already poor Yemen is dire .
No engagement Military solutions do not address the root causes of the piracy Somalia has spent almost 20 years in a state of civil war , and shifting alliances , international interventions and a steady supply of unemployed young men and cheap guns have acted against any tendencies towards stabilisation .
In a country where the average income is estimated at around $ 650 ( £ 435 ) - Somalia is too anarchic for accurate statistics - the lure of up to $ 10,000 for a successful pirate raid is obvious .
The chronic instability of most of the country and the attendant daily threats to life mean that the risks associated with piracy can be seen as little worse than those faced every day .
Pirate bosses have little difficulty recruiting to fill any gaps in their crews .
In this context a solution based on security systems and guns will not address the root causes of Somali piracy .
There are ways that navies from around the world can plaster over the problems of Somalia but as long as a state with grinding poverty , hunger , no law enforcement and no effective government sits beside a rich trading route , piracy will continue .
The outside world has for too long seen Somalia only in terms of threats to their own security .
Targeted missiles and interventions have been used to remove threatening individuals or groups but there has been no serious engagement with the political and developmental problems that allow those threats to take root .
If there is a silver lining to the piracy issue it may be that a deeper , broader and more imaginative engagement with Somalia develops .
Piracy is difficult for the nations of the world and disastrous for sailors - but for millions of Somalis the problems of their homeland are catastrophic .
Roger Middleton is coordinating a new project at the think - tank Chatham House investigating the economic dimensions of conflict in the Horn of Africa .

A version of this story was published on Salon .
Evidence is emerging that medical personnel monitored the medical effects of the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah , the al - Qaida operative who was , according to government reports , subjected to the near - drowning at least 83 times in August 2002 .
The new information comes from descriptions of cables , classified as top secret and relating to the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah , that were transmitted from a Central Intelligence Agency field station to the agency 's Langley , Va. , headquarters nearly every day between Aug. 1 and Aug. 18 that year .
The descriptions of the cables ( here and here ) reveal that a daily " medical update " and " behavioral comments " along with status and threat updates were sent to CIA headquarters throughout that period .
On five occasions between Aug. 4 and Aug. 9 , an additional cable was sent containing " medical information " along with such information as the strategies for interrogation sessions , raw intelligence , the use of interrogation techniques to elicit information , and the reactions to those techniques .
The fact that medical information was included in these cables hints that Abu Zubaydah was medically monitored during or after being subjected to those techniques .
Both professional organizations and human rights groups have rejected as unethical any monitoring role for medical personnel .
A summary of the 34 cables and of a handwritten log book were released to the American Civil Liberties Union earlier this month on orders of U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein , who is presiding over a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the group .
The lawsuit was based on a request for records related to detainee treatment that the ACLU and four other advocacy groups made of the U.S. Departments of Defense , Justice and State and the CIA in 2003 .
The new summary , known as a Vaughn Index , was released in response to a motion that the ACLU filed in 2007 after then - CIA director Michael Hayden acknowledged that the agency had destroyed videotapes of detainee interrogations in 2005 .
The cables themselves have not been made public , and the agency is contesting their release .
In response to a request for more detail on the medical information included in the cables and the reasons that information was transmitted from the field site to CIA headquarters , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano wrote in an e-mail to ProPublica : " The materials speak for themselves . "
The U.S. Department of Justice gave the ACLU other documents this month that suggest the cables are among nearly 550 interrogation - related cables sent from field stations to CIA headquarters between April and December 2002 .
Among those analyzing the new documents are National Public Radio's Ari Shapiro , the Washington Independent 's Spencer Ackerman and Firedoglake 's Marcy Wheeler .
The documents are the latest installment of an ongoing story about the role of doctors and psychologists in the government 's efforts to pry information from suspected terrorists .
Professional organizations of doctors , nurses , public health practitioners and psychologists have stated their opposition to health professionals ' involvement in torture .
" The AMA has taken the clear stand that the participation of physicians in torture and interrogation is a violation of core ethical values , " the American Medical Association said in a statement last Friday .
Last month , the AMA sent a letter to President Barack Obama reiterating , as it did during the Bush administration , that the association 's ethical code prohibits physicians from participating in torture or coercive interrogation .
However , there is evidence that health personnel , at least some of them physicians , have been involved in interrogations .
For example Col. Thomas M. Pappas , former chief of military intelligence at Abu Ghraib , who was interviewed as part of the Taguba investigation , testified that a psychiatrist and another doctor monitored interrogations at the prison and had the final say in what aspects of the interrogation plan were implemented .
The question raised by the cables is , How deep was the involvement of physicians or other health professionals in the actual interrogations at CIA " black sites " such as the one where Abu Zubaydah was held ?
Previously released documents show that Bush officials overseeing the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah saw the involvement of medical personnel as crucial because it could help prevent prosecution of interrogators under U.S. law .
As ProPublica previously reported , Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee signed a memo on August 1 , 2002 spelling out those concerns and the terms under which interrogators could waterboard and slap Abu Zubaydah , subject him to " cramped confinement " and stress positions , and shove him into flexible walls .
" The constant presence of personnel with medical training who have the authority to stop the interrogation should it appear it is medically necessary indicates that it is not your intent to cause severe physical pain , " the memo said .
Abu Zubaydah began cooperating in late April under questioning by Ali Soufan , a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who said he did not use coercive methods .
In congressional testimony this month , Soufan disclosed that there was a " CIA medical team supporting us " when he and other FBI and CIA personnel first spoke with Abu Zubaydah .
Soufan said the medical team insisted that Abu Zubaydah , who was injured during capture and in danger of dying , be taken to a hospital for treatment .
It is unclear whether the same CIA medical team that evaluated Abu Zubaydah 's health problems in the spring was still caring for him in August when he was waterboarded .
Nor is it clear precisely how health personnel might have been asked to cross the line from providing medical care to participating in or supporting the interrogations , which Soufan and other sources have described as becoming increasingly abusive under the instruction of a former military Survival , Evasion , Resistance , and Escape ( SERE ) training psychologist contracted by the CIA .
Soufan and others , including another psychologist employed by the CIA , protested the escalating techniques and left the site .
The new documents do not indicate whether medical personnel might also have objected .
In a cover letter accompanying the new Vaughn Index , acting U.S. attorney Lev L. Dassin wrote , " The Government is ... acknowledging that August 2002 was the month during which Abu Zubaydah was subjected to the most intensive interrogations . "
An Aug. 4 , 2002 , cable with the subject " Abu Zubaydah Interrogation " is a typical entry in the Vaughn Index :
This is a four - page cable from the Field to CIA Headquarters .
The cable includes information concerning the strategies for interrogation sessions ; the use of interrogation techniques to elicit information on terrorist operations against the U.S. ; reactions to the interrogation techniques ; raw intelligence ; a status of threat information , and medical information .
The news that medical information was being transmitted regularly to CIA headquarters throughout the time Abu Zubaydah was being repeatedly waterboarded troubled medical ethics experts interviewed by ProPublica .
Normally , health professionals who work at U.S. prisons share inmates ' medical information with authorities only " if there 's a need to know ; for example if someone has a seizure disorder , we put in a medical order for a bottom bunk , " Dr. Dean Rieger , chief medical officer for Correct Care Solutions , a healthcare management company for correctional facilities , said in an interview with ProPublica .
Rieger , who has been involved in corrections for more than three decades and who coauthors a column on medical ethics for the Society of Correctional Physicians , said it would be problematic to continue sharing an inmate 's medical information with authorities overseeing a system " that creates the harm in the first place . "
University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Arthur Caplan agreed .
At that point , " you gotta start protesting and stop transmitting , " he said in an interview .
" The issue is n't privacy violations , it 's complicity ...
You 're part of the torture team at that point if you 're assessing injuries and saying whether the person 's capable of enduring more . "
Legal memos written in 2005 suggest the CIA had reached precisely the opposite conclusion -- that waterboarding and other harsh interrogations should involve personnel from the CIA 's Office of Medical Services , including its physicians .
A recently declassified Justice Department memo discussed the involvement the OMS eventually had in supporting interrogations .
That memo , quoting still - classified OMS guidelines from December 2004 , said that the " use of the waterboard requires the presence of a physician . "
Another memo said that OMS doctors and psychologists had been consulted about the effects of using several techniques together , such as " when an insult slap is simultaneously combined with water dousing or a kneeling stress position , or when wall standing is simultaneously combined with an abdominal slap and water dousing " and concluded they would not cause severe pain .
Medical personnel were also given the responsibility of monitoring the interrogations for safety .
" Should it appear at any time that Abu Zubaydah is experiencing severe pain or suffering , the medical personnel on hand will stop the use of any technique , " Bybee 's 2002 memo said .
It is unclear whether the " medical personnel " designated to monitor Abu Zubaydah 's interrogation included M.D.s .
" There is no role for physicians in those practices , " Dr. Otmar Kloiber , secretary - general of the World Medical Association , told ProPublica .
Kloiber said that physician involvement in interrogations increases the chances that questioning will devolve into abuse and torture .
A physician 's reassuring presence can give questioners a green light to escalate physical and mental pressure .
In a confidential International Committee of the Red Cross report made public by New York Review of Books contributor Mark Danner last month , Abu Zubaydah described to ICRC interviewers days of being waterboarded to the point he believed he would die , slammed into hard and flexible walls , and confined in a small box where one of his wounds reopened and began to bleed .
" Eventually , " Abu Zubaydah said , " the torture was stopped by the intervention of the doctor . "
The ICRC report also reveals that other detainees who spent time in the CIA 's black sites perceived that some staff who treated them or monitored their interrogations were physicians .
The potential presence of physicians as opposed to other types of personnel raises crucial questions .
Numerous officials , both Republican and Democrat , have characterized waterboarding as torture .
There is widespread agreement among doctors -- whether employed by the military , other government agencies , or not -- that ethical standards prohibit physicians from using medical knowledge or information about patients to support torture .
The World Medical Association , which lists 85 countries including the U.S. as members , was established in 1947 to uphold independence and ethical behavior among physicians after the horrors of Nazi medicine were revealed .
It is arguably the world 's key arbiter of medical ethics .
Earlier this month , the group 's governing council issued a resolution reaffirming the group 's long - standing position that physicians are forbidden from " participating in , or even being present during , the practice of torture or other forms of cruel , inhuman , or degrading procedures " and must denounce those acts whenever they 're aware of them .
According to officials from the WMA and the Norwegian Medical Association , which put forward the resolution , the original draft made specific reference to U.S. detention facilities .
At the WMA council meeting in Jerusalem earlier this month , intense discussion ensued between normally staid physicians over whether to remove mention of the U.S. and make the language more generic .
WMA officials declined to say who took up which side .
" It got heated enough I had to call a short recess and have a cooling - off period , " WMA chair Dr. Edward Hill told ProPublica .
Hill , a former president of the American Medical Association , said the U.S. delegation stayed out of the debate .
But the American delegation made its views clear , according to Dr. Trond Markestad , who drafted the original resolution and who chairs the ethics committee in the Norwegian Medical Association .
" They felt it was a bit unfair , was n't really correct , to single out that one [ example ] since there were so many wars going on and so many things happening all over the world and since they 'd already addressed this nationally . "
The final version of the WMA resolution passed unanimously after language naming the U.S. was removed .
The resolution condemns " reports worldwide " of " deeply unsettling practices by health professionals , including direct participation in the infliction of ill - treatment , monitoring specific methods of ill - treatment , and participation in interrogation processes . "
The group also resolved to support physicians who refuse to participate in or condone torture .
Kloiber told ProPublica that WMA members are concerned , for example , that physicians in areas where sharia law is adopted are being asked to carry out punishments such as amputations .
The WMA resolution calls on national medical associations , such as the AMA , to investigate breaches of fundamental medical ethics among physicians .
But the AMA has not made public whether its ethics and judicial body has ever investigated or sanctioned physicians for participating in torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .
Last Friday , the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York launched an advocacy campaign that aims " to hold accountable healers that have harmed . "
The group is encouraging citizens to file complaints against health professionals suspected of participating in torture and to support legislation , such as a proposed bill in New York state , that prohibits health professionals from participating in torture or the improper treatment of prisoners at home or abroad .
Fun times for senators from Arkansas .
From MarketWatch …
Citigroup Inc. lowered its rating on Wal - Mart Stores Inc. to hold from buy on Tuesday , citing concern that legislation intended to make it easier for employees to unionize would raise the retail giant ’s labor costs and hurt its competitiveness .
Kos has a post up saying that it ’s wrong to think that EFCA needs 60 votes rather than a mere 50 votes , figuring that several senators will vote against EFCA on the actual bill but vote for cloture ( where the 60 rule actually applies . )
That ’s what Lieberman did on Alito , for instance .
Kos has a much better handle on vote - counting and the mechanics of these kinds of things than I do .
And I hope he ’s right because EFCA is extremely important .
But I ’m not as optimistic as he is that 60 is n’t the threshold .
Two of the key votes are Lincoln and Pryor from Arkansas , a very lightly unionized state where Walmart is headquartered .
Walmart does n’t care about optics on this .
This is the real deal for them , as the Citigroup downrating makes clear .
I do n’t see them being thrown by pulling a Lieberman and voting ‘ wrong ’ where it counts and ‘ right ’ where it does n’t count .
That works in a case where the audience is voters .
So for instance , if a really unpopular bailout bill comes up , I could see a lot of senators voting for cloture but not having the stomach for the real vote .
Because what you ’re worried about is mass opinion and 30 second tv ads .
But this is n’t like that .
For the Arkansan senators , this is a constituency of one .
And for other senators , it may be a little less clear since there ’s not one dominant company .
But there are still key businesses that this means a lot too .
For the folks these senators are worried about offending , ticking off — those people are hip to how the procedural niceties work .
And they want to know who their friends are .

Pte Leon Wilson Defence chiefs pronounced Pte Wilson , who is on attachment with 2nd Battalion of the Mercian Regiment ( Worcesters and Foresters ) " officially the luckiest man in the British Army " .
Pte Wilson was manning a machine gun during a fierce battle with the Taleban in Helmand Province when he was hit by the 7.62 mm AK47 bullet , the Ministry of Defence said .
" I took my finger off the trigger when the shot hit my helmet , " Pte Wilson said .
" I was knocked clean off my position and landed on my back .
I had my eyes shut . "
Pte Wilson , who usually works as an electrician , asked a comrade if he had been shot .
' Good soldier ' " He was just staring at me in amazement and swearing , and said ' Yes ' , " Pte Wilson said .

Why Do Some Women Kill ?
Criminologists say when women kill , it 's often for different reasons from men .
April 14 , 2009  --
Police investigating the murder of Sandra Cantu said they were on the lookout for the kind of man who could kill an 8 - year - old girl and stuff her body in a suitcase .
But the suspect they arrested late last week did n't fit their expectations .
Police say Sandra 's killer is 28 - year - old Melissa Huckaby , a Sunday school teacher and the mother of one of Sandra 's close friends .
Huckaby allegedly killed the second - grader and dumped the suitcase containing her body in a nearby irrigation pond .
Though little is known about Huckaby or a possible motive , if the allegations are true , Huckaby would not fit the typical profile of a killer .
According to the Justice Department , roughly one in 10 homicides are committed by women .
And when women kill , their victims are more likely to be someone close to them , like their children , boyfriends or spouses .
Forensic psychologists and criminal profilers say women who kill have backgrounds and motivations that are often quite different from their male counterparts .
Compared with men , women are more likely to be related to their victim , less likely to plan in advance and less likely to use extreme violence .
Criminologists : Women and Men Kill for Different Reasons
" Women are different in whom , how and why they kill , " said James Alan Fox , a criminologist at Northeastern University .
" The victims are younger , they 're more often related to them , they kill with means other than guns .
" The traditional female role is a nurturer , not a murderer .
Extreme violence is far more alien to females than to males , " he added .
" When a murder is committed by a female , it 's more likely to be self - defense or can reflect some sort of mental illness . "
Though women committed roughly 10 percent of murders between 1976 and 2005 , they were involved in nearly 35 percent of murders of intimate partners and nearly 30 percent of murders of where the victim was another family member , according to the Justice Department .
So far , police have not released a possible motive for Cantu 's death .
Prosecutors told the Associated Press Monday that they are considering rape and molestation allegations against Huckaby .
San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Robert Himmelblau told
The AP Monday that a homicide charge against Huckaby could also include the special circumstances of rape with a foreign object , lewd and lascivious conduct with a child and murder in the course of a kidnapping .
Motive in Sandra Cantu Slaying Still Unclear
Sgt. Tony Sheneman declined comment on whether or not Huckaby may have shared any details about how Sandra died .
He said autopsy results would yield further information when they are released , likely in several weeks .
Family members said Huckaby , the granddaughter of the local pastor , was a devoted mother to her 5 - year - old daughter .
" We 're very , very shocked , " said Joani Hughes , Huckaby 's aunt .
" It 's very out of character for Melissa . "
But her father , Brian Lawless , said that his daughter had often struggled with raising a child on her own and had sometimes suffered from bouts of depression .
" I have no doubt in mind she knows right from wrong , " her grandfather , Clove Road Baptist Church pastor Lane Lawless , said .
" At least I thought she did .
Maybe I 'm mistaken . "
Brian Lawless said he 's visited his daughter in jail and that they cried together .
" She looks tired , " he said .
" She has n't slept much , but all in all , she looks good . "
But when he sees his daughter 's mug shot on television and hears the crimes she 's accused of he does n't see the woman he raised .
" The young lady I see on film – that 's not my daughter , " Lawless said .
Huckaby had also been in trouble with the law .
When she was arrested Friday night on kidnapping and murder charges , after six hours of questioning , she was on probation for theft .
Huckaby does not have any history of violent behavior , Sheneman said , adding police are confident that she acted alone .
Huckaby remains in police custody and is due to be arraigned in court today .
Police said that when Cantu was captured on a surveillance camera , happily skipping down the street , she was on her way to play at Huckaby 's home .
Sheneman said police believe the 8 - year - old was killed " very soon after she was seen on the video . "
Dr. Michael Welner , a forensic psychiatrist and chairman of The Forensic Panel , told " Good Morning America " today that the arrest of a woman in a murder such as Sandra 's is " really strange and peculiar . "
" There 's more to the story , " he said .
" And instinct tells me to sit back and let the case come to all of us . "
Welner said there are a " whole range of possibilities " that could have led to Huckaby 's arrest .
" The possibilities are she is as horrible as everybody imagines , " Welner said .
" Or she could have gotten in over her head in an interrogation and gave statements that incriminated herself in a way that are actually inaccurate . "
Welner said women are statistically less likely to murder than men in part because " destruction and the ability ... use power to knock someone down is so tied into a masculine identity . "
" That 's not part of what makes women feminine in this culture or in any culture , " he said .
Though there is no single profile of female killers , mental illness has played a part in many of their high - profile killings .
According to Jack Levin , a criminology professor at Northeastern University , female killers are more likely than men to suffer from serious mental illness , while male killers more typically suffer from personality disorders , and are often sociopaths who are unable to empathize with their victims .
Andrea Yates , a Houston mother who drowned her five children in 2001 , was found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a state mental hospital .
Her attorneys argued that she suffered from severe postpartum psychosis , believed Satan was inside of her , and was trying to save her children from hell .
Women Less Likely to Use Extreme Violence
" There are a number of different roads that lead to someone taking someone else 's life , " said Xavier Amador , a clinical psychology professor at Columbia University .
" In women , in my experience , it tends to be typically related to a history of abuse or psychosis . "
Women are also less likely to use a violent means of killing or to plan out their attacks , psychologists say .
Though women account for roughly 10 percent of all homicides , they are involved in 36 percent of poisonings , according to the Justice Department .
Stacey Castor was sentenced to 25 years to life last year for poisoning her husband David Castor with antifreeze , and to another 25 years for the attempt to kill her daughter Ashley Wallace , then 20 , with an overdose of drugs and vodka in September 2007 .
" Women tend as a rule to do softer killings , poisoning , suffocation , those sorts of things .
Rarely are they the slasher types or inflicting a lot of bodily damage , " said Gregg McCrary , a retired criminal profiler for the FBI .
" For women , killing is often seen as a last resort -- a defensive move , whereas , for men , it 's an offenseive move , " said Fox .

Introduction
In our company , code reviews play an integral part in the development process for making quality software .
We opt for a mentor style approach with Wufoo , where a developer works on a segment for a period of time and then passes it up to a more experienced developer for review .
We really like this approach because it means more developers become familiar with the foundation of different code level services .
More importantly , they act as an additional safeguard against security holes , memory leaks , poor queries and heavy file structures .
Unfortunately , these reviews are also very time consuming and in a small team can sometimes be an inconvenience to the reviewer — another developer with their own todo list to accomplish .
Given that all reviews check against the same list of requirements , we ’ve found ourselves repeating the same tasks over and over again .
We spend a lot of time echoing queries , memory stats and objects to the browser just to see how they are being used in the code .
To reduce this repetition , we invested some time creating something we ’ve called the PHP Quick Profiler — we call it PQP for short .
It ’s a small tool ( think Firebug for PHP ) to provide profiling and debugging related information to developers without needing them to add a lot of programmatic overhead to their code .
Now , we only need to toggle one config setting to true and our reviewers have access to an automated tool to help create a faster and more consistent review experience .
Since anyone can use it , PQP also gives the initial developer an idea of where their code stands before the review .
We ’ve been using PQP for a while now with Wufoo .
It ’s been so useful that we decided to take some time to package everything , write out some documentation and offer it up for anyone to use .
See it in Action
We ’ve created an online example showing a landing page with PQP turned on .
The profiler contains a 5 tabbed interface that presents pages for logging messages , measuring execution time , analyzing queries , revealing memory used and showing the files included .
Thanks to Kevin ’s help , who did a great job of designing and encapsulating the interface , there ’s no need here to add links to external CSS files or Scripts to make it show up right .
When included on a page in PHP , PQP automatically inserts the markup , CSS and JavaScript needed to make the interface show up and just work .
PQP should work with Internet Explorer 6 and up , Firefox and Safari .
Getting Started
We ’ve provided a zip file which contains the entire setup for PQP and some basic instructions for installation .
Download : pqp.zip
Once you ’ve downloaded the zip , upload the contents to a PHP enabled web server .
Navigating to the root directory in your browser will show the same online example we linked to above .
At this point , each tab should work except for the database tab , which requires some additional configuration .
Once you get the example working , the next step would be integration with your own project .
It ’s important to note that dropping the folder into your own project directory will not work .
This is because 5 different aspects of the code are being looked at , and you may handle those situations differently than we do .
That said , integration is pretty straightforward , and by following the guidelines for each section below , you should be up and running in no time .
Using It In Your Code
The easiest way to make PQP work in your own code is to include PhpQuickProfiler .
php into the page you want to see it on .
That alone will enable the console , memory and file logging .
Speed and database logging take a bit more work , which we ’ll cover later .
Now , enabling the default logging is great , but nothing will display to the screen by just including the file .
To display to the screen , a bit more knowledge on what ’s happening is required .
As code is being executed , details are being logged and analyzed in PQP .
Once the code is finished , PQP finishes up also , and displays the output to the screen .
The tricky part is knowing when the code is finished , since in an ideal world this tool would work with as little developer input as possible .
In this example , we determine that the code has finished by looking at when the parent object runs its destructor .
So a timeline would be :
Landing Page constructor declares an instance of PhpQuickProfiler .
. Landing Page executes all needed code .
Landing Page destructor tells the PhpQuickProfiler to cleanup and display output .
Of course , this setup would cause PQP to always display , which is n’t ideal for production .
To make it more useful , we created a Config flag in our code ( debugMode = true ) that checks to make sure it is set to true before displaying .
Below is a sample class that can perform the steps we just covered :
class ExampleLandingPage { private $ profiler ; private $ db ; public function __construct ( ) { $ this -> profiler = new PhpQuickProfiler ( PhpQuickProfiler:: getMicroTime ( ) ) ; } public function __destruct ( ) { if ( $ debugMode == true ) $ this -> profiler - > display ( $ this -> db ) ; }}
Logging to the Console
Given the code shell above , PQP is configured and ready to be used .
We can start referencing the helper functions , starting with logging .
The console log is just a step above an echo statement in that it condenses and formats the output using print_r .
This is useful for reviewers because it provides a way to view debugging information without blowing up the layout of the page .
To output data to the console , just statically call the function :
Console : : log ( $data ) ;
The static function call accepts any data type and is available as long as the PhpQuickProfiler .
php class is included .
We chose to implement this with a static call so that the class does not have to be instantiated before use .
The downside to a static call is that we store the log history in a global php variable .
Should you wish to avoid globals , the Console . php class could always hold the log as a member variable given that it is instantiated .
But as is , the class just acts as a read and write wrapper around a global PHP variable .
On top of logging variables , the console also has four additional functions .
Console::logError( $exception ) ; Console::logMemory ( ) ; Console:: logMemory ( $variable , $ name ) ; Console::logSpeed ( ) ;
Let ’s start with logError ( ) .
Logging an error is useful for displaying information related to a PHP exception .
In our code , we ’ll use a catch block for handling errors so we can silence an exception .
We do this because we want that error to be ignored and not affect what the user is doing .
An example of this would be logging data that is n’t crucial .
If that log fails , the users should n’t have to stop what they ’re doing .
Now , in development , it ’s still nice to know those exceptions were thrown , so in the catch block a call to logError ( ) can be made to display the information to the console like so :
try { // Execute non critical code } catch ( Exception $ e ) { Console : : logError ( $e , ' Unable to execute non critical code ' ) ; }
Additionally , the console can provide even more value by using some of the helper functions that PHP natively provides .
For example , logging debug_backtrace ( ) will print related information about the script at a given point in time .
PHP also provides us with magic constants like __LINE__ , __FILE__ , __FUNCTION__ , __METHOD__ and __CLASS__ , which allows for printing of script data .
Take a look at the screenshot below to see some example usage of this :
Watching Memory Usage
Object oriented PHP is a beautiful thing to behold , but there are definitely a few concerns to keep in mind when it comes to memory usage .
These concerns tend to rear their heads when dealing with recursive output ( i.e. : exporting to Excel ) , if there ’s a leak in the creation of the objects or if objects are n’t being destroyed properly .
All of this can lead to unexpected resource usage and fatal errors that serve to aggravate the end user .
The debugger aids with memory management by displaying the maximum amount of memory used by the script .
A simple call to the built in memory_get_peak_usage( ) is where the data originates .
The system setting for memory allowed ( through ini_get ( ) ) is also shown to see how much wiggle room there is .
If an overview is n’t enough , you can drill down into your resource usage with a point in time memory call .
Console::logMemory ( ) ; Console : : logMemory ( $ variable , $ name ) ;
Calling logMemory ( ) in your code without any parameters will output the current amount of memory that PHP is using when the function is called .
This is perfect for watching a loop in your script to see if memory is building up during each iteration .
Likewise , a variable and a name can be passed in to the function .
Doing so will output the memory used by the variable to the console .
Knowing that a script is hogging memory is wonderful , and knowing which variable is doing the hogging allows the problem to be fixed .
Take a look at the screenshot below to see an example of string concatenation that is slowly eating up memory .
Runaway Includes
Similar to memory getting out of control , included files ( especially on large complex projects ) can multiply and take over your app before very quickly .
Even worse , too many includes do n’t throw the hard errors that memory usage does .
Instead , the page just slows down and resources get eaten up on every request served .
Avoiding this pitfall is pretty easy — just make sure the same file is n’t included multiple times , and catch any excessive includes of unnecessary files .
The PQP files tab shows the total files included with a count call on get_included_files and their total sizes are summed up .
The names and sizes of the individual files are output to the console for easy scanning as well .
The largest file included is noted on the left , which clearly points out if a large library is being used when it should n’t be .
For example , on Wufoo we found out that we had a script always including htmLawed , a fairly decent sized file , when it was n’t needed .
Also , keep in mind , autoloading classes or using require_once will usually alleviate any problems with file includes .
That said , it never hurts to be aware of the situation , especially when using plugins , old code , or borrowed code .
Page Execution Time
Emphasis is always placed on database optimization when it comes to performance considerations ( rightfully so ) , but that does n’t mean PHP execution time should be ignored completely .
The standard method for calculating load time is to find the difference between the time when the script starts and then again when the script finishes .
This is where the integration of the debugger into your own project becomes tricky .
Since the debugger is called on the destruction of the parent page , we know when the script is ending .
But since every project is different , the start time can vary .
The example code that you can download sets the start time in the construction of the parent object with a call to PQP ’s getMicroTime ( ) .
This will work in most cases , but if you have a lot of code going on before the parent is constructed , be sure to specifically set the start time when needed .
$ this -> profiler = new PhpQuickProfiler ( PhpQuickProfiler:: getMicroTime ( ) ) ;
Given the page execution time , the next step would be to find meaning in the information .
A quick glance will show if the time falls into an acceptable range .
Assuming it does n’t , how would we go about debugging the problem ?
Using the query section of the debugger , we can rule out query execution time ( explained more in the next section ) .
If queries are n’t the problem , then some portion of the script is .
We can find this with the console .
Console::logSpeed ( ) ;
A call to logSpeed ( ) will tell us how long the script has taken up until that point in time .
For example , imagine we have an object factory that constructs complex objects from a database .
We also have an object engine that returns the object names from a database .
When displaying 100 objects names to the screen , we would use either the factory or the engine .
But using the engine would be much faster because we only need the names , and do not need the logic processing of object creation .
If the developer did use the factory , logSpeed ( ) would reveal the slowdown in the display loop , which ultimately identifies the problem .
On a similar note , we recently discovered that xCache improves our page execution time by over 60 % .
This was compared against other benchmarks by having all of our developers run quick tests against the code they were responsible for using PQP .
A Glance at Database Activity
Getting the debugger to report database information is the hardest part of integration with your own project .
This step will only work if your database interaction is abstracted in some way .
We talked about a simple database class awhile back , and have also released an example with the zip download ( MySqlDatabase.php — you can follow the code in there to see a full implementation ) .
The reason a class is so important is because information about each query must be stored as it happens , and a class allows the queries to each go through the same analysis without additional work by the programmer .
As a query is called , the database wrapper class stores the query and logs the time .
The simplified code looks like this :
function query ( $sql ) { $ start = $ this -> getTime ( ) ; $rs = mysql_query ( $sql , $ this -> conn ) ; $ this -> logQuery ( $ sql , $ start ) ; return $rs ; }function logQuery ( $ sql , $ start ) { $ query = array ( ' sql ' => $ sql , ' time ' => ( $ this ->getTime ( ) - $ start ) * 1000 ) ; array_push ( $ this -> queries , $ query ) ; }
Using that concept , the class will have an array of all query information available to it .
Then , the debugger can take that array and print out the information .
The information that is currently stored is the query itself , and the time to execute .
The time to execute is not exact — it is the microtime until PHP has a handle on the recordset , which will be slower than the query time if there is network latency with the database server .
Viewing the queries at a glance is an easy and helpful way to look for queries that would affect more records than intended , that are being duplicated or those that open themselves up to SQL injection .
One of the most useful database features added to the debugger is the ability to EXPLAIN each query run .
Each query is run again using the explain statement , and the results are presented below the query .
This makes it easy to identify which queries are using their indexes properly .
Wrapping Up
The end goal of this debugging tool is to present a summary of useful information in an automated format .
Usually , finding out about certain aspects of the code would require manual work and thought .
And then if a problem is encountered , the debugger will hopefully make narrowing down the problem easier through the use of the extended Console functions .
With that in mind , this tool is just an aid and is in no way meant to replace the standard , thorough procedures available to developers .
The slow query log , PHP error log and full fledged debuggers and profilers are encouraged on top of this high level view to supplement the tools available to developers .
Set operations with List:: MoreUtils
[ Perl tips index ]
[ Subscribe to Perl tips ]
In the last Perl tip we briefly mentioned List :: MoreUtils .
This module ( available from the CPAN ) provides a wealth of utility methods for working with lists and arrays .
Most of these methods are trivial to write for yourself , but have been implemented directly in C so they run as fast as possible even with large lists .
List :: MoreUtils provides a great many list operations , but in this tip we 'll just examine the most common and easy - to - use set operations .
Each of these takes a common form :
operation { condition } @list
For example :
# Check to see if any elements are odd if ( any { $ _ % 2 } @numbers ) { print " Some of these elements are odd .
" ; }
any any returns true if there is at least one element for which the block returns a true value .
Consider the childhood hangman game .
In this game we may wish to compare a single guess against all the letters in the word : use List :: MoreUtils qw( any ) ; #
See if they 've correctly guessed a letter if ( any { $ letter eq $ _ } split // , $ word ) { print " $ letter is in my word !
" ; $ guesses {$letter} + + ; } all all returns true if every element causes the block to return a true value .
For our hangman game , we could use this to see if they 've guessed our entire word : use List :: MoreUtils qw( all ) ; #
See if they 've spelled out the whole word yet if ( all { exists $ guesses { $_} } split // , $ word ) { print " You have guessed all the letters , well done !
" ; last ; } none and part none returns true if no element causes the block to return a true value , and part allows us to divide a list into those which cause the block to return a false value and those which return a true value .
use List :: MoreUtils qw ( none part ) ; # Game over . #
See how many letters they guessed correctly if ( none { exists $ guesses { $_} } split // , $ word ) { print " You did n't guess a single letter correctly !
" ; } else { my % word ; @word { split // , $ word} = ( ) ; my ( $ incorrect , $ correct ) = part { exists $ word {$_} } keys % guesses ; print " You guessed " , scalar ( @$ correct ) , " letters correctly ( @$ correct )
" ; print " You guessed " , scalar ( @$ incorrect ) , " letters incorrectly ( @$incorrect )
" ; } true and false
If we did n't care which letters were guessed correctly and incorrectly , but instead care just how many letters have been guessed incorrectly we can use false .
my $ wrong_guesses = false { exists $ guesses { $_} } split // , $ word ) ;
Of course , true does the opposite of false , returning the number of elements that caused our block to return a true value .
There 's more !
In addition to the operations described above , List :: MoreUtils provides subroutines to allow you to find list indexes or insert elements into parts of your array .
You can iterate over multiple arrays , multiple values , zip arrays together , find the minimum and maximum values , and more .
Check out List :: MoreUtils for more information .

In a compensation program that has drawn angry protests from lawmakers , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expect to pay about $ 210 million in retention bonuses to 7,600 employees over 18 months , according to a letter from the mortgage companies ' regulator .
The maximum retention bonus for any individual executive under the plan will total $ 1.5 million during the 18 months ending in early 2010 , according to the letter to Iowa Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley , which provides previously undisclosed details about the bonuses .
The regulator , James Lockhart , director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , said in the letter that about $ 51 million of the payouts were made in late 2008 and the rest are to be made this year and early in 2010 .
In the letter , a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Lockhart defends the bonuses as vital to retaining talent at the two companies , the main providers of funding for U.S. home mortgages .
Fannie and Freddie , which reported combined losses of about $ 108 billion for 2008 , are being propped up by capital infusions from the U.S. Treasury .
The retention - bonus plan has stirred controversy in Washington since it was highlighted in a March 18 Wall Street Journal article .
AS one of the planet ’s most diverse cities , Toronto is oddly clean and orderly .
Sidewalks are spotless , trolleys run like clockwork , and the locals are polite almost to a fault .
That ’s not to say that Torontonians are dull .
Far from it .
With a population that is now half foreign - born — fueled by growing numbers of East Indians , Chinese and Sri Lankans — the lakeside city offers a kaleidoscope of world cultures .
Sing karaoke in a Vietnamese bar , sip espresso in Little Italy and catch a new Bollywood release , all in one night .
The art and design scenes are thriving , too , and not just on the bedazzled red carpets of the Toronto International Film Festival , held every September .
Industrial zones have been reborn into gallery districts , and dark alleys now lead to designer studios , giving Canada ’s financial capital an almost disheveled mien .
Friday
4 p.m.
1 ) WEST ENDERS
Toronto ’s cool scene seems to migrate west along Queen Street West every few years .
It started out at Yonge Street , with punk rockers and art students pouring into sweaty clubs .
Then , when mainstream stores like the Gap moved in , the scenesters fled west , past Bathurst Street , to a district now called West Queen West ( www.westqueenwest.ca), where old appliance stores are still being carved into rough - hewn galleries and hunter - chic boutiques .
Start your stroll along Toronto ’s art mile at Bathurst Street and go west .
Raw spaces that showcase young Canadian artists include Paul Petro Contemporary Art ( 980 Queen Street West ; 416-979-7874 ; www.paulpetro.com).
8 p.m.
2 ) DESIGNER MEAT
For a taste of hipsterdom , put on a T - shirt and squeeze into OddFellows ( 936 Queen Street West , 416-534-5244 , www.oddfellows.ca), a boutique - like bistro where the area ’s beard - and - flannel posse gathers nightly .
The corner restaurant , which opened last fall , is run by Brian Richer and Kei Ng , partners in a maverick design firm , Castor Design ( www.castordesign.ca), known for elevating mundane materials into clever objects .
The menu follows similar sleights of hand .
Manly cuts are skillfully turned into Canadian comfort dishes like bison meatloaf and venison burgers ( both 18 Canadian dollars , or about $ 15 at 1.21 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar ) .
The long communal table , made of polished limestone and random legs , encourages chitchat .
10:30 p.m .
3 ) TREND NORTH
Let the frat boys have College Street .
And West Queen
West has been overrun lately with 905ers , slang for out - of - towners with suburban area codes .
The cool kids , it seems , are now migrating north along Ossington Avenue , which some Toronto bloggers are already calling “ Next West Queen West . ”
Bookending the district are Sweaty Betty ’s ( 13 Ossington Avenue ; 416-535-6861 ) , a hole - in - the - wall with a brash jukebox , and Communist ’s Daughter ( 1149 Dundas Street West ; 647-435-0103 ) , an understated lounge that attracts the skinny corduroy and high - top - wearing set .
A trendy bar crawl is emerging in between , tucked among old Portuguese bakeries and kitchen supply stores .
Note :
An earlier version of this article was published by Design Management Institute and can be found here .
Designers have historically had a passionate connection to their community and an eagerness to use their creative skills toward positive social change .
In the last decade we have seen a proliferation of this activity , so much so that a new practice area of design - driven social change has emerged that many are calling social design .
Despite this increased activity , however , many design businesses struggle to integrate social design — in a sustainable way — into their business model , or to build new models with social design at the core .
At the center of this dilemma is funding , but other factors are important to consider as well .
Whether they are addressing a complex global issue like climate change or a hyper- local one , like a community garden in an urban neighborhood , designers must figure out how to do this work in a serious and sustainable business way in order to have meaningful impact over time .
While the term social design is relatively new , the movement has a rich heritage that dates back at least to the 1920s and the Bauhaus , which had an explicit commitment to designing residential housing for the poor .
This ethos was echoed by many of the great designers of the last 50 years , such as Samuel Mockbee , Tibor Kalman , and Milton Glaser , and continued by design leaders of the last generation , such as Bill Drenttel , John Bielenberg , and Valerie Casey , who have persistently worked to redefine the role of the designer in society .
In the last decade we have seen the emergence of academic programs with a focus on social design , such as the Designmatters program at ArtCenter College of Design and the Master of Arts in Social Design program at Maryland Institute College of Art ( MICA ) .
Another indicator of the maturation of this discipline is the number of programs that recognize and support the best social design work , such as Ideas That Matter by the paper company Sappi , Design Ignites Change , Designer ’s Accord , and AIGA ’s Design for Good , along with conferences like Compostmodern in San Francisco , which has a thematic focus on design for environmental sustainability .
Furthermore , the principles of social design align with many of the values that characterize the millennial generation , which comprises an increasing proportion of the design profession .
According to a January 2014
Forbes article , “ Millennials are focused on making meaning , not just making money . ”
One important aspect of the evolution of social design over the last decade is that now designers are being invited into the problem - solving process at earlier and more influential points , whereas the historical role of the designer was often to create the brand , the campaign , the poster , or the website once the core problem was solved by the embedded experts .
This trend of greater influence mirrors the increasing power designers are experiencing in many business sectors ; as noted in a 2010 Businessweek article , “ [ Designers ] help companies connect and establish a dialogue with consumers , thus enabling firms to innovate more efficiently . ” [ 1 ]
The emergence of human - centered design ( or design thinking ) methodology pioneered by global firms like IDEO and frog places a premium on design - driven research , divergent ideation , rapid prototyping , and iteration rather than a purely aesthetic focus .
This unique approach is helping to position designers as problem solvers and drivers of change , and allowing them to make relevant , meaningful contributions at a much earlier stage than ever before .
What ’s wrong with this picture ?
In order to maximize this significant opportunity , the traditional business model for a design practice must be reconsidered .
Virtually every design business and creative agency is built on the same basic “ client service ” framework , in which there is a single way to make money : through fees that clients pay in return for design services .
For several reasons this model is not appropriate for doing effective design - driven social change over the long term .
For instance , in social design there is often not a traditional client : the designer might be self - initiating the project , or there might be a collective of stakeholders , none of whom have the capacity to fund the project .
The result is that most social design projects are either self - funded at a minimal level or done on a pro-bono basis .
Hence , these social design projects usually get relegated to the periphery of the practice — they are the projects that get worked on after hours or on the weekend .
An additional result of this lack of funding is that these projects tend to be done on a compressed time frame of days or weeks , when meaningful social change efforts — including research , assessment , planning , and execution — can take years or even decades .
The rapidly emerging area of online crowd - funding sites and communities like Kickstarter and Crowdrise offers a potential remedy to the funding dilemma .
Crowd funding presents an opportunity that simply was not around only a few years ago , and it ’s a significant one , with more than $ 6 billion donated globally in 2013 .
This is somewhat deceptive , though , because with a few notable exceptions , most crowd - funded projects receive in the range of $ 5,000 - $ 20,000 — not insignificant , but also not enough to stay on the project list of a top design firm for very long .
Another significant opportunity lies in funding from philanthropic foundations and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which represent an aggregate pool of hundreds of billions of dollars in endowments .
Gates Foundation , Rockefeller Foundation , and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are all prominent examples of foundations with deep and established endowments ; locally based organizations and family foundations also offer opportunities .
Currently , however , design - driven projects are virtually invisible to these philanthropies , because design businesses are typically set up as for - profit corporations or LLCs , which are not eligible to directly apply for grant funding .
This puts most design firms in the position of relying on partnerships with third - party nonprofits in order to gain access to funds for project work — a cumbersome arrangement , at best .
Designers are beginning to recognize this dilemma , and new practice models are emerging .
Tomorrow Partners ( Berkeley , CA ) , and Greater Good Studio and Firebelly Design ( both in Chicago ) , are all examples of design businesses that are tinkering with the traditional model .
Some are establishing themselves as a non-profit 501 ( c ) 3 , and others form a nonprofit to sit alongside the traditional for - profit ( IDEO and IDEO.org are examples of this ) ; either option gives designers direct access to foundation money .
A relatively new option is the L3C business classification , a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC , the social benefits of a nonprofit organization , and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise .
Rich Hollant , founder of Hartford , CT - based Co:Lab , has intentionally built his staff to be positioned for foundation funding in a sustainable way .
“ Co : Lab is an LLC , and we access grant funding through collaborations with ( c ) 3s and foundations , ” Hollant says .
“ Our business development person has a nonprofit management background and has deep experience with foundations .
She helps us advise ( c ) 3s through the grant process as a means of subsidizing project funding .
We also take a consulting role in the sustainability plans of community - based coalitions and help our partners optimize their in - place funds . ”
One NGO that recognizes the potential of human - centered design is UNICEF , which has made a significant investment by building an internal innovation team practicing social design with a focus on children in the developing world : “ We aim to engage and partner with the right organizations and individuals from the public , private and academic sectors to support us by co-developing user - driven innovations . ” [ 2 ]
It ’s time to open the door
As we reconsider our business model , designers must also address our methodological approach .
Design has a stigma of being a mysterious and exclusive craft that would be contaminated — rather than enriched — by the direct involvement of clients or stakeholders , and designers have a similar rap of being control freaks obsessed with a perfect outcome .
Social design , on the other hand , requires designers to open their process and to be inclusive , transparent , nimble and iterative .
In order to understand deeply complex social issues and develop credible solutions to them , we depend on the active participation of experts in that area .
This means that designers need to be developing networks in communities where these subject matter experts reside .
It also means that a key skill for a social designer will be that of facilitation , since the format of the multi- disciplinary design workshop becomes key to drawing out the insights of disparate participants .
AIGA , the professional association for design recently launched Facilitation by Design , a series of workshops to help designers build the skills to “ successfully facilitate a diverse group and create effective solutions across a variety of sectors . ”
These changes to business model and method are triggering reactions throughout the design profession .
Many of the top academic design programs are taking on the challenge of building curriculum to train the emerging generation of social designers .
At MICA , the one - year Master of Arts in Social Design program “ prepares the next generation of creative leaders through collaborative practice - based learning opportunities , exploring social issues , testing processes & defining the future of design . ” [ 3 ]
Still , the career path for graduates of this pioneering program will be murky until the practice space matures in the years to come .
Whether in the studio setting , the academic world , or within large organizations , ambitious and forward - thinking designers are recognizing that social design offers a significant opportunity in an ever - more - competitive design market .
They are also coming to terms with the fact that integrating social design practices effectively and sustainably in their business model — so this work contributes to the bottom - line success of a business rather than jeopardizing it — will be the key to long - term success .

A growing battle between the Hells Angels motorcycle club and ethnic minority gangs in Denmark and Sweden is prompting renewed concern that long - simmering gang tensions are intensifying amid economic woes and resentment over immigration .
The Danish capital of Copenhagen saw almost 60 gang - related shooting incidents in the past year , many of them in Nørrebro , just north of the city center .
In March , a series of drive - by shootings and assassinations resulted in the deaths of three bystanders and sent shock waves through the city .
Efforts are now under way to boost the crime - fighting abilities of police , as well as address the causes that lead young people into gangs .
Recent killings in Nørrebro prompted hundreds of residents to stage an antigang march .
" The violence has really shaken people , and they are wondering when there will be another shooting , " says Kim Christensen , chairman of the Nørrebro district council , who led the march .
It snaked through traditional turf of the Hells Angels before finishing less than a mile away , near the biker gang 's main clubhouse .
" We 're not used to this kind of trouble , " says Ane Nissen , a student .
" Normally , Copenhagen is very quiet and very safe .
That 's why we need to react now . "
Danish police blame the recent surge in gang violence on an attempt by Hells Angels to get the upper hand over gangs consisting of first - and second - generation refugees .
" Hells Angels have been under pressure for a while now , " explains Kim Kliver , head of the investigative division of Denmark 's national police .
" About two years ago , they realized that they were getting old and needed to recruit younger , more ruthless people . "
In less than a year , the gang has doubled in size and created a " supporters club " called AK81 , made up mainly of ex-convicts with a record for extreme violence .
Police believe that victims of recent killings were chosen because they appeared foreign .
" There have always been social problems in this area , but now it 's more divided , " says Bendt Erik Krøyer , who runs a cultural center in Copenhagen 's Blågårds Plads , a cobbled square dominated by social housing for refugees , mainly from the Middle East , and home to one of the warring factions .
This is not the first gang war in the region .
The so - called " Nordic Biker War " in the mid-1990s pitted Hells Angels against the Bandidos motorcycle club .
It resulted in a dozen murders and almost 80 shootings before a truce was proclaimed .
Danish police reacted to the first biker war by closing gangs ' clubhouses and seizing finances .
Today , the job is harder :
There are at least a half - dozen ongoing gang feuds , and the gangs are harder to identify .
A bridge that spans the narrow strait separating Copenhagen from the Swedish city of Malmö is also making it easier for gangs to evade authorities , Mr. Kliver says .
" The fact that the gangs operate in both countries is no barrier , " he says .
" We carry out ' Al Capone ' operations on both sides of the border and look into how they are buying the cars and where they get their money .
If they can't prove they earned it legitimately , we seize it . "
Swedish police began recruiting specialists last month for a 200 - person antigang squad , which some call " Sweden's FBI . "
Pressure has mounted for a tougher response following the 2001 bombing of a public prosecutor 's home by a biker gang .
An estimated 50 criminal gangs , including the Bandidos and Hells Angels , as well as home - grown outfits with colorful names like Wolfpack Brotherhood and Werewolf Legion , compete for control of Sweden 's narcotics , prostitution , and extortion rackets .
According to official figures , extortion rackets have more than doubled over the past six years and grew by 50 percent in 2008 .
Erik Lannerbäck , a former Bandidos member and youth counselor who now campaigns for gang prevention , says the recession may swell the ranks of Scandinavia 's criminal gangs and lead to more turf wars .
" With fewer job opportunities and the temptation of easy money , " he says , " a lot of young guys will get drawn in . "
Lasse Wierup , a crime reporter at Sweden 's Dagens Nyheter newspaper , says that Swedish biker gangs have lost ground in recent years , often to competition from " immigrant gangs " from suburban projects .
" Hells Angels and Bandidos found it easy to get established in Sweden and Denmark because they had no organized enemies and could just walk in and take over , " he says .
" The biker gangs were founded on a myth that they were extremely dangerous and could get you wherever you are .
That works on ordinary people – but not on the new generation of armed criminal gangs . "
Sweden 's justice minister , Beatrice Ask , recently said there was a need to " react very forcefully " to the threat , while her Danish counterpart , Brian Mikkelsen , announced " extraordinary steps , " including doubling jail sentences for gang - related offenses .
Some activists , though , say that more should be done to prevent youths from joining gangs in the first place .
Khosrow Bayat runs a crime - prevention program that provides extra tuition , sports activities , counseling , and part - time jobs for young people in one of the worst - affected projects in Nørrebro .
" The most vulnerable kids are boys in their early teens .
They see gang members going around with cool clothes and girlfriends , and it affects them , " Mr. Bayat says .
" If you give them an opportunity early on to succeed in the mainstream , then you can close off the route to the gangs ....
" We need to give them something more interesting to do , " he adds , " than be lookouts for street gangs . "
A few thoughts , beginning with : there 's no such thing as " de- baptism " .
Once you are baptized , you are baptized .
It 's not just a " church rule " that one can't cancel a baptism , it 's divine law .
I can no more cancel my baptism than I can cancel having been born in Missouri .
Admittedly , folks who deny there is a God will also deny that ' divine law ' makes impossible de-baptism , but that 's a problem for apologetics , not canon law .
Anyway , as cheesy as internet " de - baptism " certificates might be , at least they provide the inimitable Jeff Miller over at Curt Jester with fodder for humor : Says Miller , Julian the Apostate , when he wanted to renounce his baptism , had himself drenched in bull 's blood .
Such a stunt , quips Miller , is " just as ineffective as an internet certificate , but it at least shows commitment . "
LOL !
Second , the " de - baptism " fad does occasion ( or , re-occasion , as the case may be ) some questions about whether , notwithstanding the indelible character of baptism , one might be able to renounce one 's Catholicism , indeed , one 's Christianity .
There are good arguments for and against the possibility that one can cancel one 's membership in the Catholic Church or even abrogate one 's identity as Christian ( without " voiding " one 's baptism , which is impossible ) .
I mention this only to caution against overly - hasty resort to pithy expressions like Semel Catholicus semper Catholicus or Semel Christianus semper Christianus when what might have been meant was only Semel baptizatus semper baptizatus and what exactly that means .
Third , signing these " de - baptism " forms does not , of itself , suffice for a " formal act of defection " under canon law ( for an excellent article on this complex area of the 1983 Code , see J. Huels , " Defection from the Catholic Church by a formal act and the Circular Letter of 13 March 2006 " , Studia Canonica 41 ( 2007 ) 515-549 ) , but signing such a form is certainly at least a step toward , indeed , objectively speaking , a sinful step toward , such defection .
Moreover , the proliferation of these documents ( not just in Britain , but around the world ) is going to force some closer attention to several related issues in canon law , e.g. , in criminal and matrimonial law , to say nothing of its serving as an topic for evangelization and catechesis focus .
Finally , recognizing that the folks using such forms need our prayers ( even if they do n't recognize it ) , we might encourage the hundreds of thousands of persons coming into the Church this Easter to pray especially for those who wish to leave her .
The newly baptized , and the newly received , flush with great graces , would make powerful prayer allies in this matter !
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Warren Buffett is famous for his rules of investing :
When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics , it is usually the reputation of the business that remains intact .
You should invest in a business that even a fool can run , because someday a fool will .
And perhaps most famously , Never invest in a business you cannot understand .
So when Buffett 's friend and longtime partner in Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKB ) , Charlie Munger , suggested early last year that they invest in BYD , an obscure Chinese battery , mobile phone , and electric car company , one might have predicted Buffett would cite rule No. 3 above .
He is , after all , a man who shunned the booming U.S. tech industry during the 1990s .
But Buffett , who is 78 , was intrigued by Munger 's description of the entrepreneur behind BYD , a man named Wang Chuan - Fu , whom he had met through a mutual friend .
" This guy , " Munger tells Fortune , " is a combination of Thomas Edison and Jack Welch - something like Edison in solving technical problems , and something like Welch in getting done what he needs to do .
I have never seen anything like it . "
Coming from Munger , that meant a lot .
Munger , the 85 - year - old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway , is a curmudgeon who frowns on most investment ideas .
" When I call Charlie with an idea , " Buffett tells me , " and he says , ' That is really a dumb idea , ' that means we should put 100 % of our net worth into it .
If he says , ' That is the dumbest thing I 've ever heard , ' then you should put 50 % of your net worth into it .
Only if he says , ' I 'm going to have you committed , ' does it mean he really does n't like the idea . "
This time Buffett asked another trusted partner , David Sokol , chairman of a Berkshire - owned utility company called MidAmerican Energy , to travel to China and take a closer look at BYD .
Last fall Berkshire Hathaway bought 10 % of BYD for $ 230 million .
The deal , which is awaiting final approval from the Chinese government , did n't get much notice at the time .
It was announced in late September , as the global financial markets teetered on the abyss .
But Buffett and Munger and Sokol think it is a very big deal indeed .
They think BYD has a shot at becoming the world 's largest automaker , primarily by selling electric cars , as well as a leader in the fast - growing solar power industry .
Wang Chuan - Fu started BYD ( the letters are the initials of the company 's Chinese name ) in 1995 in Shenzhen , China .
A chemist and government researcher , Wang raised some $ 300,000 from relatives , rented about 2,000 square meters of space , and set out to manufacture rechargeable batteries to compete with imports from Sony and Sanyo .
By about 2000 , BYD had become one of the world 's largest manufacturers of cellphone batteries .
The company went on to design and manufacture mobile - phone handsets and parts for Motorola ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) , Nokia ( NOK ) , Sony Ericsson , and Samsung .
Wang entered the automobile business in 2003 by buying a Chinese state - owned car company that was all but defunct .
He knew very little about making cars but proved to be a quick study .
In October a BYD sedan called the F3 became the bestselling sedan in China , topping well - known brands like the Volkswagen Jetta and Toyota ( TM ) Corolla .
BYD has also begun selling a plug - in electric car with a backup gasoline engine , a move putting it ahead of GM , Nissan , and Toyota .
BYD 's plug - in , called the F3DM ( for " dual mode " ) , goes farther on a single charge - 62 miles - than other electric vehicles and sells for about $ 22,000 , less than the plug - in Prius and much - hyped Chevy Volt are expected to cost when they hit the market in late 2010 .
Put simply , this little - known upstart has accelerated ahead of its much bigger rivals in the race to build an affordable electric car .
Today BYD employs 130,000 people in 11 factories , eight in China and one each in India , Hungary , and Romania .
Its U.S. operations are small - about 20 people work in a sales and marketing outpost in Elk Grove Village , Ill. , near Motorola , and another 20 or so work in San Francisco , not far from Apple .
BYD makes about 80 % of Motorola 's RAZR handsets , as well as batteries for iPods and iPhones and low - cost computers , including the model distributed by Nicholas Negroponte 's One Laptop per Child nonprofit based in Cambridge , Mass .
Revenues , which have grown by about 45 % annually during the past five years , reached $ 4 billion in 2008 .
In acquiring a stake in BYD , Buffett broke a couple of his own rules .
" I do n't know a thing about cellphones or batteries , " he admits .
" And I do n't know how cars work . "
But , he adds , " Charlie Munger and Dave Sokol are smart guys , and they do understand it .
And there 's no question that what 's been accomplished since 1995 at BYD is extraordinary . "
One more thing reassured him .
Berkshire Hathaway first tried to buy 25 % of BYD , but Wang turned down the offer .
He wanted to be in business with Buffett - to enhance his brand and open doors in the U.S. , he says - but he would not let go of more than 10 % of BYD 's stock .
" This was a man who did n't want to sell his company , " Buffett says .
" That was a good sign . "

We 're lost in Shenzhen .
I 've flown 8,000 miles to meet Wang , and on the way to the interview , my driver pulls to the side of a dusty highway .
He 's yelling in Cantonese into his phone and frenetically sketching Chinese characters on the touchscreen of a GPS navigator .
The PR woman beside me looks worried .
" The GPS is n't working , " she says .
" Too many new roads . "
I can't blame the driver or the GPS - which , it occurs to me , was probably made nearby , since Shenzhen is the manufacturing hub of the global electronics industry , the place your cellphone , digital camera , and laptop probably came from .
Just across a river from Hong Kong , Shenzhen is the biggest and fastest - growing city in the world that most Americans cannot find on a map .
It 's also the Chinese city most like America , because people who live here have come from elsewhere in search of a better life .
When Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen as China 's first " special economic zone " in 1980 , inviting capitalism to take root , it was a fishing village ; today , it 's a sprawling megacity of 12 million to 14 million people , most of them migrant workers who toil in vast factories like those run by BYD and earn about 1,300 renminbi , or $ 190 , per month .
When we find BYD 's new headquarters - a silvery office building that would not look out of place in Silicon Valley - I 'm given a tour of the company " museum , " which celebrates products and milestones from the firm 's brief history , and then escorted into a conference room where plates of apples , bananas , and cherry tomatoes are spread on a table .
Wang takes a seat across from me - he is 43 , a smallish man , with black hair and glasses - and begins , through an interpreter , to tell me his story .
He started BYD with a modest goal : to edge in on the Japanese - dominated battery business .
" Importing batteries from Japan was very expensive , " Wang says .
" There were import duties , and delivery times were long . "
He studied Sony and Sanyo patents and took apart batteries to understand how they were made , a " process that involved much trial and error , " he says .
( Sony and Sanyo later sued BYD , unsuccessfully , for infringing on their patents . )
BYD 's breakthrough came when Wang decided to substitute migrant workers for machines .
In place of the robotic arms used on Japanese assembly lines , which cost $ 100,000 or more apiece , BYD actually cut costs by hiring hundreds , then thousands , of people .
" When I first visited the BYD factory , I was shocked , " says Daniel Kim , a Merrill Lynch technology analyst based in Hong Kong , who has been to the fully automated production lines in Japan and Korea .
" It 's a completely different business model . "
To control quality , BYD broke every job down into basic tasks and applied strict testing protocols .
By 2002 , BYD had become one of the top four manufacturers worldwide - and the largest Chinese manufacturer - in each of the three rechargeable battery technologies ( Li-Ion , NiCad , and NiMH ) , according to a Harvard Business School case study of the company .
And Wang stresses that BYD , unlike Sony and Sanyo , has never faced a recall of its batteries .
Deploying the armies of laborers at BYD is an officer corps of managers and engineers who invent and design the products .
Today the company employs about 10,000 engineers who have graduated from the company 's training programs - some 40 % of those who enter either drop out or are dismissed - and another 7,000 new college graduates are being trained .
Wang says the engineers come from China 's best schools .
" They are the top of the top , " he says .
" They are very hard - working , and they can compete with anyone . "
BYD can afford to hire lots of them because their salaries are only about $ 600 to $ 700 a month ; they also get subsidized housing in company - owned apartment complexes and low - cost meals in BYD canteens .
" They 're basically breathing , eating , thinking , and working at the company 24/7 , " says a U.S. executive who has studied BYD .
Wang typically works until 11 p.m. or midnight , five or six days a week .
" In China , people of my generation put work first and life second , " says the CEO , whose wife takes responsibility for raising their two children .
This " human resource advantage " is " the most important part " of BYD 's strategy , Wang says .
His engineers investigate a wide array of technologies , from automobile air - conditioning systems that can run on batteries to the design of solar - powered streetlights .
Unlike most automakers , BYD manufactures nearly all its cars by itself - not just the engines and body but air conditioning , lamps , seatbelts , airbags , and electronics .
" It is difficult for others to compete , " Wang says .
" If we put our staff in Japan or the U.S. , we could not afford to do anything like this . "
Wang himself grew up in extreme poverty .
His parents , both farmers , died before he entered high school , and he was raised by an older brother and sister .
The train ride from the village where he grew up to Central South Industrial University of Technology , where he earned his chemistry degree , took him by Yellow Mountain , a popular destination for hikers and tourists , but he has never visited there .
" I did n't go then because we had no money , " he says .
" I do n't go now because we have no time . "
As for accumulating wealth ?
" I 'm not interested in it , " he claims .
He certainly does n't live a very lavish lifestyle .
He was paid about $ 265,000 in 2008 , and he lives in a BYD - owned apartment complex with other engineers .
His only indulgences are a Mercedes and a Lexus , and they have a practical purpose :
He takes their engines apart to see how they work .
On a trip to the U.S. , he once tried to disassemble the seat of a Toyota owned by Fred Ni , an executive who was driving him around .
Shortly after BYD went public , Wang did something extraordinary :
He took approximately 15 % of his holdings in BYD and distributed the shares to about 20 other executives and engineers at the company .
He still owns roughly 28 % of the shares , worth about $ 1 billion .
The company itself is frugal .
Until recently , executives always flew coach .
One told me he was appalled when he learned that Ford , which lost billions last year , had staged a gala at the Hotel George V during the Paris auto show .
By contrast , the last time BYD executives traveled to the Detroit auto show they rented a suburban house to save the cost of hotel rooms .
This attention to costs is one reason that BYD has made money consistently even as it has expanded into new businesses .
Each of BYD 's business units - batteries , mobile - phone components , and autos - was profitable in 2008 , albeit on a small scale .
Overall , net profits were around $ 187 million .
BYD , which is traded on the Hong Kong exchange , has a market value of about $ 3.8 billion .
That 's less than Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) ( $ 7 billion at the beginning of April ) , but more than General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) ( $ 1.3 billion ) .
Near the end of our conversation , I ask Wang about the company name .
It 's been reported that BYD stands for " Build your dreams , " but he says he added that as the company motto only later .
Others say that as Motorola , Apple , and Berkshire Hathaway have made their way to Shenzhen , the name has taken on yet another meaning : Bring your dollars .
***
When David Sokol toured BYD 's operations last summer , Wang took him to a battery factory and explained that BYD wants to make its batteries 100 % recyclable .
To that end , the company has developed a nontoxic electrolyte fluid .
To underscore the point , Wang poured battery fluid into a glass and drank it .
" Does n't taste good , " he said , making a face and offering a sip to Sokol .
Sokol declined politely .
But he got the message .
" His focus there was that if we 're going to help solve environmental problems , we can't create new environmental problems with our technology , " Sokol says .
Sokol , author of a slim volume on management principles called Pleased but Not Satisfied , sized up Wang during that visit and decided he was an unusually purposeful executive .
Sokol says , " Many good entrepreneurs can go from zero to a couple of million in revenues and a couple of hundred people .
He 's got over 100,000 people .
Few can do that . "
When he got back to the U.S. , Sokol told Buffett , " This guy 's amazing .
You want to meet him . "
Even before visiting BYD , Sokol believed in electric cars .
His people at MidAmerican have studied clean technologies like batteries and wind power for years because of the threat of climate change .
One way or another , Sokol says , energy companies will need to produce more energy while emitting less carbon dioxide .
Electric cars will be one answer .
They generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions than cars that burn gasoline , and they have lower fuel costs , even when oil is cheap .
That 's because electric engines are more efficient than internal - combustion engines , and because generating energy on a large scale ( in coal or nuclear plants ) is less wasteful than doing it on a small scale ( by burning gasoline in an internal - combustion engine ) .
The numbers look something like this :
Assume you drive 12,000 miles a year , gas costs $ 2 a gallon , and electricity is priced at 12 � per kilowatt , about what most Americans pay .
A gasoline - powered car that gets 20 miles to the gallon - say , a Chevy Impala or a BMW X3 - will have annual fuel costs of $ 1,200 and generate about 6.6 tons of carbon dioxide .
Equip those cars with electric motors , and fuel costs drop to $ 400 a year and emissions are reduced to about 1.5 tons .
The big problem is that they are expensive to make , and the single largest cost is the battery .
Manufacturing a safe , reliable , long - lasting , and fast - charging battery for a car is a complex and costly undertaking .
BYD claims to have achieved a breakthrough with its lithium ion ferrous phosphate technology , but no one can be sure whether it will work as promised .
Skeptics say that BYD 's battery cannot be both more powerful and cheaper than those made by competitors , and the U.S. Department of Energy has purchased an F3 DM to take the battery apart .
Chitra Gopal , an analyst with Nomura Securities in Singapore who follows the company closely , says BYD is betting on " entirely new technology , and the ability to produce it at scale and at a low cost remains unproven . "
William Moore , publisher and editor - in - chief of EV World , an electric car website , says , " They need to persuade people that they are selling a reliable , durable , quality automobile . "
Even BYD 's admirers say the fit and finish of the company 's cars leave much to be desired .
" Their cars are way behind Toyota , for sure , " Sokol admits .
BYD currently exports gasoline - powered cars to Africa , South America , and the Middle East , but they compete on price , not quality .
BYD 's first plug - in hybrid , called a dual - mode car , is designed to run primarily on electricity , with an internal - combustion engine for backup .
Two all - electric cars - the E3 and the E6 - will follow later this year .
Both will be sold first in China , primarily to fleet users : the government , post office , utilities , and taxi companies , all of which will build central fast - charging facilities .
Europe , with its high gas prices , is the most promising export market for BYD 's electric cars .
Wang signed an agreement last year with Autobinck , a Dutch dealer group , to distribute its cars in the Netherlands and five Eastern European countries .
The company has n't yet decided whether it will enter the U.S. market , where the economics of electric cars are not as compelling .
Sokol , who now sits on BYD 's board , says BYD could instead become a battery supplier to global automakers .
Some Americans , though , are eager to do business with BYD .
The day after Fortune 's visit to BYD , Oregon Gov .
Ted Kulongoski arrived to test - drive an electric car and urge the company to import through the port of Portland .
Meanwhile , BYD researchers are on to their next big idea , a product they call a Home Clean Power Solution .
It 's essentially a set of rooftop solar photovoltaic panels with batteries built in to store power for use when the sun 's not out , all to be designed and manufactured by BYD .
" Solar is an endless source of energy , " Wang says .
" With better technology , we can reduce the costs . "
Wang is also focused on building a stronger executive team to drive the company forward .
" The good news is , he 's 42 years old , " Sokol says .
" The bad news is that he 's clearly the brains behind the organization , and the drive .
He has to develop a team faster , but I think he knows that . "
Last winter it was Sokol 's turn to lead Wang on a tour of his home country .
They started in Detroit , where BYD 's cars generated buzz at the North American Auto Show , and wound up on the West Coast , where Wang met for the first time with Charlie Munger .
In between , they stopped in Omaha .
" How did BYD get so far ahead ? " Warren Buffett asked Wang , speaking through a translator .
" Our company is built on technological know - how , " Wang answered .
Wary as always of a technology play , Buffett asked how BYD would sustain its lead .
" We 'll never , never rest , " Wang replied .
Buffett may not understand batteries or cars , or Mandarin for that matter .
Drive , however , is something that needs no translation .
President Barack Obama arrived in Turkey late Sunday , after riling the European Union by urging its leaders to accept the large and mainly Muslim nation as a member .
Washington has long supported EU membership for Turkey , a prickly yet strategic U.S. ally .
Mr. Obama said Sunday at an EU - U.S. summit in Prague that pushing forward with membership would " ensure we continue to anchor Turkey firmly in Europe . "
But ...
If there ’s any proof that youth is overrated , it ’s zits — red oozing pustules of them , whiteheads and blackheads , all over the face and neck , from ages twelve up to twenty .
Acne vulgaris came up during my interview about BLONDES on Michio Kaku ’s show , Science Fantastic .
Does acne play a role in sexual selection ?
My hunch is that it does , and today I found some support while skimming the annals of Medical Hypotheses .
The evolutionary theory behind acne , according to the article by Dale Bloom , is that it plays a role in mate selection .
Fact is , pimples are as repulsive as they are conspicuous .
They suggest disease and trigger a “ disgust ” reflex .
At the expense off a teen ’s self - esteem , they signal “ stay away from me sexually . ”
Those big red spots are stop signs .
The reason ?
To delay pregnancy .
Think about it : Pubescent people do n’t make the best parents .
Women who recently got their first period have bodies and brains unprepared for pregnancy and childbirth .
Even in ancestral times , pregnancy put very young women at an extreme disadvantage , compromising their health and that of their babies .
With the baby diverting precious gluteofemoral fat , adolescent mothers may inadvertently arrest their own physical and mental development .
And it goes without saying that teen boys are unfit fathers — in fact , the prefrontal cortex does n’t even fully develop until a guy ’s early twenties .
Case in point is Alfie , the tiny , squeaky , grim - looking Gameboy - playing 13 - year - old British boy who became a dad earlier this month .
( Curiously , Alfie appears too young to have pimples yet , and his girlfriend ’s face is as smooth as porcelain . )
Are pimples Nature ’s way of steering away potential mates until a young person has reached true reproductive maturity ?
Bloom thinks so , calling them a “ high - order psychoneuroimmune interaction , ” the body protecting itself by becoming temporarily unattractive when it is most vulnerable .
It ’s an interesting idea .
I , for one , had so many pimples in junior high that I was n’t at risk for even a kiss .
So do teen pregnancy rates coincide with Stridex sales ?
Do flawless girls get knocked up more often than pimply ones ?
If so , perhaps dermatologists should start prescribing birth control .
The Real Expenses Scandal
It ’s a thousand times bigger than the one we ’re talking about , so why does n’t it ignite public anger ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 26th May 2009
For a moment , my heart leapt .
The headline on the front of yesterday ’s Daily Mail contained the words travel , scandal , extortionate and £ 6.2 .
I imagined , until I read it properly , that it referred to the £ 6.2 bn contract to expand the M25 motorway , which has just been signed .
Some hope .
“ The £ 6.2 m bill : Scandal of how MPs are taking taxpayers for a ride with extortionate travel expenses ” referred to a rip - off precisely 1000th of the size of the travel expenses scandal that interests me .
I understand the public anger and fascination about MPs ’ expenses , and the burning question of whether you can obtain capital gains tax exemption on your second duck house .
But it is microscopic by comparison to the corruption that has been bubbling along merrily for 15 years in the UK , unmolested by the tabloid press .
In April , the widening of four sections of the M25 was to have cost you and me £ 5 bn .
This was already a spectacular rip - off .
The Campaign for Better Transport had calculated that the same amount of extra road space – if it were really needed – could have been created for £ 478 m ( 1 ) .
But somehow , over the past four weeks , the £ 5bn for widening four sections of motorway has mutated into £ 6.2 bn for widening two ( 2 ) .
In Sicily , officials agree to terms like this with the help of dainty gifts like horse ’s heads and waistcoats full of fish .
In the UK , the government volunteers them without any obvious inducement .
There ’s nothing remarkable about this inflation : it appears to be an inherent property of the government ’s private finance initiative schemes .
The PFI allows consortiums of banks , construction and service companies to build and run our public infrastructure .
Though the government maintains that this offers better value than using public money , in reality the numbers behind all PFI projects are rigged ( 3,4 ) .
While the government retains much of the risk , the investors keep the profits , which often run to many times the value of the schemes .
The public liability incurred so far by the private finance initiative is £ 215 b n ( 5 ) .
Much of this spending ( half ? three - quarters ?
– the deals are so complex and opaque that we will never know for sure ) is pure pork fat .
One day the repayments will destroy Britain ’s public finances .
This extravagance makes our MPs look like ascetics .
But this waste will never feature on the front page of the Daily Mail – or any page at all .
Though it purports to speak for the lower middle classes , the Mail serves the rentier class , which benefits from these deals .
The issue is also so complex that it is hard to see how it could be conveyed in a tabloid story .
You have only to write the words private finance initiative to lose 90 % of your readers .
Across twelve years of researching this issue , I have kept running into the brick wall of public indifference .
I have used every conceivable device to try to convey the scope and scale of this rip - off .
None of them works .
Like the academics Jean Shaoul and Allyson Pollock , the magazines Private Eye and Red Pepper and the Sunday Telegraph ’s columnist Liam Halligan , all of whom have spent years exposing this scandal , I appear to have been wasting my time .
The issue is too remote and too complex to ignite public indignation .
The scheme ’s obscurity has protected it from the outrage now being directed towards MPs .
But just in case anyone is still reading , I ’ll try again .
The terms offered by the new M25 scheme are so generous that an orang utan in a suit and tie could n’t fail to clean up .
The new price appears to represent the cost to the government of keeping the banks in the deal .
The scheme is meant to be ready in time for the Olympics , but the companies involved have spun out the negotiations for so long – demanding ever more outrageous terms – that the government is now prepared to pay almost any price to get the road widened on time , regardless of future liabilities .
The option of tackling the problem by reducing the volume of traffic – an orbital coach network is the most obvious solution – was never considered .
When Alistair Darling was transport secretary , he was asked about this alternative in the Commons .
He dismissed it out of hand ( 6 ) .
One of the consistent features of PFI is that the projects are reverse - engineered to meet the demands of corporate investors .
This , for example , is how the £ 30 m public scheme to refurbish Coventry ’s two hospitals became a £ 410 m private scheme to knock them both down and rebuild one of them – containing fewer beds and fewer doctors and nurses ( 7 ) .
The old scheme was too cheap to attract private money .
Similarly , an orbital bus system offers only modest profits .
Last year , the Treasury promised to bring private finance deals onto the government ’s balance sheets , in order to meet international financial reporting standards .
Most PFI schemes do n’t count as public debt , which is one of the reasons why the government finds them attractive .
( The other is that this corporate welfare bought New Labour the support of business groups and sections of the rightwing press ) .
But on May 13th , at the height of the MPs ’ expenses scandal , the Treasury quietly reneged on this promise ( 8 ) .
In opposition , when Labour opposed PFI , Alistair Darling complained that “ apparent savings now could be countered by the formidable commitment on revenue expenditure in years to come ” ( 9 ) .
Now , as Chancellor of the Exchequer , he has decided to keep disguising this commitment from the public .
Government departments will publish two sets of accounts : one which keeps PFI schemes on the books to meet international standards , another that keeps them off the books in order to conceal the extent of public liabilities ( 10 ) .
This is what Enron did : it produced different sets of accounts for different audiences .
The Treasury issued no press release to announce this change of policy , and refuses to send me its guidance to government departments , which explains how the new rules will work .
The private finance initiative , like parliament , has been protected for years by secrecy and obfuscation .
We never could afford this extravagance , but to keep squandering money on PFI schemes today , when we know how much trouble government finances are in , is lunacy .
Last week the ratings agency Standard & Poor ’s warned that the UK ’s credit rating could be cut ( 11 ) .
No one in this government appears to care about the extra , unacknowledged debt it is loading onto future administrations through PFI .
Because these schemes run for 25 or 30 years , their liabilities are someone else ’s problem .
The health secretary Alan Johnson has just called for a “ root and branch look at how our democracy works ” ( 12 ) .
Is the notion that this might include a re-appraisal of the private finance initiative too much to hope for ?
Yes .
There is no tabloid campaign against this corruption , nor will there ever be .
The Conservatives , for all David Cameron ’s talk of “ re-instating accountability ” have no intention of scrapping PFI .
The real British expenses scandal appears to be immune to exposure .

At the request of my cousin a year back , I built a custom unit that would be cheaper than buying a kit , and about the same cost as renting one out .
Why pay someone to do something when you can do it in a much longer and painful way yourself !
Okay , back to the project .
This is n't the first photo booth I have built .
A few years back I threw together a unit made out of a electrical distribution box , a surface tablet , and a Canon SLR .
It got the job done but was slow and buggy due to how I configured it .
This was my chance to redeem myself and build it the way I wanted to .
For this build , I wanted the screen to be the focus .
It needed to be large and have a capacitive touch screen .
Luckily large touch screens have plummeted in price and Dell had the perfect solution .
To make it work thought I would have to build my own box .

Bryony & Ryan DIAGNOSIS : Endometriosis , Unexplained infertility
Ryan and I got married in 2011 .
Ryan had a wonderful son from a previous relationship who was five at the time .
We wanted to wait to have a baby until our new family was more stable and finances were better .
I had always had cramping and irregular , heavy periods so went to my OB / GYN for answers about that .
I was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2009 and had surgery to get some of it removed .
This stuck in the back of my mind after my marriage but I figured I was still young ( 26 ) so there was n't much to worry about .
In 2013 , we decided to officially start trying to get pregnant .
We did n't do anything special , just waited to see .
My periods were irregular , though , so I went through literally hundreds of pregnancy tests , and never saw that double blue line .
My OB / GYN prescribed Clomid for 3 months in June of 2013 ( because of my history with endo ) .
I never ovulated .
In January , 2014 my OB / GYN referred me to Dr. Alison Zimon .
The first appointment , I met her nurse , Karen - and burst into tears .
It was really hard to think I could n't get pregnant on my own .
I felt terrible .
Like I was n't a woman .
I was embarrassed and I felt awful for my husband , who had had a child so easily before he was married to me .
Karen gave me Kleenex and a hug and told me it would be OK .
She really put me at ease .
Dr. Zimon was the same way .
She was wonderful .
She agreed to skip IUD 's since I had had trouble ovulating with Clomid and we went right to IVF .
It took me 6 months to get my baseline blood work because my hormones were so out of control and my cycles were so irregular .
I finally got my baseline blood work completed and we started prepping for our fresh cycle .
I was so excited and optimistic .
In October , 2014 I started injections .
I was terrified to give myself a shot , but let me tell you , I got over that quickly .
My ovaries were so bloated and I felt like a beached whale but I kept the optimism going , knowing that this was my only chance for a baby .
In late October , I had my retrieval and the doctor managed to get 5 good embryos .
Three days later , I went for implantation .
Then .... the two week wait .
It was terrible .
I swore I would n't get a home pregnancy test and I did n't .
The day came for my blood work and Karen called with my results .
Anything over 25 was pregnant .
I was 29 .
I was pregnant .
But , Karen warned me , my numbers were low .
I 'd have to get re-tested in two days .
The next check , my numbers were still low but had risen enough that it seemed to be a good sign .
I told everyone .
I told my parents , my siblings , coworkers , friends etc .
I was ecstatic .
Two weeks later , I was feeling off .
It was a Sunday and my husband was bringing my stepson home .
I went to the bathroom and saw blood in my underwear .
I immediately called Karen who told me to go get blood the next morning .
I remember my husband was home from work with me when we got the call .
My HCG levels were n't high enough .
It was not a viable pregnancy .
I was devastated .
All of my hard work and sticking myself with needles and bloating was for nothing .
I felt as though a piece of me had died .
Even sitting here writing this , I still get sad for that loss .
I told my husband that day that I was done .
I was n't doing it again .
Two weeks later we went to see Dr. Zimon .
Of course , I cried as we discussed my miscarriage .
She urged me to try again using one of the frozen embryos we had .
I agreed that I would try one more time , but that was it .
On January 19 , 2015 we went for a frozen embryo implant .
The prep was so easy !
No shots , no bloating .
It was a breeze .
Then another two week wait .
On the day of my blood test we got hit with 3 feet of snow .
The labs , naturally , were closed .
I had one home pregnancy test left , so i figured " what the heck . "
I waited my five minutes , looked down and burst into tears .
There they were .
Two , bold blue lines .
I was pregnant .
When I finally got my blood work done , my HCG levels were so high , we thought it could be twins ( one embryo split after implantation ) .
41 weeks later , and I gave birth to the most amazing baby , Quinten .
My husband and I joke that he 's so advanced ( in many ways ) because he was frozen for 3 months .
When I first knew Willeford , in the late 1970s , he had only a small cult following .
He had n't published a book in seven years , and his twelve novels to that point were all out of print .
He was teaching at Miami - Dade Community College and reviewing mysteries for The Miami Herald .
My mother was a student in his creative - writing class , and he and his future wife , Betsy , became good friends of my family's .
Willeford was soon a fixture at my parents ' parties , skulking by the kitchen door to the patio with a cigarette in one hand and a bourbon in the other , telling dirty jokes or stomach - turning anecdotes from his years in the Army .
After growling out the one about eating dog in the Philippines , or the one about the coed long - distance - urination contest , he would drag on his cigarette , the glow illuminating his great white moustache and waggish blue eyes .
Then he'd exhale , his ample belly undulating with laughter as if he'd just heard the story for the first time himself .
As a very young man , Willeford considered himself a poet , and he continued to write poetry throughout his life .
His real writing career , though , began with a series of eight novels published as pulp paperbacks in the 1950s and early 1960s .
In them Willeford fashioned his own brand of hard - boiled prose .
But he was not writing for the pulp market ; that was simply where he was able to sell his work .
In his first book , High Priest of California ( 1953 ) , a used - car salesman goes to great lengths to seduce an innocent woman for sport , gravely disrupting her life .
But the writing is hardly lurid , and the protagonist is anything but what you might expect .
He listens to Bartók while reading T. S. Eliot aloud , and as a hobby he rewrites Ulysses in contemporary American vernacular .
Willeford 's books also offer lots of practical advice : the reader of Pick - Up ( 1955 ) , the story of two down - and - out alcoholics keeping each other alive in San Francisco , learns how to fry a steak properly , how to reuse coffee grounds , and how to keep ants out of a dresser .
The novels did , on occasion , work in issues of real import .
The Black Mass of Brother Springer ( 1958 ) is about a white writer who abandons his wife to accept a fake ordination and assume the ministry of a black church in a northern - Florida city .
Sam Springer is a characteristically Willefordian amalgam of selfish mercenary and well - meaning drifter .
He bounces through life like a pinball , responding shrewdly to the moment and giving little thought to the future .
But Black Mass is also an early depiction of the civil - rights revolution in the South : one subplot , paralleling the Rosa Parks incident , follows the city 's reaction to a black woman 's refusal to give up her seat on a bus .
The true earmark of these paperbacks , however , was humor — a distinctively crotchety , sometimes raunchy , often genre - satirizing humor .
The very first lines of High Priest of California are a send - up of the dime - novel tough guy .
I slipped a dollar under the wicket and a sullen - lipped cashier asked me for a penny .
" You 're making the change , " I told her .
A similar playfulness pervaded Willeford 's later , more mainstream novels .
The Burnt Orange Heresy ( 1971 ) , for example , is one long satire on art ( a favorite topic — Willeford studied painting in France and Peru after World War II ) , art criticism , and art collecting .
It 's the story of James Figueras , a bachelor , cad , and freelance art critic in Palm Beach , and his fascination with the ( fictional ) French artist Jacques Debierue .
A murder occurs , but the real violence is Willeford 's attack on artistic pretension : Debierue is supposedly the founder of the Nihilistic Surrealism movement — the missing link between Dada and Surrealism — who retires into famous seclusion after the creation of one work , No .
One , an empty frame mounted around a crack in a wall .
According to Figueras , " The fact that he used the English No .
One instead of Nombre une may or may not 've influenced Samuel Beckett to write in French instead of English , as the literary critic Leon Mindlin has claimed . "
Willeford also has fun with his hero : " But I was n't getting my work done .
Work is important to a man .
Not even a Helen of Troy can compete with a Hermes .
No matter how wonderful she is , a woman is only a woman , whereas 2,500 words is an article . "
Democrats are Trying to Fast - Track Cap and Trade Bill Before Americans Realize What it Means
Democrats are trying to rush through the administration ’s cap and trade bill before people have a chance to see what is actually in it .
Does that sound familiar ?
I think that is does .
Can you say stimulus bill ?
This bill is 1,000 pages long and debate is going to be short and sweet .
Once again lawmakers will be asked to vote on a bill that they can’t possibly read before voting .
Does this sound familiar ?
I think that is does .
Can you say stimulus bill ?
There is a reason that Democrats want this bill , which will raise taxes on 80 % of Americans , passed before the public can see what is in it .
And that reason is the American people have no idea what the hell cap and trade is .
The poll showed that only 24 percent of voters could correctly identify that cap and trade is an environmental policy
Simple math tells us that 76 % of Americans do n’t even know that cap and trade is an environmental policy .
But that is not all .
29 % thought it dealt with Wall Street
Almost 30 % of people polled think that cap and trade is a bill that will make Wall Street pay for the sin of being successful and having more money than they do .
How many of these people support this legislation because the falsely believe it will punish the rich ?
Is it any wonder that a majority of this group of people probably support cap and trade ?
But it continues .
17 percent thought it was health care reform
17 % of those polled think that cap and trade means that they are going to get free health - care .
No wonder why they support it .
And one last little tidbit .
30 % had no idea what the term means
I give these people credit , at least they admit that they do n’t know what the hell they are a talking about .
These people at least told the truth and admitted that they do n’t know what issue cap and trade is supposed to deal with .
Is it any wonder that the administration wants to act fast on this legislation ?
If the 76 % of Americans that could n’t correctly identify what issue cap and trade dealt with ever found out that the legislation was designed to raise their energy prices and force them to pay more taxes would they still support this legislation ?
I think not .
It is sad to me that such a large percentage of the voters do n’t know what such a large part of the president ’s agenda actually deals with .
At least we can now understand how he was elected in the first place .
This administration sees an opportunity here and that opportunity is the ignorance of a large portion of the voting public .
The administration needs to strike while the iron is hot .
Delay could breed knowledge and that is the last thing that this administration needs .
That is why Democrats are trying to rush this legislation through .
May 27 , 2009  --
A Pennsylvania woman who vanished after calling 911 to say she had been abducted and stuffed in the trunk of a car along with her young daughter apparently faked the abduction , booked a flight to Orlando , where she checked into a hotel under an alias and then took her daughter to visit a Disney theme park , law enforcement sources told ABC News .
Bonnie Sweeten , 38 , was taken into custody in Orlando after being apprehended by the FBI and Orange County police at the Grand Floridian resort and is being charged with false reports and identity theft , Bucks County , Pa. , District Attorney Michelle Henry said this evening .
Sweeten will not face any federal charges at this time , the prosecutor said .
Her 9 - year - old daughter , Julia Rakoczy , was with authorities in Orlando and was to be picked up by her biological father , Anthony Rakoczy , Henry said .
While Sweeten 's motive for fleeing was unclear , Henry indicated that domestic and financial problems were likely at the root of it .
According to court documents , Sweeten used former coworker Jillian Jenkinson 's drivers license when she bought airline tickets to Orlando after reporting the abduction .
She obtained the license on Tuesday by telling Jenkinson that she needed to borrow her driver 's license to photocopy it in order to roll over Jenkinson 's 401k account .
Jenkinson expected to get her license back later that day .
Sweeten and her daughter were last heard from about 1:45 p.m. when she called 911 to say she had been in a minor car accident in Bucks County , a Philadelphia suburb .
She called a second time moments later to say she had been tossed in the trunk of a Cadillac by two black men , according to police .
" This was a total fabrication on her part , " Henry said this evening .
Shortly after first 911 call , Sweeten called her husband Larry 's cell phone and left a tearful voicemail , describing the carjacking and how she feared for her life .
On the message she told her husband she loved him and if she did n't see him again to tell the children she loved them .
As the investigation developed , investigators became increasingly skeptical of her abduction tale , which was told against the backdrop of a probe into Sweeten 's alleged involvement in the theft of about $ 300,000 from her former employer , an attorney in Upper Makefield Township , sources close to the investigation told ABC News .
Sweeten also had recently told a friend , investigators said , that she was feeling suicidal .
Investigators said friends and relatives noted she was scared in the days prior to her disappearance .
Authorities had already noted that Sweeten had withdrawn about $ 12,000 from several bank accounts over a period of days .
Cell Phone Records Cast Doubt on Abduction Story
One of the first pieces of information that called her version of events into doubt was the fact that cell phone records indicated that Sweeten 's frantic call to 911 dispatchers reporting her kidnapping in Bucks County originated from a location in Philadelphia 's Center City neighborhood , and not from a suburb 25 miles away where she lived .
Then an airport video was discovered that allegedly showed her boarding a plane for Orlando about 3 p.m. , a little more than an hour after she reported being abducted .
A black Cadillac with front - end damage was located by police , but the FBI later said the car was not linked to the abduction .
Early today police discovered Sweeten 's silver GMC Yukon Denali , which they reported finding unlocked , without keys and with a parking ticket on its windshield in Center City , an area of downtown Philadelphia that is well - known for its bustling restaurants and shops .
Sweeten , a mother of three children , has an 8 - month - old baby with her husband , Larry Sweeten .
They live in Feasterville , Pa. Police in the suburb where Sweeten lives indicated that family members are known to them .
ABCNews.com was unable to reach Anthony Rakoczy , Sweeten 's ex-husband with whom she had two children : Paige , 15 , and Julia , 9 .
On NBC's " Today " show today , Rakoczy said that he did not know why anyone would abduct his ex-wife and daughter .
" I have no clue , " said Rakoczy , who said he has maintained a good relationship with Sweeten since their divorce .
Rakoczy said that Sweeten was known for being " very organized " and that his daughter was " always dancing around the house " and " loved sports . "

Cato study : Decriminalization of drugs in Portugal an " unambiguous success "
In 2001 , Portugal decided to make a dramatic U - turn when it comes to drug policy .
Alone in the European Union , Portugal decided to try decriminalization of drugs as a strategy to deal with the negative outcomes of illicit drug use .
They did not merely decriminalize marijuana , they decriminalized all drugs .
Without exception .
Glenn Greenwald has taken a look at the numbers and reports , in a new Cato Institute study , on the outcomes of Portugal 's new policy direction .
The results , according to him , are positive .
And not merely positive , but very positive .
Decriminalization in Portugal is working , it is an " unambiguous success , " as Greenwald puts it .
Greenwald will be at the Cato Institute today to discuss his reports .
At 12 p.m. Eastern
Time , you can watch his presentation by clicking here .
In the meantime , here is the summary he presents to his own readers :
... Drug policy is being more openly debated than ever before in the U.S. ( Time 's Joe Klein just wrote a column advocating marijuana legalization [ CNN's Jack Cafferty also recently wrote a piece entitled " The War on Drugs is insane . " ] ) , and the unambiguous success of Portugal 's 2001 decriminalization -- which is what enabled the Portuguese Government to address their exploding drug problems in the 1990s and to achieve far better results than virtually every other Western country -- provides a compelling empirical basis for understanding the profound failures of the American approach .
And , for more intrepid researchers , here is the study itself :

Until recently , people were saying the same thing about the Netherlands .
But ever since Amsterdam started tightening restrictions and closing down the coffee shops , no one speaks about the Dutch case anymore .
And NO ONE talks about the Platzspitz , Geneva 's infamous " Needle Park , " where the establishment of an open - drug scene in the belief that a single place for addicts to congregate under supervision was preferable to having them shoot up and doorways and alleyways resulted in a bumper crop of addicts from around Europe .
The local addict population swelled from 3,000 to 20,000 , and at one point , paramedics were resuscitating 40 people per day .
In any case , this effort has the usual problem of the sort of materials anti-prohibitionists offer in support of their cause ; it 's basically an opinion piece by an author with a book to sell .
And not a single person has ever been able to tell me why people would do something less after the government made it easier to do it .
That 's like saying you should leave your doors and windows unlocked to discourage burglary .

There is no definitive study demonstrating that the Netherlands experiment with drug liberalization was a failure .
There are several that suggest that it was ( and continues to be ) a success .
But something being a success has never stopped an intrepid politician from attempting to quash it .
It is not an opinion piece .
It is an analysis of the numbers .
There is no book attached to this , it is all there , freely available to anyone who wants to read it .

Dutch use of marijuana is lower than surrounding countries .
So the fact that marijuana is easily available has n't led to a local explosion in use .
And anybody who has been to Amsterdam or any other large Dutch city that have ' coffehouses " will notice that most of the people in them are foreigners .
As a non -pot smoker I 'm glad they are shutting them down as they stink up the area they are in .
Posted by : The Stig | 2009-04-03 7:44:13 AM
The numbers are not , at this point , in question ( although whether they represent all the relevant data , or merely those portions that seem to agree with the author 's opinion , is certainly open to question ) .
However , any conclusion derived therefrom constitutes an opinion ; many others look at the same freely available data and conclude otherwise .
And Glenn Greenwald is indeed a published author of political opinion pieces , on some highly controversial topics .
In spite of all the experts the anti-prohibs have quoted through the last few years , the fact remains that at least as many experts believe that drugs should remain restricted .
Remember , marijuana was removed by the pharmacopoeia by doctors , not politicians .
Just because someone has a new approach and a new idea does n't automatically make it right .
And bad as the current situation is , it is far from being so bad that it could n't get worse .
The common anti-prohib assertion that any change could only be for the better is therefore naive .

Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-04-03 6:21:28 AM
Maybe the reason that nobody talked about Geneva 's Platzspitz is that the " Platzspitz " was in Zürich .
At least you are in the right country .
Posted by : The Stig | 2009-04-03 8:13:43 AM
P.S. The Dutch themselves consider the experiment a failure ; they were tired of being a magnet for drug tourists .
Such real - world examples have a far more convincing than cloistered academics or professional activists who massage cherry - picked numbers into supporting a conclusion they 've already reached in accordance with an abstract and arbitrary ideal .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-04-03 8:14:03 AM
" However , any conclusion derived therefrom constitutes an opinion "
Also , water comes out of the tap .
Why is it necessary to mention things that are obvious ?
Any proposed policy , or any analysis of a policy , is an opinion .
" many others look at the same freely available data and conclude otherwise . "
Who are these " many others " ?
Can you link to a study / report / opinion piece , anything ?
" In spite of all the experts the anti-prohibs have quoted through the last few years , the fact remains that at least as many experts believe that drugs should remain restricted . "
What do you mean by " restricted " ?
Drugs continue to be " restricted " in Portugal .
Legalization proponents mostly support having regulations preventing minors from getting drugs , and regulating the sale of drugs .
That counts as " restriction . "
Decriminalization , like in Portugal , still includes " restrictions . "
The debate is between whether or not the war on drugs should continue in its present form , vs. some sort of loosening ( or cessation ) of the drug war .
In this debate , the number of experts supporting loosening or ending the war on drugs vastly outstrips the number of experts that support its continuation .
In fact , I know of no credible expert who supports the continuation of the war on drugs .
Please point me to one .
" Just because someone has a new approach and a new idea does n't automatically make it right . "
But if someone has a new idea , that has been proven to work , then maybe we should take a second look at it .
That is the argument .
It is not " it 's new , therefore it is better . "
Posted by : P.M. Jaworski | 2009-04-03 9:23:45 AM
Excellent post , Peter .
In your comment to Shane you wrote : " I know of no credible expert who supports the continuation of the war on drugs . "
I would add that the only so - called experts who do support the war on drugs are the people paid to fight it .
The drug war employs a huge number of people who are loath to give up the racket -- from law enforcement ( cops , prosecutors , parole officers ) to the prison industry to addiction councillors .
But once these people are out of office , they often reflect on their work as having been a failure , and advocate at least some degree of reform .
( LEAP is literally made up of reformed drug warriors . )
Until Harper , the Canadian conservative movement was drifting slowly toward a liberal approach to drug policy .
The change in policy under Harper has been about winning votes , and not about good policy .

Damn Swiss cities , I always get them confused .
Thanks for the correction .

" Also , water comes out of the tap .
Why is it necessary to mention things that are obvious ?
Any proposed policy , or any analysis of a policy , is an opinion . "
Because the solution to the current drug problem is not obvious , at least not to some people .
It 's certainly less obvious than trying to determine if you can get water out a tap .
" Who are these " many others " ?
Can you link to a study / report / opinion piece , anything ? "
I see .
So , if you tell me the Earth is flat , and offer your evidence , I 'm supposed to provide a complete list of the people who think it is n't flat ?
The AMA , the DEA , the FBI , and numerous medical and social entities oppose the legalization of hard drugs for certain , and to a lesser degree , marijuana .
They 're far too numerous to list .
Your job is much easier because you are quoting exceptions to the rule who are famous for that very reason .
" What do you mean by " restricted " ?
Drugs continue to be " restricted " in Portugal .
Legalization proponents mostly support having regulations preventing minors from getting drugs , and regulating the sale of drugs .
That counts as " restriction . "
Decriminalization , like in Portugal , still includes " restrictions . "
Virtually all currently restricted drugs , including marijuana , are available with a doctor 's prescription in Canada .
That prevents minors from getting them , and regulates their sale .
Does it not ?
" The debate is between whether or not the war on drugs should continue in its present form , vs. some sort of loosening ( or cessation ) of the drug war . "
It 's not a war , it 's an enforcement policy .
" War " is a word beloved of activists who try to paint a stark , bloody picture as bad as the killing fields of Cambodia .
The only people doing the killing are criminals .
The difference is they are being bankrolled by John Q. Citizen .
" In this debate , the number of experts supporting loosening or ending the war on drugs vastly outstrips the number of experts that support its continuation . "
You mean the number of experts with an opinion they feel strongly enough to go public on .
The only ones you hear about are the ones controversial enough to make the news .
Same for the death penalty -- only a small fraction of Canadians supported its repeal , but they were the ones that got all the airtime .
" In fact , I know of no credible expert who supports the continuation of the war on drugs .
Please point me to one . "
Who decides who is credible , and based on what criteria ?
" But if someone has a new idea , that has been proven to work , then maybe we should take a second look at it .
That is the argument .
It is not " it 's new , therefore it is better . " "
That 's what they said about Amsterdam .
What they did n't tell you was that Amsterdam already had a low rate of drug use , and that liberalizing the law did n't actually change anything , until the drug tourists got wind of it .
Besides , America is a completely different animal than Portugal .
In any case , just because it 's been proven to work to Greenwald 's satisfaction does n't make it actually proven .
The problem with your logic is this .
You argue that making something harder to do will increase the likelihood that people will do it .
As I said , that 's like recommending that you leave your doors and windows unlocked to remove the " forbidden fruit " syndrome and thus discourage burglary .
It flies in the face of all logic .
In fact , it undermines the very idea of law enforcement in general .
And the fact that so many advocates of drug legalization are anarchist types tends to support that assertion .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-04-03 10:13:42 AM
Sure , Matthew , sure .
It 's a vast Right - wing conspiracy .
That is the standard libertarian answer whenever anyone points out that the " establishment " and conventional experts do not support their ideas .
This is precisely what I had in mind when I questioned P.M. 's criteria for determining who is " credible . "
A few highly publicized former officials feeling hopeless and discouraged that they did n't accomplish more is nothing unusual , and certainly does n't discredit the approach they used in office .
Albert Pierrepoint , " England 's last hangman , " became an opponent of capital punishment after his retirement and ostensibly resigned because of it , although the records show that he actually resigned because of a dispute over his fees .
And the crime rate in England has n't gone anywhere but up since he left .
Now civility in England has declined to a point he would likely have considered unimaginable in 1956 .
Lastly , I remind you that you live in a democracy , and in a democracy , the majority rules .
To say that Harper is trying to win votes is to say that the voters are wrong on this matter .
It is they , not the politicians , you ultimately have to convince ; supremely expedient and self - serving , they simply gravitate to wherever the votes lie .
And you 're unlikely to win many converts by repeating over and over again that everything they 're doing is wrong and only you and a few longtime malcontents have the perspicacity to see it .

Wow !
You mean there are only 20,000 addicts from all around Europe who went to Platzspitz ?
Imagine if all of Europe similarly legalized drug use , and addicts were allowed to stay were they were instead of concentrating in such small parks and coffeehouses !
20,000 spread out over all of Europe would be a trivial number , a trivial public - health problem , and a non-existent criminal - activity problem .
Thanks ,
Shane , that 's the best argument in favour of a general legalization of drugs I have read in a while !

They were n't from all over Europe they were mostly Swiss , and they were almost exclusively heroin addicts .
There are 40,000 registered heroin addicts in the UK and probably 20,000 more who are unregistered .
There are 250,000 Class A addicts in the UK .
That 's no small number .
Pull your finger out Brown .

I do n't think the drug war is a vast right wing conspiracy , Shane .
I think it 's a vast statist conspiracy supported by the left and the right .
The war on drugs is a socialist enterprise , as Friedman once said .
I also think it is fair to demand that you rely on experts who do n't make their living from the drug war .
It 's like asking someone working at a human rights commission whether they think the war on free speech has been a success .
Let 's look at what independent scholars are writing .
As for democracy and majority rule , we live in a liberal or constitutional democracy where basic freedoms are -- or shoudl be -- protected can not be voted away .
What you seem to be advocating is majoritarianism .
That 's not what Western democracy is about .

You people always talk about drugs as if it should be a free choice made by adults .
The problem is that so many of our addicts get hooked on drugs not as adults but as children .
Legal or not , our children will continue to get hooked on drugs and therefore outright bans are the only solution .
Like Harper says , Llibertarians are irresponsible and this is another example of how Llibertarians refuse to take responsibility for our children or for people who are too depressed , gullible or just plain stupid to act reponsibly .

You do realize how dtupid that sounds , right ?
If they continue to get hooked on drugs when they are illegal , how is that an argument to keep them illegal ?
You say in your reply that outright bans do not work , then assert that as a reason why we must keep them ?

Matthew , this debate is not about what you think .
It 's not about what anybody thinks .
It 's about what you can prove .
And you have proven no conspiracy .
Yes , we live in a liberal democracy .
However , that does not mean that anything goes .
You have no Constitutionally protected right to get high .
Getting high is not a right .
Street disorders are not what Western democracy is about , either , but try telling that to the " foot soldiers of democracy . "
Bottom line :
Your case for a conspiracy is not proven .
And Who says only scholars should have a voice in how society is run ?
Or that only scholars know what they 're talking about ?
Scholars have agendas too , you know .
For that matter , so do activists .

Yes , some people are willing to risk breaking the law to indulge in certain behaviour .
But the spectre of a criminal record manages to keep many away .
If you remove that , how many more will get hooked ?
Or put another way , how does it logically follow that making something more accessible will result in fewer people buying it ?
You say in your reply that outright bans do not work , then assert that as a reason why we must keep them ?
Outright bans are not 100 percent effective ; on sample sizes this large , nothing is .
But doing nothing is ZERO percent effective .
The math is pretty simple .
But then , potheads are n't known for their math skills .
They tend to bite at history , too .
And boy does it show in their arguments , because those are the two most important things to master if you want to create sound policy or even win an argument about it .
Like I said , the higher brain centres are the first to go .

If th Portugese Miracle gets applied to Vancouver - heres what you get :
1 ) line ups of junkies - en masse - waiting to score their freedom powders every hour of the day & night forever
2 ) the Canadian Govt and police pretending its not there in order to appear nice , warm liberal socially advanced guys (* aka retards )
3 ) when enough is enough whole blocks of druggie slums get bulldozed and the freedom powder clients warehoused elsewhere - oops that was a bad moment for freedom
4_ instead of an incarcerated life facing guards and cops - the freedom powder clients face an incarcerated life of facing doctors , social workers and various agency clipboard people -- costs double and instead of being compelled to quit , they are entertained as they indulge in chemical selfishness at taxpayers expense , , taxpayers revolt , here we go --

what a dreadful glimpse of the shape of things to come -- see for yourself folks -
Portugal drug decrim experience is a clogged toilet spilling down the stairs ... how can anybody applaud this ?
maybe just Govt Retards and their Wipehead delusionoids but the rest of us are not buying this plan .. the oft quoted above happy face Portugese govt report on success ..
\ dream on all you liberatarian goofs - the War on Drugs will only wind down when the Wipeheads themselves give it up , ya we all agree they are too fucked up to do this .. so are wipeheads to be guarded buy cops or doctors ?
thats they only real choices here Its what society can afford - a phd or mall cop -

Yes .
Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in the EU in 2001 .
They changed their policies , and now things are better .
Have you considered at least skimming the Cato report , 419 ?

Shane : I would like a policy paper , or an academic paper arguing for the continuation of the drug war .
Just one .
I would like you to name one academic or expert who supports the drug war .
Just one .
Before I give you what you want , P.M. , think about this .
You have deliberately stacked the deck in your favour .
You have specifically stated from whom you want to hear , and it what manner you would like to hear it .
Your belief that scholars have all the answers betrays your own bias .
The fact that the current generation of scholars used drugs heavily in their youth further muddies the issue , which you also know full well .
You also know that most academic papers are hidden behind a wall of paid subscriptions and that only the newsworthy ones or those accessed by activists generally see the light of day , which further stacks the deck .
That amounts to intellectual dishonesty , P.M.
It also gives more weight to the opinions of people of a certain class , which one would think would be against the libertarian ideal .
In Drug Control Policy , by William O. Walker ( that 's the name on the book , I swear ) , under the chapter " Drug Legalization , the Drug War , and Drug Treatment in Historical Perspective , " David T. Courtwright argues that a coercive public - health approach to drugs has the best chance of minimizing their damage to society .
One passage in particular is damning to the pro-legalization movement : " Forbidding the sale of powerful psychoactive drugs to young people makes social , moral , and political sense .
Unfortunately , illicit drug use in this country has been concentrated among the young , that is , among those who are most likely to be made exceptions to the rule of legal sales [ italics added ] . "
In any case , it does not matter , in the end , what the intellectuals want , or the academics want , or the politicians want , or the police want , or even what the courts want .
This is a democracy .
It matters what the people want .
Even if what they want is delayed a generation by having to wait for current judges and policymakers to retire , in the end they will get their wish .
To dismiss them as rubes who should know better than to interfere with the social tinkering of their supposed betters is not only anti-democratic , but anti-libertarian .
It is the people you have to convince ; it is people the intellectuals have to convince .
So far they — and you — are doing a poor job .
61 percent of Americans think dope should remain illegal .
The numbers only go up from there when discussing smack and crack .

what are the chances of Canada adopting this Portugese national drug surrender model , that being legalizing all controlled substances act drugs and treating those who get too carried away as sick people ?
How about it happening this year ?
how about next year -
or the year after that ?
- Canada is n;t Portugal
Portugal is Portugal
Tell the Taliban in Afghanistan
to keep on milkin ' them poppies -
and tell the Shining Path in S America
to keep an pickin ' them coca leaves --
tell all the wipehead pot farmers
to keep on shinin ' them lights ---
it will all be ok ..
just fine for the astute drug bosses
our people using their product die or end up fucked up
but now tat last hey won;t have police records - as if that mattered in the first place
nor will they suffer indignity in prison
so its a great day for toxic humanity
at least the ones who make it
Chances of Canada adopting any of this free range Wioehead approach in a hurry is somewhat remote - unless , of course anyone wants to put $ 20 on it .. same drill : money / mouth etc

You make too many assumptions , Shane .
I gave a class of people from whom to pick .
What I 'm looking for is an intelligent argument backed by empirical facts .
That 's all .
You " gave a class of people , " but yet are " looking only for intelligent arguments . "
Which is it ?
I do n't have this belief .
I believe that scholars have a broader base of information from which to make informed judgments .
And why should anyone care what you believe ?
Scholars are famous for cloistered , ivory - tower ideas that would never fly in the real world .
That does not mean they 'll always get it right , it just means they 're more likely to have the right incentives to do the best they can .
Scholars ’ primary incentives are tenure and the recognition of their peers .
Neither requires honesty , and depending on the quality of their peers , it does n’t require sound arguments either .
Academic treatises are notoriously difficult reading .
What you did here is identical to me stating , " Your belief that scholars never have any of the answers betrays your own bias . "
But that 's not what you said , and I did n't say what you claim I believe .
I did not require you to produce sources only from non-academic sources , though , did I ?
This assertion is therefore false .
That depends on the scholar .
And you knew that .
Universities are notorious drug dens , and it was , if anything , worse in the 60s , when most of these scholars were undergrads .
Yes , some scholars do n’t , and have n’t , done drugs .
But I venture to say that they used them more than the general population .
I have access through JSTOR and through Ohio Link and several other sources .
So if you point me to an article , I can read it .
I can’t .
And that ’s the point .
That 's confused .
Libertarians are biased in favour of liberty and against the state , they are not , like you seem to be , anti-intellectual .
My point was you were prepared to accept arguments only from a certain class of people , an overtly elitist approach that subverts libertarian thinking .
Was that really so hard ?
Did you need to go through all of that bluster to give me this ?
I 'll take a look .
Thanks for the heads - up .
It ’s not bluster ; it ’s the truth .
Policy is ultimately shaped by the voters , provided they ’re sufficiently engaged in the process .
Only when the voters sleep do the elitists get to play .
As for your opinion about the importance of majoritarianism , I do n't share your opinion .
It ’s not opinion .
It ’s the law .

Obviously " 419 " obviously has no interest in taking even a cursory glance at the Cato report .
They decriminalized , NOT legalized .
Trafficking and sale is still very much criminalized , and , according to the 2001 news story , caught users can still be jailed if they fail to obey the program .
I believe Shane Matthews , in that there are many experts that believe drugs must be prohibited , but I 'll bet many of those same people would be willing to consider an alternative approach to * how * they are prohibited if the outcome could be less death , disease , and waste of criminal justice resources .
That is why the Portugal model is so interesting .
The U.S. policy gives lip service to " drug courts " ( forced treatment ) , but repeated use will often mean a parole violation , with criminal penalties , and either way the drug arrest shows up in background checks , so that follows the arrestee forever .
Portugal has basically mandated that their version of forced treatment actually be used most of the time .
Can you take the model and drop it in other countries ?
Of course not , but it shows decrim does n't destroy society and has positive effects .
" Needle Park " was not a success , but we need * more * experimentation .
If anything , drug policy would be better off localized because * culture * is localized .
The UN treaty stifles innovation .
Shane , do you have any links demonstrating how the Netherlands policy is a failure ?
I can see that some Dutch have a distaste for the coffeeshops , but that 's hardly proof of drug policy failure .
What if they go away and disease and death go up ?
Also , you 're right to say that , in general , criminality is a deterent , but remember , most drug users start in the teen years , when rebellion trumps law , especially victimless drug laws .
I believe that when marijuana prohibition falls , the size of the remaining hard drug black will shrink substantially , and as well the need for dangerous drug raids .
I make no claims that legalization for adults will reduce teen use , in fact I 'd prefer that teens that are going to experiment with drugs use marijuana than prescription opiates .

Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-04-03 7:08:52 PM
Steve ,
1 . You do realize that " decriminalized " is simply a fiction that requires suspension of disbelief and pretending the real rules do n't exist ?
They can't get drugs legalized , so they set the bar lower and aim for " decriminalization , " in the hopes that it will achieve much the same thing .
Something is either illegal or it is not .
There is no grey area .
2 . An alternative to the existing approach would not necessarily be decriminalization , but stepped - up enforcement with tougher sentences for dealers with indefinite drug camp sojourns for users .
Part of the problem is how difficult it has become to actually put anyone in jail and keep them there .
Contrary to popular belief , the supply of potential criminals is not unlimited .
3 . I agree enforced treatment is an essential part of any solution to the current problem .
But more people will just keep getting hooked unless it is made more difficult for them to try drugs .
Know why there 's so much violence in the drug world right now ?
Because the supply of drugs is actually drying up from enforcement and the punks are fighting over the crumbs that remain .
4 . That it can have positive effects .
Also , what Portugal has done is not decriminalization as Canadians usually use the term .
Here it means that instead of jail time , you get a fine .
No enforced treatment .
Hell , even those who want to kick the stuff have trouble finding treatment .
That 's a big reason the problem is so intractable here .
5 . Would you be okay with the Lower Mainland 's addict population being " localized " in your neighbourhood ?
Localization is not good ; it encourages ghettoization .
Look at the Downtown Eastside for a textbook example .
6 . It does n't matter what the academics have decided vis-a - vis Amsterdam , Steve .
What the chattering classes think has very little real - world importance .
The point is that the people of Holland have decided that their approach was causing more problems than it solved , and acted on that decision .
7. Bring back the strap .
Part of the reason teenagers are so out of control is that an overly liberal society has emasculated the disciplinarians .
There are virtually no legal means to control rebellious teens apart from juvenile detention .
Either of my sons tries drugs and I 'll give him twenty lashes of the belt and risk the jail time .
And the fact that these pustules specifically target our youth before they have a chance to learn better is all the more reason to stretch their necks on the gallows .
8 . On what do you base this belief ?
Drugs would remain illegal for minors , even as alcohol and cigarettes are now illegal for minors .
Unless you can come up with a convincing reason why dope should be legal for teens but not cigarettes and booze ?
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2009-04-03 7:29:10 PM
" Logically , they do n't matter .
Politically , they do .
Remember , it is the people , not the intellectuals , that need convincing .
And you keep coming up short . "
So opinions do matter .
Let 's hope no one notices that you 've changed your mind .
" Me and the 61 percent of Americans who think pot should stay illegal , among them the Great Black Messiah . "
Interesting that you think citing a poll in the U.S. is somehow relevant to whether or not Canada should change her laws .
" They 're not supposed to be the first resort ; certainly they do n't give the best answers .
Why are we talking about psychology ? "
" supposed to " ?
Is that a fact or your opinion ?
" No , you changed the subject .
Man , you are all over the map .
Do you realize you 're spending less and less time arguing over the core subject and instead arguing over meaningless inconsequentia ? "
I 'm only following your lead .
It is interesting to see that you think you can come up with rules that everyone has to follow except for you .
Some would call that hypocrisy .
Luckily , you do n't care about opinions , except when you do care about opinions .
Like political opinions .
I may be all over the map , but you 're not even making contact with the map .
You 're floating aimlessly in space .
Maybe your wipehead friend 419 can help direct you back on track with an incoherent , ungrammatical and misspelt ramble .
Maybe both of you will learn about irony in the process .
" Consider your surrender accepted , P.M. "
Consider using English , rather than your own language .
" I told you why I do n't trust academics .
From that one sentiment came all of these meaningless side battles . "
No .
I explained why I wanted an academic source , and why I generally trust academics .
From that one sentiment came all of these meaningless side battles .
" Bottom line :
It 's the people you have to convince , not some morally superior elite .
If your line of thinking is inimical to that , I suggest you start pricing real estate in benevolent dictatorships like Singapore . "
Oh .
Then I do n't have to do anything .
Canadians already think the war on drugs should be loosened , and pot should be treated with kid gloves .
Why did n't you tell me that all you care about is opinion polls ?
We could have saved both of us a lot of time .

Drugs seem to be an obsession with some at this site .
Regardless of one 's stand on the issue , it is NOT a priority when it comes to issues .
As long as we lack freedom of expression and of the press and private property rights , it is silly to keep harping on the drug issue in my opinion .
Posted by : Alain | 2009-04-03 8:44:50 PM
So opinions do matter .
Let 's hope no one notices that you 've changed your mind .
Opinions win elections , but not debates .
Interesting that you think citing a poll in the U.S. is somehow relevant to whether or not Canada should change her laws .
Unfortunately , it is .
Because it is politically and legally problematic to the point of hopelessness to legalize up here while it remains illegal down there , if the objective is to reduce the gang presence .
Most gangs produce mainly for export anyway .
" supposed to " ?
Is that a fact or your opinion ?
If you seek the best , most thoroughly reasoned solutions ( and I admit , seeking to choose those over the alternative is a judgement call ) , then you crunch facts instead of reading sheep intestines , even if you consider those sheep generally trustworthy .
I 'm only following your lead .
It is interesting to see that you think you can come up with rules that everyone has to follow except for you .
Some would call that hypocrisy .
Luckily , you do n't care about opinions , except when you do care about opinions .
Like political opinions .
Sure , you 're only following my lead ; you 're chaff in a whirlwind , with no will of your own .
You were the one who went all obtuse and starting trotting out obfuscatory bafflegab like " heuristics " to justify your deliberate attempt to pre-screen information .
Again : Opinions do n't win debates , which is what we are having .
Voters ' opinions matter ( in a democracy ) in that they affect policy .
The point is that academics ' opinions seldom do .
Consider using English , rather than your own language .
Say what , heuristics boy ?
No .
I explained why I wanted an academic source , and why I generally trust academics .
From that one sentiment came all of these meaningless side battles .
Only because you took exception to the fact that neither I nor the general public trust them , labelling us " anti-intellectual . "
If I did n't know better I 'd guess I 'd ruffled some feathers .
Oh .
Then I do n't have to do anything .
Canadians already think the war on drugs should be loosened , and pot should be treated with kid gloves .
Why did n't you tell me that all you care about is opinion polls ?
We could have saved both of us a lot of time .
Oh really ?
Then why have they twice elected a governments that has vowed to tighten pot regulations ?
Why has the marijuana party failed to obtain even a single seat , especially with its " libertarian " platform ?
A hasty public - opinion poll proves little .
The people remain unconvinced , in spite of your claims to the contrary .
This " support " of yours has failed to produce meaningful and directed action by the elecatorate , as has the arrest and extradition of Marc Emery .
The people are not following your lead .
You may as well give up , P.M. ; you can't be a pied piper until .
you learn to play the flute .

Something is either illegal or it is not .
There is no grey area .
There 's a big difference between fining speeders / making them attend traffic school and giving them criminal records .
Laws may be concrete , but penalties vary drastically within a country as well as the handling of the arrested within the criminal justice system .
stepped - up enforcement with tougher sentences for dealers with indefinite drug camp sojourns for users ...
Feel free to try mandatory minimums .
We 've tried em a few times for marijuana now in the states .
They filled jails , that 's about it .
I agree enforced treatment is an essential part of any solution
Well , no .
I think forced treatment for marijuana addiction , in particular , is a complete waste of resources .
more people will just keep getting hooked unless it is made more difficult for them to try drugs .
So you think there 's an endless queue of people just wishing to try heroin if it were only legal ?
the supply of drugs is actually drying up
Do you believe that ?
That 's been the mantra of our drug czars for many years .
Here it means that instead of jail time , you get a fine .
No enforced treatment .
Hell , even those who want to kick the stuff have trouble finding treatment .
Yep , lack of treatment access sucks ( if you 're talking about highly addictive substances ) .
I think any sane drug policy would require treatment funding and I 'd probably start with a hefty alcohol tax .
I understand it 's way too cheap in the U.S .
Would you be okay with the Lower Mainland 's addict population being " localized " in your neighbourhood ?
If that were my neighborhood I 'd be begging to try any other policy than the one in place .
Extreme problems require radical solutions , and our hands are tied by treaties and federal laws written under completely different conditions and assumptions .
the people of Holland have decided that their approach was causing more problems than it solved
I know the hill is steep , I just think it 's worth pushing up it .
If it makes it worse , they 'll vote it out .
There 's nothing people love more than to limit the rights of others by popular vote .
Ask the gays .
Bring back the strap .
Part of the reason teenagers are so out of control is that an overly liberal society has emasculated the disciplinarians .
Yeah , a lot of sucky ( non ) parenting .
why dope should be legal for teens but not cigarettes and booze ?
Maybe I was n't clear .
Marijuana should be regulated similarly to alcohol ( adults only ) .
I 'm 34 and have never been drunk or stoned , and from my perspective there 's no moral brick wall between alcohol and pot .
In either case I think we need to ban marketing as the U.S. did with tobacco .
Yes , legalized pot will increase the chances of kids having access to it , but that is not a nightmare scenario for me .
Kids popping prescription opiates or other stuff the weed dealer offers them , that 's a nightmare , and it's what we have now .

Steve ,
1. Traffic offences and bylaw infractions are special cases , separate from criminal law .
And it 's pretty tough to criminalize selling something without also criminalizing buying it .
We do n't think twice about giving prostitutes or their customers criminal records ; why the velvet cushion treatment for drug users ?
2 . Yes it did fill jails ... with criminals .
The great majority of people charged with possession get no jail time , unless it 's something like their fifth offence .
Most people in jail for drugs are dealers , not users .
3 . The main focus of the Portugal article was their approach to hard drugs , not marijuana .
4 . I think more of them would try it if it were more widely available ... which it would be if it were legal .
It was once , remember ?
They restricted it for a reason , and it was n't a government conspiracy .
5 . Asking if I believe something is n't refuting it .
6 . Alcoholics , by and large , pay for their own rehabilitation .
I do not see why they should have to pay for heroin addicts ' as well .
7 . You like radical solutions ?
Very well .
All dealers and users of illegal drugs shall be punished by immediate execution .
The population of drug users would plummet , I promise .
NO policy is so bad that there is n't another that is worse .
8 . Well , most people do n't feel like pushing up that particular hill .
And you wo n't convince them otherwise by telling them they all suck for disagreeing with you .
9 . He that spareth his rod hateth his son .
Assholes are created not by ( fair ) discipline , but by lack of it .
10 .
You have several times brought your own perspective into the picture , e.g. " I believe , " " I think , " " from my perspective . "
That is a statement of opinion , not an argument .
And an adults - only law wo n't stop teenagers from experimenting because they will still be illegal for them to buy ... only now they can raid the old man 's cannabis cabinet .
You are not the world , Steve .

Hemp Wars Fire Up
The debate heats up over legalizing domestic production of hemp - a banned crop that has a trace of THC - reports CNBC's Jane Wells .
Less than a week after the conclusion of The Pirate Bay trial , a new controversy has surfaced over the judge 's possible conflict of interests .
It turns out that Judge Tomas Norstr�m — the judge who found The Pirate Bay defendants guilty and slapped them with jail time — is currently a member of the Swedish Copyright Association , an organization that works against piracy along with a number of entertainment industry members .
As a result , lawyers for the defendants have made it clear that they will push for a retrial .
The Swedish media dug up information this week revealing that Norstr�m is a member of the Swedish Copyright Association along with Henrik Pont�n , Peter Danowsky and Monique Wadsted — individuals who represented the recording industry in The Pirate Bay trial .
Additionally , Norstr�m also sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property , an advocacy group that pushes stricter copyright laws .
And these are n't just accusations .
Norstr�m acknowledged to Sveriges Radio , as reported by The Local , that the findings are true ; he just thought that it would n't be a problem .
" My view has been that these activities do not constitute a conflict of interest , " Norstr�m said .
Needless to say , the defendants feel otherwise .
The lawyer representing The Pirate Bay 's Peter Sunde ( also known as brokep ) , Peter Althin , announced Thursday that he would seek to have the decision thrown out and the case revisited .
" In the autumn I received information that a lay judge could have similar connections .
I sent these to the court and the judge was excluded in order to prevent a conflict of interest .
It would have been reasonable to then review this situation as well , " Althin told The Local .
In fact , The Pirate Bay case has been laced with conflict of interest controversies for some time now .
In addition to the current and lay judge 's conflict of interests , in June of 2008 , it was revealed that the police officer leading the investigation was also employed by Warner Bros .
at the same time he was investigating the torrent kings .
The Pirate Party — a Swedish political party that is not directly related to The Pirate Bay , but supports copyright reform and privacy rights — agrees that this chain of events is n't flattering to Sweden 's political system .
" The copyright lobby has really managed to bring corruption to Sweden , " Pirate Party chairman Rickard Falkvinge said in a statement .
Not directly , no .
We are of course very much aware of Erlang , but we did n't study it before designing Axum .
On the other hand , both languages are influenced by the common actor - oriented roots .
The direct influences on Axum have been CSP and pi-calculus , BizTalk , Ada and the language SR ( rather obscure , but that 's where we got the idea for domains from ) .
Also , the service - oriented way of breaking down a problem was a great source of inspiration .
If you look at Erlang and Axum , you will find that there are many similarities and many differences :
Erlang achieves isolation through the immutability of its data structures , Axum through scope - based isolation and making object graphs non-reachable .
Erlang does away with the object - oriented paradigm , while Axum is swimming in a sea of objects .
This is the biggest reason why , even if we had studied Erlang first , Axum would still look very different -- .NET is OO , and we have to mesh well with that .
Erlang follows the traditional mailbox - processor actor design pattern , while Axum uses channels that are more like stay - alive HTTP sessions .
We think this is a significant advancement on the actor pattern ; we 're learning from how the web , the biggest , most parallel , software system in existence , is programmed .
One thing the two have in common is the light - weight actors , and the affinity for message - passing , of course .

If you get excited about the prospect of really , really fast broadband Internet service , here ’s a statistic that will make heart race .
Or your blood boil .
Or both .
Pretty much the fastest consumer broadband in the world is the 160 - megabit - per - second service offered by J: Com , the largest cable company in Japan .
Here ’s how much the company had to invest to upgrade its network to provide that speed : $ 20 per home passed .
The cable modem needed for that speed costs about $ 60 , compared with about $ 30 for the current generation .
By contrast , Verizon is spending an average of $ 817 per home passed to wire neighborhoods for its FiOS fiber optic network and another $ 716 for equipment and labor in each home that subscribes , according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company .
Those numbers from Japan came from Michael T. Fries , the chief executive of Liberty Global , the American company that operates J:Com .
His larger point : “ To me , this just is n’t an expensive capital investment , ” he said .
The experience in Japan suggests that the major cable systems in the United States might be able to increase the speed of their broadband service by five to 10 times right away .
They might not need to charge much more for it than they do now and they ’d still make as much money .
The cable industry here uses the same technology as J:Com .
And several vendors said that while the prices Mr. Fries quoted were on the low side , most systems can be upgraded for no more than about $ 100 per home , including a new modem .
Moreover , the monthly cost of bandwidth to connect a home to the Internet is minimal , executives say .
So what ’s wrong with this picture in the United States ?
The cable companies , like Comcast and Cablevision , that are moving quickly to install the fast broadband technology , called Docsis 3 , are charging as much as $ 140 a month for 50 Mbps service .
Meanwhile other companies , like Time Warner Cable , are moving much more slowly to upgrade .
Competition , or the lack of it , goes a long way to explaining why the fees are higher in the United States .
There is less competition in the United States than in many other countries .
Broadband already has the highest profit margins of any product cable companies offer .
Like any profit - maximizing business would do , they set prices in relation to other providers and market demand rather than based on costs .
Pricing at Liberty varies widely by market .
In Japan , its 160 Mbps service costs 6,000 yen ( $ 60 ) per month .
That ’s only $ 5 a month more than the price of its basic 30 Mbps service .
In the Netherlands , meanwhile , it charges 80 euros ( $ 107 ) for 120 Mbps service and 60 euros ( $ 81 ) for 60 Mbps.
Mr. Fries said that he expected these prices would fall over time .
“ Our margins go up , ” he said .
“ But we are delivering more value . ”
Cable executives have given several reasons for why many cable systems in the United States are going very slowly in upgrading to Docsis 3 .
There ’s little competition in areas not served by Verizon ’s FiOS system , which soon will offer 50 Mbps service .
And some argue there is n’t that much demand for super - high speed .
Mr. Fries added another : Fear .
Other cable operators , he said , are concerned that not only will prices fall , but that the super - fast service will encourage customers to watch video on the Web and drop their cable service .
The industry is worried that by offering 100 Mbps , they are opening Pandora ’s box , he said .
Everyone will be able to get video on the Internet , and then competition will bring the price for the broadband down from $ 80 to $ 60 to $ 40 .
Are n’t you worried that the prices will fall too ?
I asked .
“ Maybe , ” he said very slowly .
“ We ’ll see how it happens .
We want to keep it up there for now .
It is a premium service . ”

It was Fox News against the world about tea party coverage , but CNN “ Lou Dobbs Tonight ” host showed he ’s just as disgusted with some of the coverage as many conservatives are .
Lou Dobbs comments on Janeane Garofalo on his April 17 radio show .
Dobbs , on his April 17 radio program , criticized comedian Janeane Garofalo on his April 17 radio show for her vitriolic attack against the April 15 tea party protests .
“ The national liberal media gets so snarky , it ca n’t stand itself , ” Dobbs said .
“ Then all these too cute by half ideologues trying to pose as some sort of objective journalists .
You know , these fools , start falling off their little high horses – it ’s fun to me .
But , I ’m pretty sure you ’re going to see a lot more snarky little nastiness coming out of the national liberal media . ”
Dobbs , in his own brand of populist outrage showed his ire against the media for dismissing the April 15 protest .
“ They ca n’t accept that the American people – that the vast majority of American people are through with the ideological nonsense – whether it ’s on the left or the right .
And they ’re sure through with the national liberal media who think you know they ’re just a heck of a lot smarter than everybody else in this country . ”

Round glutes , strong back , bigger hams , The Deadlift
Like the squat , the deadlift involves the largest muscle groups in the body : the gluteus maximus , hamstrings , quadriceps and erector spinea .
And like the squat , it is a very hard , taxing exercise to perform .
Consequently , for this reason alone many people do n’t use the deadlift in their routines .
The gluteus maximus is utilized most in the beginning of the movement when there is a large degree of hip flexion .
The glutes work in unison with the hamstring to extend the hips .
The hamstrings , located on the back of the upper thigh , become more involved as you begin to decrease the degree of hip flexion as you raise the weight .
The erector spinea , which run the length of your spine on both sides , are statically contracted throughout most of the movement keeping the normal curvature of the spine .
A static contraction of the rhomboids and the trapezius muscles help maintain the shoulders .
The quadriceps muscles are involved with knee extension .
Extension of the body occurs when the upper body , torso and pelvis rotate up and back .
In a properly performed deadlift , this will happen simultaneously with the hips moving forward and the knees extending .
Two of the biggest mistakes I see when this movement is performed are locking the knees out before the upper body is extended or allowing the back to “ round ” and magnifying the kyphotic ( upper back ) curvature while de-emphasizing the lordotic ( lower back ) curvature .
I need to add that a slight curve of the upper back will present no danger and will happen to most while using heavy weight , but if you look like the hunch back of Notre Dame while performing the exercise that ’s a different story .
The main reason your lower back would round , which could cause devastating trauma to the lumbar area , is weak erector muscles .
There are various exercises you can use to strengthen your lower back like good mornings , arched back good mornings , arched back stiff legged deadlifts , and reverse hyperextensions , but good mornings and its variation in my opinion are probably the best exercise for this purpose .??????
