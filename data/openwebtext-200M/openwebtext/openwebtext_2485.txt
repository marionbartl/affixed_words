Gaza attack could prompt Israel to pull out Killing of 30 Palestinian refugees inside U.N. campus invites escalation of outrage
A Palestinian man sits outside one of the two UN schools that were hit by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip on January 6 , 2009 at the al - Shati refugee camp in Gaza City .
Israeli strikes hit two UN - run schools -- one of them crowded with refugees -- in the Gaza Strip today , killing at least five Palestinians , medics and UN officials said .
Two people were killed when an artillery shell slammed into a school in the southern town of Khan Yunis and three people were killed in an air strike on a school in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City , they said .

Middle East observers felt a sense of deja vu Tuesday as Israeli tank shells slammed into a U.N. school near Gaza City , killing at least 30 Palestinians who had taken refuge there from the war raging around their homes .
In 1982 , a massacre carried out by a Christian militia group at the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps killed hundreds of Palestinians ; the camps had been under Israeli control .
In 1996 , there were 118 people killed at a U.N. compound by Israeli artillery in the town of Qana , and in 2006 , an Israeli air strike killed 56 in an apartment complex in the same town .
All three events spelled the beginning of the end of Israeli campaigns into Lebanon .
Until now , the international community - including Egypt - has given Israel a long leash to strike a heavy blow against Hamas .
But with the shelling of the U.N. school in the northern Gaza town of Jebaliya on Tuesday , the clock might start ticking for Israel to withdraw its troops .
The Israeli Foreign Ministry , which branded the deaths " a heartrending tragedy , " said it would continue with the offensive until Hamas stopped launching rockets on its southern towns and agreed not to restock its weapons .
At least 15 rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday , including one that injured a baby in the town of Gedera , about 25 miles northeast of Gaza , the farthest north a Hamas rocket has reached .
The Foreign Ministry also said it had good reason for targeting the school .
" Initial investigations indicate that Hamas terrorists fired mortar bombs from the area of the school towards Israeli forces , who returned fire towards the source of the shooting .
The Israeli return fire landed outside the school , yet a series of explosions followed , indicating the probable presence of munitions and explosives in the building . "
The Israeli army also accused Hamas of " cynically " using civilians as human shields .
Intelligence reports indicated the dead included Imad Abu Askar and Hasan Abu Askar , " two known Hamas mortar crewmen , " the Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
Two neighborhood residents who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared for their safety , confirmed the Israeli account , telling the Associated Press that a group of militants fired mortar rounds from a street near the school , then fled into a crowd of people in the streets .
But such justification might not be enough to silence the growing chorus of international disapproval as civilian deaths rise .
Dr. Bassam Abu Warda , director of Kamal Adwan Hospital , told reporters that 36 people were killed in the strike on the school .
The United Nations confirmed that 30 were killed and 55 injured by tank shells .
At least 70 Palestinians were killed Tuesday , and more than 600 have died since Israel sent ground forces into Gaza on Saturday , according to U.N. and Palestinian officials .
The United Nations says about 25 percent of the victims were civilians .
Ten Israelis have died , including a soldier who was shot Tuesday .
A predictable clash
In Jerusalem , Western diplomats said privately Tuesday it was predictable that Hamas would draw Israeli army fire toward civilian targets and that Israel would oblige them .
" A ground invasion was expected and , in some Hamas quarters , hoped for , " said the International Crisis Group , a Brussels - based organization engaged in conflict resolution , in a position paper published this week .
" The Islamist movement hopes to reap political benefit from material losses .
It knows it is no military match for Israel , but it can claim victory by withstanding the unprecedented onslaught . "
Shlomo Brom , the former head of the strategic planning division of the Israeli army , said minimizing civilian casualties requires " a combination of excellent intelligence , very accurate weapons systems and very good planning that takes into account collateral damage .
Mistakes are bound to happen , and they will happen in this war . "
Gerald Steinberg , professor of political science at Bar - Ilan University in Ramat Gan , said the strike against the U.N. school and ensuing diplomatic pressure it could create were not only foreseen but discussed in advance by Israeli policymakers .
" There were many meetings on how to deal with this before the fighting started .
It happens every time .
The effect this time very much depends on how the story plays out in the next 24 hours , " said Steinberg .
" If organizations like Amnesty ( International ) and Human Rights Watch give this issue much greater visibility as they have in the past , the pressure on Israel will build and it will have some impact , but if it 's strictly Palestinian claims it wo n't have much effect . "
But international pressure is mounting .
Egyptian proposal
A cease - fire initiative won support from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on rival sides to follow up .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday the initiative seeks an immediate cease - fire by Israel and Palestinian factions for a specific period to allow secure corridors for delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza and to give Egypt time to continue efforts to reach a permanent cease - fire .
Egypt is inviting Israeli and Palestinian sides for urgent meetings to resolve issues underlying the fighting , including securing Gaza 's borders and reopening all crossings , Mubarak said .
The deaths at the school could shake Israel 's broad national consensus in favor of the war , as did the Qana air strike in 2006 , which included 32 children among the 56 killed .
" It is clear that should a misfired bomb kill and injure dozens of civilians , including women and children , the U.N. would be the first to condemn Israel and accuse it of committing war crimes , " Israeli military analyst Ron Ben - Yishai said last week .
" This could also end the operation prematurely . "
Meanwhile , some other observers fear both sides will continue to make the same errors as in past conflicts .
" Because this drama has played out before , there are lessons that ought to have been learned , " said James Zogby , a pollster and president of the Washington - based Arab - American Institute .
" But , sadly , have not . "

The United States graduates about 70,000 engineers each year , and another 30,000 with advanced engineering degrees , according to Daniel Hastings , Dean of Undergraduate Education at MIT .
The numbers could be double that .
On average about 50 % of U.S. engineering students dropout .
John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins argues that we must encourage more U.S. students to choose engineering .
He notes that India graduates 450,000 engineers each year and China another 300,000 .
Actually , those numbers include all graduates in math , science , engineering , and technology , but his point is clear .
At the recent Web 2.0 conference John suggested that the US should staple a Green Card to every foreign student 's engineering diploma and encourage them to stay in the USA .
Why do students drop out ?
Student surveys say because the first year of an engineering program is all foundational theory and they do n't see the connection to a career in engineering .
The second most common complaint is poor quality teachers that are more interested in their own research than in teaching undergraduate students .
Why are n't these professors fired ?
How is it acceptable that 50 % of students drop out ?
Why are the Deans and Professors of these schools still employed ?
Some wear it as a badge of honor .
Engineering is supposed to be tough and it is expected that students will drop out .
However , MIT , Olin College , and other elite engineering schools have dropout rates of less than 2 % .
What is being done about this ?
The Olin College of Engineering has embarked on a mission to redefine engineering education .
Today I attended the annual Presidents Council meeting that focused on " Catalyzing Change in Engineering Education " .
It was a fascinating workshop on what works and what does n't in engineering education .
Dr. Joseph Bordogna , former deputy director and COO of the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , says the problem can be solved and Olin College of Engineering is an excellent example of how to do it .
What does Olin do ?
Curriculum of engineering design and entrepreneurship .
Students start by designing or reverse engineering popular products as a way to learn how things work .
This hands on approach , right from the start , makes engineering real .
Other engineering schools require students to take foundational courses in physics , thermo- dynamics , chemistry , and math for the first two years .
Olin introduces these disciplines as needed throughout the 4 years .

All students receive 100 % scholarships - Franklin W. Olin endowed the school sufficiently to provide 100 % scholarships for all students .
Obviously all engineering schools can't implement all of these practices .
But , some of them would definitely help reduce the high dropout rates .
The University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign recently signed an agreement with Olin to help transform engineering education .
Other engineering schools should consider what they can do to increase enrollments and reduce dropout rates .
The continued success of our country depends on it .

“ Earth Must Be Warned ! ” Screams French Astronaut Before Suicide Attempt
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers ( Traducción al Español abajo )
A most peculiar FSB is circulating in the Kremlin today stating that the renowned scientist and France ’s first female astronaut Claudie Haigneré [ pictured top left ] had to be ‘ forcefully restrained ’ after screaming “ Earth Must Be Warned ! ” prior to her falling into a coma from a reported overdose of sleeping pills in an apparent attempt at suicide .
Of Dr. Haigneré ’s suicide attempt we can read from French media sources :
“ The first French woman in space has been hospitalized after she tried to take her own life , according to published reports .
Claudie Haignere , 51 , was hospitalized late yesterday after she tried to commit suicide , an unidentified French government source told Agence France - Presse .
Another source told AFP that Haignere overdosed on pills .
Haignere , a rheumatologist , flew to the MIR space station as an astronaut in 1996 and to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in 2001 .
She 's studied how humans adapt their motor and cognitive skills in weightlessness and monitored astronauts from the ground .
Later , on the MIR , she performed experiments in physiology , developmental biology , fluid physics and technology , according to the European Space Agency . ”
More ominously , these reports continue , was that within hours of Dr. Haigneré ’s alleged suicide attempt her laboratory , where she worked on the forefront of Human / Alien DNA research , at the World renowned Pasteur Institute was destroyed by fire , and as we can read as reported by the Associated Press News Service :
“ Fire broke out Wednesday in a biology laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in Paris , famed for research on fighting infectious diseases , officials said .
No victims were reported , and no sensitive materials or viruses were affected by the fire , which was extinguished by firefighters , an official at the institute said .
The official was not authorized to be publicly named according to company policy .
The cause of the blaze was unclear .
The fire broke out mid-morning in an underground level of one of the buildings in the institute 's campus in southern Paris , a lab that conducts research in developmental biology , the official said . ”
FSB internal reports on Dr. Haigneré state that since her return from space she had become convinced that our Earth had been visited in our historical past by ‘ ancient astronauts ’ who had not only had colonized our Planet but had genetically engineered the then existing semi-human life forms into our present day human race .
Dr. Haigneré ’s beliefs mirror those of the prominent Israeli writer and researcher Zecharia Sitchin who it is reported : “ attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the " Annunaki " ( or " Nephilim " ) , a race of aliens from a planet he calls Nibiru which he believes to be in an elongated , elliptical orbit in the earth 's own solar system .
Sitchin asserts that Sumerian mythology reflects this view , though his speculations are entirely discounted by mainstream scientists , historians , and archaeologists , who see many problems with his translations of ancient texts and with his understanding of physics . ”
It is also interesting to note the timing of Dr. Haigneré ’s alleged suicide attempt coming at the exact time that concerns are growing over the growing deployment of Global Naval Forces around the Middle Eastern region believed to have been the location of the ancient Garden of Eden , and which we had reported on in our December 21st report titled “ World Shipping Comes To Halt As Global Navies Prepare For ‘ Unprecedented ’ Confrontation ” and where we had noted that :
“ Global Naval Forces currently steaming towards , or already in , The Gulf of Aden include ‘ friends and foes ’ alike The United States , Iran , China , Russia , Germany , Switzerland , European Union and India under what these reports state is the ‘ cover story ’ of protecting the shipping lanes of that region from the US backed pirates operating out of Somalia .
Current news from this region are , also , appearing to show that hostilities have already begun between our Earth ’s ‘ Defense Forces ’ and the Watchers as like the United States last attempt to attack these ‘ aliens ’ by themselves this past January has , once again , resulted in massive cuts by the Watchers to the many undersea communication cables laying upon the seafloors of this region which have now isolated large parts of the Middle East and the sub- continent . ”
Equally important to note is that for the first time in centuries Chinese warships have left their home waters to join the massive International effort to confront what is seen as our Earth ’s most serious threat ever , and that when attempting to confront an undersea ‘ anomaly ’ off the coast of Papua New Guinea villagers reported a UFO like craft rapidly ascending from the ocean and streaking skyward leaving in its aftermath giant swells which have left nearly 32,000 homeless and which the United Nations is now rushing aid towards .
To the catastrophic damage wrecked upon Papua New Guinea the UN is reporting that “ the swells destroyed houses , food and water supplies , damaged crops and led to the loss of gardening tools . ”
To what Dr. Haigneré was attempting to warn our World about it is not to our knowing , other than to point out the obvious conclusion that whatever had caused this most distinguished of scientists to be in such great distress could , indeed , be a prelude of more , and even stranger , events ready to overtake us in the days and months to come .

¡EL MUNDO TIENE QUE SER ADVERTIDO !
GRITA ASTRONAUTA FRANCESA ANTES DE INTENTO DE SUICIDIO
Por : Sorcha Faal y como lo informa a sus suscriptores Occidentales
Un informe más que peculiar de las FSB ( Fuerzas Especiales Rusas ) están circulando hoy en el Kremlin señalando que la reconocida científica y primera mujer astronauta de Francia Claudie Haigneré ( foto superior izquierda ) tuvo que ser ‘ sujetada por la fuerza ” después de gritar “ ¡El mundo tiene que ser advertido ! ” antes de caer en coma después de una sobredosis de pastillas para dormir en aparente intento de suicidio , según se informó .
Sobre el intento de suicidio de la Dra.
Haigneré , nos podemos enterar por las fuentes de información Francesas al leer :
“ La primera Francesa en el espacio ha sido hospitalizada después de que trató de quitarse la vida según reportes publicados .
Claudie Haigneré de 51 años de edad , fue hospitalizada ya tarde el día de ayer tras de cometer suicidio , una fuente no identificada del gobierno dijo a la Agence France Presse .
Otra fuente le dijo a la AFP que Haigneré tomó una sobredosis de pastillas .
Haigneré , reumatóloga , voló a la estación espacial MIR como astronauta en 1996 y a la estación espacial internacional ( ISS ) en 2001 .
Estudió cómo los humanos se adaptan a sus habilidades motoras y cognoscitivas en astronautas sin peso y monitoreados desde tierra .
Más tarde , en la MIR , ella realizó experimentos en fisiología , biología de desarrollo , física y tecnología de fluidos , según la Agencia Europea Espacial . "
Más espantosamente , continúan indicando estos informes , fue que en cuestión de horas del supuesto intento de suicidio de la Dra .
Haigneré , su laboratorio , en el que ella trabajaba en la investigación de vanguardia de ADN Humano / Alienígena en el reconocido Instituto Pasteur fue destruído por el fuego como lo informa la Associated Press :
“ El miércoles estalló un incendio en un laboratorio de biología en el Instituto Pasteur de París , famoso por su lucha contra las enfermedades infecciosas dijeron los funcionarios .
No se reportaron víctimas y no resultaron afectados materiales sensibles ni virus por el fuego que fue extinguido por los bomberos , dijo un funcionario del Instituto .
El funcionario no estaba autorizado para dar su nombre según la política de la empresa .
La causa del incendio no está clara .
El fuego inició a media mañana en un nivel subterráneo de uno de los edificios en el campus del instituto en el sur de Paris , un laboratorio que lleva a cabo investigación en la biología del desarrollo , dijo el funcionario . ”
Los informes internos de las FSB sobre la Dra.
Haigneré señalan que desde su regreso del espacio se había convencido de que la Tierra había sido visitada en nuestro pasado histórico por ‘ astronautas antiguos ’ que no solamente habrían colonizado nuestro planeta sino que habrían diseñado genéticamente las entonces existentes formas de vida sub - humana con miras hacia nuestra actual raza humana .
Las creencias de la Dra.
Haigneré reflejan las del prominente escritor e investigador Israelí , Zecharia Sitchin , quien se reporta que “ les atribuye la creación de la antigua cultura Sumeria a los “ Annunaki ” ( o “ Nefilim ” ) una raza de alienígenas procedentes de un planeta que él llama Nibiru que él cree está en una órbita alargada elíptica en el propio sistema solar de la Tierra .
Sitchin asegura que la mitología Sumeria refleja esta perspectiva , aunque sus especulaciones son totalmente descontadas por los científicos , historiadores y arqueólogos de la tendencia principal de opinión , que ven muchos problemas con las traducciones de él de los textos antiguos y con su comprensión de la física ” .
Es interesante también observar la coincidencia del tiempo con el presunto intento de suicidio que llega justo con el momento exacto en que aumentan las preocupaciones sobre el aumento del despliegue de las fuerzas navales globales alrededor de la región del Medio Oriente donde se cree se ubicaba el antiguo Jardín del Edén , y que informamos en nuestra pieza del 12 de diciembre titulada : “ LA NAVEGACION MUNDIAL SE DETIENE AL PREPARARSE LAS ARMADAS MUNDIALES PARA UNA CONFRONTACION ‘SIN PRECEDENTES ”
" Las Fuerzas Navales Globales actualmente dirigiéndose , o ya dentro del Golfo de Adén , incluyen a ‘ amigos y enemigos ’ al igual que a los Estados Unidos , Irán , la China , Rusia , Alemania , la Unión Europea y la India , bajo lo que estos informes indican es la ‘ historia pantalla ’ de proteger a los corredores de navegación de esa región de los piratas que cuentan con respaldo Estadounidense y que operan en las costas de Somalia .
Las noticias actuales procedentes de esta región están apareciendo también para mostrar que las hostilidades ya han comenzado entre nuestras ‘ Fuerzas de la Defensa ’ de la Tierra y los Vigilantes pues el último intento de ataque de los Estados Unidos , solos , contra estos ‘ alienígenas ’ el pasado mes de enero , de nuevo , tuvo por resultado que los Vigilantes cortaran muchos de los cables submarinos de comunicación que yacen en los fondos marinos de esta región que ahora ya aislan a grandes partes del Medio Oriente y del subcontinente . "
Igualmente importante es observar que por primera vez en siglos , han dejado sus bases en su patria las naves de guerra Chinas para unirse al monumental esfuerzo internacional para confrontar lo que es visto como la más grave amenaza contra nuestro planeta , y que sobre el intento de confrontar una ‘ anomalía ’ bajo el mar en las costas de Papúa , Nueva Guinea , los pobladores reportaron el avistamiento de un OVNI como una nave ascendiendo rápidamente del océano y como de rayo hacia el cielo dejando tras de sí gigantescas crecidas que han dejado sin hogar a casi 32,000 personas a las que ya la ONU está enviando ayuda urgente .
Ante el catastrófico daño infligido sobre Papúa , Nueva Guinea la ONU está informando que “ las crecidas destruyeron casas , abastecimientos de alimentos y agua , dañaron cultivos y llevaron a la pérdida de herramientas de jardinería y cultivo ” .
Lo que la Dra.
Haigneré trataba de advertir al mundo no lo sabemos y no nos queda más que señalar que la conclusión obvia de que lo que sea que haya puesto a esta muy distinguida científica a tal grado de aflicción podría ser , en realidad , un preludio a más sucesos y hasta mucho más extraños listos para sobrecogernos en los días y meses por venir .

One in four births in the UK is by Caesarean Babies born by Caesarean section are more prone to developing asthma , say Dutch researchers .
In a study of almost 3,000 children , birth by Caesarean was associated with a 80 % increased risk of asthma by age eight compared with vaginal birth .
The association was even stronger in children whose parents had allergies , suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disease , it is reported in Thorax .
Previous research has linked Caesareans with the development of allergies .
In total , the team looked at 2,917 children , 247 of whom were born by caesarean .
The mother should be informed of the risk of asthma for her child , especially when the parents have a history of allergy or asthma
Dr Caroline Roduit Around 12 % of the children were diagnosed with asthma for which they were treated with inhaled steroids by the time they were eight years old .
The researchers found that the 9 % of children who had two allergic parents were almost three times more likely to be asthmatic by the time they were eight compared with children whose parents were not allergic .
Immunity Study leader , Dr Caroline Roduit , now based at the Children 's Hospital of Zurich , Switzerland , said rates of asthma had soared in industrialised countries in parallel with a rise in Caesarean section births , which have increased from 5 % in the 1970s to more than 30 % in 2000 .
She suggested that one reason for the association between Caesareans and asthma could be the priming of the immune system after birth .
Other research has shown babies born by Caesarean are not exposed to microbes as soon as babies born by vaginal delivery .
Previous studies in this area have produced conflicting results but the authors said the size of the study , the long monitoring period and and the definition of asthma to include inhaled steroids , strengthened the findings .
" The increased rate of Caesarean section is partly due to maternal demand without medical reason , " said Dr Roduit .
" In this situation the mother should be informed of the risk of asthma for her child , especially when the parents have a history of allergy or asthma . "
Dr Mike Thomas , chief medical adviser to the charity Asthma UK , said previous studies had also suggested that Caesarean section might increase the risk of asthma .
He said : " Sometimes a Caesarean section is needed for medical reasons , but where possible a natural birth is better . "

Fidel Castro had not been seen or heard of for five weeks Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has praised US President Barack Obama for his " honesty " but says he has many questions to answer .
Mr Castro broke a five - week silence , writing an opinion column on a state - run internet site .
The 82 - year - old 's silence , after months of column writing , had contributed to speculation about his health .
His brother , President Raul Castro , said earlier that Mr Obama " seemed like a good man " and wished him luck .
But he cautioned that the new US president might be raising " hopes too high " .
' Noble intentions ' Fidel Castro 's essay on the www.cubadebate.cu site came hours after the president denied rumours that his health was worsening .
He did not give any reason for not writing columns , or " reflections " as he calls them , since 15 December , after averaging nine a month in 2008 .
Mr Castro , whose Cuban revolution has survived 10 US presidents , had warm words for Mr Obama .
" I expressed that personally I had not the least doubt of the honesty with which Obama , the 11th president since 1 January , 1959 , expressed his ideas , but in spite of his noble intentions there remained many questions to answer , " he wrote .
Mr Obama has said he wants to meet Cuban leaders and improve US - Cuba relations .
He has indicated he will ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba but maintain the 46 - year US trade embargo on the island .
The Cuban president has also said he is willing to talk with Mr Obama , as long as there are no intermediaries and as equal parties to the dialogue .
If they met , it would be the first between leaders from the neighbouring nations in five decades .
Fidel Castro also confirmed that he had met Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner on Wednesday , near the end of her three - day visit to Havana .
President Fernandez said earlier that Mr Castro seemed healthy after she spent an hour of talks with him in Havana .
No pictures of the talks have yet been released .

KHARTOUM ( Reuters ) - Up to 6,000 child soldiers , some as young as 11 , have been recruited by rebels and government forces in Sudan ’s Darfur conflict , the United Nations said .

Youngsters have repeatedly been seen carrying weapons , even though Sudanese law and international agreements banned the use of children in conflicts , the head of the U.N. children ’s fund ( UNICEF ) in Sudan Ted Chaiban told reporters late on Monday .
Chaiban said UNICEF had evidence that all of Darfur ’s main rebel groups used children , including the powerful Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) and the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army led by Abdel Wahed Mohamed Ahmed al - Nur .
Government forces , including the army , the police , Darfur ’s Central Reserve Police and state - allied militias had also recruited under - 18s , Chaiban said .
“ All the armed factions and groups in Darfur have used children ...
We have seen children in uniform and children carrying weapons with virtually all the forces , ” he said .
“ An 11 - year - old in this sort of situation basically looses their childhood .
It dehumanizes them . ”
No one was immediately available for comment from Sudan ’s armed forces or Darfur ’s rebel groups .
U.N. agencies estimate more than four million people have been affected by almost six years of fighting in Darfur .
UNICEF says about half of those people are children .
“ Of those roughly 700,000 were born since 2004 , so all their life they have lived in an area that has been in conflict , ” Chaiban said .
One former rebel group had agreed to demobilize its first 16 child soldiers in January , after a campaign by local children ’s agencies and UNICEF , he said .
The faction of the Sudan Liberation Army led by Minni Arcua Minnawi -- the only rebel leader to sign a 2006 peace deal with Khartoum - had also identified another 100 to be released from military service later next year , he added .
Children ’s rights groups were now hoping to sign similar demobilization deals with insurgents and had already secured agreements from the government to release children from service .
Most of the child soldiers identified by UNICEF and other groups were aged between 15 and 17 , although some were as young as 11 , said Chaiban .
Not all of them were directly involved in fighting , but international agreements banned all use of under - 18s in conflict situations , even if they were only used as porters and in other support roles , Chaiban added .
UNICEF estimates there are a total of 8,000 child soldiers in Sudan , 6,000 in Darfur and the rest in southern Sudan -- which ended a two - decade civil war with the north in 2005 -- and the east of the country , the site of a low level insurgency against Khartoum .
Mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms against Khartoum in 2003 , accusing the government of neglecting the remote western region .
Sudan ’s government mobilized mostly - Arab militias to crush the Darfur revolt .
Sudan denies accusations by activists that state - backed militias carried out mass killings and rapes during the counter - insurgency .
Just wait until Lizard - Lincoln finds out about this and travels back in time to kick his robo-ass .

Twenty - Five Ways To Suppress Truth : The Rules of Disinformation ( Includes The 8 Traits of A Disinformationalist )
by H. Michael Sweeney copyright ( c ) 1997 , 2000 All rights reserved ( Revised April 2000 )
Built upon Thirteen Techniques for Truth Suppression by David Martin , the following may be useful to the initiate in the world of dealing with veiled and half - truth , lies , and suppression of truth when serious crimes are studied in public forums .
This , sadly , includes every day news media , one of the worst offenders with respect to being a source of disinformation .
Where the crime involves a conspiracy , or a conspiracy to cover up the crime , there will invariably be a disinformation campaign launched against those seeking to uncover and expose the truth and / or the conspiracy .
There are specific tactics which disinfo artists tend to apply , as revealed here .
Also included with this material are seven common traits of the disinfo artist which may also prove useful in identifying players and motives .
The more a particular party fits the traits and is guilty of following the rules , the more likely they are a professional disinfo artist with a vested motive .
People can be bought , threatened , or blackmailed into providing disinformation , so even “ good guys ” can be suspect in many cases .
Editor ’s Note :
This excellent article was posted at 911 blogger this weekend at “ Free ’s ” blog , and is followed by thoughtful , interesting comments and discussion .
( Follow Source link below article ) .
UPDATE 7/21/09 : A reader ’s excellent suggestions have been added at the end of this article .
A rational person participating as one interested in the truth will evaluate that chain of evidence and conclude either that the links are solid and conclusive , that one or more links are weak and need further development before conclusion can be arrived at , or that one or more links can be broken , usually invalidating ( but not necessarily so , if parallel links already exist or can be found , or if a particular link was merely supportive , but not in itself key to ) the argument .
The game is played by raising issues which either strengthen or weaken ( preferably to the point of breaking ) these links .
It is the job of a disinfo artist to interfere with these evaluations … to at least make people think the links are weak or broken when , in truth , they are not … or to propose alternative solutions leading away from the truth .
Often , by simply impeding and slowing down the process through disinformation tactics , a level of victory is assured because apathy increases with time and rhetoric .
It would seem true in almost every instance , that if one cannot break the chain of evidence for a given solution , revelation of truth has won out .
If the chain is broken either a new link must be forged , or a whole new chain developed , or the solution is invalid and a new one must be found … but truth still wins out .
There is no shame in being the creator or supporter of a failed solution , chain , or link , if done with honesty in search of the truth .
This is the rational approach .
While it is understandable that a person can become emotionally involved with a particular side of a given issue , it is really unimportant who wins , as long as truth wins .
But the disinfo artist will seek to emotionalize and chastise any failure ( real or false claims thereof ) , and will seek by means of intimidation to prevent discussion in general .
It is the disinfo artist and those who may pull their strings ( those who stand to suffer should the crime be solved ) MUST seek to prevent rational and complete examination of any chain of evidence which would hang them .
Since fact and truth seldom fall on their own , they must be overcome with lies and deceit .
Those who are professional in the art of lies and deceit , such as the intelligence community and the professional criminal ( often the same people or at least working together ) , tend to apply fairly well defined and observable tools in this process .
However , the public at large is not well armed against such weapons , and is often easily led astray by these time - proven tactics .
Remarkably , not even media and law enforcement have NOT BEEN TRAINED to deal with these issues .
For the most part , only the players themselves understand the rules of the game .
For such disinformationalists , the overall aim is to avoid discussing links in the chain of evidence which cannot be broken by truth , but at all times , to use clever deceptions or lies to make select links seem weaker than they are , create the illusion of a break , or better still , cause any who are considering the chain to be distracted in any number of ways , including the method of questioning the credentials of the presenter .
Please understand that fact is fact , regardless of the source .
Likewise , truth is truth , regardless of the source .
This is why criminals are allowed to testify against other criminals .
Where a motive to lie may truly exist , only actual evidence that the testimony itself IS a lie renders it completely invalid .
Were a known ‘ liar ’s ’ testimony to stand on its own without supporting fact , it might certainly be of questionable value , but if the testimony ( argument ) is based on verifiable or otherwise demonstrable facts , it matters not who does the presenting or what their motives are , or if they have lied in the past or even if motivated to lie in this instance — the facts or links would and should stand or fall on their own merit and their part in the matter will merely be supportive .
Moreover , particularly with respects to public forums such as newspaper letters to the editor , and Internet chat and news groups , the disinfo type has a very important role .
In these forums , the principle topics of discussion are generally attempts by individuals to cause other persons to become interested in their own particular position , idea , or solution — very much in development at the time .
People often use such mediums as a sounding board and in hopes of pollination to better form their ideas .
Where such ideas are critical of government or powerful , vested groups ( especially if their criminality is the topic ) , the disinfo artist has yet another role — the role of nipping it in the bud .
They also seek to stage the concept , the presenter , and any supporters as less than credible should any possible future confrontation in more public forums result due to their early successes .
You can often spot the disinfo types at work here by the unique application of “ higher standards ” of discussion than necessarily warranted .
They will demand that those presenting arguments or concepts back everything up with the same level of expertise as a professor , researcher , or investigative writer .
Anything less renders any discussion meaningless and unworthy in their opinion , and anyone who disagrees is obviously stupid — and they generally put it in exactly those terms .
So , as you read any such discussions , particularly so in Internet news groups ( NG ) , decide for yourself when a rational argument is being applied and when disinformation , psyops ( psychological warfare operations ) or trickery is the tool .
Accuse those guilty of the latter freely .
They ( both those deliberately seeking to lead you astray , and those who are simply foolish or misguided thinkers ) generally run for cover when thus illuminated , or — put in other terms , they put up or shut up ( a perfectly acceptable outcome either way , since truth is the goal . )
Here are the twenty - five methods and seven traits , some of which do n’t apply directly to NG application .
Each contains a simple example in the form of actual ( some paraphrased for simplicity ) from NG comments on commonly known historical events , and a proper response .[ examples & response - http://www.proparanoid.com/truth.html]
Accusations should not be overused — reserve for repeat offenders and those who use multiple tactics .
Responses should avoid falling into emotional traps or informational sidetracks , unless it is feared that some observers will be easily dissuaded by the trickery .
Consider quoting the complete rule rather than simply citing it , as others will not have reference .
Offer to provide a complete copy of the rule set upon request ( see permissions statement at end ) :
Twenty - Five Rules of Disinformation
Note :
The first rule and last five ( or six , depending on situation ) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply .
These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership , key players , or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up .
1 . Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil .
Regardless of what you know , do n’t discuss it — especially if you are a public figure , news anchor , etc .
If it ’s not reported , it did n’t happen , and you never have to deal with the issues .
2. Become incredulous and indignant .
Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme .
This is also known as the ‘ How dare you ! ’ gambit .
3. Create rumor mongers .
Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges , regardless of venue or evidence , as mere rumors and wild accusations .
Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well .
This method which works especially well with a silent press , because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such ‘ arguable rumors ’ .
If you can associate the material with the Internet , use this fact to certify it a ‘ wild rumor ’ from a ‘ bunch of kids on the Internet ’ which can have no basis in fact .
4 . Use a straw man .
Find or create a seeming element of your opponent ’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad .
Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent / opponent arguments / situation , or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges .
Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges , real and fabricated alike , while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues .
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule .
This is also known as the primary ‘ attack the messenger ’ ploy , though other methods qualify as variants of that approach .
Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as ‘ kooks ’ , ‘ right - wing ’ , ‘ liberal ’ , ‘ left - wing ’ , ‘ terrorists ’ , ‘ conspiracy buffs ’ , ‘ radicals ’ , ‘ militia ’ , ‘ racists ’ , ‘ religious fanatics ’ , ‘ sexual deviates ’ , and so forth .
This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label , and you avoid dealing with issues .
6. Hit and Run .
In any public forum , make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded , or simply ignore any answer .
This works extremely well in Internet and letters - to - the - editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism , reasoning — simply make an accusation or other attack , never discussing issues , and never answering any subsequent response , for that would dignify the opponent ’s viewpoint .
7. Question motives .
Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias .
This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive .
8. Invoke authority .
Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough ‘ jargon ’ and ‘ minutia ’ to illustrate you are ‘ one who knows ’ , and simply say it is n’t so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources .
9. Play Dumb .
No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered , avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility , make any sense , provide any proof , contain or make a point , have logic , or support a conclusion .
Mix well for maximum effect .
10 . Associate opponent charges with old news .
A derivative of the straw man — usually , in any large - scale matter of high visibility , someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with – a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained . )
Where it can be foreseen , have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans .
Subsequent charges , regardless of validity or new ground uncovered , can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues — so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source .
11 . Establish and rely upon fall - back positions .
Using a minor matter or element of the facts , take the ‘ high road ’ and ‘ confess ’ with candor that some innocent mistake , in hindsight , was made — but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which , ‘ just is n’t so . ’
Others can reinforce this on your behalf , later , and even publicly ‘ call for an end to the nonsense ’ because you have already ‘ done the right thing . ’
Done properly , this can garner sympathy and respect for ‘ coming clean ’ and ‘ owning up ’ to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues .
12 . Enigmas have no solution .
Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events , paint the entire affair as too complex to solve .
This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues .
13 . Alice in Wonderland Logic .
Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact .
14 . Demand complete solutions .
Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely , a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10 .
15 .
Fit the facts to alternate conclusions .
This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place .
16 . Vanish evidence and witnesses .
If it does not exist , it is not fact , and you wo n’t have to address the issue .
17 . Change the subject .
Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here , find a way to side - track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new , more manageable topic .
This works especially well with companions who can ‘ argue ’ with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues .
18 . Emotionalize , Antagonize , and Goad Opponents .
If you ca n’t do anything else , chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated , and generally render their material somewhat less coherent .
Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance , but even if their emotional response addresses the issue , you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘ sensitive they are to criticism . ’
19 .
Ignore proof presented , demand impossible proofs .
This is perhaps a variant of the ‘ play dumb ’ rule .
Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums , claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by ( it may exist , but not be at his disposal , or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld , such as a murder weapon . )
In order to completely avoid discussing issues , it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources , deny that witnesses are acceptable , or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance .
20 . False evidence .
Whenever possible , introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations — as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution .
This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose , and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications .
21 . Call a Grand Jury , Special Prosecutor , or other empowered investigative body .
Subvert the ( process ) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion .
Once convened , the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled .
For instance , if you own the prosecuting attorney , it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators .
Once a favorable verdict is achieved , the matter can be considered officially closed .
Usually , this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent , but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim .
22 . Manufacture a new truth .
Create your own expert(s ) , group (s ) , author (s ) , leader (s ) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific , investigative , or social research or testimony which concludes favorably .
In this way , if you must actually address issues , you can do so authoritatively .
23 . Create bigger distractions .
If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues , or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials , create bigger news stories ( or treat them as such ) to distract the multitudes .
24 . Silence critics .
If the above methods do not prevail , consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely .
This can be by their death , arrest and detention , blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information , or merely by destroying them financially , emotionally , or severely damaging their health .
25 . Vanish .
If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot , to avoid the issues , vacate the kitchen . .
Note :
There are other ways to attack truth , but these listed are the most common , and others are likely derivatives of these .
In the end , you can usually spot the professional disinfo players by one or more of seven ( now eight ) distinct traits :
Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist
by H. Michael Sweeney ( Revised April 2000 – formerly SEVEN Traits )
1 ) Avoidance .
They never actually discuss issues head - on or provide constructive input , generally avoiding citation of references or credentials .
Rather , they merely imply this , that , and the other .
Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility .
2) Selectivity .
They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully , either applying the hit - and - run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents , or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues .
Should a commentatorbecome argumentative with any success , the focus will shift to include the commentator as well .
3 ) Coincidental .
They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved .
They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern .
They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason , and vanish with the reason .
4) Teamwork .
They tend to operate in self - congratulatory and complementary packs or teams .
Of course , this can happen naturally in any public forum , but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved .
Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength .
5 ) Anti-conspiratorial .
They almost always have disdain for ‘ conspiracy theorists ’ and , usually , for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO .
Ask yourself why , if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists , do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies ?
One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic , or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain .
Or , one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do .
6 ) Artificial Emotions .
An odd kind of ‘ artificial ’ emotionalism and an unusually thick skin — an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance .
This likely stems from intelligence community training that , no matter how condemning the evidence , deny everything , and never become emotionally involved or reactive .
The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial .
Most people , if responding in anger , for instance , will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal .
But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the ‘ image ’ and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style .
It ’s just a job , and they often seem unable to ‘ act their role in character ’ as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face - to - face conversation / confrontation .
You might have outright rage and indignation one moment , ho - hum the next , and more anger later — an emotional yo - yo .
With respect to being thick - skinned , no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job , and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game — where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style , substance , and so forth , or simply give up .
7 ) Inconsistent .
There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self / motives .
This may stem from not really knowing their topic , or it may be somewhat ‘ freudian ’ , so to speak , in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within .
I have noted that often , they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author .
For instance , one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot , but blamed his poor communicating skills ( spelling , grammar , incoherent style ) on having only a grade - school education .
I ’m not aware of too many Navy pilots who do n’t have a college degree .
Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic / situation but later claimed first - hand knowledge of it .
8 ) BONUS TRAIT : Time Constant .
Recently discovered , with respect to News Groups , is the response time factor .
There are three ways this can be seen to work , especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation :
1 ) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response .
The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage .
SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT – FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR , or the visitor may be swayed towards truth .
2 ) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist , such as email , DELAY IS CALLED FOR – there will usually be a minimum of a 48 - 72 hour delay .
This allows a sit - down team discussion on response strategy for best effect , and even enough time to ‘ get permission ’ or instruction from a formal chain of command .
3 ) In the NG example 1 ) above , it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48 - 72 hours delay – the team approach in play .
This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth .
Thus , a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin .
I close with the first paragraph of the introduction to my unpublished book , Fatal Rebirth :
Truth cannot live on a diet of secrets , withering within entangled lies .
Freedom cannot live on a diet of lies , surrendering to the veil of oppression .
The human spirit cannot live on a diet of oppression , becoming subservient in the end to the will of evil .
God , as truth incarnate , will not long let stand a world devoted to such evil .
Therefore , let us have the truth and freedom our spirits require … or let us die seeking these things , for without them , we shall surely and justly perish in an evil world .
An interested reader who is also a donor to 911 Truth.org has a suggestion with respect to the pernicious presence of disinformation , and the aggressive and persistent efforts of “ disinfo specialists ” whose responsibility is to try to cloud issues , to disrupt discussions , to “ frighten ” people away from the web site or blog just as they might get interested in learning more about 9 - 11 Truth , or truth on other important issues .
The suggestion is very simple : Never , ever , respond to any of the points from what is obviously a post from a disinfo specialist .
That is , do not answer them .
Instead , simply provide more information about 9 - 11 Truth .
As an example , suppose your first post is about how Publisher ’s Weekly has chosen David Ray Griffin ’s book as “ web pick of the week ” with appropriate links , perhaps cutting and pasting the review verbatim .
Very soon , it is likely that a post will appear that provides no factual information , but has a great deal of “ noise ” in it .
Your next post , e.g , .
could then be a listing out of several 9 - 11 truth web sites , such as
Do n’t list all of them !
You could scare away novices to this area of truth .
The professional disinfo ‘ expert ’ will be non-plussed but he / she will try to draw you out again , with another posting , perhaps attacking you and in any case , again with a great deal of noise , but no factual content .
Of course , the best thing again is to avoid responding to anything said , and instead , your next posting could be , for instance ,
“ Recently formed 9 - 11 truth groups include medical professionals and religious leaders , web sites listed below .
Thus , our doctors and our religious leaders want truth about what happened with respect to the 9 - 11 crime . ”
* Medical Professionals for 9/11 Truth * Religious Leaders for 9/11 Truth
And so on .
Your next reply , again ignoring the noise and so on , could be about NYC CAN and about this 9/11 Truth site ( 911truth.org ) and so on .
Keep your messages brief .
Let your readers explore these sites , as they have powerful content .
Long - winded messages can also cause those who might otherwise develop an interest , to not delve more deeply .
Watch how quickly the disinfo experts stop posting .
Their goal is to disrupt , and if you use their postings to simply post more truth , they are not disrupting .
They will keep trying but they will become extremely frustrated .
Bottom line :
Never ever respond to a disinfo expert , but keep posting about the truth .
Best Boy
You thought : – The producer ’s gimp .
Actually : Responsible for running the rigging and lighting department , including crew hiring and schedules , liaising between the electrical crew and the other units on a film , booking rented lighting and grip equipment in and out , loading production trucks and setting up lighting .
Term dates back to the apprentice system .
Not always a boy .
The Gaffer You thought : – Vague authority figure – Some old guy .
Actually : Known sometimes as Chief Lighting Technician , the gaffer is the head of the electrical department and will oversee the construction of ( and often design ) practical lighting set -ups .
Works closely with the director of photography .
The term ‘ gaffer ’ is thought to derive from ‘ gaff poles ’ used to move a film studio ’s mirrored panels into usefully reflective positions back when movies could only be shot with available light .
The need to provide adhesion by wrapping the poles with tape is one possible explanation for the term ‘ gaffer ’s tape ’ .
Opposition to Same - Sex Marriage
In most contexts , opposing something means that someone holds unfavorable attitudes toward it .
In the case of activists , one may oppose something in the sense of trying to change it .
But in the context around same - sex marriage , opposition takes on a more specific meaning .
" Opposing same - sex marriage " in this context refers to not merely to one 's attitudes , or even the desire to change something , but also to legislation .
Opponents of same - sex marriage seek to prevent it from occurring through legal means .
They favor a definition of marriage that restricts it to something that a man and a woman do .
They commonly refer to this as necessary to protect " the traditional
This means that the statement " Ted opposes same - sex marriage " is equivalent to " Ted believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman and favors a legal ban on same - sex marriage . "
Does Opposing Same - Sex Marriage Make One a Bigot ?
Before responding , consider the following :

Regardless , they want to ban same - sex marriage .
This means that the statement " Ted opposes same - sex marriage " is equivalent to " Ted believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman and favors a legal ban on same - sex marriage .
" Before responding , consider the following :
Does opposing African American marriage ( i.e. , defining marriage as between two whites and seeking to prevent two consenting African Americans from being married on the grounds that they are African American ) make one a bigot ?
I think we can all agree that someone who opposed African American marriage is indeed a bigot .
The real question is why .
Could it be because we recognize that two consenting African American adults who wish to marry are no less deserving than two consenting white adults ?
Could it be because we have learned something since the civil rights movement whereby someone campaigning against African American marriage today would rightly be viewed as a racist ?
How about a different example ?
Does opposing atheist marriage ( i.e. , defining marriage as between two theists and seeking to prevent two consenting atheists from being married on the grounds that they are atheists ) make one a bigot ?
So does opposing same - sex marriage ( i.e. , defining marriage as between a man and a woman and seeking to prevent two consenting adults from being married on the grounds that they are of the same sex ) make one a bigot ?
Yes , it appears that it does .
Religion Enters And Things Get Messy
There is a reason that the debate over same - sex marriage has not gone away yet , and no , it is not simple homophobia .
The reason is religion .
You see , when opposition to same - sex marriage is clothed in religious garb , those who would normally recognize the inherent bigotry get nervous .
They do not want to be perceived as being intolerant to religion ( even as religion is intolerant of all sorts of things ) .
To call someone a bigot for campaigning against same - sex marriage is one thing ; to call someone a bigot for doing what the think their " holy " book tells them to do is something else .
Or at least , that is how many people feel .
We are so used to treating religious belief with kid gloves that many of us do not feel comfortable looking beyond it to the bigotry it shields .
Who knows , we might even be called bigots ourselves !
When opponents of same - sex marriage introduce religion into their arguments , they obfuscate the real issue ( i.e. , their bigotry ) to those who are convinced that religion must remain immune to criticism .
This is one reason why atheists can be useful allies for those in the LGBT community .
When religion enters the debate , those who want to ban same - sex marriage end up calling the rest of us bigots .
Why ?
Because we have the nerve to expect them to treat people equally !
Imagine that .
Subscribe to Atheist Revolution
Is this question any more difficult to answer than the previous example regarding African Americans ?
If so , why ?
Perhaps defining marriage as an agreement before some sort of god means that those who do not accept the reality of such a god have no business being married .
Even as we might be tempted to pursue such a line of argument , I think that most of us realize that we are most interested in marriage in the secular and contractual sense .
So does opposing same - sex marriage ( i.e. , defining marriage as between a man and a woman and seeking to prevent two consenting adults from being married on the grounds that they are of the same sex ) make one a bigot ?

Black Duck Software on Open Source Myths
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 09 , 2008
We 've covered Black Duck Software a few times before .
The company offers services for managed and secure implementations of open source software , and maintains a giant knowledgebase of over 170,000 open source projects .
It 's doing very well even in this economic environment , as seen in the story linked to above .
Today , the company sent along a collection of myths about open source , responses for which answer some interesting questions .
Is open source just source code ?
According to Black Duck : " Source code is actually only 15 % of what is released by open source developers .
There are four times as many binary files as source files in open source releases . "
This seems fairly obvious to me .
From documentation to scripts and more , open source is much more than source code .
Is open source adoption dominated mostly by application infrastructure ?
Here Black Duck 's software repository turns up an interesting finding that I 've known to be true for a long time .
Huge open source application infrastructure implementations in enterprises , such as Linux and MySQL , are only a fraction of overall adoption .
" The open source world is dominated by components , not fully formed applications , " says the report , and there 's no doubt about it .
Would a few billion lines of existing open source code be about right ?
Black Duck 's finding is that there are in fact tens of billions of lines of open source code online .
This lines up well with data I 've seen from the Linux Foundation about the number of lines of code in Linux distros alone .
Is the GPL Version 3 being ignored ?
Black Duck finds that GPL Version 3 , which has only been available since June 2007 , is more prevalent than the CPL , Mozilla , MIT and Apache licenses .
The company finds that about 70 percent of open source projects use a variant of the GPL license .
Here are a couple of graphics , courtesy of Black Duck , illustrating some of these findings :

GENEVA , Switzerland , Jan. 19 ( UPI ) --
The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at U.S. President George Bush is seeking political asylum in Switzerland , the man 's attorney said .
Muntadhir al - Zaidi , 29 , a correspondent for the al - Baghdadiya TV channel , shouted insults and threw his shoes -- considered an insult in Iraq -- at Bush during a news conference in Baghdad in mid-December .
Bush ducked to avoid the tossed footwear .
Advertisement
Mauro Poggia , al - Zaidi's attorney , said in the Swiss Tribune de Geneve newspaper that the journalist 's family contacted him and he sent a letter to the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs , asking Switzerland to grant the reporter political asylum , Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Monday .
Al - Zaidi " can no longer work as a journalist without suffering horrible pressure , " Poggia said .
" His life could become hell in his own country . "
The Iraqi journalist was subdued and escorted from the news conference and is being held in a jail in Baghdad .
He was charged with " aggressive actions toward a foreign official , " which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years .
I was bumping along Rangoon 's streets in a battered taxi when I saw the crowd , men and women wearing red armbands , most with heads bowed , looking uncomfortable , even frightened .
Any crowd in Burma 's old colonial capital is a rarity and I asked the driver who they were .
" NLD , " he muttered .
I asked him to stop and walked back up the street .
I had not noticed it before but tucked between two shops selling cheap wooden furniture is the office of the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , the party of Aung San Suu Kyi , the icon of Burmese democracy and political prisoner who remains confined to her decaying lakeside home on University Avenue , a mile or so away .
The NLD was the landslide winner of elections in 1990 , immediately annulled by the ruling military to keep themselves in power .
In the 18 intervening years , depressingly little has changed in Burma 's political landscape .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
U Hla Tin introduced himself as a member of parliament ( who has never taken up his seat ) and steered me through the overspill of NLD members on the pavement .
The crowd of about 80 people was braving not just the glare of Burma 's midday sun but the scrutiny of watching plain - clothed military intelligence officers across the street .
A recent flurry of lengthy jail sentences meted out to Burmese dissidents made their simple decision to come out to support their party a stunningly brave one .
In recent months , hundreds of activists , along with journalists , bloggers , a comedian and a hip hop star have been handed decades - long sentences and dispatched to remote jails across the Burmese gulag .
" Are n't you scared ? " I asked the MP .
" No , " he said with a smile .
" We do n't care . "
He and his colleagues had faced up to the worst that could happen to them , it seemed , and were no longer afraid .
Inside , in a gloomy shop - cum - house , with yellowing walls and ceiling fans whirring , it was hard to believe we were in the offices of the party which should be running a country of more than 50 million .
I was ushered to a plastic chair near the front .
U Hla Pe , a member of the NLD central executive committee , read dryly from a written speech calling for political prisoners to be released and for the junta to implement an urgent review of a new constitution which enshrines their role in any future elected government .
A woman in the audience , her greying hair pinned back , wiped away silent tears as she listened to demands that are unlikely ever to be met .
U Hla Pe finished , took a sip from his water glass , his hand shaking , and was helped down from the wooden podium .
He rejoined the NLD top brass seated behind him ; two rows of noble , elderly men , their political dreams reduced to empty protocol .
The NLD has been criticised for its lack of direction and new ideas .
Not surprising , given that most of its best political minds are behind bars .
And communication with Ms Suu Kyi , under house arrest , is impossible , said U Hla Tin .
" We do n't speak to her , we do n't hear from her , no no no , " he shook his head .
" How can we know what she 's thinking ? "
Rudderless and reduced by imprisonments , the remnants of Suu Kyi's party are trying to decide whether to contest elections set for 2010 .
There is almost no prospect of a fair vote , Burma 's generals will no doubt ensure that their puppet civilian organisation , the Union Solidarity and Development Association ( USDA ) will form the winning party .
But the NLD 's refusal to engage with the military 's stage - managed " road- map to democracy " means the party risks becoming isolated and irrelevant as the years tick by .
Some of Ms Suu Kyi's supporters want a change of tactic .
According to the online bulletins of Burma 's exiled opposition , calls for greater engagement in the military 's skewed political process are led by the veteran journalist and NLD executive U Win Tin , released in September after 19 years in jail .
Reports say pressure has been added by Western diplomats who have met privately with NLD leaders to urge them to participate .
But the party rank and file are circumspect .
" In the West you always talk of a level playing field , " said another disenfranchised MP .
" Here our game is played on the side of a mountain . "
They streamed out of the meeting , walking in pairs or small groups to catch an ancient bus or taxi home .
They kept their heads down , with wary sideways glances at the men across the street .
For two years , Bart McIntyre was deeply involved in the insignificant , thinly populated white supremacist movement .
Though it may be difficult to believe , this actually represented something of an improvement in McIntyre ’s social circle , since his paying job was a position in one of our country ’s most repellent criminal syndicates , the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , Explosives , and Persecution of Unsanctioned Political and Religious Minorities ( or ATF , for the sake of convenience ) .
Unsavory as their personal beliefs may be , most adherents of the white supremacist movement actually work for a living , unlike the tax - engorged parasites of the ATF .
Tiny though that sub-population is , I ’ll bet that less than one of every 1,000 white supremacists ever commits a crime against the person or property of another human being .
The core mission of the ATF , on the other hand , is to commit various kinds of aggression against gun owners and other harmless people , and the agency is indelibly tainted by its role in the 1993 mass murder at Mt. Carmel .
But this is simply the predictable fruit of a very evil tree .
The ATF ’s progenitors were the properly despised 18th - century “ Revenuers ” whose haughty impositions helped precipitate the Whiskey Rebellion ; the agency also played a key federal enforcement role during the demented quasi-puritanical social experiment called “ Prohibition . ”
In that role the agency ’s immediate ancestor was an appendage of the federal Bureau of Internal Revenue , as the IRS was known at the time .
It was only with the enactment of the Nazi- derived U.S. Gun Control Act of 1968 ( the German National Socialist pedigree of that measure has been capably documented by Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership ) that the ATF blundered into its present role as chief persecutor of law - abiding gun owners and firearms dealers .
So it was in his day job as an ATF Special Agent , rather than his part - time deployment undercover in the white supremacist milieu , that McIntyre forged his connections with those devoted to keeping Nazi ideals alive .
As he prepares to retire , McIntyre has taken the opportunity to warn that the ongoing economic collapse may re-invigorate the moribund white supremacist movement .
“ In society , you have a very small number of people who are going to push the envelope and take it to the next step ” beyond grievance and intemperate talk and into criminal violence .
This is emerging as a standard narrative among federal law enforcement agencies :
A plummeting economy + the election of a black president = a racist renaissance and a surging tide of hate crimes .
The Regime ’s publicity arm has already treated the public to several variations on that theme , even though the evidence to support it is thin to the point of translucency .
The point of all this is not to address a plausible threat , of course , but rather to provide the proper reductionist framing device so that any tremor of organized resistance to Obama ’s Neo - New Deal can be interpreted in terms of racial resentments .
Given the prominence of federal informant / provocateurs among white supremacist groups it ’s quite likely that federal seed money is the only thing keeping that movement alive ; it ’s simply too useful an antagonist for the Feds to permit it to die outright .
The political conquest of America by white supremacist ideology is about as likely a prospect as a winning streak by the Washington Generals .
This does n’t prevent collectivists of a certain ilk — Philip Roth being a suitably loathsome exemplar — from peddling the notion that America must always be caught up in a foreign war or similar undertaking in order to domesticate the white population ’s resilient racism and direct it outward , rather than letting it coalesce into an American Reich .
People preoccupied with such concerns do n’t object to the mechanisms of fascist rule ; they simply prefer that those mechanisms be controlled by , and for the benefit of , their faction .
Ironically , or perhaps not , the incipient Obama Regime seems prepared to consolidate many of the fascist - flavored innovations of its predecessor .
One very interesting illustration of this continuity is the apparent selection of Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano to serve as the next Commissar for Homeland Security .
Napolitano , who first attracted public attention in 1991 as a legal adviser to Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings , is widely perceived as a mildly “ progressive ” Democrat .
But in her career in Arizona , first as a federal attorney and then as Governor , she has displayed an uncanny ability to exploit the racially charged issue of immigration for her political advantage .
Michael Lacey , publisher of the Phoenix New Times , refers to Napolitano ’s career as a “ cocktail of mediocrity , ” made up of roughly equal parts of incompetence and “ rank opportunism . ”
As a state bordering Mexico , Arizona has a very large population of immigrants , both those who arrived through legal channels and those who did n’t .
It also has a very large and politically organized constituency for immigration reform .
Most — actually , nearly all — Arizonans concerned about unchecked immigration are entirely innocent of racial prejudice .
A handful are entirely consumed by it .
And the state ’s most successful politician has ruthlessly capitalized on the issue as a way to deflect public attention from his spectacular incompetence and unvarnished corruption , and the cost those attributes have imposed on the taxpayers .
The politician in question is Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who would likely be in prison were it not for a favor done long ago by Janet Napolitano .
As the elected head of the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ( MCSO ) , Arpaio has cultivated a media image as “ America ’s Toughest Sheriff . ”
He has made himself famous by creating and maintaining a county detention system in which various forms of petty belittlement — such as forcing male inmates to wear pink underwear and eat green bologna — are inflicted on the inmates , most of whom have yet to be convicted of an actual crime .
Both male and female detainees are forced to work on chain gangs , and those consigned to Arpaio ’s “ Tent City ” are deliberately exposed to extremes of climate , which in Arizona can mean temperatures in excess of 110 degrees .
( Arpaio seems to take a perverse pleasure in making life especially difficult for female inmates :
Until a federal lawsuit forced him to stop , he maintained a jail netcam broadcasting female detainees using the toilet .
That fact provides a certain nauseating subtext to Arpaio ’s publicly expressed desire to have authorities in L.A. extradite Paris Hilton to Arizona to serve out her jail term for DUI - related offenses . )
During the past decade , while Arpaio has labored to make himself a household name , people have been dying in the custody of his deputies .
Lawsuits resulting from the death of inmates at the hands of Arpaio ’s brown - shirted homeboys have cost the county more than $ 13 million in legal settlements , and a five - fold increase in insurance premiums .
Last September , the National Commission on Correctional Health Care revoked its accreditation of the MCSO jails owing to Arpaio ’s refusal to provide adequate health care to inmates .
The following month , U.S. District Judge Neal Wake ( a George W. Bush appointee ) , ruled that the MCSO detention system violated legal standards of inmate treatment .
Both the revocation and Judge Neal ’s ruling will probably result in additional lawsuits .
In 1996 , four years after Arpaio was first elected and while Janet Napolitano served as a Clinton - appointed federal prosecutor in Arizona , a petty drug offender named Scott Norberg was attacked and beaten to death by nearly a dozen county correctional officers .
Much of the lethal violence was committed while Norberg was shackled to a torture device called a “ restraint chair ” : Bound and unable to defend himself , Norberg was beaten by the brave men of the MCSO until he died .
Arpaio did n’t order the murder of Scott Norberg , but he was deeply involved in the cover -up .
“ Notes taken the night of the killing were destroyed , ” writes Phoenix New Times ’ Michael Lacey .
“ Critical X - Rays were destroyed .
County authorities , under the watchful eye of the sheriff , hid the fact that Norberg ’s larynx was fractured . ”
What evidence did exist was forwarded to the FBI .
The Norberg family ’s attorney , Michael Manning , provided Napolitano — by way of her assistant US attorneys — with much of the evidence that had been suppressed by the MCSO .
And that ’s where the case died .
Before the investigation found traction , Napolitano was dismissive of Arpaio ’s critics , insisting that he ran “ a strict jail but a safe one . ”
The Justice Department ’s final report , which was issued two years after Napolitano punted on the issue , fleshed out the skeletal term “ strict ” in interesting ways , noting that excessive and abusive use of force was common and often involved unjustified use of restraint chairs , hog-tying and beating of inmates , and other forms of deadly restraint .
The report likewise scored Arpaio ’s staffing decisions , which left the jail “ below levels needed for safety and human operations . ”
The Justice Department , as former Arizona Republic reporter Tom Zoellner pointed out in Slate , “ filed suit and settled with the sheriff the same day ” in exchange for promises of various reforms .
Napolitano was at Arpaio ’s side when the sheriff called a press conference to call the settlement a personal vindication .
Napolitano , recall , had been handed clear evidence of murder committed under Arpaio ’s authority , and a criminal conspiracy led by his office cover up that crime ; she simply threw it out and refused to prosecute .
The Sheriff would eventually reciprocate by crossing party lines to support Napolitano ’s subsequent political career , first endorsing her bi to become state attorney general and , in 2002 , throwing his support to her in a gubernatorial race that was decided by a handful of votes .
But this was the least Arpaio could do for the woman whose malfeasance of office not only saved his career , but probably kept him out of prison .
In 2005 , Napolitano became the first governor to sign what is called a 287 ( g ) agreement with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ( ICE ) — the component of the Homeland Security Department in charge of border enforcement .
Agreements of that kind permit state and local law enforcement agencies to take the lead in border enforcement .
And this handed Arpaio a new use for his Tent City :
It could now hold immigrants collected during high - profile sweeps conducted by Arpaio ’s office , in which people of Mexican ancestry — citizens , legal residents , and illegal immigrants alike — are subject to pretext stops and searches by MCSO deputies .
These anti-immigrant sweeps are hugely popular with a large segment of Arizona ’s electorate .
It ’s likely that the popularity of the sweeps would suffer somewhat were the public adequately informed of one very troubling cost incurred by them .
A recent study by the Goldwater Institute entitled “ Mission Unaccomplished : The Misplaced Priorities of the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ” documents that Arpaio ’s project of turning the MCSO into an immigration control agency has effectively crippled it as a law enforcement entity .
“ MCSO ’s massive diversion of resources into policing illegal immigration … coincides with growing rates of violent crimes , plummeting arrest rates , and increased response time to citizens ’ calls for help , ” notes the report .
“ At the same time , [ an investigation done by the Arizona Republic newspaper ] found that crime rates in areas that were the subject of saturation [ immigration ] raids were largely unchanged after the sweeps . ”
Arpaio ’s office is the depository for all warrants issued to law - enforcement agencies in Maricopa County .
As of September 2008 , 77,949 warrants were outstanding , including 42,297 felony warrants .
Many , perhaps most , of the felony charges dealt with violent crimes against persons and property .
The soi-disant “ toughest sheriff ” in the land boldly sends his deputies to drag Mexican mothers from their cars while their children scream in terror , and deploys paramilitary units to seize janitors while their children scream in terror , or their jobs at Mesa City Library or City Hall .
Meanwhile , actual violent criminals remain free and the crime rate continues to climb — and Arpaio capitalizes on that latter fact by describing it as a product of unrestricted immigration , rather than a reflection of his own politically opportunistic priorities .
Two recent developments prompted Arpaio to discover , however tardily , the merit of enforcing felony warrants .
The first was Napolitano ’s grudging decision to withhold some state funding from the MCSO until something was done to address the backlog of outstanding warrants .
The second was the development of a “ reality television program ” featuring the MCSO entitled “ Smile !
You ’re Under Arrest . ”
The program — a product the Fox network , natch — features people subject to felony warrants ( involving non-violent offenses for the most part ) being “ punk ’d ” through elaborate on - camera ruses before being arrested .
The process is long , expensive , needlessly complicated , and self - indulgent .
To Arpaio , an insatiable publicity whore who cannot resist an opportunity to thrust his unsightly mug in front of a camera , the opportunity to star in his own television show outweighed any practical liabilities .
Endlessly vain and incurably power - intoxicated , Arpaio does n’t venture out in public without being surrounded by a phalanx of grim - faced bodyguards .
This is supposedly made necessary because of purported death threats received by the sheriff , at least one of which was a “ bomb threat ” that was actually contrived by the Sheriff ’s Office itself .
In October 2007 , Arpaio sent his Selective Enforcement Unit to arrest Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin , the owners of the Phoenix New Times , which has produced a steady stream of critical stories examining the sheriff ’s empire of authoritarian corruption .
Lacey and Larkin were charged with publicizing secret grand jury proceedings by publicizing a subpoena they had received from the local prosecutor , a priggish authoritarian and Arpaio ally named Andrew Thomas , that demanded , inter alia , “ Every note , tape , and record from every story written about Sheriff Arpaio by every reporter over a period of years ” as well as “ detailed information on anyone who has looked at the New Times Web site since 2004 ” as well as every individual “ individual who looked at any story , review , listing , classified , or retail ad [ in the publication ] over a period of years . ”
All of this was part of a campaign of official harassment and intimidation provoked by a New Times investigation into Arpaio ’s personal real estate holdings .
One story published by the paper gave Arpaio ’s home address , thereby supposedly posing “ a serious and imminent threat ” to his personal safety .
The charges against Lacey and Larkin were dropped , and the New Times is pursuing a lawsuit against the rogue sheriff and his ally in the County Prosecutor ’s office .
Arpaio continues to use the powers of his office to punish and intimidate his critics , whether this involves threatening to arrest reporters for seeking public records about the MCSO or arresting citizens who politely applaud his critics during meetings of the County Board of Supervisors .
( People who applauded other speakers at the same event were left unmolested by Arpaio ’s minions . )
Arpaio ’s preferred tactic is to file “ disorderly conduct ” charges against people who confront or criticize him or his office ; in fact , he ’s been captured on video trying to provoke a citizen into some act , gesture , or vocal inflection that could be construed as “ disorderly ” :

New Mexicans for Science and Reason presents " A Pilot 's View ( on Chemtrails ) " by Ian Wickson Chemtrails ??
I have recently become interested in the chemtrail controversy  to which much web space is currently dedicated .
I must admit , I have certain reservations regarding the validity of the many assertions I have read and interpretations of the photos I have seen .
I hold a private pilot license and , as a pilot , I have a rudimentary understanding of meteorology and the formation of clouds and  contrails  ( condensation trails ) produced by aircraft .
Much of the chemtrail evidence  I have seen does not mesh with solid scientific facts I have been taught as a pilot .
Contrails vs. sprayed agents
First , let s establish how a normal contrail is formed .
When burned , fuel containing hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the air to form water vapor , among other byproducts .
Under certain conditions , that vapor will condense to form a visible trail  an artificial cloud , for all intents and purposes .
Because the high temperature of the exhaust gas keeps the water in a vapor state until it has a chance to mix with the colder surrounding air , this artificial cloud will always form some distance behind the aircraft , rather than directly aft of the engines .
If atmospheric conditions support a persistent  contrail , it will most likely become more visible and spread to a more natural cloud - like state with distance from the aircraft .
If an aircraft were spraying some form of liquid or powdered solid , such as bacterial agents or aluminum particulates as suggested by many theorists , it should be most visible directly behind the trailing edge of the wing ( or wherever the nozzles may be located ) , becoming less visible as it dissipates in the atmosphere in the wake of the plane .
This is exactly what you would observe when watching a crop duster .
Yet , in every photo of an aircraft producing a chemtrail  I have seen , the opposite is true .
They all look like normal contrails .
Having said that , it is possible to make a sprayed agent behave as a contrail .
In the case of a liquid , it would have to be heated to the point of vaporization , so that the vapor would re-condense in a manner consistent with a normal contrail  some distance behind the aircraft .
If the liquid were used as a medium for biological agents , the temperature required would most likely kill the microbes .
If the high vapor temperature didnt do the job , then the extremely low temperature of the surrounding atmosphere just might .
Assuming these biological agents survived the hostile environment , they would tend to have a very slow rate of descent back to earth due to their microscopic size .
( Microscopic dust from volcanoes is known to remain in the upper atmosphere for years after an eruption . )
In all likelihood , atmospheric disturbances would scatter them and they wouldnt even land in the area they were released .
All in all , this seems an inefficient method of bombing  the population with any type of harmful agents , if that is the intent .
A reliable method would be to release the agents at very low altitudes , as is done by fire suppression aircraft and crop dusters .
Yet , no one seems to be presenting any evidence that this is indeed the case .
 Grids in the sky
Many theorists have used the observation of chemtrail grids ,  or crosshatched contrail patterns as evidence that aircraft are blanketing target areas with sprayed agents .
To prove this , they would need two things .
One : video or photographic evidence of aircraft emitting materials in a manner inconsistent with normal contrails , as described above .
Two : video evidence of a single aircraft making multiple passes over an area consistent with the formation of the grid pattern .
It would be helpful if we could actually see evidence of the spray nozzles being turned on and off during the maneuvers .
So far , I have seen no such videos , and none of the photos I have seen prove that this is the case .
All I have seen are photos of a few parallel trails and perhaps one intersecting trail .
( Why didnt the photographers wait until the aircraft had completed real grids  and photograph those ? )
In fact , there is a reasonable explanation for the formation of these parallel lines .
Aircraft flying above 18,000 feet are required to be on an instrument flight plan . 
As such , they often follow federal airways  designed for the separation and management of air traffic  especially in the vicinity of hub airports .
Aircraft en route to the same destination are likely to be following one another on the same airway .
Think of these as highways in the sky .
Heres what happens .
Aircraft A is traveling along airway XYZ , leaving a contrail behind .
Several minutes later , aircraft B follows on the same airway , tracking the exact same line over the surface of the earth .
It is also leaving a contrail .
However the air mass is in motion due to wind aloft , which carries the first contrail away from its original location .
The result is the contrail from aircraft B appears as a line parallel to that of aircraft As contrail .
Enter aircraft C , D , and E following the same airway .
You now have five parallel lines .
Add aircraft F , traveling a course perpendicular to the others , and you have the beginnings of a grid .
Another predictable multiple contrail pattern is that of a  V . 
Again , assume the air mass is in motion , carrying the contrails away from their original locations .
Aircraft alternately departing and arriving at the same hub , and following the same airway ( at differing altitudes , of course ) would produce this effect as their contrails alternately converge and diverge .
I believe this is what is shown in the various satellite photos that appear on many web sites , but are misinterpreted as evidence of chemtrail grids . 
Intermittent chemtrails 
There is no hard and fast rule regarding the elevation at which an aircrafts engines will produce contrails .
Furthermore , there are a variety of atmospheric conditions , such as ambient temperature , relative humidity , concentration of dust particles and winds aloft that will affect how the trail behaves once it is produced .
For instance , contrails tend to persist when produced in areas of high relative humidity and low temperatures , while they dissipate quickly in the presence of warmer , drier air .
Descending air currents found in wind shear conditions can carry the aircrafts exhaust gases to lower elevations and warmer temperatures where the moisture will vaporize , rendering it invisible .
The portion of the contrail on the other side of the shear will remain in conditions that support its persistence .
This accounts for breaks in visible contrails , which some have theorized indicates the spray nozzles have been turned off .
 Chemtrail generators 
A 1974 patent awarded to the Navy for an aircraft - mounted device designed to disperse microscopic titanium oxide particles into the air has been circulating about the web .
This is used as evidence of military involvement in the proliferation of chemtrails . 
Again , other explanations are available .
Ive read the patent document , and it clearly states that the device is intended to replace smoke - oil injection systems used on aircraft exhaust systems to generate a smoke trail .
Anyone who has been to an air show or seen skywriting has witnessed the use of smoke - oil systems .
In this case , it seems the device was invented to allow a towed target glider ( which has no hot exhaust system with which to generate smoke ) to leave a visible trail for purposes of target identification .
Since this system generates no smoke ,  it seems they replaced the words  smoke trail with contrail . 
Ive looked into the noxious nature of the chemicals referenced in the document .
DuPont R-931 is the identification number given to a highly reflective paint pigment made of titanium oxide .
DuPont lists applications for this particular pigment in both indoor and outdoor latex paints .
It seems we are all exposed to this chemical on a daily basis .
Yet none of the chemtrail proponents call for a reform in the paint industry .
Nor are they warning us that the very walls of our houses contain the same chemical the government is secretly dropping on our heads .
Why ?
Probably because it has none of the detrimental qualities they claim .
According to the chemical manufacturer , LabKorea ( http://www.labkorea.com),
 The colloidal silica is available for various applications such as fiber , sizing , diazo papers manufactures , cellophane film , precision casting , ceramics , glass fiber , paints , catalysts , batteries , wax , optics , elastomer , food , health care , industrial chromatography and polishing .
Again , it would seem we are exposed to this chemical frequently .
And finally , the silica gel .
This is a drying agent used quite commonly in food packaging .
Next time you open a refrigerated pasta product , look for a packet of the stuff glued inside the packaging .
How harmful can it be ?
If this device were actually in use for clandestine purposes , the contrail  it produced would be visible immediately aft of the aircraft .
Again , all the photos I have seen show a normal contrail becoming visible a significant distance behind the plane .
I believe this patent presents evidence of an alternative method of generating air show smoke , not government involvement in the bombardment of citizens with noxious substances .
Other metals in the air
During the Viet Nam era , fighter pilots were vulnerable to radar and infrared guided surface - to - air missiles .
To address this threat , a program known as  Wild Weasel was started .
It involved equipping various fighter aircraft with infrared and radar countermeasures , which included advanced air - to - ground missiles , infrared flares and radar - reactive chaff delivery systems .
Chaff is the term used to describe the tiny silicate / metallic particles deployed by military aircraft for the purpose of confusing the enemys radar and preventing them locking onto the aircraft .
Because its important to use material with a low molecular weight to maximize the time the chaff remains suspended in the air , aluminum is most commonly used .
Chaff is deployed in small packages which then burst open in the planes wake , creating an aircraft - sized false radar signature .
What would happen if aircraft were deploying continuous streams of chaff and creating grids of the stuff , as claimed by some chemtrail theory proponents ?
Think about it .
Radar used by air traffic controllers would be rendered useless .
They would be unable to distinguish between real airplanes and the ghost images created by the chaff .
Not a likely scenario .
What has happened to our normal clouds ?
This question is posed by many conspiracy theory proponents , and answered with supposed effects of chemtrails . 
If the appearance of our skies has changed in the last decade or so , there may be a less sinister explanation .
The overall effect may be attributable to a combination of the following changing conditions .
Global warming means generally warmer air temperatures in the upper atmosphere .
Warmer air has the ability to hold more moisture in vapor form .
On days when the atmosphere in a given region and at normal flight elevations is supersaturated ( a condition wherein the relative humidity is at or above 100 % , but clouds have not formed due to lack of solid particles for moisture to condense with , or insufficiently low temperatures to cause water vapor to sublimate directly into ice crystals ) , it may take as few as one or two aircraft flying through to trigger widespread formation of cirrus clouds .
This can happen one of two ways , or as a combined effect of the two .
In addition to water vapor , jet exhaust contains carbon particles commonly referred to as soot . 
These particles make an excellent surface for moisture to condense upon , thus creating a visible cloud that spreads horizontally in the wake of the plane .
The other effect is a byproduct of the aerodynamic forces that cause the wing to create lift .
Aircraft wings are curved more on the top surface than on the bottom .
This causes the air traveling across the top surface to speed up , reducing its density and pressure .
The air on the bottom side maintains normal , ambient pressure .
The net effect is an area of relatively high pressure on the bottom , accompanied by relatively low pressure on the top surface of the wing .
Thus , lift is produced .
The reduced air pressure above the wing is always accompanied by a momentary reduction in air temperature .
( If interested , consult the ideal gas law , PV=NrT to prove this fact . )
Under supersaturated conditions , this downward spike in temperature is sufficient to cause water vapor to sublimate into ice crystals .
The ice crystals , themselves , then become surfaces for more moisture to condense upon , creating a more and more dense cloud spreading in the wake of the plane .
Global warming , rather than chemtrails  as some theorize , may also be to blame for drought conditions in some areas and flooding in others .
As stated earlier , warmer air has the ability to hold more moisture than cooler air .
In the case of drought , this warmer air may be retaining moisture it would normally have dropped in the form of precipitation under our previously cooler global environment .
In the case of flooding , the opposite is happening .
When atmospheric conditions cause the formation of precipitation , the warmer , post - global - warming , air contains more moisture to release .
Thus the rainfall is heavier than it would have been under our previously cooler conditions , causing flooding .
And yet another possible explanation for increased high - altitude cloudiness : higher concentrations of particulates in the upper atmosphere for moisture to condense upon .
Every year , we put more and more automobiles on the road which produce more and more particulate emissions .
Increases in air travel have the same effect .
Volcanic activity is on the rise , as is the destruction and burning of rainforests .
Drought ridden areas are experiencing unprecedented forest fire activity .
One would have to surmise that the concentrations of particulates in the atmosphere are higher now than they were a decade ago .
More particulates = more condensation points for moisture = increased cloudiness .
Could a mass psychological effect be in play ?
Blaming the government for our every woe seems to be in vogue at the moment .
Im not saying it is nt warranted in many situations .
( Personally , I dont agree with invading Iraq to protect our oil - hungry lifestyle , and I think the Federal Reserve is unconstitutional .
But , I digress . )
However , this practice has become a catch - all drawer for our societal problems .
As the greatest consumers on the face of the earth , and with much of our wealth coming at the expense of the environment , I dont see how Americans could not experience a certain amount of guilt  at a subconscious level , at least .
We see our little planet changing before our eyes , and must know we carry a great deal of the blame .
But , that s a hard thing to own .
So we look for a scapegoat  the government .
We look at the sky , and it looks different .
In our hearts , we know why .
But , we cant accept our own role .
The government must be to blame .
They are bombarding their own people with noxious substances .
Why ?
To cull the population ?
( But , what will happen to their economic machine if they reduce the number of consumers ? )
To test the effects of biological agents ?
( Dont they have laboratory animals for that ?
And , think of the cost to the government of a class action lawsuit . )
Weather control experiments ?
( Maybe .
It s a fact that cloud seeding operations are conducted to induce precipitation .
But that s a far cry from manipulating the weather on a global level .
And last time I checked , rain wasnt known to be particularly harmful to humans . )
Global warming is happening .
Weather patterns are changing .
Through scientific evidence , the reasons are becoming clearer .
The answer is also clear  we must look to clean , renewable energy sources .
We cant burn petroleum forever .
We can no longer support the destruction of rainforests for cheap lumber and beef .
The day will come when we must change our habits .
With change comes uncertainty , and that scares us to death .
We want the good life weve become accustomed to .
We dont want to change .
We re afraid of economic changes that will surely accompany a change in the very base of our energy system  petroleum .
And we certainly dont want to face the possibility of paying more for the resources we need to live .
Rather than confronting to our problems and initiating the changes we know must come , we support environmentally destructive business as usual at an ever increasing rate .
What should we really be concerned about ?
In truth , the exhaust gases and contrails produced by aircraft do have an effect on our environment , but probably not because they contain the clandestine substances chemtrail proponents believe .
The chemicals that exist in contrails are the same ones produced by our automobiles  hydrocarbons , carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , and various oxides of nitrogen .
All of these substances are known to have an effect on air quality and chemistry .
The scary thing is that aircraft emit these chemicals in large quantities miles up in the stratosphere .
There are solutions .
Reducing these chemical emissions would call for major changes in the way the airline industry operates their aircraft .
One solution would be to retrofit airliners to run on liquid hydrogen .
Doing so would eliminate the introduction of hydrocarbons , CO and CO² into our upper atmosphere .
Unfortunately , the nitrous oxide problem would remain .
In addition , the cost of this conversion would be substantial .
That cost would ultimately be passed on to consumers through elevated ticket prices .
So much for cheap travel .
There would also be the problem of educating travelers .
People hear hydrogen ,  and immediately think they would be flying around in H - bombs or Hindenburgs .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
Are consumers ready and willing to accept these changes ?
I would guess not .
We re talking about change , and nobody wants that .
We might have to give up a little piece of the good life .
Are chemtrails  real ?
It s entirely possible .
In concluding this lengthy dissertation , I have to admit I cant disprove their existence .
My point is simply this : proponents of the chemtrail theory have failed to produce a smoking gun . 
There are logical and believable explanations for all the evidence 
I have seen .
No truly damning evidence seems to exist  or if it does , it s lost in a sea of inconclusive theory , conjecture and photos of normal contrails and meteorological events .

If you write anything critical of Israel ’s actions in the West Bank , you ’re immediately inundated with letters complaining about Hamas .
“ Hamas is a death cult , ” these letters run .
“ They ’re religious fanatics .
They use children as human shields .
How can you defend Hamas ? ”
Along these lines , in a widely noted New York Times op -ed Jeffrey Goldberg argues that the US and Israel should try to strengthen the secular Palestinian party Fatah and work to weaken Hamas .
Yet it ’s worth reminding ourselves in the not too distant past , the exact opposite strategy was followed .
In the 1970s both the United States and Israel thought that secular left - wing Arab nationalism was a bigger threat than religious fundamentalism .
For that reason , Israel worked strongly to empower Hamas and undermine Fatah .
In his 2006 book The Iron Cage , historian Rashid Khalidi describes “ the transformation of the Palestinian branch of Muslim Brotherhood and its offsprings , Hamas , from the protégés of the Israeli occupation into Israel ’s fierce enemy . ”
As Khalidi notes , “ For well over two decades after the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 , Israel … [used ] the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoot Hamas in Gaza as a counterweight to the nationalist Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) .
This reached the point where the Israeli military occupation encouraged Brotherhood thugs to intimidate PLO supporters . ”
Khalidi ’s account is bolstered by a 2006 article a 2006 article by United Press International Reporter Richard Sale which offer details on the Israel / Hamas collaboration :
Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat , but , according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials , beginning in the late 1970s , Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years .
Israel “ aided Hamas directly — the Israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the PLO ( Palestinian Liberation Organization ) , ” said Tony Cordesman , Middle East analyst for the Center for Strategic Studies .
Israel ‘s support for Hamas “ was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong , secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative , ” said a former senior CIA official .
So basically we see a see - saw policy : support Hamas one day to weaken Fatah , support Fatah the next day to weaken Hamas .
In the larger scheme of things , all these policy shifts make perfect sense : they are part of the long - standing imperialist tradition of divide - and - conquer .
It ’s the inability to see Israel as following an imperialist strategy that prevents a true understanding of what ’s happening now .
Through the streets of Jabaliya refugee camp , the nauseous smell of burning tyres mixes with the sickening smell of singed flesh .
Houses gutted by bombs teeter on their foundations .
Ambulances race through the camp , sirens screaming as they collect the critically injured and random body parts strewn around the streets .
Electricity no longer functions .
Clean water is scarce .
Families crouch in cubbyholes and makeshift shelters , huddled around small handheld radios , listening , praying , hoping for an end .
This is Israel 's " Hot Winter " , its latest intensified assault on the people of Gaza and its most recent attempt to rout Hamas .
At Jabaliya 's Kamal Adwan Hospital , a steady stream of wounded pour in , the lucky still in possession of life and limbs .
Frantic family members vie for attention from exhausted emergency staff .
An ambulance arrives .
Inside a man clings to life , though much of his skin has been plastered on the streets by an F - 16 .
Mercifully he is unconscious .
With just two operating rooms , Kamal Adwan 's surgeons struggle to attend to the admitted while performing triage on the arrivals .
Blood coats their uniforms .
The scene is of organised destruction and a determination to save lives despite the odds .
As the surgeons work , an orderly wheels in another victim .
This young man arrives in a coma , bleeding profusely from multiple shrapnel wounds delivered by an air - to - ground missile .
The doctors desperately attempt to stem the bleeding .
Suddenly all eyes are raised to the ceiling .
Outside , the thwop - thwop - thwop of a helicopter gunship envelops the medical sanctuary , its vibration deafening .
Moments later , a thud followed by Boom !
Boom !
Ka-boom !
The Israelis are shelling again close by .
Stressed and exasperated , those waiting scream .
Some cry , while others sit blank - faced in shock .
Leaving the hospital I pass a young man named Mustapha al - Banna being carried in .
His legs and one arm are gone ; his eyes have welled with tears .
Awake yet not awake , his lip quivers , wanting to speak but he can't .
His father frets , holding his son's hand .
" He was feeding the sheep at our home when an Israeli F - 16 bombed our house , " he explains .
" His legs were blown out from under him ! "
Down the street , I hear the cries of a young girl .
" Wake up Samah , please ! " she screams .
But the teenage victim cannot hear ; her torso is burned black .
Panicking , the young girl looks to her eldest sister on the other side of the room .
But this sister , Salwa , is also dead , both siblings killed as they slept by an Israeli F - 16 .
When the paramedics arrive at the girls ' home , they stare in disbelief .
" Where is the rest of the body ? " an ambulance driver chokes , realising the walls are where she now lies .
Minutes later , down the street , 17 - year - old Jaclyn Abu Shbak screams .
Her 14 - year - old brother Eyad lies motionless in the street .
As she approaches his body , an Israeli sniper shoots her dead .
The Atallah family lived in a three - storey building that was bombed by an Israeli F - 16 .
The air strike killed father , mother and four of their children .
Their other two children are in a critical condition and have been transferred to an Egyptian hospital .
And thus the carnage continues .
Israeli warplanes , citing " self - defence " , relentlessly bomb as women and children flee into the night with whatever they can carry .
Nowhere is safe .
The planes target homes .
Snipers target children and bombs hold no prejudice or preference .
On 29 February , on Israeli army radio , Israel 's deputy defence minister Matan Vilnai threatened " Shoah " on Gaza in response to Qassam rocket fire directed at the Israeli colony of Ashkelon , which resulted in the death of one Israeli .
Shoah is the Jewish name for the Holocaust .
But this justification for Israel 's invasion of Gaza ignores the historical context .
When President George W Bush arrived in the Middle East in January , Israel began a sustained bombing of Gaza , while professing to " seek peace " .
Its siege and collective punishment of Gaza through border closures and the withholding of food , water and medical supplies has now entered its 25th month .
For the first eight months after Israel removed its illegal colonies from Gaza in September 2005 , Hamas and the Palestinian resistance observed a ceasefire , despite Israel 's continued random shelling , kidnapping of officials and targeted assassinations .
This ended in June 2006 when an Israeli ship bombed a beach in Gaza , killing 13 people , 11 from the same family .
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah repeatedly approach Israel to negotiate a ceasefire .
Israel continues to reject each overture , intensifying its assaults and causing an endless tit - for - tat with each side escalating and civilians on both sides paying the price .
Operation Hot Winter claimed 60 lives on its first day .
As I write , the total number killed has been more than 126 ( among them 39 children and babies and 12 women ) .
There have been more than 380 citizens injured and hundreds of houses demolished .
The United Nations defines as a " massacre " the killing of 50 or more civilians .
This has been a massacre , the massacre of Jabaliya .
And , as Deputy Defence Minister Vilnai threatened , the potential seed of a holocaust .

While Adult Swim is generally regarded as the pioneer of irreverent short - form animation -- especially for ' toons that reimagine past hits -- it was n't always the king .
In fact , the late - night programming block arguably found its birth in a series of short toons and interstitials that ran in the heyday of its daytime alter ego , the venerable Cartoon Network .
The brainchild of C.N. Creative Director Michael Ouweleen and Hanna - Barbera chief Fred Seibert , these cartoons reinterpreted the network 's properties through stock footage , indie music , and original animation in a wide variety of styles , as well as introducing prototypes of characters that would become some of the most famous in the history of American animation .
The groundwork for the following projects was arguably laid by two cartoons :
The Moxy and Flea Show ( the network 's first original series ) and Space Ghost Coast to Coast .
Though little is remembered of the short - lived , which starred mo -capped entertainers Penn Jillette and Bobcat Goldthwait as a 3D animal duo , hit a chord and ran for years in the night block as a cult series -- its bizarre , incoherent " interviews " and repurposed 1960s characters set the stage for Adult Swim in later years .
Crafted by the aforementioned - Ouweleen in the mid-90s , " Cartoons That Never Made It " was a brief series of four " bumps " -- short cartoons that play before commercial breaks or split up longer programs .
The four shorts acted as promos for various fictional cartoons , all rejected for obvious reasons .
Surprisingly twisted for the network 's early , more staid days , the popularity of the bumps inspired Ouweleen to expand his ambitions in projects to come .
" Groovies " was the term for a new series of shorts which took the form of music videos .
Each one was based on a property in the Cartoon Network stable , from Betty Boop to Dexter 's Lab .
Old clips and in some cases fresh animation work was mixed with original music from well - known artists like Devo , The Apples in Stereo , and will .i.am , resulting in amusing and surprising tributes that respected the classic animation while showing it in a whole new light .
Following the success of the Groovies , Ouweleen acted a little more adventurously by introducing the Shorties .
Shorties were similar to Groovies in that they repurposed older properties broadcast by the network , but they did so in longer - form shorts sans music , and more often with a new visual style .
The shorts were often more sarcastic in tone than their inspirations , and acted along with Space Ghost as the sources for later programs like Sealab 2021 and Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law Known variously over the years as , and , this program was the magnum opus ofcreator John Kricfalusi and cartooning workhorse Fred Seibert , the original creative director of MTV and Nickelodeon and the one - time president of Hanna - Barbera .
Seibert , who would later go on to found Frederator Studios , intended to recreate the atmosphere of the 1950s animation industry by returning creative control to the animators .
The cartoons introduced by the show ranged from the quaint to the grotesque , from the traditional to the bizarre .
Many were popular enough to become full - fledged series -- these characters , referred to as the " Cartoon - Cartoons " , would serve as the network 's programming backbone for years to come First , the one - off shorts that never got picked up by the network .
Next up , the more popular shorts -- ones that made it to two or three episodes , but did n't quite make the cut .
Finally , the shorts that became pilots for successful series .
Most , if not all , of the music used in Cartoon Networks various bumps and interstitials -- including much of the music in the Groovies shorts -- can be found on Bluetube.com , the homepage of Michael Kohler , the chief composer of most of these projects .
So if you heard some music you liked while browsing these videos , chances are its on his site , free to listen to and without any distracting sound effects .

January 6 , 2008 -- The Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) condemned Israel ’s military invasion against the Gaza Strip as it expressed its sorrow over the loss of more than 550 innocent Palestinians and the merciless destruction of their territory .
A statement issued by the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) , published at the United Nations , in New York , expresses the NAM ’s concern about Israel ’s ground invasion , which started on January 3 , when hundreds of tanks opened fire against the Gaza territory , [ defying ] the world ’s outcry .
The NAM statement reads as follows :
The NAM calls upon the international community , especially the Security Council , to uphold international law and its responsibilities and to act urgently to address this grave situation .
The NAM demands that Israel immediately cease its military attacks and abide by all of its obligations under international law and relevant United Nations resolutions .
Such violent and illegal military actions and the continued collective punishment of the Palestinian people have deepened the suffering of innocent and defenceless Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , who are already greatly suffering from continued imposition of the crippling Israeli siege and the ensuing humanitarian crisis .
This unacceptable military escalation by Israel constitutes a grave breach of international law , including humanitarian and human rights law , fuels the cycle of violence and threatens international peace and security as well as the fragile peace process between the two sides .
The Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) strongly condemns the military aggression , including airstrikes , carried out by Israel , the occupying Power , on the Gaza Strip , which has caused death and injuries to hundreds of civilians , including children , and destruction of Palestinian property and infrastructure .

January 4 , 2009 -- Palestinian citizens of Israel held a massive protest on January 3 , 2009 , in Sakhnin , an Arab city in northern Israel , against Israel 's war on the Palestinian people in Gaza .
It was attended by up to 150,000 protesters .
Crowds waving Palestinian flags and brandishing pro-Palestinian placards chanted " Gaza will not surrender to the tanks and bulldozers ! " and " Do n't fear , Gaza , we are with you ! " .
Meanwhile , Israel has begun its ground invasion of Gaza .
Around the world on January 3 , solidarity demonstrations have been held , attended by tens of thousands .
Two thousand protested in South Africa outside the United States Consulate in Johannesburg ( statement see below ) .

January 3 , 2008 --
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called on January 3 , 2008 , upon the Arab people and all progressive forces in the world to escalate all forms of resistance against the Zionist and imperialist enemy .
The PFLP noted the mass response of the Arab people who have taken to the streets across the Arab homeland in support of their sisters and brothers resisting and beseiged in Gaza and called upon this resistance to continue and escalate .
The PFLP further called for popular and armed resistance to the occupiers and invaders of our land to intensify and increase , so that as the enemy attempts to intensify its crimes in Gaza , it will feel the response of the resistance and the fire of the anger and determination of the people everywhere .
In addition , the PFLP called upon the progressive forces of the world to continue and intensify their actions and mobilisation against the Israeli crimes and the US and European complicity and support in this war against our people .
The PFLP salutes the mass mobilisation in the cities of the world -- London , New York , Paris , Oslo , Brazil , Lima , Rome , San Francisco , Chicago , Mexico City , Bogota , Manila , Jakarta , Kuala Lumpur and everywhere -- and calls for the continuation of the pressure upon their governments .
The PFLP further stated that this is a historic moment and battle , and a fight for the existence of the resistance and the future of the Palestinian cause .
Now is the time to meet this challenge , as the resistance is doing in Gaza and the West Bank , with all utmost action and mobilization throughout the Arab homeland and around the world .
Towards victory !
Now is the time for unity and resistance
By the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
More than 431 killed in Gaza and 2300 have been wounded in a series of massacres and crimes committed by the Zionist occupier against the Palestinian people in Gaza on December 27 , 2008 .
650 children have been injured and 75 women as part of the ongoing onslaught .
The occupier has continually bombarded Gaza with missiles from Apache helicopters and F - 16 planes throughout Gaza for over seven days .
Demonstrations have broken out throughout the West Bank and the Arab world in protest and outrage at the brutality and the nature of these massive crimes .
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement calling for the broadest resistance to meet and confront this aggression against the Palestinian people and to respond to these massacres , and for the unity of the resistance , and the unity of the Palestinian people , to greet the occupier with resistance , strength and steadfastness despite his brutal crimes .
The statement stressed the urgent need for national unity immediately to confront the crimes against our people and to greet the occupier and its brutality with tremendous and unified resistance that is capable of shaking its foundations .
The PFLP statement further called upon all resistance forces to come together now and establish unified resistance front to coordinate and take up the challenge of these attacks against our people .
It pointed to the responsibility of the United States for these attacks , as a strategic partner of the occupier , working hand in hand with its massacres and crimes against the Palestinian people , and as the source of the arms used by the occupier against our people .
It also pointed to the complicity of the Arab regimes in these crimes , particularly the Egyptian regime , for its ongoing and active participation in the blockade and siege of the Palestinian people in Gaza and its meetings and discussions with the occupier about its plans for Gaza .
These massacres are taking place because of Arab and international silence and active complicity .
The PFLP further called for the immediate end to any and all negotiations with this brutal occupier who plans massacres against our people and stated that if he will not end the negotiations immediately , Abu Mazen must resign now .
The nature of the Zionist enemy and its dedication to the eradication of the Palestinian people is laid bare and clear by this series of attacks , calculated to cause maximum damage and human cost .
For the past sixty years , there is an unbroken history of massacres and crimes against our people and this massacre today is yet one more expression of the nature of the illegitimate colonial state that has implanted itself on Palestinian land and continues to live on US support through massacres and crimes against the Palestinian people .
The statement concluded by calling upon all of its fighters and military branches to take the strongest actions and to resist the occupation and its massacres by all methods and forms of action and resistance , and by calling for the broadest solidarity on Arab and international levels , for people to come into the streets , demonstrate , march , and take action to declare that these massacres and crimes are unacceptable , that the Arab people and the world are with Palestine and the Palestinian people , and that they will not allow these crimes to continue nor for the Arab regimes and international regimes to be silently complicity or actively involved in the occupation 's crimes .
The Palestinian people will greet these massacres with steadfastness , strength , unity and resistance and all of the crimes , massacres , targeting of civilians , residential neighborhoods , and schoolchildren and teachers will do nothing to crush the resistance of our people , the statement said , it will only ensure Palestinian unity in the face of this brutality which makes clear the true face of the occupier to the world .
From the Communist Party of Israel : Stop the Killing !
No to the Siege !
www.maki.org.il
January 3 , 2008 --
The killing in Gaza continues .
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed , thousands injured , air strikes have caused utter devastation and entire families are left homeless .
Civilians in the south of Israel are being held captive by a government which lies to them and abuses them .
Destruction and death in Gaza will not ensure their future , but rather lead to more violence and killings .
Tomorrow ( Saturday , January 3 , 2009 ) two big protests will be held in Israel , by a coalition of peace forces and the Communist Party of Israel and the front Hadash ( the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality ) in Tel - Aviv ; and in Sakhnin by the High Committee of Arab - Palestinian Citizens in Israel , both of them against the killing in Gaza .
Together we will call out : Stop the Killing !
No to the Siege !
Yes to life for both peoples !
In these dark days , let us stick to our message : Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies !
Our demand : A full truce and the lifting of the siege on Gaza NOW !
Israel has gone to great lengths to ensure that the world does not know the extent of its crimes against humanity inside of Gaza .
In Israel itself , there are protests against this war on a captive people .
Thousands have gathered to protest daily in Tel Aviv , West Jerusalem , Haifa , Nazaret , Um el - Fahem , Tira , Taybe and other cities .
Citizens called up as reservists to prepare for a possible land assault on Gaza have refused service , risking jail .
None of this is being reported in the US and European corporate media , which is largely " cheerleading " the Israeli attack , primarily by “ evenhandedly ” reporting on the attacks in Gaza and the rockets launched by Hamas into Israel .
As Dov Khenin , an Israeli Knesset member from Hadash and a leading Communist Party member , stated in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now ! , “ Well , the most important thing to realise is that there is an opposition inside Israel to the war and to everything going on around right now in Gaza .
This position is a Jewish - Arab one .
On Saturday night , we had a demonstration in Tel Aviv of 2000 young people , mainly Jews , and there are a lot of demonstrations all over Israel of Jews and Arabs opposing the war policy of the current government .
This opposition is growing steadily .
It is very important to know this and to understand that there are other voices in Israeli society who ( oppose ) a war , and they believe there is a better alternative for Israelis and Palestinians alike . ”
Yesterday , a group of Tel Aviv poets held a poetry - reading vigil protesting the Gaza operation in front of the luxury Akirov Towers , where Defence Minister Ehud Barak ( and head of the Labor Party ) has an apartment .
Twenty young poets read anti-war works over a loudspeaker , calling it " a protest against the destruction Ehud Barak is wreaking on the residents of the south while he 's sleeping in a comfortable bed on the 31st floor . "
Ibtisam Marahna , number 12 on the Meretz Knesset list , spoke at the protest , and announced her resignation from Meretz because of its support for the war .
Ten human rights organisations yesterday called on Defence Minister Ehud Barak to urgently renew an unlimited supply of fuel to the Gaza Strip .
The groups , including B'Tselem , Gisha and the Association of Civil Rights in Israel , wrote that the massive destruction of infrastructure following the Israeli action will increase the need for fuel to operate " humanitarian equipment such as water pumps , sewage and the health system . "
The groups wrote that since Israel has been constantly reducing the fuel supply to the Gaza Strip since October 2007 , a shortage should have been expected following the military action .
MK Mohammad Barakeh ( Hadash ) yesterday demanded from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that the Shin Bet security service stop questioning Arab political and leftists activists following protests over the Gaza operation .
" If the defence establishment is worried about a wave of protests against the crime in Gaza , it is better to stop the crime and not persecute the political leadership and activists in the Arab sector " , Barakeh said .

Philippine government should sever ties with Israel
Stop the War Coalition - Philippines
January 5 , 2008 --
We at the Stop the War Coalition Philippines , a broad coalition of civil society organisations , social movements , labour unions , political parties , human rights , women's , students , religious and other organisations , strongly condemn Israel 's war crimes against the people of Gaza and the international community .
These latest attacks are not only disproportionate , they are completely unjustifiable .
At the root of the continuing tragedy in the Middle East is the continuing illegal occupation of Palestine by Israel .
That Israel is able to continue this occupation and that it is able to bomb and kill indiscriminately without restraint points to the incapacity of the international community , including the United Nations and the world 's governments , to uphold peace and justice .
It is this unwillingness to act that will ensure that more blood and tears will flow from this escalating war .
We in the Philippines must help stop this war not only because thousands of Filipino migrant workers are caught in the crossfire but because we have a stake in creating a world with peace and justice .
We at the Stop the War Campaign demand that Israel should immediately end its war crimes in Gaza and end the occupation of Palestine .
We demand that the United States immediately stops arming and funding Israel 's war .
We call on the international community , the United Nations and all responsible international government and civil society organisations , to stop Israel from continuing its attacks and to support a just resolution to the crisis .
We demand that the Philippine government begins the process of severing all diplomatic ties with Israel until it complies with international law and ends the occupation of Palestine .
At the same time , we also call for immediate relief and evacuation plans for Filipino workers in the region .
We demand more jobs for Filipinos at home so that they will not be forced to seek employment in outlaw states .
As our elected representatives , our government should take a stand in favour of international law and justice , summon the Israeli ambassador to protest , and expressly condemn Israel for its actions .
We demand that Manila and other government units revoke their " sister city " ties with Israeli cities .
We call on our parliamentarians and diplomats to likewise denounce Israel 's actions .
In solidarity with the Palestinian , as well as Israeli people opposed to war , we call on trade unions , universities , cultural organisations , political parties , and other social movements and civil society groups to be part of a global boycott and sanctions campaign against Israel .
` Amandla intifada ' -- Almost 2000 protesters in Johannesburg call for sanctions against Israel
By Palestine Solidarity Committee ( South Africa )
January 3 , 2009 -- Close to 2000 protesters chanting slogans such as ``Amandla intifada '' , ``From Iraq to Palestine , occupation is a crime ' ' , and ``Free , free Palestine ' ' gathered outside the United States consulate in Johannesburg to protest Israel 's barbaric bombing of Gaza and to support a campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
The protest was organised by the Palestine Solidarity Committee .
Speakers included : Eddie Makue , general secretary of the South African Council of Churches ; Bongani Masuku of the Congress of South African Trade Unions ; and Melissa Hoole and Salim Vally of the Palestine Solidarity Committee .
Vally insisted that the demonstration was not only a condemnation of Israel 's brutality but also a celebration of Palestinian heroism and resistance .
He likened the resistance to ``the brave young women and men in the Warsaw Ghetto against Nazi occupation ' ' .
He described appalling living conditions in the Gaza Ghetto and noted that 80 % of the inhabitants of Gaza were refugees .
Vally said Israel planned this massacre six months ago and constantly provoked Hamas by , for example , arresting democratically elected officials and increasing the number of men , women and children in Israeli jails to 12,000 .
He acknowledged the presence at the protest of Somali refugees and asked for unity against xenophobia , support for the poor in South Africa and for solidarity with the people of Swaziland , Zimbabwe , Burma and Western Sahara .
He called for supporting the goals of most Palestinians -- ``a single democratic state with equal rights for Jews , Christians and Muslims , and not a bantustan ' ' .
Protesters endorsed a call for a campaign of boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel , as called for by close to 200 Palestinian civil society and political organisations .
COSATU 's Masuku said that was the best way for South Africa to support the oppressed Palestinian people .
He also reiterated his organisation 's call on the South African government to withdraw the South African ambassador from Tel Aviv , sever all diplomatic relations with Israel , and impose sanctions on that state .
Makue , who returned two weeks ago from an 11 - city speaking tour of the US , where he also called for sanctions against Israel , emphasised that Israel is an apartheid state and pointed out that apartheid in any country in the world is a crime against humanity .
He also insisted that the US and Israel must respect democracy and said that the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people elected in a free and fair election in 2005 was Hamas .
Hoole pointed to the billions of dollars of support that the US provides to Israel and , in particular , to the Israeli military .
She said the US was not only complicit but was an active partner in Israeli violations of international law .
She called on Obama to prove that he believed in change by changing US policies towards Israel and to end its support for that racist state which is the largest recipient of US aid .
Protesters also expressed their disgust at Arab governments , calling them ``quislings ' ' .
Undemocratic and unelected Arab ``leaders '' have hypocritically sold out the Palestinian people and the struggle for Palestinian liberation , some said .
In particular , fingers were pointed at the Saudi Arabian monarchy and Egypt 's strongman Hosni Mubarak .
Mubarak , it was noted , was briefed about the Gaza massacre days before it happened .
They also mentioned his suppression of workers ' struggles .
As a result , protesters decided to stage a demonstration outside the Egyptian Embassy in Pretoria next week .
Among the protesters were some Palestinians , mostly from Gaza .
Other speakers included representatives from the Socialist Party of Azania , Virginia Setshedi from the Soweto Concerned Residents and the Social Movements Indaba , and Maulana Ebrahim Bham from the Jamiatul Ulama .
12,000 people rally in Toronto against the Israeli assault on Gaza

January 3 , 2009 --
At least 10,000 people gathered at Toronto ’s Yonge - Dundas Square to protest against Israel ’s recent assault on Gaza .
Protesters then marched through the streets of Toronto to the Israeli Consulate and the United States Embassy .
Demonstrators called on the Canadian government to condemn Israel ’s latest aggression and to cut all political , economic and military ties with Israel until it complies with international law .
Protests were also held across Canada in Ottawa , Winnipeg and Vancouver .
Demonstrations are scheduled in Montreal on Sunday .
“ We are overwhelmed by the support we have received from Canadian civil society , the trade union movement , and allies in the Jewish community .
The large number of people on the streets today shows that the Harper government is out of touch with the Canadian public , ” said Khaled Mouammar President of the Canadian Arab Federation .
As the protest was taking place , Israel began a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip .
This latest escalation comes in spite of international condemnation and calls for Israel to end its full - scale military assault on the people of Gaza , which has already killed over 400 people .
It is clear that Israel believes it can act with impunity , and continue to commit war crimes against the illegally occupied Palestinian people .
" We will continue to mobilise and voice our outrage at the crimes being committed in Gaza until the Canadian Harper government publicly condemns Israel ’s violations of international law " , stated Farid Ayad , president of Palestine House .
Numerous speakers at the demonstration , including the president of CUPE Ontario Syd Ryan , local Jewish activist Jenny Peto and Rafeef Ziadah from Palestine House , urged the crowd to support the campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israeli apartheid .
As part of this campaign , organisers called on the Canadian government to implement sanctions against the Israeli government until Israel halted its aggression upon the population of Gaza and fully complied with international law .
Organisers further demanded that Canada insist Israel ends the siege on Gaza and open the borders to allow for food , medicine , water and other essentials of life .
The rally was endorsed by :
Palestine House
Canadian Arab Federation
Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid
Canadian Union of Public Employee ( Ontario )
Canadian Union of Postal Workers

St. Paul dropping all misdemeanor charges for journalists arrested during RNC
Charges will be dropped against journalists who were arrested and charged with misdemeanors for unlawful assembly during the Republican National Convention , St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said today .
Many reporters , photographers and bloggers were among the 818 people arrested during the Sept. 1 - 4 convention .
Many were trapped on a bridge with protesters on the Thursday night , just before Sen .
John McCain made his acceptance speech .
Police had warned the large group to dissipate , then closed in from both sides of the bridge and made mass arrests .
The mayor ’s ruling applies only to journalists getting misdemeanors , but he said that , with the proliferation of alternatative media covering the convention , the definition of journalist will be broadly applied as they try to ascertain identities and credentials .
City officials said they ’re not sure how many people this will affect .
– Joe Kimball
Here ’s the mayor ’s announcement :
Mayor Coleman Announces Policy Not to Pursue Certain Misdemeanor Charges Against Journalists
SAINT PAUL – Mayor Chris Coleman announced today that the city will decline to prosecute misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists arrested during the Republican National Convention .
He made the announcement after consultation with the city attorney ’s office , which recommended the city not pursue misdemeanor prosecution of these individuals .
“ This decision reflects the values we have in Saint Paul to protect and promote our First Amendment rights to freedom of the press , ”  Mayor Coleman said .
“ A journalist plays a special role in our democracy and that role is just too important to ignore .
At the scene , the police did their duty in protecting public safety .
In this decision , we are serving the public ’s interest to maintain the integrity of our democracy , system of justice and freedom of the press . ” 
The decision will only affect people identified as journalists who face the misdemeanor charge .
Recognizing the growing media profession in print , broadcast and the Internet , the city attorney ’s office will use a broad definition and verification to identify journalists who were caught up in mass arrests during the convention .
It is not known how many cases this decision will affect .

New research suggests that relatively recent events had a substantial impact on patterns of genetic diversity in the southwest region of Europe .
The study , published by Cell Press on December 4th in the American Journal of Human Genetics , shows that geographical patterns of ancestry appear to have been influenced by religious conversions of both Jews and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula .
" Most studies of European genetic diversity have focused on large - scale variation and interpretations based on events in prehistory , but migrations and invasions in historical times may also have profound effects on genetic landscapes , " explains senior study author Prof.
Mark A. Jobling from the Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester .
Prof.
Jobling and colleagues performed a sophisticated genetic analysis of 1140 males from the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands , focusing on the Y chromosome , which is passed down from fathers to sons .
The researchers found a remarkably high level of Sephardic Jewish ( 19.8 % ) and North African ( 10.6 % ) ancestry in their large sample of Y chromosomes from the modern population .
The Iberian Peninsula has a complex recent history that involves the long - term residence of these two diverse populations with distinct geographical origins and unique cultural and religious characteristics .
The large proportion of Sephardic Jewish ancestry does not fit with simple expectations from the historical record .
" Despite alternative possible sources for lineages [ to which ] we ascribe a Sephardic Jewish origin , these proportions attest to a high level of religious conversion , whether voluntary or enforced , driven by historical episodes of social and religious intolerance that ultimately led to the integration of descendants , " offers Prof. Jobling .
Additionally , the prominent North African lineage in Iberian populations exhibits low diversity , which favors its arrival after the conquest of 711 AD , and the geographical distribution of North African Ancestry in the peninsula does not reflect the initial colonization and subsequent withdrawal .
" This is likely to result from later enforced population movement – more marked in some regions than others , " explains Prof. Jobling .
The research demonstrates that both immigration events from the Middle East and North Africa over the last two millennia and introduction of new Y - chromosome types driven by religious conversion and intermarriage have had a dramatic impact on modern populations in Spain , Portugal , and the Balearic Islands .
In addition , the findings indicate that recent history should be considered when investigating the impact of events occurring during the earlier prehistory of Europe .
The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust .

The fifth season of Lost kicks off with some mind - bending physics , crazy ninja moves , a few blasts from seasons past , and a guy named Frogurt .
“ Tonight on Losterpiece Theater we bring you the harrowing tale of a young British aristocrat and her trials and tribulations upon choosing a suitable husband … ”
“ Surely you ca n’t be serious ! ”
“ OBVIOUSLY .
Tonight on Lost we bring you the craziest mindf#@k of an episode ever .
And … do n’t call me Shirley . ”
***
So these miner guys come and grab Dr. Candlewax and this dude is like “ Sir , you ca n’t drill any deeper or else this hole is going to explode ! ! ”
“ That ’s what she said .
And anyway , it ’s not all bad .
Behind that hole is just wibbly wobbly , timey wimey stuff . ”
And Daniel ’s like I do n’t get it …who is “ she ? ” … and is n’t it like , 1972 ?
Should n’t I be in Speed Racer underoos and not fully grown and bearded ?
***
“ Did someone say Speed Racer ?
I heard that movie was awful awesome .
So many … pretty colors …. ” * starts humming Go Go Speed Racer to himself *
“ Hi ! I ’m Earth !!
Have we met ! ? ”
“ I do n’t … think…so … ”
So Ben is all “ WE HAVE TO GO BACK ” and Jack ’s like “ THAT IS MY LINE ! ” whilst removing the dead animal carcass that had been living on his face !
And Ben ’s like “ Let ’s wrangle up all your Oceanic 6 pals and take them on a tropical vacation ! ”
And then they had a sing - off !!
♫ Aruba ! Jamaica !
Ooh I wanna take ya to Bermuda , Bahama , come on pretty mama ! ♫
♫ Nobody likes me , everybody hates me , I ’m gonna go eat worms !!!
DIPPED IN CODEINE !!! ♫
♫ We get by with a little help from our friends .
Get high with a little help from our friends .
Although obviously you ’re good going solo on that second part . ♫
♫ I AM A ROCK !!!
I AM AN ISLAAAAND !!! ♫
“ Right , because a rock feels no pain , and an island NEVER CRIES .
Excuse me while I ROFLMAO . ”
***
And then the island wanted to jump into the sing - off with a little “ Jungle Love ” by Morris Day and the Time … Travelers !!!!!
So anyway as it tuns out , spinning Ye Olde Frozen Donkeye Wheele = CTRL + ALT + DELETE -ing the island !!
So now everyone is experiencing the Blue Screen of Death , i.e. THE ISLAND IS HOPPING AROUND IN TIME !!!
O_O
Lucky for us , Sawyer left his shirt in 2004 !
Unfortunately his pants did not suffer the same fate .
So then Bernard comes running out of the jungle and he ’s all “ WE CAN ’T GO BACK TO THE CAMP , THERE IS NO CAMP !!! ”
And then this little bald kid is all “ WE CAN ’T USE THE SPOON , THERE IS NO SPOON !!! ” and we ’re all like “ WTF IS HAPPENING !? ”
And Sawyer ’s like “ Where did our camp go , all my shirts were in my tent ! ”
“ I ’m afraid you ’re going to have to remain topless for a while , you see , your camp has n’t even been BUILT yet !! ”
* DUN DUN DUNNNNNN *
***
Now we ’re back in 2007 and Kate ’s hanging out with her baybeh Aaron when these two dudes come to the door and they ’re all like “ Ve vant to take yourrrr blood ! ”
“ What , are you guys vampires or something ! ? ”
“ Actually no , I ’m the dad from My So - Called Life and my friend is the villain from every 80 ’s teen movie .
We ’re here to prove that your kid is / is n’t really yours ! ”
So of course Kate puts on her best running pumps , grabs some travel shampoo , her pajamas , a giant wad of cash , and a big honkin ’ gun and screams “ ROAD TRIP !!!!!! ”
***
“ Hey Professor Honeydew , gimme yer shirt ! ”
And Miles is like , “ Um , I could give you my shirt , I ’m totally wearing like 3 right now … ”
But Daniel is like , “ No !
No shirts for Sawyer !
Everyone just shut up okay , we ’ve got to get to the hatch !!
This island is like a record and Jacob is making a remix !!
AND WE ALL KNOW REMIXES SUCK , SO LET’S GOOOO . ”
****
Then THIS PLANE JUST FALLS OUT OF THE SKY AND OMFG IT ’S YEMI ’S PLANE O’ DRUGS !!!!!
And then Locke reenacts that scene from North by Northwest !
So then he tries to go see what ’s up with the plane when Locke gets shot …
AGAIN !!!!
I mean , REALLY !????
Ca n’t this guy go one episode without getting MAIMED in some way !?
Anyway , this time it was ETHAN that shot him !!!
Which was weird considering he was a lot less DEAD than he was when we saw him last !!!
And Locke was just as confused as we were .
***
So then Chuck Widmore meets Sun in the airport and he ’s like “ You got moxy kid , I like your style .
Have your people call my people and we ’ll get our people to go kill some people !! ”
To which Sun replied , “ Benjamin Linus , your ass is grass and I ’m the mower . ”
***
And then Sayid and Hurley start giving each other some advice !
Sayid : CONSTANT VIGILANCE !!!!!!!
TRUST NO ONE !!!!!!
Especially Ben Linus .
Do the opposite of what he says at all times .
And find a cool code name for yourself .
They call me Mr. Tibbs .
Hurley : Eat more junk food !!
It ’s like your clogged arteries are giving your heart a HUG !
And then some red shirt was like “ WOOPS DART TO YOUR NECK ” and Sayid was like , “ WOOPS , PAN TO YOUR FACE !!! ”
And then Sayid killed this dude VIA DISHWASHER !
I MEAN DEATH BY DISHWASHER OMFG !!!!
‘DS;LFKAL ;’SDFKL GOOD THING SAYID MADE A CLEAN GETAWAY !!
LOL
And then some asshole took a picture of Hurley covered in ketchup and holding a gun !!!
So now he ’s wanted for all of Sayid ’s pwntacular murders , but we all know Hugo has only ever murdered a tub of tasty ranch dressing and some super old crackers !!!
***
Back on the island Team Daniel saw that the hatch was now Post - Implosion , so for all they knew their friends were still on the island .
And Sawyer ’s like “ I WANNA GO WARN KATE EVERYONE ABOUT THE FREIGHTER !!! ”
But Daniel was all , “ NUH UH , YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE COURSE OF TIME , HAVEN ’T YOU EVER SEEN DOCTOR WHO !?
Everything we try will be FOR THE LOSE , James ! ! ”
***
Okay so Locke is laying there like BLEEDING TO DEATH and all the sudden he hears someone coming – someone with a torch !
COULD IT BE PAST !
SAYID COMING TO TORCH-A HIM !?
But lucky for him it was Mr. Manscara himself , the Ghost of Christmas Present !
Or Future !
Or Past !
OR WHATEVER .
So Locke is all “ WHEN AM I !?
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE !? ”
And Richard ’s like “ You ’re in the now , man !!
And you told me next week !
WHAT ?
THAT DOESN ’T MAKE SENSE TO YOU !?
GET WITH THE PROGRAM ! ”
And then he gave him a compass and told him next time Locke saw him he would n’t know him anymore !!!
CAN I GET A WTF !?
And then to make matters worse he ’s like “ BY THE WAY LOCKE , YA GONNA HAFF TAH DAH - YEEE ! ”
And Locke ’s like , “ Why do I feel like Charlie all of the sudden ! ? ”
***
Then , after Son - of - a- Bitch -ing in two totally different TIMES , Sawyer ’s like “ I need to get some food / beer / clothes ” and we ’re all like WE’RE GLAD YOU’VE GOT YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT !
So Sawyer goes and starts banging on the hatch door ( did I mention it was miraculously BACK IN ONE PIECE AGAIN !? ) and Sawyer ’s all “ HEY DESMOND LET ME IN !
WE CAN BE HOT AND SHIRTLESS TOGETHER ! ” and Daniel ’s like “ DUDE , NO !
YOU CAN ’T SEE EACH OTHER , HE DOESN ’T KNOW YOU YET !!!
YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE PAST ! ”
And Sawyer ’s like , “ I KNOW WHAT I CAN ’T CHANGE , THE ONLY PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT JUST BLEW UP ON YOUR BOAT ! ” and we were like AW OMG POOR SAWYER !!!
But then Juliet ’s like “ I know a person like me liking a person like you makes less sense than the rest of this episode , but JAMES , YOU’VE STILL GOT ME !! ”
And then Charlotte started suffering from the Agent Dana Scully Disease in which a tiny nose bleed signifies a potentially life threatening problem !!
And Mulder ’s like “ BLAH BLAH BLAH GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY ALIENS TIME TRAVEL !!!
Hope you ’re okay !! ”
And we ’re all like “ MULDER , DON’T FRONT , WE KNOW YOU ~*LIKE *~ HER , WE’VE SEEN HOW YOU GAZE AT HER ” and he ’s like “ I do not gaze at Scully ! ” * sighs whilst watching her walk away *
So anyway after checking his little Scientist Manual and seeing that it said “ DON ’T PANIC ” he went and had a chat with Desmond !
Only this was n’t the slightly psychic , blue - shirt - wearing Desmond we ’ve grown to know and love , but the crazed paranoid WHAT - DID -ONE - SNOWMAN-SAY-TO-THE -OTHER-SNOWMAN
Desmond that was stuck living in the hatch back in the day !!
HE ’S JUS ’ SAVIN THA WORLD , BROTHAH !!!!
So Desmond ’s all “ WTF , BROTHAH !? ”
And Daniel ’s like “ OKAY LISTEN , YOU DON’T KNOW ME , BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE SUPER SPECIAL ! ”
“ OCH ! ARE YOO HITTIN ’ ON ME ! ? ”
“ Sorry , bitchy redheads are my type , but you really are special !
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE !
NOW WAKE UP AND COME SAVE US , PLZ !
FIND MY MOM , SHE’S IN OXFORD !!!! ”
***
And then 3 years in the few - chah , Desmond wakes up and he ’s like “ I just had the weirdest dreammmmmemory !!!!! ”
And Penneh ’s kind of “ WTF , mate ! ? ” but she ’s used to Desmond being sort of insane by now lol .
And then someone ’s like “ WELL FARADAY KIDS , THIS IS THE STORY ABOUT HOW DESMOND MET YOUR MOTHER . ” and we ’re all like “ Whaaa ! ? ”
****
So jump back now to the day the Oceanic 6 were “ found . ”
Jack ’s like “ Look , the first rule of Flight 815 Club is that YOU DON ’T TALK ABOUT FLIGHT 815 CLUB .
So are we all cool with lying about what happened to us ? ? ”
Kate : “ Yeah lying is like second nature to me . ”
Sayid : “ Lying is awesome , I did it all the time when I was working undercover for the government . ”
Sun : “ I do n’t think I know how to NOT lie anymore LOL . ”
La Penis is like , * points at self * “ Too drunk to give a shit ! ”
So Hurley ’s the only one that ’s like “ Guys , lying ’s bad , mmkay ?
If we stick together , people will have to believe the real story , even if the island just went BLOOP ! ”
But majority rules , so Hurley had to lie too . :(
***
Now it ’s like 3 years later and despite killing someone via large kitchen appliance , Sayid felt like taking a little drug - induced nap coma !
So Hurley ’s trying to get him buckled in ( it ’s the law ! ) when a cop pulls him over !
And HOLY SHIT , it ’s your least favorite Tailie and mine , ANA - LUCIA !!!!!!!!
And instead of wanting to eat Hurley ’s brains like a normal zombie , she tells him to get a makeover , do n’t get arrested , and that the Libbster says hi !!
But really it totally was n’t Ana - Lucia , but the smoke monster or Jacob or SOMETHING because he / it is always the one to say “ You ’ve got work to do ! ! ” AMIRIGHT !?!?!
***
Back on the island , Rose and Bernard were having a argument …
Rose : YOU DON’T HAVE ENOUGH WOOD
Bernard : I HAVE TOO MUCH WOOD
Entire Audience : LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL STOP PLEASE
Rose : YOUR WOOD FAILS !
Bernard : THE ONLY TENT LEFT ON THIS BEACH IS THE ONE IN MY PANTS !
And then * tosses confetti* we finally got to meet FROGURT !!
And WOW , is he bitchy is WHAT !?
But we were n’t too worried about him ruining the rest of the season , we saw his shirt .
And those colors do n’t run .
They just get shot / stabbed / drowned / SET ON FIRE /etc .
Unfortunately Sawyer stole one of Frogurt ’s shirts and after that , the sexiest thing on the beach was that wood conversation Rose and Bernard were having .
But then Daniel wandered back to the beach after his conversation with Desmond and Sawyer ’s like “ Hey Doctor Wizard , what have you been doing ! ? ”
“ Do n’t worry , campers !
I ’m somehow going to find out where / when the frak we are using my mad scientist skillz ! ”
***
And then Hurley played Weekend at Bernie ’s with Sayid !!
Then he stopped by a Quik - E - Mart to get a Squishee and a new wardrobe !
And we ’re all thinking Wow I hope Naveen Andrews wins an Emmy for this performance !
***
Back in The Suite Life of Ben and Jack , Ben is pulling a Dexter and hiding something in the air duct vents and wearing his kill suit !
“ By the way Jack , I flushed all your pills down the John .
I mean … the toilet .
Not Locke .
He ’s still out in the van lol . ”
“ What do you mean my pills are GONE ! ? ” * just Jearzed in his pants *
“ Look Jack , “ D.A.R.E. TO STAY OFF DRUGS ! ”
You do n’t need drugs to get messed up anymore , the island is happy to do that for you !
Now listen , you ’ve got 6 hours to go gather all your worldly belongings .

“ WELL , GOOD .
Ca n’t wait to get BAAAACK to the island . ”

By now Hurley is totally freaking out , and he shows up at his parents ’ place with a nice housewarming gift !
A dead Pakistani !
Cheech is all “ WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE IN DANGER !?
WHO IS TRYING TO HURT YOU !?
AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU HEART SHIH - TZUS !? ”

So Ben pays a little visit to his local Meatery and we ’re all thinking “ Seriously can every single Dharma chick BE any BUTCHER !? ” ( lol butcher )
And he ’s like “ Keep Locke ’s body safe or else everything we ’re about to do wo n’t matter ! ”

After having to be put in Time Out by Mama Rose , Frogurt ’s going “ WE CAN ’T EVEN MAKE A FIRE ” and we ’re all thinking “ I KIND OF HOPE YOU DIE IN A FIRE , FROGURT ” and all the sudden his pretty red shirt was all ablaze by some FREAKING FLAMING ARROWS THAT CAME FLYING TOWARDS EVERYONE OUT OF NOWHERE SZL ;FD’;LSDKL ;
NEIL STARTED THE FIRE !
IT WAS ALWAYS BURNIN ’ SINCE THE ISLAND ’S BEEN TURNIN ’!
And we ’re all like HOLY SHIT WHAT IS THIS , LORD OF THE RINGS !?
And Sawyer ’s all “ FOR FRODO !!!!! ” and everyone runs away !!!
***
And then HOO - GOH ’s mom comes home and she ’s like “ HOO - GOH WHY IS THERE A DEAD ARAB ON MY COUCH ??
AND WHY ARE YOU WANTED FOR MURDER !?!?!? ”
Sayid ’s was n’t doing so hot so everyone was like “ IS THERE A WHINY DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE !? ” and Hurley ’s like “ Oh , I think I got a guy … ”
***
So Kate ’s in LA visiting Sun , who is in town for some “ Business Time ” i.e. making Benry dead .
“ Someone knows we ’re lying , the dad from My So - Called Life and an 80 ’s movie villain came to my house asking me for a blood sample !
They know that KATE AUSTEN …. IS NOT THE MOTHER ! ”
“ Listen Kate , I know this sounds harsh , but kill those guys .
Kill anyone who gets in your way .
This is a healthy way to think … ”
“ … I ’ve thought this way ever since Jin died .
Which was almost totally your fault .
I ’ve gone a little mad since then , and I ca n’t believe you let him die , but it ’s not your fault Kate… . ”
“ … I mean sure , you could have not thought about YOURSELF and thought about the FATHER OF MY CHILD , but it ’s all cool .
I do n’t blame you .
For killing my husband .
Oh Kate , do n’t cry . ”
* bawling * “ THANKS SUN , I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW . ”
“ Anytime , friend . ”

So Cheech slipped past the cops that were staking out his house and brings On - Death ’s - Door ! Sayid to Jack .
And the first thing Jack does is call Benry to tell him that Sayid kindly stopped by , and while Ben ’s like “ Okay , thanks ” which seems fine , but the music is like * REE REE REE CRAZY PSYCHO MUSIC * so we ’re all like UH OH !!!!
***
And then HOO - GOH told his mom all about what really happened on the island .
About the crash , the smoke monster , the Others , the freighter , the hatch , the button , the montages of him handing out food every season , the ping pong table on the beach , the Dharma van and Shambala , that time he got to make out with Libby , the Nikki and Paulo Jewel Heist , WAAAAAAAAAAAALT , that bird that screamed “ HURLEY ” when it flew by , the French transmission , the shitty episode about Jack ’s tattoos , the island golf course , the sky turning purple , the polar bears , asking Jin to pee on him , and Desmond ’s psychic visions .
“ And the people that were on that plane that did n’t get to da choppa are still stuck on that island !!! ”
And Momma Hurley is all , “ I believe you , HOO - GOH ! ” and we ’re like “ AW I HOPE MY MOM ALSO DOESN ’T THINK I’M NUTS IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO ME !!! ”
And then she ’s like “ Do n’t worry Hoo - goh let momma make you a sandwich .
You want the crusts cut off , baby ? ”
“ Yes , mommy . ” * squishes Hurley omg *
***
Jack had taken Sayid to the hospital and after giving him some wake up drugs Sayid immediately comes to and he ’s like “ LOOK MAN , I ’M NOT GOIN ’ TO JAIL FOR YOU OR ANYBODY ” and Jack ’s like “ NICE TO SEE YOU TOO , BRO !
You ’re welcome , btw . ”
By now poor Sayid ’s brain is just as disheveled as his hair .
“ If we ’ve got to go back to the island , at least let me pack my flat iron for chrissakes .
I mean … I ca n’t walk around like this . ”
***
And then Hurley launches a CRISPY , CRUNCHY , TENDER , FLAKY GRENADE AT BEN !!!!!!!
* sings Hooot Pocket *
“ Those things should come with a roll of toilet paper . ”
“ Listen Hurley , come with me !
We all want the same thing !
Lets go back to the island !
HELP ME HELP YOU , HUGO !! ”
But Hurley does n’t go with Ben !
He takes Sayid ’s advice and does the opposite of what Ben says – and goes and turns himself in for Murder by Dishwasher and whatever other crazy ninja move - related crimes Sayid had committed that week !
***
Meanwhile on the island , Juliet and Sawyer had gotten themselves into a bit of bother with the locals !
The Dharma dude was all , “ WHO ’S GONNA SAVE YOU NOW !? ”
And Sawyer saw something out of the corner of his eye and he ’s like “ IDK MY BFF LOCKE !? ”
* pwns with giant knife *

And then deep in an underground lair , a hooded woman / necromancer was using the most state of the art computer technology ( if you lived in 1979 ) to do some kind of mapping …

Mr. Parekh said , “ Savings are important .
Joint families exist .
When one son moves out , the family helps them .
So you do n’t borrow so much from the bank . ”
Even mortgage loans tend to have down payments in India that are a third of the purchase price , a far cry from the United States , where 20 percent is the new norm .
( Let ’s not even think about what they used to be . )
But there was also another factor , perhaps the most important of all .
India had a bank regulator who was the anti-Greenspan .
His name was Dr. Y. V. Reddy , and he was the governor of the Reserve Bank of India .
Seventy percent of the banking system in India is nationalized , so a strong regulator is critical , since any banking scandal amounts to a national political scandal as well .
And in the irascible Mr. Reddy , who took office in 2003 and stepped down this past September , it had exactly the right man in the right job at the right time .
“ He basically believed that if bankers were given the opportunity to sin , they would sin , ” said one banker who asked not to be named because , well , there ’s not much percentage in getting on the wrong side of the Reserve Bank of India .
For all the bankers ’ talk about their higher lending standards , the truth is that Mr. Reddy made them even more stringent during the bubble .
Unlike Alan Greenspan , who did n’t believe it was his job to even point out bubbles , much less try to deflate them , Mr. Reddy saw his job as making sure Indian banks did not get too caught up in the bubble mentality .
About two years ago , he started sensing that real estate , in particular , had entered bubble territory .
One of the first moves he made was to ban the use of bank loans for the purchase of raw land , which was skyrocketing .
Only when the developer was about to commence building could the bank get involved — and then only to make construction loans .
( Guess who wound up financing the land purchases ?
United States private equity and hedge funds , of course ! )
Then , as securitizations and derivatives gained increasing prominence in the world ’s financial system , the Reserve Bank of India sharply curtailed their use in the country .
When Mr. Reddy saw American banks setting up off - balance - sheet vehicles to hide debt , he essentially banned them in India .
As a result , banks in India wound up holding onto the loans they made to customers .
On the one hand , this meant they made fewer loans than their American counterparts because they could n’t sell off the loans to Wall Street in securitizations .
On the other hand , it meant they still had the incentive — as American banks did not — to see those loans paid back .
Seeing inflation on the horizon , Mr. Reddy pushed interest rates up to more than 20 percent , which of course dampened the housing frenzy .
He increased risk weightings on commercial buildings and shopping mall construction , doubling the amount of capital banks were required to hold in reserve in case things went awry .
He made banks put aside extra capital for every loan they made .
In effect , Mr. Reddy was creating liquidity even before there was a global liquidity crisis .

Did India ’s bankers stand up to applaud Mr. Reddy as he was making these moves ?
Of course not .
They were naturally furious , just as American bankers would have been if Mr. Greenspan had been more active .
Their regulator was holding them back , constraining their growth !
Mr. Parekh told me that while he had been saying for some time that Indian real estate was in bubble territory , he was still unhappy with the rules imposed by Mr. Reddy .
“ We were critical of the central bank , ” he said .
“ We thought these were harsh measures . ”
Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron arrest Palestinians suspected of throwing stones during a protest against Israel ’s bombing of Gaza , 30 December 2008 .

US
A state founded by Holocaust survivors should be a beacon of morality , not a black hole for it .
Supporters of Israeli policy ( and I distinguish between support for the Israeli people and support for its government ’s policies ) often justify their support by saying that Israel is the only democracy in the region .
Leaving aside certain problematic aspects of that claim , I wonder if these people have ever thought of the implications of Israel , as a democracy , being engaged in continual violations of international law and human rights .
Israelis , benefiting from a press that is far more open to the truth about government ’s policies than the American media , know a great deal about what the leaders they elect are doing , yet they continue to elect them .
Thus , the Israeli public has culpability for their government ’s crimes that citizens under a dictatorship would not have .
Of course , the Israeli government could never have pursued these policies without the money , weapons , and diplomatic cover provided by the US , in particular the US Congress .
After all , it is Congress ’s powers over the “ purse strings ” rather than the President acting as commander - in - chief that has had a more direct bearing on the colonization of Palestinian territories by Jewish settlers .
So many members of Congress have taken money from organizations effectively in exchange for supporting Israeli government interests .
So many members of Congress have accepted all - expense paid junkets to Israel , ostensibly for educational purposes .
With too few exceptions , they are fully complicit in Israeli government crimes , including war crimes .
What about the American public ?
I would say that the American public is largely in the dark about what is going on , thanks to a media which makes criticism of Israeli policy practically taboo .
Of course , this gives the media a special culpability .
Still , there are many Americans who do know the score and fail to speak out .
This is particularly true with Gentiles .
Let ’s face it , although Jews make up only a few percent of the US population , the bulk of the outspoken critics of Israeli policy in this country seem to be Jewish - Americans .
It may be that Gentiles are afraid to speak out for fear of being labeled “ anti-Semitic , ” but I say that as long as you are not anti-Semitic then you should not be afraid .
In fact , if you are a true friend of the Israeli people then you should stand with those in their beleaguered peace movement .
It does Israelis no more good to control Palestinian land , exploit its resources , and inflict misery on its people than it did the US any good to do the same to Iraqis .
Most of us know that the crimes our country committed in Iraq were detrimental to our future , so why would we support the Israeli government when it engages in the same self - destructive behavior .
My question to Israel ’s “ friends ” in Congress would be , “ is that what friends are for ? ”
Of course not .
Most of our members of Congress ( and here is the big surprise ! ) are too self - serving to care about the impact of their votes so long as it helps them raise money for their next election .
They are the kind of “ friends ” Israel ’s mother should have warned it against — if only we were Israel ’s mother .
The only real threat to Israel ’s existence comes not from Iran or Hizballah , but from a further loss of morality .
It comes from attacking and threatening its neighbors .
It comes from dehumanizing the indigenous people of the West Bank and replacing them with religious fanatics .
As described by Leonard Fein in the Forward , some settlers view the Israeli government as their “ enemy ” and have called to establish a “ Kingdom of Judea ” in the West Bank .
It comes from turning Gaza into a massive ghetto and slowly starving it , and now more than anything from bombing it into rubble .
We must condemn Israel ’s attack on Gaza .
I know that it is customary for many to equally condemn both sides whenever violence flares up in the conflict , but there is nothing equal between the two sides .
The Palestinians have for decades been subjected to occupation , disappropriation , assassination and siege , always with massive suffering to civilians , and are expected to accept it without lifting a finger .
Should the Palestinians put up any resistance , Israel feels free to launch any scale of attack , secure in the knowledge that at most it will be subject to calls for “ restraint ” and condemnation of violence on “ both sides . ”
While I do not like the rockets that get fired from Gaza , as long as we as Americans provide the military , financial and diplomatic support that makes the Israeli occupation and siege possible I feel that we as Americans are in no position to condemn the Palestinian resistance .
Remember , we as a society idolize our own forefathers who fought a violent resistance against British colonial rulers who paled in comparison in terms of brutality and repression to those the Palestinians face .
Our government must withdrawal all support from Israel and instead should deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid directly into Gaza .
With the US heading into the biggest economic crisis of our lifetimes , the Israeli government must realize that it cannot take American financial and military aid for granted .
The Palestinians have offered so many concessions .
Israel needs to accept their generous offer before it falls headlong into the abyss .

David Gewirtz , author of ' Where Have All the Emails Gone ? ' reportedly wrote an open letter to President - elect Obama asking that his administration please treat the White House computers like crime scene evidence .
By failing to preserve official emails , the Bush White House has technically committed a federal crime by violating the Presidential Records Act and The Federal Records Act .
The first few weeks of the Obama Administration taking office are going to be critical in preserving that information .
Forensic evidence needs to be gathered before it's lost in the flurry of incoming activity .
( Source : outlookpower.com )
The letter goes on to note that any computers left behind -- not removed like they were by President George H.W. Bush 's team -- could contain important information .
Any of the computers or computer parts , such as hard drives and other media like flash and thumb drives , may contain traces of those famous missing white house emails .
( Source : zdnet.com )
Gewirtz 's Letter Reiterates Many Important Issues
In Congressional testimony , Mr. Bush 's CIO admitted that the Bush White House misplaced all email correspondence from the period of March 1 through May 23 , 2003 .
This statement indicates the White House has broken two key federal laws : the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act .
The Bush White House may actually have " misplaced " as much as 225 days of email from 2003 , according to an Office of Administration request for contractors ' proposals .
When the Obama team enters the White House on January 20 , the building is likely to be filled with the droppings and detritus of the previous administration , including old computers .
According to Gewirtz , incoming officials may just want to get to work and those computers are likely to be treated like old office equipment .
But each computer the Obama team finds in the White House and the Executive Office Building ( EOB ) must be treated as evidence , catalogued and removed for forensic examination .
Under no circumstances should anyone on the incoming team boot up those machines or use them since they might overwrite deleted files that could otherwise be recovered , noting that " they could possibly cover the few remaining tracks that might be available , the few possible clues to a period of real upheaval in our history . "
He 's right .
The computers should be preserved , not only for the mishandling of emails , but for proof if it 's determined that the Bush administration might have committed other high crimes and misdemeanors .
There is also the question , as noted by ZDNet , of whose duty it is to preserve that information .
Is it the responsibility of the White House staff or the National Archives to preserve , respectful of the time limits necessary for presidential confidentiality , relevant content , communications trails , etc . ?

“ This is history , ” says economist Ram Bhagavatula , who 's also managing director at Combinatorics Capital .
“ December payrolls will be weak as well .
The leading indicators will come from a slow re-activation of the credit markets and increases in consumer spending .
You should begin to see that in the next couple of months . ”
Managing Your Career :
Bhagavatula is among a growing number of economists who say the seeds of recovery are already in place , even if they are revising their forecasts for GDP contraction in the fourth quarter to show an even greater decline .
" Every recession has its worst day , and this is probably the worst day , " says Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi .
Economists point to historical data and recent developments as solid grounds for optimism .
" This number is a unique number because it reflects an unprecedented economic situation , which began with the bankruptcy of Lehman on Sept 15 , “ says long - time Fed watcher David Jones , of DMJ advisors .
“ The economy has never been shut down as quicly as it was following that bankruptcy .
The economic response to that cut off in credit is unprecedented . ”
Jones points to significant downward revisions in September and October payroll losses .
Indeed , the November payrolls decline of 533,000 was enormous and the biggest since December 1974 , when they dropped about 600,000 .
But declines after that month — in what might be considered closer to the end of the recession than the beginning — were much less severe .
“ Severe drops like this ( the Sept. - Nov payrolls ) cannot be sustained , ” says Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact & Opinion Economics .
“ It suggests we are getting so weak there will be a turnaround . "
Science fiction pioneer Ray Bradbury , author of the Martian Chronicles , wrote the foreword to the recent special " space " issue of National Geographic .
Bradbury wrote about Mars ( ' natch ) .
From his essay :
In 1976 I was invited to stay overnight at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , waiting for news to come back from the Viking 1 lander , which was going to touch down on Mars and take photographs .
It was incredibly exciting to be there , surrounded by engineers , waiting for the first pictures .
There was a tall gentleman standing next to me , who I thought looked familiar .
At last I realized it was none other than Wernher von Braun , the man who had fled Germany for America to become the co-inventor of the rocket that took us to the moon and that was now taking us to the planets .
Early in the morning the photographs began to arrive .
I could hardly believe I was seeing the surface of Mars !
At 9:00 a.m. , ABC television put me on the air to get my reaction .
The interviewer said , " Mr. Bradbury , how do you feel about this landing ?
Where are the Martian cities and where are all the living beings ? "
" Do n't be a fool , " I said .
" WE are the Martians !
We 're going to be here for the next million years .
At long last , WE ARE MARTIANS ! "
That was the end of the interview .
I 'm Israeli .
My family lives in Israel .
I visit every year .
So please listen , I have a pretty good understanding of the consensus over there .
As far as the quotes , I know I 've said horrible things in anger , and may have even acted on some of those feelings if given the chance , that I regret .
When coffee shop , bus , mall , theatre suicide bombs go off in Israel ( which is not uncommon ) , yes , people get angry .
Think back to 9/11 , right here in the US , how many arabs and middle easterners were discriminated against ?
its human nature I guess , to pick on people that are different from them .
Sad , but true .
But the country is not about hate .
Pride , maybe , but not hate .
And Pride they should have .
The Jews have been picked on throughout history , way before modern day wars .
I 'm talking way back to ancient times .
I think we can agree on that .
Americans have pride too .
Was 9/11 not an excuse to invade Iraq and Afghanistan because the people were blinded by pure revenge ?
Now look at Iraq .
If I , or you , were an Iraqi child that had a family member killed by a US soldier ( and statistically every family in Iraq has had that happened to them ) would you not also bear arms against them ?
Israel has to put up with this on a constant basis .
But they try and make it work .
We can go into certain parts of Egypt and Jordan , but god forbid we go too far in where Israeli's are treated as a black man in some deep south part of the US .
We gave Egypt back the Sinai .
Hell , we even gave Gaza back .
But like most civilians said even when that was going on , it was only a temporary fix , and obviously they were right .
When Israel was deciding whether or not to give Gaza back , supporters hung blue ribbons from their cars .
If you walked around israel at that time , you would be amazed to see almost every car driving by with one of those blue ribbons , or tied on a backpack , or hung outside a home .
Israelis want peace !
Of course .
Why would you want to be threatened with suicide bombings and terrorist organizations .
In fact , its not just the terrorists they are dealing with , its the other governments as well .
Us getting angry over a few words said in anger is regrettable , and especially , I would assume , for you OP with your avatar of M.L.K.jr .
I 've seen so many threads lately displaying graphic videos or pictures of the battles , with titles like " Israelis murdering innocents . "
Come on guys .
Look up news articles of every suicide bomb that has taken the lives of countless Israeli men , women , and children .
They are graphic too .
Hell , look at the videos and read the news articles of what US soldiers have done in Iraq .
Its all awful .
Read about a pair of Israeli teenagers who were close to a border country .
How they were captured , tied up to the back of a truck , and dragged throughout a neighboring town until they were dead .
Believe me Israel wants peace .
It wasnt but last summer I was over there when Israel was negotiating with Hamas to release the bodies of 2 soldiers that were captured nearly 2 years prior and were killed by the group in exchange for a live prisoner Israel had captured of a man who was renowned for murdering entire families , including the women and children , in front of eachother .
What a horrible trade for Israel .
But was that not also to try and spread some peace ?
I know that if I were over there , I would much rather be held in an Israeli jail than any other nation in the middle east .
The point is , evil begets evil .
Bad things happen , terrible things are said , on ALL sides .
Women and children get caught in the crossfire .
Its awful .
And even worse , threads like these , only further that hate and discrimination .
If we are who we say we are , we wouldnt single out an entire nation , religion , race ( and saying " not everyone " does not mean your not singling out ) .
Yes they news needs to be spread , but why in such horrible ways .
We know war is awful .
I doubt anybody in a war wants to be there , in the middle of it , actually doing the dirty work .

Infections following treatment in clinics , retirement homes , and long - term care facilities are a grave problem for patients , and resistant germs can be particularly devastating .
“ High infection rates are in particular observed related to implants , catheters , and stents , ” reports Karl Gademann , “ those for urinary catheters mounting up to 30 % per week ! ”
In cooperation with his team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne , he has developed a process for coating surfaces with an antimicrobial layer .
As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie , their system is based on hybrid molecules derived from various natural products .
For a patient , the results are particularly grave if an infection occurs in an implant .
Usually , replacement of the affected part is the only possible treatment .
“ One particularly attractive approach is the application of antibiotics directly on the material , ” says Gademann .
To test their idea , the team from Lausanne chose to use natural product hybrids : biologically active fragments of various natural products are coupled to combine two different modes of action .
The hybrid produced by Gademann ’s team is made of three parts : two natural products are coupled by means of a polymer bridge .
The first substance is anachelin , an iron transporter ( siderophore ) from cyanobacteria .
Anachelin strongly and selectively binds metal oxides .
The majority of implants are made from a metal oxide : highly biocompatible titanium dioxide .
Anachelin fixes the hybrid firmly to the surface of the implant .
The second natural product is the antibiotic vancomycin , which disrupts the biosynthesis of cell walls and thus stops bacterial growth .
The coupling component is polyethylene glycol , a chemically inert , nontoxic polymer .
It also assures that dead bacteria and cell components cannot bind to the surface .
The hybrid can be applied to titanium dioxide components in a simple dunking procedure .
“ We were able to demonstrate that our hybrid firmly attaches to titanium dioxide surfaces and effectively hinders infection with Bacillus subtilis as well as the attachment of cellular material , ” says Gademann .
In a confrontational and much - needed LewRockwell.com article , Prof. William Anderson launched a counter - attack against mainstream academic economists ’ refusal to consider seriously the Austrian School ’s theory of money .
Despite the fact that Ludwig von Mises ’ 1912 theory of money explains booms and busts better than rival theories , and despite the fact that Austrian School disciples predicted the most recent bust when academic economists denied that such a bust was imminent , Austrian School economists get no respect .
I could almost hear Aretha Franklin as I read Anderson ’s essay .
I would put it somewhat differently .
I would say that the nine - decade blackout on Mises ’ theory of money has fared better than the seven - decade blackout on his theory of why socialist economic calculation is impossible ( no capital markets ) , and therefore socialism as a system will fail .
What rescued Mises ’ theory of socialism was the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union in 1988 , the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , and the suicide of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Reality had undeniably triumphed .
So , grudgingly , there was a new willingness by a few mainstream economists to give Mises ’ 1920 essay , “ Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth , ” at least a footnote .
One old - line socialist even admitted in print that Mises had been right .
Robert Heilbroner , who became a multimillionaire from royalties on his undergraduate textbook on the history of modern economic thought , The Worldly Philosophers , which did not mention Mises , said so in print .
He made his admission in a non-economics setting : The New Yorker ( Sept. 10 , 1990 ) .
So far , there has not been a breakdown of the monetary system comparable to the breakdown of the Soviet Union .
The Soviet Union always was , in Richard Grenier ’s magnificent phrase , Bangladesh with missiles .
Because it had power , Western intellectuals gave its system credence .
But it had always been blood and mirrors from 1917 .
When it went belly - up , Western economists at last abandoned ship .
They had not even made it in time to the lifeboats .
They had only their lifesavers to let them float away .
What we need — and what we are going to get — is a monetary crisis comparable in scope to the crisis of the Soviet Union .
Mises called this event the crack - up boom : mass inflation .
It will undermine the capital markets .
Thus , Western state capitalism , funded by fiat money through fractional reserve banks , will at long last achieve what socialist economies achieved first : economic blindness .
Meanwhile , Austrian School economists suffer from Aretha Syndrome .
Anderson writes :
Austrian economists and the intellectual tools they bring to the table are needed more than ever , yet the response of the economics profession has been to be even more aggressive in denouncing Austrians as “ quacks ” and “ charlatans ” and making sure that they are excluded from any academic and political discussions about this crisis .
However , if one wishes to see just how superior the Austrian position has been , the best proof is to watch clips of Peter Schiff ( Irwin ’s son ) , who is a well - known investor and fund manager , debate mainstream economists and other “ financial experts ” by using the Austrian analysis against their viewpoints .
Schiff clearly understands the nature of the crisis and how to stop the bleeding and cure the “ patient ” ; the others blindly stumble about , citing the “ expertise ” of economic theories that lead to nowhere .
For years , economists from the University of Chicago and others influenced by them have claimed that Austrian Economics is rejected by the mainstream because it “ fails the market test . ”
Their logic goes like this : ( a ) Mainstream economists accept good theory and reject bad theory ; ( b ) Austrian Economics is rejected by the mainstream ; ( c ) Therefore , Austrian Economics is bad economics .
The real market test is not what a guild of self - accredited academic economists write in the tenured safety of their tax - funded ivory towers .
It is not what a committee of equally subsidized peers determines is fit for publication in the guild ’s unread and unreadable academic journals .
It is the market outside the insulated halls of ivy that determines what survives and what does not .
MISES VS .
FISHER
We have seen a similar test before .
The real world imposed a vote of “ no confidence ” on an earlier critic of Mises : Irving Fisher .
Fisher was the dean of American economists in 1929 .
For two decades , his theory of money was dominant .
He did not accept Mises ’ theory of the effects of central bank fiat money : to destroy capital investment by lowering the interest rate below what it would otherwise had been .
Fisher believed in monetary aggregates , not monetary distortion .
The entire academic profession agreed with Fisher .
It still does .
The debate has not changed fundamentally in over nine decades .
Each side refines its arguments , but the basics do not change .
Mises used his monetary theory to predict the Great Depression of the 1930’s .
In 1929 , he turned down a lucrative job offer from Austria ’s Credit Anstalt Bank .
He was convinced that the bank was vulnerable to the panic that was coming .
He did not want his name associated with the bank .
In 1931 , its collapse triggered a wave of bank defaults in Europe .
Mises wrote a critique of Fisher in 1928 , which is available free on - line here .
It is found in the section on “ Monetary Stabilization and Cyclical Policy . ”
Fisher ’s conceptual error , Mises argued in 1928 , was that he did not recognize the distorting effects of monetary inflation , caused by expansionary central bank policies .
The price level — always a statistical tool of special interests — may remain stable , but this does not overcome the boom - bust effects of monetary inflation on the structure of production ( pp. 85— 88 ) .
Fisher ’s theory of money defined inflation as a rise in prices , not an increase in money .
His theory produced blindness to the effects of central bank inflation on relative prices , especially of capital goods .
Fisher did not see the depression coming .
Mises did .
On September 15 , 1929 , on the basis of his theory of money , Fisher issued this now legendary prediction : “ Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau . ”
He repeated this for months thereafter .
Fisher had invented the Rolodex card file .
He was a rich man in 1929 .
He lost his entire fortune , valued in the millions , plus the fortune of his wife ’s sister , in the ensuing depression .
It is amusing to learn that two staff economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis have used modern ( non-Austrian ) economic theory to conclude : “ Fisher Was Right ! ”
They published this in the Bank ’s in - house academic journal .
Many stock market analysts think that in 1929 , at the time of the crash , stocks were overvalued .
Irving Fisher argued just before the crash that fundamentals were strong and the stock market was undervalued .
In this paper , we use growth theory to estimate the fundamental value of corporate equity and compare it to actual stock valuations .
Our estimate is based on values of productive corporate capital , both tangible and intangible , and tax rates on corporate income and distributions .
The evidence strongly suggests that Fisher was right .
Even at the 1929 peak , stocks were undervalued relative to the prediction of theory .
It was a great theory , they say .
It was the theory that counted , not his forecast .
He was right in theory .
He was wrong in his prediction .
He was wrong in both .
The modern economics profession is so hostile to Mises , who argued that central bank inflation in the 1920 ’s caused the Great Depression , that they are still ready to swallow Fisher — hook , line , and sinker .
SCHIFF VS .
LAFFER
The debate goes on .
This time , however , it is between two real - world economists .
One has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago .
The other has no Ph.D. Neither is in academia .
They both sell their services as forecasters .
Schiff saw this bust coming and said so on national television in 2006 .
Laffer responded on - screen , dismissing this prediction as nonsense .
The video is here .
Schiff said that America would enter a major recession in 2007 or 2008 , and that it would be long and deep .
Laffer was contemptuous of Schiff ’s forecast .
“ I do n’t know where he is getting this , ” he said .
He was getting it from Mises .
He was getting it from Murray Rothbard .
In short , he was getting it from Austrian School economics .
Dr. Laffer has little use for Austrian economics .
He shares this opinion with 99 % of academic economists and stockbrokers .
He insisted that American tax policy was great , monetary policy was great , and there was no crisis facing the American economy .
Everything was just fine , Dr. Laffer insisted .
That was then .
This is now .
Now he says we are facing the end of prosperity .
He has now written an article in the Wall Street Journal , titled provocatively , “ The Age of Prosperity Is Over . ”
He had written this :
Financial panics , if left alone , rarely cause much damage to the real economy , output , employment or production .
Asset values fall sharply and wipe out those who borrowed and lent too much , thereby redistributing wealth from the foolish to the prudent .
Quite correct .
This is exactly what financial panics do .
Peter Schiff had predicted this financial panic .
Dr. Laffer had denied it was coming .
Good decisions should be rewarded and bad decisions should be punished .
The market does just that with its profits and losses .
He can say that again !
That is why I am pointing attention to a very good decision : Peter Schiff ’s decision in 2006 to go on national television and warn viewers about the financial panic that has now hit with devastating force .
Dr. Laffer made a bad decision : to tell viewers everything was A - OK .
Now , he says this :
Twenty - five years down the line , what this administration and Congress have done will be viewed in much the same light as what Herbert Hoover did in the years 1929 through 1932 .
Whenever people make decisions when they are panicked , the consequences are rarely pretty .
We are now witnessing the end of prosperity .
This is exactly what Peter Schiff was saying in 2006 .
He has not changed his views .
Dr. Laffer has changed his .
Dr. Laffer is not a fast learner , but he is not a suicidally slow learner , either .
He changed horses mid-stream — not in terms of economic theory but in terms of the terrible reality of the effects of the economic policies of Mr. Bush , Mr. Greenspan , and now Dr. Bernanke .
Dr. Laffer remains a non-learner with respect to Austrian School economic theory , but at least he can see what is in front of his nose : a major recession , a collapsing stock market , and a catastrophic economic policy .
He is therefore a lot faster learner than the non-learners on Tout TV who keep telling viewers that “ the bottom is near : so here ’s a stock to buy today to make money . ”
So , we find Dr. Laffer blaming the Federal Reserve System for the present crisis — not the FED under Greenspan , which he publicly praised in his debate with Schiff , but Bernanke ’s tight money policy , which ended in August 2008 .
As reported in the financial press ,
“ The Fed did not allow the money base to expand , and we had a panic in the liquid markets , ” Laffer said .
“ What caused this was financial panic , pure and simple . ”
Chicago School economists hate stable money — the kind of money provided by ( 1 ) the gold standard and ( 2 ) 100 % reserve banking .
They like “ mild ” money manipulation by the Federal Reserve System .
That was Friedman ’s argument in A Monetary History of the United States ( 1963 ) .
The FED did not inflate enough in the early 1930’s .
It was opposed by Murray Rothbard in America ’s Great Depression ( 1963 ) .
The FED inflated too much in the late 1920’s .
Both books were published in Princeton , New Jersey : one by Princeton University Press and the other by Van Nostrand .
Which book won Nobel Prize for its author ?
Which book did academia accept ?
Which one was ignored for 20 years until Paul Johnson discovered it and used it as the basis for his chapter on the Great Depression in Modern Times ( 1983 ) ?
Need I ask ?
SCIENTIFIC IS AS SCIENTIFIC DOES
Friedman , a disciple of Fisher ’s monetary economics , wrote in a famous essay in 1953 that the sole test for an economic theory is its ability to produce accurate forecasts .
Mises opposed this interpretation .
He argued for the sole test as internal consistency and the self - evident accuracy of a few axioms .
The great irony here is that Mises and those who use his theories have predicted recessions better than Fisher and his disciples .
Rothbard , who was in agreement with Mises on methodology , provided a summary of Fisher ’s forecasting abilities .
During the 1920s Fisher was the leading prophet of that so - called New Era in economics and in society .
He wrote three books during the 1920s praising the noble experiment of prohibition , and he lauded Governor Benjamin Strong and the Federal Reserve System for following his advice and expanding money and credit so as to keep the wholesale price level virtually constant .
Because of the Fed ’s success in imposing Fisherine price stabilization , Fisher was so sure that there could be no depression that as late as 1930 he wrote a book claiming that there was and could be no stock crash and that stock prices would quickly rebound .
Throughout the 1920s Fisher insisted that since wholesale prices remained constant , there was nothing amiss about the wild boom in stocks .
Meanwhile he put his theories into practice by heavily investing his heiress wife ’s considerable fortune in the stock market .
After the crash he frittered away his sister - in - law ’s money when his wife ’s fortune was depleted , at the same time calling frantically on the federal government to inflate money and credit and to re-inflate stock prices to their 1929 levels .
Despite his dissipation of two family fortunes , Fisher managed to blame almost everyone except himself for the debacle .
But what of Fisher ’s disciples ?
The head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , also named Fisher , remains in awe of him .
He writes :
During the first quarter of the 20th century , Irving Fisher was one of America ’s most celebrated economists .
But sadly , most Americans today have not heard of him .
Even as his reputation among the public faded with the years , his reputation within the economics profession has steadily risen .
Fisher ( no relation to the undersigned , though I would like to claim access to his gene pool ) was a pioneer in many theoretical and technical areas of economics that today are the foundation of central bank policy .
One such achievement was the creation of indexes to measure average prices , the bedrock for all current monetary policy .
His was a storied and successful career even if , by the time of his death , Fisher ’s own finances and reputation as an economic prognosticator lay in ruins .
We hope readers will find his life story interesting as they learn more about this pioneer of monetary economics .
The debate goes on because the strict free market views of Mises are anathema to academic economists , who are hired by the Federal Reserve System to continue the cheerleading .
The graduate schools without exception favor the FED .
Without exception , the textbooks do not treat the FED as a cartel , which it is , according to the definitions in the textbooks ’ chapters on cartels and oligopolies .
The one book that blows the whistle is Murray Rothbard ’s The Mystery of Banking , which was not aimed at a collegiate market and has never been assigned there .
You can get it free here .
CONCLUSION
The debate between Mises and Fisher , Mises and the Chicago School , and Schiff vs. mainstream economists in 2006 boil down to this : Can we trust the Federal Reserve System ?
The Austrian School ’s answer : no .
Why not ?
Because the Federal Reserve System substitutes the judgment of monopolistic central planners for consumers and investors .
It substitutes the decisions of people with job tenure and little accountability for the decisions of people who put their own wealth at risk .
It substitutes the judgments of non-owners for owners .
We find that academic economists , either tenured or seeking tenure , side with Fisher .
The textbooks side with the academic economists .
You would be wise to side with Mises .

Vârsta nu este un impediment în dragoste , tocmai de aceea Kelly Brook vrea să se mărite cu iubitul ei , Danny Cipriani , mai tânăr decât ea cu opt ani .
Deşi a avut o lungă relaţie cu actorul Billy Zane , în vârst ă de 42 de ani , femeia perfectă este abia acum sigură că şi-a găsit sufletul pereche .
Legătura pe care o are cu jucătorul de rugby o face să se simtă mai mult decât fericită .
 Îşi doreşte foarte mult să se căsătorească .
Ea a ţinut cont de fapul că Danny este mai mic cu opt ani decât ea , aşa că nu a grăbit lucrurile .
Dar nu s- a mai simţit niciodată aşa cu nimeni .
Au discutat despre faptul că trebuie să se stabilească la casa lor şi evident să se căsătorească .
Momentan nu vor să dezvăluie nimic , dar nu mai este mult şi îşi vor face publice planurile .
Iar pentru Danny sentimentele sunt aceleaşi , a mărturisit un prieten apropiat al cuplului .
Billy nu era pentru model bărbatul potrivit .
Brook mereu a ştiut că relaţia lor nu va merge prea departe .
 Ceea ce simte pentru Danny este foarte diferit .
Aceasta nu este doar o aventură .
Ei îşi petrec fiecare noapte împreună şi tot nu se satură , a adăugat sursa .
Kelly pare foarte încântată de relaţie , însă nu ştim cât de mult va rezista iubitul el .
Să nu uităm că vorbim de acelaşi bărbat care a apărut la o emisiune pe MTV , fără tricou , pentru a putea face rost de o întâlnire .
Şi , dacă ne amintim bine , tot el a fost îndrăgostit nebuneşte de Monica Irimia , una dintre gemenele Cheeky Girls .
Trecutul nu contează , cel puţin nu pentru Kelly .
Ea este convins ă că Cipriani îi împărtăşeşte sentimentele şi oricând se poate căsători fără probleme cu el .
 Mă pot hotărî ca mâine să fug , să am copii şi să trăiesc la ferma mea , unde o să fiu foarte fericită .
Probabil mult mai fericită .
Danny este mai apropiat de vârsta mea decât au fost ceilalţi bărbaţi cu care m-am întâlnit .
Dacă ştiam că este atât de bine , aş fi făcut - o acum mulţi ani .
Nu vreau să fiu nepoliticoasă sau să critic relaţiile anterioare , dar mai fericită decât sunt acum , nu am fost niciodată .
Mă simt o persoană total diferită acum , decât atunci când eram cu Billy , a mărturisit Brook .

Blizzard notched another victory in its legal campaign against World of Warcraft bots when a judge on Wednesday ruled that a leading bot violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
MDY Industries LLC , the firm that develops and sells the Glider bot , already suffered a major setback last summer when the judge granted Blizzard summary judgment on several key issues .
This week 's decision deals with the issues the judge believed could not be decided until the conclusion of this month 's trial .
The judge ruled that Glider violated the DMCA 's ban on " circumvention devices , " and he also found that MDY 's founder , Michael Donnelly , was personally liable for the actions of his firm .
As we 've noted before , Blizzard 's legal arguments , which Judge David G. Campbell largely accepted , could have far - reaching and troubling implications for the software industry .
Donnelly is not the most sympathetic defendant , and some users may cheer the demise of a software vendor that helps users break the rules of Blizzard 's wildly popular role playing game .
But the sweeping language of Judge Campbell 's decision , combined with his equally troubling decision last summer , creates a lot of new uncertainty for software vendors seeking to enter software markets dominated by entrenched incumbents and achieve interoperability with legacy platforms .
DMCA hairsplitting
World of Warcraft includes software called a " warden " that scans a user 's computer looking for bots such as Glider .
Blizzard contends that Glider violates the provision of the DMCA that prohibits " trafficking " in software that is " primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work " protected by copyright .
Judge Campbell has distinguished between the actual bits stored on the World of Warcraft disk ( which he called the " literal elements " of the game ) and the interface elements the user encounters as he 's actually playing the game ( which he dubbed " non-literal elements " ) .
In his ruling last summer , Judge Campbell ruled that Glider did not violate the DMCA with respect to the " literal elements " because Warden did not " effectively control " access to those elements : they are stored , unencrypted , on the World of Warcraft disk .
But he deferred until this month 's trial the question of whether Glider violated the DMCA with respect to the " non-literal elements . "
In Wednesday 's ruling , Judge Campbell found that Warden did effectively control access to the " non-literal elements . "
That is , while Warden does not prevent users from accessing the individual elements of the game separately , it does effectively bar users from accessing all of the elements together while playing the game .
Therefore , Judge Campbell concluded , MDY violated the DMCA when it evaded warden 's checks .
MDY argued that these " non-literal elements " did not constitute a distinct copyrighted work , and therefore could not trigger DMCA liability .
The firm offered two arguments .
First , the law only grants protection to works that are fixed in a tangible medium , and MDY argued that the " non-literal elements " were too ephemeral to qualify .
The judge rejected this argument , holding that it was sufficient that the " non-literal elements " could be recorded by screen - capture software , even if Glider did n't actually do so .
Second , MDY argued that the " non-literal elements " were not created solely by Blizzard , but by the interaction of Blizzard 's software with the user .
Hence , if the game experience was copyrighted , it would be the joint work of Blizzard and its users .
The judge tersely rejected this argument as well .
The other question Judge Campbell considered is whether Michael Donnelly , MDY 's founder and Glider 's author , should be personally liable for the infringing activities of his firm .
Donnelly contended that because copyright is unclear in this area , and because he believed his conduct to be legal , that he should not be personally liable for the infringing activities of his firm .
Judge Campbell rejected this argument , holding that Campbell was aware of his firm 's actions and should have known that they were illegal .
Ars talked to two legal experts at Public Knowledge , a public interest organization that filed an amicus brief in the MDY case last year .
Staff attorney Sherwin Siy compared Wednesday 's decisions to past decisions that tried to use the DMCA to limit competition in the garage door opener and printer industries .
He noted that the purpose of warden seemed less to control access to a copyrighted work than to a network service — quite a different thing .
Siy 's colleague Jef Pearlman agreed , warning that if the courts were n't careful , we could end up in a situation where " because anything can contain copyrighted works , any access to anything becomes a DMCA violation . "
Siy and Pearlman also expressed skepticism at the notion that these " dynamic , non-literal elements " constitute a distinct copyrighted work .
The in - game experience is assembled from a variety of disparate elements , including files already on the user 's hard drive , instructions from Blizzard 's server , and the decisions of the various players .
Judge Campbell 's ruling seems clearly out of step with the stated purpose of the DMCA .
When Congress passed the DMCA in 1998 , it was concerned with the specter of mass file - sharing on the Internet .
Yet in this case , there is no file - sharing in sight .
Glider is designed to be used by legitimate Blizzard customers who not only paid for their copies of World of Warcraft , but pay a monthly fee for access to Blizzard 's servers as well .
Blizzard is using the DMCA not to stop illicit file sharing , but as an all - purpose tool to control their users ' behavior .
Next stop : Ninth Circuit
It 's a safe bet that the ruling will be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , the appeals court that has decided many key high - tech copyright cases .
Although Wednesday 's ruling will be among the issues considered by the Ninth Circuit , the core of the argument will likely focus on the issues Judge Campbell decided last summer , especially the relationship between copyright law and contract law .
Blizzard argued , and Judge Campbell agreed , that when users violated the World of Warcraft EULA , they no longer had a license to play the game and were therefore guilty of copyright infringement .
As Siy noted in a blog post last year , Blizzard 's theory , if taken literally , would mean that violating any of the rules in the EULA and Terms of Service , such as choosing a screen name that did n't meet Blizzard 's guidelines , would be an act of copyright infringement .
And distributing software that helps users infringe copyright itself constitutes secondary copyright infringement , which could expose MDY to copyright law 's draconian " statutory damages " of $ 150,000 per act of infringement .
The law gives aggrieved parties to contract disputes much less potent powers .
Copyright was never intended as an alternative mechanism for contract enforcement .
If that theory is allowed to stand , it would dramatically strengthen end - user license agreements and create enormous liability for those who break them .
That would eviscerate the first sale doctrine and create tremendous legal risks for firms and free software projects that reverse - engineered other firms ' products for purposes of interoperability .
MDY may not be the world 's most sympathetic defendant , but there 's a lot more at stake in this case than World of Warcraft bots .
Savage Love DTMFA -a- Thon
I 'm a 34 - year - old straight woman living with a 32 - year - old straight man .
His daughter is 2 , and I am the only mother she has ever known .
( Her real mother is a crack whore somewhere . )
My boyfriend tells me he loves me , but it does n't feel like he wants to spend any time with me .
I pay the rent and am the only person in our household with a full - time job .
When I get home , I want to relax .
He wants to go out because he has been sitting at home all day .
If he has n't been at home , he has been running around with his friends .
This pisses me off , and I am not afraid to tell him so .
His response ?
" You 're just jealous because you have to work ! "
Damn right I 'm jealous !
Also , I do all the cooking and do n't get any help with cleanup or housework .
Other factors include my 13 - year - old son , who has had trouble adjusting to a baby in the house ; my boyfriend 's outstanding warrants ; and the fact that I have desperately wanted another baby for 10 years .
What on earth should I do ?
Back Against The Wall
Here 's one occupational hazard of the advice - column bidness :
If you 're not careful , if you 're not constantly on your guard , you can fill your column with letters like BATW's .
Your column fills up with letters from people asking , in essence , " DTMFA ? " and you 're forced to respond , " Yes , for fuck 's sake , DTMFA . "
( For those of you just tuning in : DTMFA stands for " dump the motherfucker already . " )
You may be helping people , sure , but your column quickly becomes a tedious slog , people stop reading , and then you have to get a real job at an auto plant or a hedge fund or a daily newspaper .
But there is one good reason to run DTMFA letters :
You can dispose of the letter quickly — keep the baby , if at all possible , BATW , and DTMF'ing freeloading , inconsiderate piece of shit — and move on to more interesting topics .
For instance : A new study out of the Bradley Hasbro Children 's Research Center found that " anal sex is on the rise " among straight teenagers and young adults .
According to a heavy - breathing report from ABC News , straight kids are having butt sex " to please a partner , to have sex without the risk of pregnancy , or to preserve their virginity . "
I 'm old enough to remember when getting fucked in the ass was considered a sex act , something that virgins , almost by definition , shied away from .
But that was before kids were subjected to religious indoctrination masquerading as sex-ed .
Abstinence " educators " emphasize the importance of virginity — but they only talk about vaginal intercourse because they figure if we do n't tell kids about anal sex they 'll never figure out what brown can do for them .
But they do figure it out .
And lacking accurate info , kids are n't just concluding that anal sex is n't really sex .
( " Otherwise it would 've been covered in our sex - ed classes , right ? " )
Kids are telling researchers that anal intercourse , unlike the premarital vaginal intercourse they were warned about ( STDs !
Pregnancy ! Eternal damnation ! ) , carries no risk of disease .
( I ca n't wait to tell all my dead friends ! )
I wanted to scream and yell about this study — and a DTMFA letter leaves plenty of room — but then I figured , you know , fuck it .
I 've been ranting and raving about the idiocy of abstinence education for 10 years .
Obviously I can't beat 'em , so I might as well join 'em .
All my life I 've had to listen to fundamentalist Christian bigots like Pat Robertson and Rick Warren — Rick Warren , Obama ? — fume about all the terrible , no good , really bad sodomy gay men get up to .
But I have n't been sodomizing the boyfriend all these years !
I 've been preserving his virginity .
I 've been preserving the shit out of my boyfriend 's virginity for 14 years now .
If my boyfriend ever decides to marry a woman — miracles can happen !— he 'll be able to wear white at his wedding .
Hell , he 's so pure he can wear Saran Wrap at his wedding .
And his wife will have me to thank for delivering him to her with his virginity intact .
( Unfortunately , the boyfriend can't preserve my virginity .
As a teenager , I had actual vaginal intercourse , under duress , with an actual female 's actual vagina . )
But until the boyfriend meets the right girl , I 'm going to keep preserving the living shit out of his virginity .
His virginity is n't going anywhere — not on my watch .
My girlfriend 's parents are very wealthy and are paying for her education .
They also bought her an apartment and give her tons of spending money .
My dad is dead ( beat ) and my mom is a waitress , and I 'm paying my way through school .
My girlfriend demands gifts and flowers .
I pay for everything when we go out .
Other than this , she 's sweet and attractive .
Once I graduate and start working , I 'll be happy to pay for everything .
But how do I convince her that things have to be more egalitarian for the time being without losing her ?
Boyfriend Reeling Over Killer Expenses
P.S. She 's only ever physically affectionate after I 've spent money on her .
DTMFA , BROKE .
And here 's hoping that the girlfriend 's parents invested all their money with Bernard Madoff , and that the spoiled - rotten little whore they raised has to get a job and start pulling her own weight .
And , hey , here 's another interesting study :
While straight kids are busily boning each other 's butts — the better to preserve their virginities !— gay teenagers are knocking each other up .
According to a study out of the University of British Columbia , lesbian and gay teenagers are seven times likelier to get knocked up than their straight peers .
How the hell does that happen ?
Well , gay teens are having straight sex in order " to prove they are heterosexual to avoid harassment and discrimination " by their parents and peers .
In other words , gay kids are still having heterosexual sex under duress .
This is where abstinence education and homophobia have gotten us :
Gay kids are having vaginal intercourse and straight kids are having anal intercourse .
Good work , sexphobes !
I 've been reading your column since I was 13 .
I 'm 20 now and dating a 41 - year - old crossdresser .
We were friends for six months before he told me he would n't be able to spend time with me anymore unless we " got closer . "
A couple months later , he told me he is into pegging .
Now , pegging is all he wants to do .
He also told me that he wants to transition from male to female , but he changed his mind and stopped going to his appointments .
All that is background to what has been happening recently .

generalist : a person competent in several different fields or activities
business software developing generalist : I know how to do the simplest tasks with many different languages / tools , but I can not be considered competent with any of them .
me : So , I see you have Erlang on your resume , how do you like the language ?
candidate : I like it 's concurrency handling , but I 'm a bit weary of it 's syntax .
me : ( thinking - okay , do you have any original thoughts on Erlang ? )
I can understand those points of view , what problem were you trying to solve with Erlang and why did you think it was the right tool ?
candidate : Oh , I really only got through the 2 minute tutorial , you know , hello world basically .
But if you guys have Erlang projects you want me to work on I 'm happy to , I 'm a generalist , I like all languages .
me : Okay , so what language would you say you know the most about ?
candidate : I do n't bother to specialize , I do a little bit with each language , you know , hello world or whatever , so I can use the right tool for the job .
That 's the best part of being a generalist .
me : ( thinking - this interview is already over )
Okay , so tell me about the languages / tools you 've had to use at your different jobs ?
If you read my blog entry on Language Specialization you might have concluded that I prefer generalists .
If , in our industry , generalists were what the definition describes , then I would prefer generalists .
Unfortunately , business software developers seem to have created their own definition of generalist .
I blame Scott Ambler .
To me anyway , it seems like the daft generalist movement started when Scott wrote Generalizing Specialists
Our industry has always been saturated by bad programmers .
I 'm on record stating that at least 50 % of the people writing business software should find a new profession .
The problem with bad developers is that they take good ideas and turn them in to monstrosities .
I remember reading Generalizing Specialists and being inspired .
I thought Scott gave fantastic and relevant advice .
Unfortunately , many bad or junior developers heard :
Do n't bother to deeply understand anything , instead , you 're agile if you know a little about everything .
Suddenly , when I started interviewing developers I ran into situations like this .
Inevitably , the candidate does n't even have a deep understanding of the tools they 've used at work , because they are too busy doing hello world in every language invented .
They also love to say that they take the Pragmatic Programmers advice to extreme and ' learn ' several languages a year .
The truth is , these generalists have little in the way of valuable knowledge .
They provide their projects with little more knowledge than a Google search can bestow in 30 minutes .
In short , they 're worthless , if not destructive I do n't actually blame Scott Ambler .
In my opinion he was right then , and he 's right now .
Become a Generalizing Specialist is still the advice that I currently give developers .
Specializing in something makes you an asset to the team .
If I 'm building a Web 2.0 website , I want everyone to have an understanding of HTML , CSS , Javascript , Ruby , & SQL .
However , I also want each team member to specialize in one of those areas .
Knowing IE quirks is just as important as knowing how to optimize MySQL .
And , I want to make sure I have team members that can get into the deep , dark corners of delivering highly effective software .
That does n't mean everyone needs to know what a straight join in MySQL does , but at least 1 person should .
The rest of the team is n't entirely off the hook though , they better understand how to write basic SQL statements that are maintainable and at least semi-performant .
Becoming a Generalizing Specialist takes time , but the first step is becoming a Specialist .
Once you deeply understand one language / tool , you can move on to the next relevant language / tool .
How do you know when it 's time to move on ?
When you start having answers to questions that people are n't asking .
If you 're constantly looking up answers to common questions , you are n't a specialist .
However , if you start providing more ( relevant ) detail in your answers than people are looking for , you 're on your way to possessing the deep understanding that a Specialist should have .
At that point , it 's probably time to start looking deeply into something else .
One painful mistake to look out for is specializing in something less relevant .
If you work for a trading firm that writes only thick client applications , understanding why Chrome 's Javascript VM is better than Firefox 's Javascript VM is probably not the best use of your time .
It 's true that you may move on to a web application at some point , but by then your information will probably have become stale anyway .
Stick to specializing in things that you work with day to day .
Your language , your IDE , the Domain Specific Languages you use in your applications ( regular expressions , SQL , LINQ , etc ) , or the frameworks you use ( Spring , ASP.net , etc ) are things you should specialize in to increase the value you provide to your team .
Eventually , you become competent with several different tools and languages .
You 've become a Generalizing Specialist and as such you are significantly more valuable to your team .
I was sixteen years old in the late summer of 1994 .
I ’d left public high school that spring and spent the entire summer splitting my time between hanging out on in UVa ’s empty computer labs ( what better a place to play Doom ? ) and on the Downtown Mall some twenty blocks away .
Each morning I ’d get a ride into town with my father , sleeping through the lengthy trip , groggily assemble my bicycle when we ’d arrived and head off for another day ’s adventure .
Come fall I ’d decided not to attend Murray High School , which had accepted me a couple of months previously , but instead to enroll in a new home schooling group turned private school , The Living Education Center for Ecology and the Arts .
This courtesy of my friend Patrick — we ’d met at a protest some months previous , and his parents owned the school .
His parents had also invited me to join the family of four to see Vice President Al Gore visiting town .
I ’d seen President Clinton speak at Monticello in 1992 , on his pre-inaugural trip across the nation , and it seemed worthwhile to see what the veep had to say for himself .
At the time I was deeply involved with a public internet access program housed at UVa named the Hopper Project ( soon to be renamed the Monticello Avenue Virtual Village ) , and with Gore talking a lot about this “ information superhighway , ” I relished the chance to ask him what the hell he meant by that .
So I went .
On the day itself I got a lift with Patrick ’s family .
We drove out to the city airport , clutching our tickets , where a couple hundred of us spent at least an hour milling about in a small hangar while men in black suits with earpieces did whatever they do .
When the doors finally opened to the runway we found that folding chairs had been set up in front of a small stage .
Steel light trees flanked the stage , trimmed with gelled fresnels , each light directed with barn doors .
( Patrick and I were both lighting geeks at Live Arts , so such things fascinated us . )
Air Force II landed before long .
It taxied right up to the stage , where a casually - dressed Vice President Al Gore disembarked , strode up to the podium , and began to speak .
I could n’t tell you what he talked about .
As a relatively politically disengaged sixteen year old , I ’m not sure that I followed him particularly closely .
But I did have the good sense to realize that this was cool , and I ’d want to remember it .
Al Gore works a ropeline in San Francisco last year .

When he was done speaking , after we ’d all finished applauding , he came forward and began shaking hands .
A waist - high metal barricade separated us from him , and the couple hundred of us in attendance all pushed forward in an effort to meet the vice president .
I positioned myself such that he eventually made his way down to me .
Upon shaking his hand I realized that I had nothing to say .
Nothing interesting , nothing clever .
So , stupidly , I asked him what this “ information superhighway ” was .
He gave me a fluffy answer , having no idea that while I was not licensed to drive on the actual highway , I ’d spent a fair bit of time on his metaphorical highway .
I nodded sagely as he spoke to me for about thirty seconds and thanked him for his time before he moved down the rope line .
I continued to stand there post - encounter , figuring that standing there had paid off once , so why not remain a bit longer ?
The crowd swelled along with Gore ’s movements , pushing forward and moving down the runway with him — I moved along with them , since it was easier than fighting the tide .
When the vice president had moved perhaps ten feet from me , that was when Patrick and I noticed an alarming development .
The crush of the crowd had tilted the steel light tree immediately next to us .
Bristling with hundreds of pounds of lights — to say nothing of the weight of the steel framework itself — it had begun its downward arc .
Directly towards the head of the vice president .
Patrick and I dove for the rig , wedging our shoulders underneath it to prevent it from falling any farther .
We were n’t nearly strong enough to right it , but we could temporarily arrest its descent .
Fortunately some bystanders saw our predicament and jumped into action , helping to right the whole thing .
A few of us stood around afterwards , marveling how close Al Gore had come to being crushed , and how oblivious that his two Secret Service bodyguards had been to the entire affair .
We went home afterwards , and school and life went on normally .
Patrick and I went on to publish a popular Charlottesville zine , titled “ Distribution , ” in one issue of which we described the incident .
When a local weekly wrote about our zine sometime later they classified that article as fiction , which was understandable given how bizarre the whole affair was .
( The final issue of Distribution is available as PDF .
The publication subsequently morphed into cvillenews.com . )
Fortunately we had enough witnesses , one of whom we know to this day , that we know the incident was n’t merely the product of overactive teenaged imaginations .
Of course , nobody knows what would have happened if the thing had actually fallen .
The story is much better , though , if labeled as a life - and - death moment .
Like the time I was a roadie for the Rolling Stones .
And that , as I like to think of it , is the time I saved Al Gore ’s life .
Interpreters provide vital local knowledge , as well as language skills .
By Humphrey Hawksley
BBC News , Baghdad
The Pentagon has rescinded a controversial decision that banned Iraqi interpreters working for US troops in Baghdad from protecting their identities by wearing ski-masks .
The ban was meant to reflect the improved security situation - in which interpreters were no longer afraid of retaliation .
But that is not the case .
" If anyone of my neighbours see me with this uniform I will get killed , " said an interpreter working with the US 4 - 10 Cavalry Regiment , which patrols a large part of western Baghdad .
" Maybe they will kill my family .
That 's the issue " , he added .
About 30 interpreters work with the 300 troops from a large camp that used to be a luxury shopping mall .
To be a successful linguist you have to act when you translate , to make the other side understand if they are serious or not serious
Zeeman , an Iraqi translator Another interpreter , who only wanted to be known as Zeeman , said he had worked for too many years against too many different militia to feel safe .
" I am married and I have a family and we have to remember that these forces are leaving one day and we are staying here . "
He explained further : " If these people here see the same faces as they see with the Americans and American is not here ? "
The question was left hanging , with no doubt as to his fear .
Some 300 interpreters have been killed during the war in Iraq , and they are seen as a crucial link between the US forces and Iraqi communities trying to recover from the years of violence .
" It would have been tough to get where we are today without our interpreters , " said the regiment commander , Colonel Monty Willoughby .
" We know that they get spooked and scared , and we try to protect their identity as much as possible . "
' At grave risk '
Out on patrol with Zeeman , we called first at a local Iraqi police station where he translated an intelligence briefing .
We then headed to a empty building lot nearby where it was thought weapons might be hidden .
He apologised to the residents as our Humvees blocked the street and during the search - that yielded nothing - he liaised between the police and the US soldiers .
Finally , he introduced the patrol commander to Iraqi soldiers manning traffic checkpoints .
" To be a successful linguist you have to act when you translate - act exactly what 's going on - to make the other side understand if they are sad , if they are happy , if they are serious or not serious . "
US officials at first tried to defend the Pentagon ruling , saying interpreters could seek alternative employment if they were unhappy with it .
Interpreting through interrogation in Ramadi , Iraq
But the issue was taken up by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden .
He sent a Congressional petition to the US Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
" Preventing interpreters from concealing their identities puts their lives , as well as the lives of their families at grave risk , " said the petition letter .
It went on : " The heightened threat could also reduce the numbers of interpreters available in Iraq , due to death and resignations , and put American service members and their missions in danger . "
Col Willoughby said the mask ban had now been lifted and that decisions could be made at an operational level .
" We ask them not to wear masks , " he said .
" But troop commanders can make that determination . "
Zeeman does not give his real name and does not want his face filmed .
He has worked without a mask for some time , realising that it helps the hearts and minds campaign .
" But the decision needs to be in my hands , not in the hands of someone in Washington who knows nothing about how we work . "

Schedulers : the plot thickens
The RSDL scheduler ( since renamed the staircase deadline scheduler ) by Con Kolivas was , for a period of time , assumed to be positioned for merging into the mainline , perhaps as soon as 2.6.22 .
Difficulties with certain workloads made the future of this scheduler a little less certain .
Now Con would appear to have rediscovered one of the most reliable ways of getting a new idea into the kernel : post some code then wait for Ingo Molnar to rework the whole thing in a two - day hacking binge .
So , while Con has recently updated the SD scheduler patch , his work now looks like it might be upstaged by Ingo 's new completely fair scheduler ( CFS ) , at version 2 as of this writing .
There are a number of interesting aspects to CFS .
To begin with , it does away with the arrays of run queues altogether .
Instead , the CFS works with a single red - black tree to track all processes which are in a runnable state .
The process which pops up at the leftmost node of the tree is the one which is most entitled to run at any given time .
So the key to understanding this scheduler is to get a sense for how it calculates the key value used to insert a process into the tree .
That calculation is reasonably simple .
When a task goes into the run queue , the current time is noted .
As the process waits for the CPU , the scheduler tracks the amount of processor time it would have been entitled to ; this entitlement is simply the wait time divided by the number of running processes ( with a correction for different priority values ) .
For all practical purposes , the key is the amount of CPU time due to the process , with higher - priority processes getting a bit of a boost .
The short - term priority of a process will thus vary depending on whether it is getting its fair share of the processor or not .
It is only a slight oversimplification to say that the above discussion covers the entirety of the CFS scheduler .
There is no tracking of sleep time , no attempt to identify interactive processes , etc .
In a sense , the CFS scheduler even does away with the concept of time slices ; it 's all a matter of whether a given process is getting the share of the CPU it is entitled to given the number of processes which are trying to run .
The CFS scheduler offers a single tunable : a " granularity " value which describes how quickly the scheduler will switch processes in order to maintain fairness .
A low granularity gives more frequent switching ; this setting translates to lower latency for interactive responses but can lower throughput slightly .
Server systems may run better with a higher granularity value .
Ingo claims that the CFS scheduler provides solid , fair interactive response in almost all situations .
There 's a whole set of nasty programs in circulation which can be used to destroy interactivity under the current scheduler ; none of them , says Ingo , will impact interactivity under CFS .
The CFS posting came with another feature which surprised almost everybody who has been watching this area of kernel development : a modular scheduler framework .
Ingo describes it as " an extensible hierarchy of scheduler modules , " but , if so , it 's a hierarchy with no branches .
It 's a simple linked list of modules in priority order ; the first scheduler module which can come up with a runnable task gets to decide who goes next .
Currently two modules are provided : the CFS scheduler described above and a simplified version of the real - time scheduler .
The real - time scheduler appears first in the list , so any real - time tasks will run ahead of normal processes .
There is a relatively small set of methods implemented by each scheduler module , starting with the queueing functions :
void ( * enqueue_task ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ; void ( * dequeue_task ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ; void ( * requeue_task ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ;
When a task enters the runnable state , the core scheduler will hand it to the appropriate scheduler module with enqueue_task ( ) ; a task which is no longer runnable is taken out with dequeue_task ( ) .
The requeue_task ( ) function puts the process behind all others at the same priority ; it is used to implement sched_yield ( ) .
A few functions exist for helping the scheduler track processes :
void ( * task_new ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ; void ( * task_init ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ; void ( * task_tick ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ;
The core scheduler will call task_new ( ) when processes are created .
task_init ( ) initializes any needed priority calculations and such ; it can be called when a process is reniced , for example .
The task_tick ( ) function is called from the timer tick to update accounting and possibly switch to a different process .
The core scheduler can ask a scheduler module whether the currently executing process should be preempted now :
void ( * check_preempt_curr ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ;
In the CFS scheduler , this check tests the given process 's priority against that of the currently running process , followed by the fairness test .
When the fairness test is done , the scheduling granularity is taken into account , possibly allowing a process to run a little longer than strict fairness would allow .
When it 's time for the core scheduler to choose a process to run , it will use these methods :
struct task_struct * ( * pick_next_task ) ( struct rq * rq ) ; void ( * put_prev_task ) ( struct rq *rq , struct task_struct * p ) ;
The call to pick_next_task ( ) asks a scheduler module to decide which process ( among those in the class managed by that module ) should be running currently .
When a task is switched out of the CPU , the module will be informed with a call to put_prev_task ( ) .
Finally , there 's a pair of methods intended to help with load balancing across CPUs :
struct task_struct * ( * load_balance_start ) ( struct rq * rq ) ; struct task_struct * ( * load_balance_next ) ( struct rq * rq ) ;
These functions implement a simple iterator which the scheduler can used to work through all processes currently managed by the scheduling module .
One assumes that this framework could be used to implement different scheduling regimes in the future .
It might need some filling out ; there is , for example , no way to prioritize scheduling modules ( or choose the default module ) other than changing the source .
Beyond that , if anybody ever wants to implement modules which schedule tasks at the same general priority level , the strict priority ordering of the current framework will have to change - and that could be an interesting task .
But it 's a start .
The reason that this development is so surprising is that nobody had really been talking about modular schedulers .
And the reason for that silence is that pluggable scheduling frameworks had been soundly rejected in the past - by Ingo Molnar , among others :
So i consider scheduler plugins as the STREAMS equivalent of scheduling and i am not very positive about it .
Just like STREAMS , i consider ' scheduler plugins ' as the easy but deceptive and wrong way out of current problems , which will create much worse problems than the ones it tries to solve .
So the obvious question was : what has changed ?
Ingo has posted an explanation which goes on at some length .
In essence , the previous pluggable scheduler patches were focused on replacing the entire scheduler rather than smaller pieces of it ; they did not help to make the scheduler simpler .
So now there are three scheduler replacement proposals on the table : SD by Con Kolivas , CFS by Ingo Molnar , and " nicksched " by Nick Piggin ( a longstanding project which clearly deserves treatment on this page as well ) .
For the moment , Con appears to have decided to take his marbles and go home , removing SD from consideration .
Still , there are a few options out there , and one big chance ( for now ) to replace the core CPU scheduler .
While Ingo 's work has been generally well received , not even Ingo is likely to get a free pass on a decision like this ; expect there to be some serious discussion before an actual replacement of the scheduler is made .
Among other things , that suggests that a new scheduler for 2.6.22 is probably not in the cards .
( CNN ) -- Voluble real estate mogul Donald Trump called alleged Wall Street scam artist Bernard Madoff a " sleazebag " and " a total crook " Thursday in an interview on CNN .
Donald Trump said investors who lost money in a Ponzi scheme were victims of their own greed .
Trump recently hosted a party at his Palm Beach , Florida , estate , Mar - a - Lago , that was attended by several people who say they were victims of an alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme run by Madoff .
Madoff , 70 , is a former chairman of Nasdaq .
He was charged last week with fraud .
Trump , chairman and president of the Trump Organization , a New York - based real estate development empire , spoke with Kiran Chetry on CNN's " American Morning . "
CNN : How angry are people at this situation with Madoff ?
Donald Trump : ...
The people in Palm Beach , many of those people have been just ripped off by this sleazebag , and they 'll never see the kind of money that they 've seen .
You have some people gave 100 percent of their net worth to him in trust , because they trusted him , they trusted his family , they trusted everybody , and now they literally are selling their houses in order to live .
And some of them mortgaged their houses in order to give that money to this Madoff .
And it 's really a terrible thing .
I 'd see him around Mar - a - Lago , I 'd see him around Palm Beach -- and he 's a disgrace .
Watch the possible ramifications of the Madoff case »
CNN : ... How did he get away with this ?
How did so many smart people entrust somebody -- and we keep hearing over and over again , 100 percent of their money going to this guy .
Would you ever let 100 percent of your money go to something , even if you trusted the person ?
Trump : I would not , and a lot of my friends would not , but obviously a lot of my friends did .
The word is very simple .
It 's a word called " greed . "
Greed .
That 's all it is .
People were greedy .
They thought he was going to get them a little bit more return , or a lot more return .
I mean , he was a Svengali for rich people .
There are Svengalis for women ; this guy was a Svengali for rich people -- very rich people .
But when you think of a person putting up 100 percent of their net worth and even mortgaging their house , even though they had a lot of cash -- mortgaging their house to get more cash to this guy -- and now they 're going to have to go out , literally , and maybe work in a drugstore .
I do n't know what they 're going to do .
CNN : Did you lose money from Madoff ?
Trump :
No , I did not .
CNN : Some are blaming the [ Securities and Exchange Commission ] , saying for years they did not investigate any claims .
Chairman Christopher
Cox said there were some credible accusations against Madoff made nearly a decade ago that were never referred to the commission to act .
So what 's your take on the oversight , how the SEC and government handled this ?
Trump : I would not blame the SEC .
This guy was a total crook .
The people in his own organization supposedly did n't know about it .
Now , that 's another thing ; I find that hard to believe .
He 's got two sons , and they did n't know about it ?
And they worked there for years ?
I think the whole thing is a swindle .
I think even that 's a swindle :
The father said , " Look , you guys turn me in and pretend you do n't know anything and I 'll save my two sons . "
But it 's impossible for me to believe that his sons did n't know about this .
CNN : So you also think it 's impossible that he acted alone .
Trump : I do n't know how you could act alone .
They had three floors of a major office building .
How could one man be manipulating that much money without all of the people knowing -- without at least a large number of the people knowing about it ?
So I would certainly think that his sons are guilty .
All About Bernard Madoff • Donald Trump • SEC Activities
In 1999 , the Croatian novelist Slavenka Drakulić visited The Hague to observe the trials for war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia .
Among the defendants was Goran Jelisić , a thirty - year - old Serb from Bosnia , who struck her as “ a man you can trust . ”
With his “ clear , serene face , lively eyes , and big reassuring grin , ” he reminded Drakulić of one of her daughter ’s friends .
Many of the witnesses at The Hague shared this view of the defendant — even many Muslims , who told the court how Jelisić helped an old Muslim neighbor repair her windows after they were shattered by a bomb , or how he helped another Muslim friend escape Bosnia with his family .
But the Bosnian Muslims who had known Jelisić seven years earlier , when he was a guard at the Luka prison camp , had different stories to tell .
Over a period of eighteen days in 1992 , they testified , Jelisić himself killed more than a hundred prisoners .
As Drakulić writes , he chose his victims at random , by asking “ a man to kneel down and place his head over a metal drainage grating .
Then he would execute him with two bullets in the back of the head from his pistol , which was equipped with a silencer . ”
He liked to introduce himself with the words “ Hitler was the first Adolf , I am the second . ”
He was sentenced to forty years in prison .
Arendt in a Paris café , in 1935 .
Her celebration of the public realm was matched by a mistrust of the private realm .
To her , the personal was emphatically not political .
Photograph by Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust
None of Drakulić ’s experience in creating fictional characters could help her understand such a mind , which remained all the more unfathomable because of Jelisić ’s apparent normality , even gentleness .
“ The more you realize that war criminals might be ordinary people , the more afraid you become , ” she wrote .
What Drakulić discovered , in other words , is what Hannah Arendt , at the trial of Adolf Eichmann , in Jerusalem , some forty years earlier , called “ the fearsome , word - and - thought - defying banality of evil . ”
Drakulić titled her book “ They Would Never Hurt a Fly , ” after Arendt ’s description of a typical Nazi functionary who “ does not regard himself as a murderer because he has not done it out of inclination but in his professional capacity .
Out of sheer passion he would never do harm to a fly . ”
Arendt ’s concept has become so famous that it is hard to remember how bitterly controversial it was when she first used it .
Many readers resisted what looked like an attempt to trivialize the Nazis .
“ No banality of a man could have done so hugely evil a job so well , ” one critic wrote .
Yet even those who dispute Arendt ’s judgment acknowledge her influence on the way we think about political evil .
As long as ordinary people can be transformed overnight into mass murderers , we are still living in Hannah Arendt ’s world .
It is an ambiguous tribute to Arendt , then , that her scholarly and popular profile is higher today than at any time since she died , in 1975 , at the age of sixty - nine .
In the past few years , a number of Arendt ’s works have been published by Schocken Books , where she worked as an editor in the nineteen - forties .
“ The Origins of Totalitarianism ” has been accompanied by several collections of essays — most notably “ The Jewish Writings , ” edited by Jerome Kohn and Ron Feldman , which includes Arendt ’s wartime journalism .
Scholars around the world have kept pace with a torrent of studies — on Arendt and international relations , Arendt and human rights , Arendt and the Jewish question .
It is hard to name another thinker of the twentieth century more sought after as a guide to the dilemmas of the twenty - first .
Yet it is not just political theorists who find Arendt a source of fascination .
The most intense curiosity about Arendt in the past few years has had less to do with her work than with her life .
Above all , the publication in English , in 2004 , of Arendt ’s correspondence with Martin Heidegger , after decades of speculation about their relationship , brought renewed scrutiny to her intimate life .
To a thinker who believed that the personal was emphatically not political , this kind of attention would have been very unwelcome .
She derided the “ pseudoscientific apparatuses of depth - psychology , psychoanalysis , graphology , etc. ” as nothing more than “ curiosity - seeking . ”
Yet Arendt ’s deeply ambivalent relationship with Heidegger — her lover , teacher , and friend — has a more than personal significance , since it casts light on the most vexed issue in her work : her tangled relationship with Jewishness and Germanness .
Arendt ’s legend — or , perhaps it is better to say , her image — has become as important to posterity as her theories .
In part , of course , this is because Arendt is one of the few women in the traditionally male pantheon of political philosophy .
It makes sense that it is feminist readers who find the most food for thought in Arendt ’s image — even though Arendt denied that she was a feminist .
Julia Kristeva devotes some pages of her recent book on Arendt to her changing appearance , as documented in photographs : from the girlish “ seductress ” of the nineteen - twenties , gazing poetically at the camera , to the confident intellectual of the fifties , whose “ femininity . . . beats a retreat ” as her face becomes “ a caricature of the . . . battle scars ” received during her public career .
Kristeva ’s reverie on Arendt ’s “ psychic bisexuality ” is not the kind of attention that gets paid to Kant or Heidegger .
Yet it is a sign of the way that Arendt has emerged as something both more and less than a political theorist .
The most rewarding way to read Arendt , and the best way to make sense of both the strengths and the limitations of her work , is to approach her as Michelle - Irène Brudny does in “ Hannah Arendt : An Essay in Intellectual Biography ” : “ I definitely take Hannah Arendt to be less a political philosopher or a political theorist . . . than an author in the strong sense of the word . ”
Kristeva , still more emphatically , considers Arendt ’s writings “ to be less a body of work than an action . ”
Like so many Jewish writers of her generation , Arendt attempted in her work to shine the light of intellect on the extreme darkness she lived through .
That she chose to do this in the most impersonal of genres — philosophy and history — rather than through memoir , or even poetry ( which she loved to read , and wrote from time to time ) , is itself a clue to the immense psychological pressures that shaped her work and , in the end , partly disfigured it .
The power of the impersonal is the great theme of Arendt ’s work , and it is no coincidence that she first discovered it in the most literary , least theoretical of her books , “ Rahel Varnhagen : The Life of a Jewess . ”
It was the first book she wrote ( not counting her doctoral dissertation ) , but it was not published for almost two decades , and it remains , even today , a kind of orphan in the Arendt canon .
Readers of “ Eichmann in Jerusalem ” and “ The Origins of Totalitarianism ” tend to ignore this impressionistic biography of a late - eighteenth - century hostess and letter writer , whose Berlin salon was one of the breeding grounds of German Romanticism .
Yet the Rahel biography , as Kristeva says , is “ a veritable laboratory of Arendt ’s political thought . ”
Arendt acknowledged her deep affinity with Rahel Varnhagen , née Levin , calling her “ my very closest woman friend , unfortunately dead a hundred years now . ”
What they had in common was their predicament as highly gifted Jewish women in a culture that exacted a terrible psychic toll both on women and on Jews .
In Berlin , at the time of the French Revolution , Rahel ’s friends included some of Prussia ’s greatest minds .
They were drawn to her freedom from social convention , and to the exquisite sensibility that informed her cult of Goethe , her extensive correspondence , and her love affairs .
Yet during the Napoleonic Wars , as Prussian nationalism began to flourish , many of Rahel ’s German friends deserted her ; her Gentile fiancé , whom she saw as her ticket to respectable society , refused to marry her .
She was left alone with her inwardness , mourning “ the thing which all my life seemed to me the greatest shame , which was the misery and misfortune of my life — having been born a Jewess . ”
Not until she was dying did she decide that , all the same , Jewishness was the one thing “ I should on no account now wish to have missed . ”
When Arendt first discovered Rahel , in the late nineteen - twenties , she recognized her as both a tutelary spirit and a cautionary tale .
Arendt was born in 1906 , into a family that , like so many German Jewish families , ardently pursued Rahel ’s ideal of culture , or Bildung .
“ With us from Germany , ” she wrote bitterly during the Second World War , “ the word ‘ assimilation ’ received a ‘ deep ’ philosophical meaning .
You can hardly realize how serious we were about it . ”
Again like Rahel , Arendt was conspicuous for her intelligence from an early age ; as a young woman , she was nicknamed Pallas Athene .
When , in 1924 , she went to Marburg University , she entered into the study of theology and philosophy as into her own inheritance , even though she recognized that they might be uncomfortable subjects for a Jew .
When she signed up for a seminar on the New Testament , she sternly warned the professor , Rudolf Bultmann , that “ there must be no anti-Semitic remarks . ”
Yet Arendt could not have suspected just how fraught her encounter with philosophy would turn out to be .
Like all the most enterprising students , she enrolled in a class with Martin Heidegger .
Heidegger was then at work on his magnum opus , “ Being and Time , ” but already he had a reputation as a thrilling teacher .
As Arendt remembered a lifetime later , in her tribute to Heidegger on his eightieth birthday , “ Little more than a name was known , but the name made its way through all of Germany like the rumor of a secret king . ”
She was thus more than prepared to respond when the married , thirty - five - year - old professor began to fall in love with her .
The fact that Heidegger and Arendt were lovers was no secret to her close friends —
“ Oh , how very exciting ! ” Karl Jaspers exclaimed when Arendt told him — and it has been public knowledge since Elisabeth Young - Bruehl revealed it in her 1982 biography .
But the affair became a kind of highbrow scandal in 1995 , when Elzbieta Ettinger , a professor at M.I.T. , wrote about it in a short book , “ Hannah Arendt / Martin Heidegger . ”
Ettinger , who had been granted access to the Heidegger - Arendt correspondence for the purpose of writing a new biography of Arendt , instead made it the subject of a sensational exposé .
The book was loftily derided by Arendtians ; yet , without the curiosity that Ettinger excited , it is doubtful that Arendt ’s and Heidegger ’s estates would have consented to the publication of their letters , which cast a fascinating new light on this most important chapter in Arendt ’s life .
The correspondence , which is collected in “ Letters 1925 - 1975 , ” is revealing , first of all , in its very incompleteness .
Arendt kept all of Heidegger ’s letters , from the very beginning ; he kept few of hers , and none from the early years .
As a result , Heidegger ’s voice dominates the book , just as his personality and his decisions dominated the affair .
As one would expect , Heidegger — an older male professor , who also happened to be one of Europe ’s greatest philosophers — treats his teen - age lover with a combination of passion and condescension .
He is capable of poetic raptures : “ The demonic struck me .
. . .
Nothing like it has ever happened to me , ” he writes not long after their first meeting .
Yet while Arendt ’s intellect helped draw him to her , he is deeply patronizing about her intellectual ambitions .
He urges her to take a “ decisive step back from the path toward the terrible solitude of academic research , which only man can endure , ” and to concentrate instead on becoming “ a woman who can give happiness , and around whom all is happiness . ”
Understandably , after a year of covert meetings and emotional confrontations , Arendt left Marburg for Heidelberg , where , in Jaspers , she found a more equable teacher .
It is just possible to glimpse in the letters the pain that the affair caused Arendt — above all , by enforcing a sense of powerlessness .
Early on , in an autobiographical composition addressed to Heidegger and titled “ Shadows , ” Arendt described herself in the third person : “ Her sensitivity and vulnerability , which had always given her an exclusive air , grew to almost grotesque proportions . ”
As late as 1929 , when Arendt ran into Heidegger at a train station and for a moment he failed to recognize her , she found the experience shattering : “ When I was a small child , that was the way my mother once stupidly and playfully frightened me .
I had read the fairy tale about Dwarf Nose , whose nose gets so long nobody recognizes him anymore .
My mother pretended that had happened to me .
I still vividly recall the blind terror with which I kept crying : but I am your child , I am your Hannah .
—That is what it was like today . ”
The full significance of her experience with Heidegger did not unfold , however , until the early nineteen - thirties .
As the Weimar Republic collapsed and Nazi violence grew , Arendt began to hear unsettling rumors about Heidegger ’s sympathy with National Socialism .
Her letter to him on the subject is lost , but we can gauge her anxiety from Heidegger ’s response , which is tentatively dated “ Winter 1932/33 . ”
“ The rumors that are upsetting you are slanders , ” he begins , and proceeds to give an evasively technical defense of his treatment of Jewish students and colleagues .
( If he refused to supervise a Jewish student ’s dissertation , he explains , it was only because “ I am on sabbatical this winter semester ” ; and , besides , “ the man who , with my help , got a stipend to go to Rome is a Jew . ” )
Nowhere in the letter is there any denial of Nazi sympathies .
Instead , Heidegger simply assures Arendt that , whatever happens , “ it can not touch my relationship to you . ”
After reading this letter , Arendt could not have been entirely surprised when , in 1933 , Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and became the rector of Freiburg , with the mission of aligning the university with the new party - state .
Sasha became unexpected passenger number 125 en route to Boston
A Ugandan woman has given birth to a baby girl on board an international flight from Amsterdam to Boston after going into labour mid-flight .
The six - pound ( 2.7kg ) baby named Sasha was delivered on New Year 's Eve with the help of two doctors on the eight - hour - long Northwest Airlines flight .
Mother and baby were taken to a Boston hospital on landing and are doing well .
Sasha was deemed a Canadian citizen for customs ' purposes because she was born over Canada 's airspace .
Canada 's immigration ministry has not yet commented .
The rare trans -Atlantic birth was greeted with cheers and applause from passengers on board flight 59 , reports said .
The excitement began some six hours into the flight , when the Ugandan woman who was eight months pregnant went into heavy labour .
Flight crew located two doctors on board the plane , and the woman gave birth to Sasha at 0900 Boston time ( 1400 GMT ) - some 90 minutes before touch down .
" Everybody was there to help , " Dr Natarajan Raman , who helped deliver the child , told the Boston Globe .
" People offered baby food , people brought things , people vacated their seats ... The spirit of America is alive , " he added .
The mother 's identity - as well as her reasons for travelling so late into her pregnancy - were not clear .
She was said to be travelling with a toddler and a friend .
A 6 - year - old boy from Virginia somehow managed to get the keys to his family ’s car and take a drive to his school on Monday ( and put his experience of driving in video games to the test ) .
The boy , whose name has yet to be released , missed his bus but was still intent on arriving to school somehow .
With knowledge of driving from Grand Theft Auto and Monster Truck Jam in mind , the boy drove a 2005 Ford Taurus about six miles towards his school and completed a few 90 - degree turns before crashing .
Miraculously , the boy suffered just minor injuries .
The poor kid , who seemed almost hellbent on completing his mission , began walking to school after he exited the car .
County Sheriff Chuck Wilkins said , “ When he got out of the car , he started walking to school .
He did not want to miss breakfast and PE . ”
After crashing , the boy told police that his “ driving experience ” came from playtime of Grand Theft Auto and Monster Truck Jam video games .
Is n’t it a bit strange that the boy ’s parents allowed their 6 - year - old to play an M - rated game ?
Although he missed breakfast and perhaps PE as well , the boy was able to return to school after he was checked at a local hospital for injuries .
The story is n’t so bright for the boy ’s parents .
His mother and father were charged with child endangerment .
The mother was asleep when the boy grabbed the keys and drove off on his adventure .
As of now , the boy and his 4 - year - old brother have been placed in protective custody .

FORT COLLINS , Colo . ( AP ) 
A man accused of making unflattering online comments about his former lover and her attorney on Craigslist has been charged with two counts of criminal libel .
" It 's not a charge you see a lot of , " Larimer County District Attorney Larry Abrahamson said of the 1800s - era state law that can put people in jail for the content of their speech or writing .
Abrahamson charged J.P. Weichel , 40 , of Loveland , in October over posts he allegedly made on Craigslist 's " Rants and Rave " section .
The case began when a woman told Loveland police in December 2007 about postings made about her between November and December 2007 .
Court records show posts that suggested she traded sexual acts for legal services from her attorney and mentioned a visit from child services because of an injury to her child .
Police obtained search warrants for records from websites including Craigslist before identifying Weichel as the suspect .
Weichel shares a child with the woman .
Weichel , confronted by detectives at his workplace in August , said he was " just venting , " according to court records .
No phone listing could be found for Weichel , and his attorney , Michael Liggett of Fort Collins , did n't immediately return a message left Monday by The Associated Press .
Libel is commonly seen as a civil case .
Denver attorney Steve Zansberg , who specializes in First Amendment law , said prosecutors seeking criminal libel cases could have a " chilling " effect on free speech in Colorado , particularly over the Internet .
Abrahamson was n't so sure .
He said it is up to police departments to pursue cases .
Zansberg contends the law is outdated , is unclear about stating opinions and is written in such a way that dead people could be victims of criminal libel .
The statute allows prosecution for speech " tending to blacken the memory of one who is dead " or to " expose the natural defects of one who is alive , and thereby to expose him to public hatred , contempt or ridicule . "
Criminal libel carries a punishment of up to 18 months in prison .

HONG KONG ( Reuters Life ! ) - Michelin on Tuesday awarded its top three - star accolade to a Chinese chef for the first time in the celebrated gourmet guide ’s 108 - year history , as it released its maiden directory to fine dining in China .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The Michelin guide for Hong Kong and Macau awarded 28 restaurants in the two cities star ratings , including top billing for one restaurant in each city .
Eight restaurants got two stars and 18 establishments received one star each .
Hong Kong ’s three - star restaurant was Lung King Heen , a Cantonese eatery in the luxury Four Seasons Hotel , whose innovative head chef Chan Yan - tak is the first Chinese granted this prestigious culinary award .
“ We ’re very impressed by his cuisine ... in order to give him three stars he ’s been visited 12 times which means that he has very , very high consistent level and quality level , ” Jean - Luc Naret , director of the Michelin guide , told a news conference .
Only 72 restaurants worldwide hold three Michelin stars .
In Macau , the three - stars restaurant was Robuchon a Galera , run by renowned French chef Joel Robuchon , situated in the former Portuguese enclave ’s Hotel Lisboa .
The bilingual Chinese and English edition ’s other rated restaurants in Hong Kong and Macau span over 30 different types of cuisine , with over half the selection serving various types of Chinese food .
Michelin described Hong Kong as a culinary paradise with a diverse mix of food , particularly its exceptional Chinese food .
Of the 12 food inspectors who rated the restaurants , only two of these were Chinese , but Michelin played down any suggestions of the ratings being skewed by predominantly Western palates .
“ You do n’t have to be French to appraise French cuisine and you do n’t have to be Chinese to appraise Chinese cuisine , ” said Naret , who added efforts would be made to incorporate more local appraisers in future guides for the two cities .
The Hong Kong / Macau guide is the second launched by Michelin in Asia , after the Tokyo guide ’s release in November 2007 .
Tokyo’s 2008 guide had 9 three - stars restaurants , 36 two - stars and 128 one - star establishments .
A total of 202 Hong Kong and 49 Macau establishments are included in the guide , including 49 hotels .
( CNN ) --
We all make bad decisions sometimes .
In some contexts , to a certain extent , psychologists know why .
Chess players , with experience , learn how to make rapid judgments about their moves .
Much research on the subject was done by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky , who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for their models of how intuitive reasoning is flawed in predictable ways .
Kahneman is now professor emeritus at Princeton University , and Tversky died in 1996 .
But other researchers are working on showing that , when it comes to more basic judgments , we 're not so bad .
Research in the current issue of the journal Neuron offers a mathematical model for how people make decisions about visual stimuli on a computer screen .
They found that humans make accurate judgments about cues they can see .
" We 're discovering that humans are n't so stupid after all , " said Alexandre Pouget , co-author of the study and associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester in New York .
Participants were asked to look at moving dots on a screen .
Many of the dots moved randomly , but some moved in one clear direction .
Researchers found that people very quickly realized which way the non-random dots were going .
The work complements that of Kahneman and Tversky in that it shows humans are good at lower - level , nonlinguistic tasks , while perhaps not so good at higher - level probability problems involving words , he said .
" In simple perceptual decisions -- you have a visual stimulus on the screen and you have to make decisions about it -- it looks like you do accumulate the evidence optimally , given that uncertainty , " Pouget said .
Psychologists believe the human mind has two systems for decision - making : intuitive and reasoning .
The intuitive system is emotional , fast , automatic but slow - learning , while the reasoning system is emotionally - neutral , slow , controlled , and rule - governed .
Neither , of course , is always right , but there are certain simple problems that reveal flaws in intuition .
A classic example that Kahneman has often used in lectures is this math problem : A bat and a ball together cost $ 1.10 .
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball .
How much does the ball cost ?
Your intuitive system may quickly tell you that the ball costs 10 cents .
That would be an easy solution , but it would also be incorrect .
In fact , if the ball costs 10 cents , that would mean the bat costs $ 1.10 , so the two together would be $ 1.20 -- violating the first piece of information you had .
A little algebra , or a little more thought , reveals that the ball must have cost 5 cents .
Oops .
Now , think about tossing a coin six times .
Which is more likely : heads - heads - heads - tails - tails - tails or tails - tails - heads - heads - tails - heads ?
You might think that the second one seems more random , so it 's more likely .
That error would fall into what Kahneman and Tversky would call the representativeness heuristic or , more specifically , the misconception of chance -- in other words , we tend to go on our intuitive notions of what an unrigged coin toss should look like rather than actually calculating .
If you think about the probabilities of each , you 'll realize the two combinations are equally likely .
A related concept is called fundamental attribution error , demonstrated by Edward Jones and Victor Harris in 1967 .
The researchers gave people texts , some of which opposed Fidel Castro and some of which supported him .
Most subjects said the writers held the beliefs expressed in the essay , even after the experimenters told them that an instructor or experimenter had previously dictated the essay 's stance to the writer .
The point is that the subjects did not take into the account all of the situational factors when making a decision about the writers ' attitudes .
Intuition is not always wrong .
Expert chess players , for example , develop extraordinary speed in making moves , and learn to instantly recognize the available moves and strategies based on the board .
Team sports players operate in much the same way .
There are , however , limits to what intuition can offer .
Experts say it 's important to distinguish between decisions that should be made by intuition and those that require careful calculation .
" With respect to accuracy , it all depends on the nature of the decision .
I would not rely on my gut judgment when picking stock options for my retirement portfolio , for example , " said Alexander Todorov , assistant professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University .
Some of the most remarkable mental feats are done entirely without awareness , such as color vision , said Eldar Shafir , professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University .
Other tasks require more effort , with less impressive results -- for example , humans can't navigate as well as a honeybee , which has a brain the size of the head of a pin .
Todorov and Shafir both said the conclusions of Pouget 's moving dot study -- that people make good decisions about certain perceptual problems -- make sense .
" We -- like every other biological organism -- do some things remarkably well , and often unbeknownst to us .
Other things , we do remarkably badly , even if we might think -- sometimes with great confidence -- otherwise , " Shafir said .
All About Psychology
As a Minnesotan ... I 'm surprisingly not embarassed , but rather amused .
It shows that we do have a sense of humor afterall , though it can oftentimes be expressed in unusual ( and perhaps in this case , inappropriate ) ways .
I think the reason why it 's considered an overvote is because the person wrote in " Lizard People " for the Senate too , even though they voted for Franken .
It 's a tough call ... but I probably would count it .
I mean , in Florida , they counted write - votes for Donald Duck and Bill O'Reilly .

[ I have collaborated on this with my sister and historian Greg Dehler , author of “ Chester Allan Arthur ” , Published by Nova Science Publishers , Incorporated , 2006 ISBN 1600210791 , 9781600210792 192 pages . ]
I ’ve been forwarded the actual naturalization record for William Arthur on microfiche , obtained from the Library of Congress .
He was naturalized in New York State and became a United States citizen in August 1843 .
Chester Arthur perpetrated a fraud as to his eligibility to be Vice President by spreading various lies about his parents ’ heritage .
President Arthur ’s father , William Arthur , became a United States citizen in August 1843 .
But Chester Arthur was born in 1829 .
Therefore , he was a British Citizen by descent , and a dual citizen at birth , if not his whole life .
He was n’t a “ natural born citizen ” and he knew it .
We ’ve also uncovered many lies told by Chester Arthur to the press which kept this fact from public view when he ran for Vice President in 1880 .
Garfield won the election , became President in 1881 , and was assassinated by a fanatical Chester Arthur supporter that same year .
How ironic that the allegations started by Arthur Hinman in his pamphlet entitled , “ How A British Subject Became President ” , have turned out to be true … but not for the reason Hinman suggested .
Hinman alleged that Arthur was born in Ireland or Canada as a British subject .
It was bunk .
It ’s been definitively established that Chester Arthur was born in Vermont .
But Hinman turns out to be correct anyway since Chester Arthur was a British citizen / subject by virtue of his father not having naturalized as a United States citizen until Chester Arthur was almost 14 years old .
That means Chester Arthur was a British subject at the time of his birth .
We ’ve uncovered news clips exposing a thorough trail of lies , all of which served to obscure Chester Arthur ’s true history of having been born as a British citizen .
Chester Arthur ’s lies came during his Vice Presidential campaign in 1880 .
His fraudulent attempt to obfuscate family history provides context and evidence that in 1880 it was recognized that having been born as a British citizen would make one ineligible to be President or VP .
His falsification of family history indicates he was aware of POTUS ineligibility .
HISTORICAL CONTEXT
Chester Arthur was in politics at the time of the 14th Amendment ’s ratification .
He was a lawyer and a politician while the 14th Amendment was being debated .
It was ratified in 1867 .
In that same year Chester Arthur rose to become chairperson of the Executive Committee of the State Republican Committee .
He would have been fully cognizant of the natural born citizen issue and that should he ever run for POTUS or VP , problems could arise .
He would have known that if anybody found out his father naturalized after he was born , he could never be President or Vice President .
CHESTER ’S LIES
The definitive biography on Chester Arthur is “ Gentleman Boss ” by Thomas Reeves .
It ’s an exhaustive reference .
Many of the blanks in Chester Arthur ’s legend were filled in by this book which utilized interviews with family members and authentic documents like the Arthur family Bible .
It was a necessary work since old Chester Arthur was a very wily protector of his strange history .
He burned all of his papers .
( See page 2365 . )
“ Gentleman Boss ” establishes , on page 4 , that Chester Arthur ’s father William was born in Ireland , 1796 , and emigrated to Canada in 1818 or 1819 .
His mother Malvina was born in Vermont and his parents eloped in Canada in 1821 .
They had their first child , Regina , in Dunham , Canada on March 8 , 1822 .
By no later than 1824 , the Arthur family had moved to Burlington , Vermont .
Their second child Jane was born there on March 14 , 1824 .
Chester Arthur was their fifth child , and he was born on October 5 , 1829 .
Reeves established these facts ( and the correct date of Chester Arthur ’s birth ) from the Arthur family Bible .
From “ Gentleman Boss ” , page 202 and 203 :
“ … Hinman was hired , apparently by democrats , to explore rumors that Arthur had been born in a foreign country , was not a natural - born citizen of the United States , and was thus , by the Constitution , ineligible for the vice - presidency .
By mid-August , Hinman was claiming that Arthur was born in Ireland and had been brought to the United States by his father when he was fourteen .
Arthur denied the charge and said that his mother was a New Englander who had never left her native country — a statement every member of the Arthur family knew was untrue . ”
Arthur ’s mother had lived in Canada with her husband and even had her first child there .
In the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper , an article interviewing Chester Arthur about Hinman ’s accusations was published on August 13 , 1880 .
In that article , Chester Arthur defended himself as follows :
“ My father , the late Rev. William Arthur , D.D. , was of Scotch blood , and was a native of the North of Ireland .
He came to this country when he was eighteen years of age , and resided here several years before he was married . ”
This was another blatant lie .
His father emigrated from Ireland to Canada at the age of 22 or 23 .
William Arthur did n’t come to the United States until sometime between March 1822 – when his first child was born in Dunham , Canada – and March 1824 – when his second child was born in Burlington , Vermont .
The youngest he could have been when he came to Vermont was 26 .
On August 16 , 1880 Chester Arthur told the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper that at the time of his birth , his father was forty years old .
Another blatant lie .
His father would have been only thirty - three years old when Chester was born .
In that same article he lied that his father settled in Vermont and reiterated the lie that William came here at the age of eighteen .
This age discrepancy was exposed in the August 19 , 1880 edition of the Brooklyn Eagle in an article written by Hinman .
It was very convenient for Arthur that Hinman kept the focus on the extraordinary and false claim – that Arthur was born abroad – while the more subtle and true eligibility issue stayed hidden in plain site .
FATEFUL FACTS
I contacted Greg Dehler a few days ago after finding a reference in his Chester Arthur biography which said William Arthur became a citizen in 1843 .
I wrote to Greg and asked him about the reference .
As fate would have it , Mr. Dehler , after checking his notes , wrote back to me to say that he got it from Thomas Reeves ’ book , “ Gentleman Boss ” .
I went to the library the next day and devoured the Reeves book .
But the reference to William ’s naturalization was not there .
Greg also knew I was interested in the Hinman scandal and pointed me to the Brooklyn Eagle search engine from the Brooklyn public library .
I began poking around and discovered a few of the lies mentioned above .
Earlier today I was telling my sister that this matter of Chester Arthur having falsified his parents ’ personal history might lead to a very important revision of history .
I suggested we put together an outline of a book as we might be able to prove that Chester Arthur was a fraudulent President and that would be quite a story .
My sister thought I was jumping the gun a bit in that we really needed to define when William Arthur was naturalized before we could get excited .
About an hour later I received an email from Greg Dehler .
I ’ll let you read it :
Leo ,
Needless to say I was more than a little embarrassed that you could not locate the reference in Reeves .
I thought that was odd because my note concerning William Arthur was with the Reeves notes .
I conducted a more thorough search and found the source .
It was in the Chester A. Arthur Papers ( what is left of them at least ) at the LOC .
I own the microfilm reels and made a copy for you which is attached .
The Washington County Clerk in NYS dates it August 31 , 1843 .
How does this affect Chet ?
Greg
I almost fell off my chair when I downloaded the William Arthur naturalization PDF and was staring at the shifting sands of history .
Chester Arthur had something to hide .
He had all of his papers burned which was very odd for a President .
Arthur lied about his mother ’s time in Canada .
He lied about his father ’s time in Canada .
He lied about his father ’s age plus where and when he got off the boat from Ireland .
By obscuring his parents ’ personal history he curtailed the possibility that anybody might discover he was born many years before his father had naturalized .
When Chester runs for VP , Hinman comes along essentially demanding to see Chester ’s birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States .
This causes a minor scandal easily thwarted by Chester , because Chester was born in Vermont … but at the same time , the fake scandal provides cover for the real scandal .
Is this the twilight zone ?
William Arthur was not a naturalized citizen at the time of Chester Arthur ’s birth , and therefore Chester Arthur was a British subject at birth and not eligible to be Vice President or President .
Chester Arthur lied about his father ’s emigration to Canada and the time his mother spent there married to William .
Some sixty years later , Chester lied about all of this and kept his candidacy on track .
Back then it would have been virtually impossible to see through this , especially since Arthur ’s father had died in 1875 and had been a United States citizen for thirty - two years .
And without knowledge of his father ’s time in Canada , or the proper timeline of events , potential researchers in 1880 would have been hard pressed to even know where to start .
Reeves proved that Arthur changed his birth year from 1829 to 1830 .
I do n’t know if that would have protected recorded information .
It ’s another lie .
I just do n’t know what it means .
Because Chester Arthur covered up his British citizenship , any precedent he might have set that the country has had a President born of an alien father is nullified completely as Chester Arthur was a usurper to the Presidency .
He would n’t have been on the ticket if it was public knowledge .
Nobody knew Arthur was a British subject because nobody looked in the right place for the truth .
And it ’s no precedent to follow .

Recently over at the Bitten blog , Mark Bittman shared some shocking pictures of himself at home cooking turkey breasts .
Sure , the turkey looked great , but that kitchen ?
What was Mark Bittman doing in such a small kitchen ?
“ It appears that Mark has a kitchen just as small as most others in New York , ” wrote reader Mark .
“ Truly , it ’s not the size of the kitchen that counts , but how you use it , ” wrote another reader , Guy B. Jones .
Considering I have long used my lousy kitchen as an excuse not to cook , I decided to talk to Mark about the pleasures and frustrations of cooking in a less - than - perfect kitchen .
Q .
Okay Mark .
What ’s a popular food writer like you doing in a kitchen like that ?
A .
I got a bunch of e-mails that say , “ Can you believe all this stuff about your crummy kitchen ? ”
But the whole idea is that you do n’t need a fancy kitchen .
You do n’t need fancy equipment , and you do n’t need fancy recipes .
When I show people my kitchen , they believe it .
But I hate my kitchen also .
I bump my shins on the dishwasher .
There is not enough room to put stuff .
It ’s a terrible stove .
It ’s a terrible dishwasher .
I do n’t have room for the pots I ’d like to have .
I ’ve cooked in much worse , though .
I ’m used to it .
Someday I ’ll grow up and get a real kitchen .
Q .
So why do so many people think a nice kitchen will solve their cooking woes ?
A .
Maybe it ’s like what you said .
You use your crummy kitchen as an excuse not to cook .
Maybe it ’s like saying , “ I ca n’t exercise in the winter because I do n’t have an elliptical trainer . ”
I once cooked for six months in what amounted to a basement with a hot plate , microwave and a refrigerator and sink .
Not only did I cook for six months , but I wrote the column for six months .
It was funny .
People like to cook when they ’re camping and in other places where the situation is less than adequate .
For some reason they think they have to have a great kitchen to cook at home , but it ’s not true .
Q .
So what are your must - haves in a kitchen , and what can you live without ?
A .
One of the things I hate about my stove is you ca n’t put four pots on it at the same time , so you cook with two pots and use the oven more .
A functioning oven , the best possible stove … I think a big refrigerator is not that helpful .
Stuff that ’s in the refrigerator should n’t be in there all that long anyway .
You need a couple of sauce pans , a couple saute pans , you need some knives , and then you need to pick up what you need on an as - needed basis .
If you ’re going to roast a turkey you need something big to put it in .
When you need it you ’ll know you ’ll need it .
Some things you ’re going to find yourselves repeatedly wishing you had .
Those are the things you need .
Q .
Do you think people buy too much cooking equipment , or too many gadgets ?
A .
I think buying pots and pans in sets is prevalent .
I do think people overbuy .
They become enchanted with gadgets that are n’t that essential .
Bread machines were around for a while .
That was quite hilarious .
I do n’t have a toaster because I do n’t have room for it .
If I want toasted bread , I toast it in the broiler .
It ’s not horrible , and it ’s the way millions did it before the electric toaster was invented .
It ’s a trade - off between counter and cabinet space , money and need .
In Manhattan I do n’t have a food processor .
I ’d love to have one , but I do n’t have room for it .
Once a week , I think , “ Damn , I wish I had a food processor . ”
I ’m not going to find the space for it .
I ’ve chucked all my cookbooks because there is n’t room for them .
Q .
So do you find a bad kitchen as frustrating as the rest of us do ?
A .
I think part of me likes the inadequacy of it .
There ’s some pride involved .
But people come in and ca n’t talk to you when you ’re in the kitchen .
There ’s no room for two people to cook .
It ’s not really a galley kitchen .
It ’s about 7 feet wide and 8 feet long .
It has that beautiful window in it , which makes things much nicer .
The sad thing is the lack of storage and lack of counter space .
I could live with everything else , but that stuff is what drives me bats .
It ’s definitely not ideal , but great things can be done .

U.S. Navy Salutes Wave Energy Tech With A $ 3 Million Contract
November 6th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
The US Navy has awarded Ocean Power Technologies a $ 3 million contract for participation in the second phase of its Deep Water Active Detection Systems ( “ DWADS ” ) program .
[ social_buttons ]
Ocean Power Technologies plans to test an advanced version of the PowerBuoy system to power the DWADS program , which uses sophisticated oceanic data - gathering and communications systems to track vessels .
The project begins immediately and should be completed in about 18 months , the company said .
Under the first phase of the program — announced on October 16 , 2008 — OPT deployed an initial test design of its PowerBuoy 75 miles off the coast of New Jersey .
This first phase ocean test provided power generation data that validated OPT ’s power predictions for the system .
The new contract provides for ocean testing the autonomous device according to the Navy ’s operational requirements .
In addition , OPT will support the Navy ’s ocean test procedures in the areas of mooring design , at - sea operations and deployment .
Dr. George W. Taylor , Chief Executive Officer of OPT , stated , “ We are very pleased to have received this new contract from the US Navy , following the deployment of our first DWADS PowerBuoy last month .
It builds on our experience in deep - water power source applications . ”
Ocean Power has also signed a $ 2 million contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to deploy a PowerBuoy off the Oregon coast in the second half of 2009 .

Cocaine is a terrible drug — not just for humans , but for honeybees as well , whom it turns into exaggerating liars .
When researchers applied a drop of cocaine to the backs of feeding bees , they returned to their hive and gave a waggle dance — the stepping pattern by which bees communicate food location , and the one thing I retained from my 8 a.m.
Biology 101 class — that described the pollen as being far better than it was .
These findings , scheduled to publish on Friday in the Journal of Experimental Biology , are more than a slightly surreal way of passing time : they suggest that honeybees are affected by cocaine in ways similar to humans , and may be useful as experimental models of drug addiction .
According to the press release , the researchers " hope to find out whether the drug has as devastating an effect on honeybee society as it does on human society . "
One looks forward to the developmental studies on crack larvae .

Hi friends , my name is Alok Vats , and I am the owner of this website I News India .
From last six years I am trying to build this website , I started this website from scratch and then with the help of my friends like Pooja , Prachi , and Divya I published many articles over here .
Recently Harshita , Tanmay and Aayushi too joined my website , and am really glad to share some articles written by them over here .
I am sure many of you would love the same .
These days I am managing the site with myself only and the focus is to share blogs on the topics like Blogging Tips , Self Improvement , SEO , and all other things which can make you to enhance your life .
No , this is n’t an article from The Onion .
Really , I promise !
I grew up watching MTV ( and it ’s Canadian counterpart , MuchMusic ) .
It showed music videos 24 hours a day , 7 days a week from bands like Van Halen , Rush , Kraftwerk , The English Beat and all sorts of cool bands .
Shows were hosted by cool VJ ’s such as Marth Quinn .
As time passed the execs at MTV found that we had shorter attention spans and started just showing 3 minute clips of videos .
They added music game shows & other music related shows .
Finally ,
They dispensed with music concept altogether , and their programming became pop culture oriented instead of Music related .
MTV now brings us us wonderful and insightful programming like Paris Hilton ’s My New BFF , MTV Cribs , True Life , and Sex , With Mom and Dad – but hold on .
Someone at MTV had an amazing brainstorm – “ what if we started a platform for music videos ? ” , “ Dammit , that ’s just crazy enough to work ! ” .
In the grandest irony of ironies , MTV has launched a new service very redundantly called MTVMusic.com ( now redirects to MTVHive.com ) .
It ’s got music videos for most of the popular music being released lately , a searchable database and all sorts of top 10 lists .
They even have a ( you guessed it ) a social network .
And yes , since you asked – all those Corey Hart , Twisted Sister ( who could do without the Twister Sister Dee Snider Makeup Kit ? ) and Culture Club videos are still there – although if you like 80 ’s music videos , you should probably check this out instead .
MTV hosting music videos – what will they think of next ?
So here I am .
In a hotel room in New York .
The writing desk and its view of xth Avenue are all but obscured by :-
7 x Mini USB cables : 2 of them are the new Micro type that Blackberry has switched to for the Storm only , the rest are standard .
1 x Ethernet cable : into wall - socket of hotel room .
8 bucks a day .
But using Ethernet rather than the hotel ’s wi-fi allows me to share via a wireless network that I create on my laptop .
That way all my other toys can be online without separate logging on and billing .
Hotels make so much money from “ high - speed ” internet these days .
Well , they ’ve lost their once juicy phone income I suppose .
I remember back in the early nineties , before the world wide web was so much a glint in Tim Berners - Lee ’s eye and the net was all VERONICA , JANET , WAIS , Gopher and FTP , I ran up a Princeton hotel phone bill of three and half thousand dollars in one calendar week .
Ach , die schöne Zeit …

4 x iPod/iPhone chargers : I seem to use one iPhone exclusively for mad hacking , jailbreaking and frigging about with , another as a pedometer , another for music , another as a – guess what ?
– phone .
I know I ’m putting my botty on the line by confessing to jailbreakage and hackery , but I think Apple ( while each update brings a new weapon in their war against Pwnage and SIM - card skulduggery ) are man enough to take it .
3 x Hard drives :
Took the hasty decision to come to America ( I sha n’t be back in Britain till late January ) with just one computer , one of the new MacBooks .
It does n’t have Firewire .
Duh ?
Maddening , since my favourite hard drive is Firewire only .
But at least the MacBook allows a proper connection , unlike the underpowered USB of the original version of the scrumptious MacBook Air .
You know that feeling when you have a whole lump of data on one device or peripheral and you want to get it on another and you suddenly realise you can ’t ?
‘ Okay , so I upload it onto a compact flash card .
No onto an SD card .
Hell where ’s my card reader ?
Right .
I email myself the file …’ etc. , etc .
That happens to me a lot .
1 Snowball USB Microphone : just in case I have the sudden yen to record a podgram .
You never know .
6 x SIM cards : Orange , Vodafone , 2 x O2 , T - Mobile , AT&T .
My UK mobile number is Orange , that ’s my regular number , but one needs to swap and shuffle and use other networks in order properly to play .
I know .
I ’m weird .
I ’ve long accepted it .
But weird is just another way of spelling “ wired ” .
I drew weird in another way and got wired .

A delicious nest of happiness © Samfry Ltd 2008
It ’s a bombsite , as the photo reveals .
But to me it ’s a delicious nest of happiness , a heap of bliss : a mess I ’ll nestle in , paraphernalia paradise .
There is much swearing and ‘ why the hell wo n’t you do this ? ’ and ‘ oh , for goodness sake what is wrong with you ? ’ and all kinds of curses and imprecations , but if I ’m honest a glowing contentment underlies it all .
A strange obsession , mine .
But better to be addicted to smartphones and gismos than cocaine or sex , I suppose .
Well , I do n’t know , the result is the same after all , very little sleep , great expense and horrific mess everywhere .
My very first blog to my website was on the subject of Smartphones .
‘ I never met a smartphone I did n’t buy , ’ I wrote with somewhat overcooked hyperbole .
So nearly true as to be worth the mangling of Will Rogers ’ famous , ( and equally unbelievable ) claim .
Incidentally , I was faintly horrified to note , while seeking a good site to link to Will Rogers , that Barry Manilow wrote a song with that same title , whose lyrics are written out here with an illiteracy so fantastic as almost to be beautiful .
Eek .
I nearly always have to preface this kind of article with a ‘ Whatever you think of Apple , there ’s no doubt … ’ or ‘ Love them or loathe them , Apple have changed the… ’ or ‘ No matter what your view of Steve Jobs , you ca n’t deny he … ” and so forth .
Take these opening riders as read : they are there so as to deter enraged anti-Applers from turning and charging into the bushes , snorting and stamping in disgust .
Some people despise Apple , hate Macvangelists and abhor everything positive that might be said about what comes out of Cupertino .
I have in the past been guilty of just such visceral overreaction when it comes to Microsoft .
Tribal loyalties have riven the world of personal computing since Bill Gates came late on the scene and took every IBM - compatible user with him .
A triumph of business manoeuvring , a triumph of opportunism , a triumph of financial acumen , a triumph of all kinds of things except computer science or technological advancement , in the opinion of people like me at least .
Every time Windows had a rebirth I would get hold of it and buy a new machine to run it on believing that they must now have got things right and finally created an operating environment that could excite , impress and enthral me .
But each time their system got more ham - fisted , more insulting and more indifferent to the pleasures and interests of the consumer .
Windows users meanwhile watched the Mac transform itself from niche – almost hobbyist – toy to glamourpuss of the digital world and it was important for them to demonstrate their contempt for the , as they saw them , media poseurs who so proudly swung open their MacBooks in coffee bars and airport lounges .
Such a schism was silly but hard to stand back from .
History is already having its way with Microsoft ; the Redmond , WA empire , as all empires do , will crumble .
Apple crumble will be served up in time too .
MS got big by seeing , which IBM did n’t , that the future was with operating systems :
Google got big by seeing , which MS did n’t , that the future was with online systems .
What will we all fail to see next ?
Certainly one battleground that everyone has at last identified is the one on which mobile handheld do - it - all computing and communication devices clash .
For want of a better word we will call these devices smartphones .
The conclusion that no observer can fail to come to , whichever side of the tribal divide they inhabit , is that the iPhone has Changed Everything when it comes to smartphones .
Without so much as a blush , all the major players have presented to the world over the last few months an ‘ answer ’ to the iPhone .
The point , it seems to me , is not to win or erode the share iPhone already has , but to stake a claim in a marketplace that in three or four years will see the majority of the world ’s mobile phone using population , who now have ‘ ordinary ’ cell phones , switch over to smartphones .
The potential rewards are enormous .
No wonder everyone ’s toes are being dipped into the water .
We should remind ourselves of the state of play before the arrival of the iPhone four and a half digital years ago in June 2007 , ( Fry ’s Law of Digital Time states that 1 calendar year = 3 digital years ) .
There were smartphones , in those far off days , that used the Symbian operating system , Nokia and Sony - Ericsson principal amongst them ; there were smartphones using the Palm OS , though these were being ( wrongly and sadly in this writer ’s opinion ) phased out and replaced with Treo units ‘ powered ’ by the third major OS , Windows Mobile , which could also be found in other devices , notably and most successfully those manufactured by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC .
And , expressly for the businessman , there was the Canadian firm Research In Motion ’s famous BlackBerry .
RIM had begun to make a few incursions outside the corporate sector with the BB Pearl which boasted such unBlackBerry features as a camera and music player , but essentially the BB was a businessman ’s tool focussing on its branded push email service , using either Enterprise servers controlled by individual companies ( BES ) or – as a concession to individual customers – open Internet servers ( BIS ) .
Its operating system was proprietary , though third parties could avail themselves of its APIs or supply over the air ( OTA ) Java applications .
And so the stage was set for the arrival of the iPhone .
Many people ( they wo n’t care to be reminded of it , but there were hundreds of them ) warned that Apple ’s chances of entering such a competitive market from a standing position were less than zero .
Many others were incensed by the hype engendered when the product finally arrived , by the fact that its launch made national news , that photos of cheering queues outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store were on every newspaper front page .
‘ Style over substance ’ jeered those who looked at the phone but had n’t yet used it .
‘ My WinMob TyTN can do that .
And it ’s got GPS and 3G !’ cried others , pointing out in exultant disbelief the features the iPhone lacked .
Despite Apple ’s ‘ foolhardy ’ standing start , despite the gaping lacunae of those missing features , despite the units being primly and firmly locked to single network providers , iPhone was a gigantic success right out of the traps .
And over the intervening eighteen months the arrival of 3G , GPS , some kind of non-enterprise or ‘ Cloud ’ push service and third party apps ( installable OTA or via the desktop ) ensured that the iPhone ’s position as an epoch - altering giant , a seismic , paradigm - shifting , cliché - evoking phenomenon has been incontrovertibly affirmed .
This is no triumph of style over substance .
iPhone is all about function , all about ease and pleasure of real , hard - working use , all about the fundamental understanding that is Steve Jobs and Jony Ive ’s ( Apple ’s Chief Designer ) great contribution to digital ( and therefore cultural ) life in our time – that human beings , willy - nilly , forge relationships even with inanimate objects and that those relationships , being human , take on all the colours of emotion : it is in our DNA for this to be the case .
With objects that we spend most hours of most days with such a relationship is far from a secondary consideration .
There is no ‘ pathetic fallacy ’ here , this is not an additional luxury for media types only , a pretentious over - reading for the leisured and chattering classes , this is a deep and important human psychological truth that allows machines to function better : much , much better .
At the extremes humans can love or hate .
I have raved , screamed , shrieked and cursed when my iPhones , Macs , iPods , Airport base units and Apple TVs have betrayed me , let me down .
I expect so much of them .
But it is nothing to the venomous fury , disbelieving rage and overmastering contempt that floods my being when attempting to get function , sense and use out of a Windows , especially a Vista machine .
I made quite a spectacle of myself over this very issue not long ago .
But , despite my emotional as well as intellectual belief in Apple there is much wrong , or at the very least deeply unsatisfactory about the iPhone and perhaps about its ‘ business model ’ .
When the first generation came out I offered the view , based on my experience of releases and refinements in this field , that iPhone the Third would be The One .
I still believe this to be true .
Any wishlist for hardware and software improvements in v3.0 would be bound to hope for – nay demand – the following : -
1. Cut and paste .
I mean come on !!
2. iPhone version of Safari to be Flash capable .
3. Video recording : iPhone should be like a Flip
4. Upgrade of camera ( xenon flash , higher res )
5 . Front facing video camera for 3G video calls
6. MMS
7 . User file management capabilities
8. Bluetooth that is worthy of the name .
File transfers between different phones and platforms is a minimum requirement .
9 . A memory card slot .
10 . AM / FM radio .
( Mobile TV too , why not ? )
11 . Better ( and removable ) battery .
12 . Built in projector ( this prolly wo n’t come till V4 , but you never know )
13 . Customisable glossary for Apple ’s predictive text input system .
BlackBerry has a superb autotext that allows BB units still to outperform iPhone when it comes to input .
14 . Email to be widescreen capable .
15 . Attachable proprietary or third party peripherals : keyboard , projector ( if not built in see wish 12 ) , printer etc .
Maybe not necessary if iPhone implementation of Bluetooth gets the kick up the arse it needs .
I would add to that list three demands that are more to do with the way Apple and the network companies limit the iPhone ’s power .
1. Jailbreaking to be tolerated – encouraged , even
2. Unlocking not to be hobbled by iTunes
3 . Apps designers to be freer to innovate yet further .
Without most or all of these requests being implemented Apple will find itself in danger of falling behind .
But hell , they know that better than me , and I ’m sure they will surprise us with capabilities I have n’t begun to think of .
I believe that not only can they now afford to open up but also that they cannot afford not to .
Google ’s Android is the reason they have to redouble their efforts as we shall see later on .
Looking back , then , at the first phase in the history of smart communication devices , the real mystery is not how Jobs and Ive and their team made their breakthrough with such conspicuous speed and success , it is how the might of Symbian , Nokia , Sony Ericsson and Microsoft could have bestridden the market for so many years without so much as making an attempt to satisfy , please , solace and ease the smartphone experience : even a quarter of Apple ’s imagination , creativity , innovation and delight in technology would have been something .
Weird to remind ourselves yet again of just how unanimous in their scepticism the press and professional techies were about the possibility of Apple being able to make a dent in the market as an untried newcomer while now we ’re already thinking of them as the big brutal bullying champion .
How could the major players have left a gap in the market so wide that a complete novice in mobile telephony could so instantly shame them ?
Shame them in the eyes of the world , at least , if not in their own .
The excuses made by the CEOs and spokesmen of BigCell for their failures remind me of publishers I have met who have tried to explain why they turned down the manuscript of J. K. Rowling ’s first Harry Potter novel .
‘ Ah , yes .
You see it was our publishing house ’s policy not to consider MSS over 40,000 words for the children ’s market … nothing I could do .
No point even reading it ….’
‘ Ah , yes , well , you see it ’s not our fault it was the networks / It was not our fault it was the manufacturers . ’
Hmmmmm .
Ever try to connect to a wireless network on a Sony Ericsson P series or WinMob smartphone ?
The contempt implicit in these foul , fiddly behemoths was breathtaking .
The profound ugliness of Nokia ’s e range , the horrible underpowered nightmare of Sony ’s UIQ devices , the quite staggeringly insulting ghastliness of Windows Mobile … for two years I kept believing that the manufacturers and software developers in this field would eventually get it right and produce something as truly usable as the old Psions , the old Palm Pilots and Treos , while utilising the newer technologies and capabilities of the 21st century .
The only major player an enthusiast like myself could genuinely admire was RIM , because the BlackBerry was everything it aspired to be .
It deliberately had no camera , ( secret business meetings , factory visits and so on often necessitate the leaving of cameras at the door , like guns in a western town being cleaned up by James Stewart ) and never embarrassed itself by pretending to be a media player .
It did what it was supposed to and refused to pretend to be anything other than what it was .
So there we were .
They all left an open door through which Apple charged .
And now , with unblushing fanfare they each attempt to bring something similar to market .
This is good .
Apple have shown that there is a huge demand for exciting , innovative , lovable and imaginative consumer devices .
All the rivals have to do is to … is to what ?
To produce cut price lookalikes or truly to pioneer and innovate ?
Well , the latter is what they should do , but the former is what most of them will do of course , because these dumb firms never ever learn .
They are afraid to be good .
They will blame stockholders , consumers , anyone but themselves .
Do n’t you sometimes long to be CEO of a company like Sony Ericsson , Samsung , Nokia or Microsoft ?
So that you can say to your coders , your designers , your development teams and your software architects : “ Not Fucking Good Enough .
I have n’t said ‘ Wow ’ yet .
I have n’t gasped with pleasure , amusement or admiration once .
Start again .
Not Fucking Good Enough . ”
And ( forgive this ranting sidebar ) how one would lay into the packaging department !
“ Nowhere near Fucking Good Enough .
I ’m not enjoying opening this .
It ’s clumsy , dumb and contemptuous .
I ’m in product - opening hell .
Not Fucking Good Enough . ”
Oh , yes Stephen .
That ’s all very well , but you try being a CEO in the real world of share prices and financial officers .
Bullshit .
Any CEO who hides behind his shareholders is n’t worthy of their job : I ’ve met enough business leaders to know that the good ones lead , they do n’t follow .
Is n’t that kind of what ‘ leader ’ means ?
I seem to be straying .
But it ’s all relevant really and it all needs saying again and again .
Managers , corporates , finance people , executives in tech companies – they all need to understand for the sake of their pride and happiness as much as their success , this simple rule : ‘ That ’ll do ’ wo n’t do .
‘ That ’s good enough ’ is never good enough .
And so we come to the three products under advisement .
I shall start with the Blackberries .
Throughout their six year history RIM have produced excellently serviceable messaging phones .
That is what they are all about .
Instant pushed email with no frills for the business consumer .
You do n’t need me to tell you that this approach has earned RIM and their phone a kind of cult metonymical status .
Now , in the Post iPhone era , they appear to have come to the conclusion that this is not enough .
Either that or they feel they have more or less saturated their existing core market and now wish to move into fresh woods and pastures new .
A sudden blizzard of new RIM devices has hit and is hitting the market .
The Bold is a legato evolution , the Storm a break into strident falsetto while the Pearl / Kickstart 8820 clamshell flip phone might be regarded as a melody in an altogether different key .
I have had no access to the Kickstart , though with WiFi capabilities , a 2 mp camera , quad band EDGE and an all new form factor it looks like a larky entry level winner .
THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL
So let ’s begin with the Bold , pausing only to reflect on the horror of its name .
A detergent with built in softener , a polari code word , a Merseyside district , an emphatic typographical style – all of those may be said to be bold , yes .
But a phone ?
‘ Do you want to see my Bold ? ’
Very odd .
At first glance the RIM Blackberry 9000 Bold , to give it its proper designation , looks a little fatter than either the 83×0 Curve or the shiny piano black 88×0 .
A band of silvery metal ( which turns out to be plastic ) surrounds the candybar body lending it a faintly iPhonic appearance , but the classic keyboard , pearl trackball and BB logo menu key soon remind us that we ’re in RIMland .
Less sculpted than the Curve , this is a device that nonetheless fits very well in the hand , most of the pleasure deriving from the design of the back , whose faux leather texture and softly rounded corners feel and look immensely satisfactory .
An external flap for a micro SD card means we can kiss goodbye to the boredom of having to jerk out the battery every time we want to change memory cards .
Otherwise the usual assignable function buttons , a standard 35 mm stereo jack ( thank heavens we have seen the last of the horrid days of freakish proprietary earphone sockets – or have we ?
More later ) a mini USB port and a standby / mute button complete the exterior hardware features .
Blackberry Bold © Research in Motion Ltd 2008
It is the screen that takes up all our attention .
This Half VGA 480x 320 display is an absolute honey .
The images are crisper , clearer and brighter than you could possibly have expected .
Moving and still images dazzle with their pleasing clarity and depth of colour .
The only really new capability on this phone is 3G .
RIM has bowed to the inevitable and sacrificed some of the BlackBerry ’s fabled battery life for the sake of being able to badge it as a speedster .
Emails do n’t arrive any faster , because they could n’t be quicker than they always were on EDGE and GPRS anyway .
3G is only justified for OTA app / file downloading or power web browsing and is the BlackBerry a phone where you are likely to do much of either ?
The in - house browser is not very good and likes nothing better than to visit a site and then throw up a warning screen that says “ The XML is not well formed ” or something equally rude and stupid .
It does offer the possibility of online video , but only from the few compatible sites that offer 3GPP RTSP streaming .
There is also the boredom of it expressing itself as either the badged network provider browser , in my case Orange , or splitting itself in two when using Wi-Fi and calling itself a HotSpot Browser .
All very silly and lazy .
Most users will prefer to download Opera Mini which while certainly better , calls up the built - in browser anyway whenever there ’s downloading to be done .
As far as other apps are concerned , I have given up trying to persuade the GooSync client for synchronising Google Calendars to work .
It needs to piggyback off a deeply unsatisfactory application called SyncJe which Simply Wo n’t Work .
I did manage to download Twitterberry which functions adequately without being any of fluent , function rich , legible or appealing .
BlackBerry Maps of course , Simply Wo n’t Work either .
But then they never have on any of the half dozen or so models of BlackBerry I ’ve owned in my absurd life .
I sometimes wonder if Wayfinder or another third party provider of navigation software does n’t pay RIM or the network providers a kickback of some kind .
When fired up , the BB Maps application ( mapplication ? ) offers a splashscreen that tells me that I do n’t have a BES or BIS connection , which is manifestly untrue since BIS is cheerfully pushing emails at me faster than Bendick ’s pushes out Bittermints .
The same is true on the BlackBerry Storm , so it seems to be horribly usual .
How they get away with advertising their map service I can’t imagine , when a quick search through the help forums seems to show that BB Maps works for just about NO ONE .
But then – and one ca n’t repeat this often enough – that is n’t the point of BlackBerry .
The point of BlackBerry is fast and furious emailing .
Instant Messaging out of the box , it must be confessed , is limited to PIN2PIN chats between fellow BlackBerry users , but IM clients like VeriChat and Gizmo allow the usual AIM , Yahoo , Google and MS chatter .
SMS texting is reasonably well threaded , but email … well , it ’s hard to explain to the uninitiated quite why the BB email experience is so satisfying , but deeply , joyfully satisfying it is .
And now , with the Bold , it is even more so .
For the Bold is not just a new box , it brings with it a new operating system , version 4.6 , which amongst other things offers correctly formatted HTML emails .
Well , jolly nearly correctly formatted – correctly formatted for the screen , shall we say ?
The annoyingly overprotective options do n’t allow you automatically to see the images in your email ( I ’m talking about images embedded in the format here , not attachments ) until you select the option from your menu each time for each email .
But again , some BB aficionados will see graphical email as completely unBlackBerry anyway and wo n’t mind a bit .
OS 4.6 offers fabulous speed and smoothness from its 624MHz Intel XScale PXA 270 processor .
The fonts are gorgeous and automatically anti-aliased , without the need for the font smoothing option of old .
The charming white - light neon outline icons of the home screen are not always easy to interpret , but you soon get the idea .
In Britain , the Bold comes exclusively from Orange , in America AT&T have that honour .
The Orange handset I have comes with two themes : Precision Orange and Precision Silver .
Icons , settings , shortcuts , trackball , autotext ( one of BlackBerry ’s clinching USPs ) and menus work the same way they have for years on BlackBerry so it ’s an easy transition from a Curve , Pearl or 8800 .
The same but better , smoother , faster , prettier .
It seems that early releases of the Bold were so problematic that Orange in the UK actually yanked it from their list of phones for a while .
All seems to be well now , although the Orange badged version does n’t allow the Wireless updating of the system that is a vaunted feature in other territories , nor the implementation of GPS ephemeris for star - gazers .
Maybe some kind of update will help .
The media browsing and playing is much as it has been since the first Pearl models , hardly up to iPhone or iPod standard , but the new screen though small , presents knockout video and photo reproduction .
There seems to be an improvement in the built - in speakers too .
You would n’t use them to play music at a country house rave , but for reference and handsfree talk they are much better than once they were and better than the iPhone can offer .
You ca n’t say that about the camera however .
Same resolution as the iPhone ’s at 2 megapixels , but a woefully less impressive lens and end product .
To compensate , you can geotag your photos and there is an adequate video capture programme too .
Only a gigabyte of onboard memory is offered , but this can be supplemented by up to 16GB via the MicroSD slot ( some rumours suggest 32 GB is possible ) .
Included as standard are voice recording , voice dialling , some dumb but prettily implemented games , a suite of Dataviz document readers ( which can become full read / write apps if you pay for an upgrade ) , a calculator , a memopad and a sweet little alarm / clock / stopwatch with a cunning bedside mode .
No front - facing lens for video chat though .
Power will be drained if you use too many of the radios at the same time , so best go with GPS and Bluetooth off unless you really need them .
Once you ’ve tired of seeing the strange sight of “ 3G ” on a BlackBerry screen you might as well go to phone options and choose an EDGE connection .
It will save you a lot of battery life and you ’ll lose little functionality .
Text input is achieved via a keyboard slightly different from that of the Curve and , in my opinion at least , better .
I think I can type faster and more accurately on a BB Bold than on any make of phone I ’ve ever used .
The Palm Treo 650 used to take that prize , but I think the design , ergonomics and heft of the Bold edge out that beloved old Treo .
The usual small annoyances remain ( surely RIM can come up with a better shift and alt lock ?
Why not a double press in each case ? ) but all in all it ’s a fine and serviceable keyboard .
In short the Bold is a superb evolution of a winning formula ( if formulae can be said to evolve ) : it looks and feels attractive , solid and well - made .
The software architecture and hardware design complement each other perfectly .
Above all it remains wholly , proudly and properly a BlackBerry .
It is , to be sure , no threat to the iPhone except in one regard : devoted BlackBerry users will be less anxious and uncertain than they might have done a month or so ago .
They will feel proud , happy and loved once again and all thoughts of moving to iPhone will vanish away .

STORM WARNING
But the Bold is not RIM ’s only major new model this year .
In fact , superb as the 9000 model is , almost all recent press coverage has been focussed on BlackBerry ’s entry into the touchscreen and accelerometer age , the 9500 - 9530 Storm ( and you thought Bold was a bad name ) .
An accelerometer is a device that lets an object know which way up it is .
That ’s just what the RIM corporation itself seems to need , for it is clear that with the release of this dog they do n’t know their tits from their tibias .
Available exclusively through Verizon in the States ( non-Americans should know that this network provider ’s name is pronounced to rhyme , not with ‘ berries on ’ , but with ‘ horizon ’ , as in “ There ’s a Storm on the Verizon ” ) and through Vodafone in the United Kingdom , the 9500 is RIM ’s answer to a question it should never have been asking in the first place .
Blackberry Storm © Research in Motion Ltd 2008
The American version of the Storm is ( under ) powered by a Qualcomm 528 MHz CPU while the British model relies on the 624 MHz Marvell Intel XScale .
The very fact that the same phone can vary so fundamentally shows how much heft network providers have these days when it comes to phone manufacture , design and marketing .
My suspicion is that the Storm ’s most glaring faults derive from the unseemly haste with which it has been released : pressure on the software and design teams that is more likely to have come from the two V’s , Verizon and Vodafone , than from RIM .
I may be wrong , but that is my feeling .
On that subject , some defensive types will accuse me of reading too much into an early release ( not a pre-release : my toys , as usual when I am not reviewing through the pages of the Guardian or similar , are mine , bought and paid for ) .
Software updates , firmware patches and other improvements are certain to come out in the next months – indeed already have done so .
I am as certain as I can be that I ’m running the latest version of the OS .
So everything below is written in the knowledge that while things might well get better it is legitimate to judge what is currently on offer and busily being advertised .
Software updates or no software updates it remains true that , as they say in the music industry , ‘ you can not polish a turd . ’
A turkey is a turkey , no matter what colour you dye the feathers .

The dedicated 4.7.0 operating system is tasked to manage the Storm ’s major selling feature , it ’s haptic ‘ Sure Press ’ touchscreen .
Haptic does n’t really mean much more than ‘ of or about the sense of touch ’ – in ergonomics and the digital sphere , however , it tends to suggest something deeper than the usual glass capacitive touchscreen that we find on iPhones and the like , it promises some measure of tactile feedback ( like the wonderful buzzy kick you get from an HTC Touch when playing a Get - The - Ball - Bearing - Down - The - Hole game , only more sensitive and useful ) .
All the patented SurePress actually does is click like a dislocated knuckle every time you press down on it .
The idea is that a single , gentle touch highlights and selects a screen object or option to be dealt with , like a single mouse click , while the action of pressing down confirms , executes or opens – like a double click or enter key .
It feels plasticky and … well , just plain wrong .
The accelerometer meanwhile allows the screen to change from portrait to landscape in the manner we are all now familiar with .
Except that it allows no such thing because it ’s shite .
It revolves the screen when you do n’t want it to and it waits a maddening five seconds when you do actually need it to turn .
Grrrr .
But first things first .
Out of the box the Storm does n’t look too bad .
Undistinguished perhaps , but certainly not dreadful .
A little narrower than the Bold and a fraction shorter , it somehow contrives to feel bigger .
I think the reason for this is the size of the icons once the device is switched on .
The whole GUI feels overblown , as if the zoom button got stuck .
This is especially true when the device is ( eventually ) oriented into landscape mode .
The very icons ( white neon outline style ) that so delight and impress on the Bold are somehow clumsy and annoying when magnified on the Storm .
This melancholy state of affairs will be thematic as we go through the whole blighted and benighted disaster .
If things feels clumsy when viewing nothing more than the home screen icons , just wait until you have to input text .
This is where the Storm enters into its own misguided and nightmarish hell .
The SurePress protocols of Touch - to - Highlight and Press - to - Execute are needed to operate its ‘ soft ’ ( i.e. graphical ) keyboards .
Now , the iPhone relies on an audio click to tell you that a key has been pressed : you can turn this alert off , since it is so annoying to partners and friends .
The Storm relies on the physical click of a screen press – it ’s the same noise someone with a broken nose makes when they waggle it to gross you out at dinner parties .
This feature you of course cannot turn off since it is fundamental to the whole design .
It is supposed to be the grand response to the problems of iPhone text entry .
I will admit that I commonly swear at my iPhone when typing .
I wrote from the first that this is an issue for those who , like me , often type more words a day than they speak .
I am still more productive in that respect on a QWERTY keyboard , or even a Pearl - style SureType than on an iPhone , although my speed there has increased and will do so even more when and if Apple allow / introduce autotext glossaries and macro expanders .
In the sphere of keyboard entry RIM was right to see an opening .
But what they have done is to arrive chirpily on the battlefield equipped with smart shiny new muskets to face off an enemy armed with Gatling guns .
Yes , Apple ’s Gatling may not be the last word in field artillery : it jams , it stutters and it often misses … but its raking automatic fire sure as hell beats the Storm ’s muzzle - loading arquebus , with its laborious tamping and dangerous backfiring .
Watching someone writing an email on a Storm is like watching an antelope trying to open a packet of cigarettes .
There are two input keyboards .
In portrait mode you are given 20 soft buttons , arranged on a 5 × 4 grid .
The paired character groups are , reading along the top row , QW , ER , TY , UI , OP – yes , it ’s BlackBerry ’s SureType system which works so brilliantly well on the Pearl , allowing rapid and cleverly predictive QWERTY text on a phone - pad sized keyboard .
On the Storm the system does work but is slower , so - o - o much slower .
Partly this is because suggested words for completion and / or correction are popped up in a menu and , while key pressing is accurate if done right ( see below ) menu selection is an ever - living mother of a horror .
Menu items are highlighted and your finger automatically stabs the wrong one , usually the one above – something to do with parallax , I should n’t wonder .
If you aim low in order to compensate you will , such is life , make your one accurate selection of the day .
If you slow right down and do it deliberately you increase your chances of success , but slowing right down is not what a smartphone experience on the hoof should be about .
You ’re an important person , you have emails to fire off which the world is awaiting with rabid impatience , you do n’t want your fingers to imitate those executive toy ducks that slowly in perpetual motion used to dip their beaks into glasses of coloured water .
But that is the only kind of action that guarantees accuracy .
When I said above if done right , that is what I meant .
Let ’s twist the Storm and wait for it to go into landscape mode .
Now we are presented with a full QWERTY soft keyboard and the results are immeasurably worse .
Thumbing is the only real option here , unless you ’ve plonked the device down on a table , and thumbing will achieve nothing but pain and sorrow .
Remember , to input text you have to snap the screen down each time , just touching achieves nothing but the highlighting of a letter .
If you build up a slow , even rhythm you can get by , but try and hurry it and you will
produce nothij a ; ldfk ep[w d ;s ;m a ; s pir nd fcking arrsewippe .
What a painful horror .
Carpal tunnel syndrome or worse forms of RSI beckon .
How one longs for a pearl trackball …
For the rest , the camera is 3.2 MP rather than the 2MP offered by Bold and iPhone and the pictures , still and moving , are of high quality .
The media browser works well too .
But what makes this Storm a stumer , little more than a worthless tchotchke , is that not satisfied with introducing a white elephant of an input system , RIM has decided it should take its stand in the marketplace without WiFi .
Derr ?
Wh… ?
Huh ?
Yougoddabekiddingright ?
Go figure .
Original iPhones with 2.5G EDGE only and without GPS might have struck some people as underequipped , but WiFi was always there , WiFi capability remains crucial in a smartphone worthy of the name .
Even iPODS have it for heaven ’s sake !
Incidentally , if you are a Mac user it seems that RIM , Verizon and Vodafone would prefer that you did n’t buy this phone .
Updates are achieved , not Over The Air , but online via the desktop only through the Windows version of BlackBerry Tools or by downloading a Windows executable file using Internet Explorer only .
There is no Mac or OTA alternative .
That is also true of the Bold .
Oh well .
At least Vodafone offers an option whereby you can drop off a phone for upgrade at one of their stores .
Though after you ’ve spent a few days with the blasted thing , an option whereby you can drop it off one their roofs for destruction will strike you as preferable .
For the rest , the wirelessless Storm ’s files and apps are all laid out in a familiar BlackBerry way , except that keyboards have a habit of popping up when you do n’t need them and failing to when you do .
Scrolling is juddery and does n’t speed up when you flick faster as it does on the iPod and G1 .
As an implementation of touchscreen technology the Storm sucks : I ’ll go further .
The Storm could teach an industrial vacuum pump how to suck .
It could teach Linda Lovelace how to suck .
It could … you get the idea .
It is as if RIM decided to point out to us all the impressive things about the iPhone that we might have missed in our excitement at the more obviously stellar features .
How responsive it is , how swift , how smooth , how light and quick on its feet , how instinctive and intuitive , how little you have to think and consider what to do with it .
I dare say some of the judder , lag and jerk will be smoothed out by further software or ( more likely ) firmware updates , but nothing can take away from the fact that this is the Edsel of smartphones , an absolute smeller from top to bottom .
It ’s easy to be wise after the event , but how RIM could have been persuaded away from their core business of providing a slow , steady , quality evolution of business oriented push email devices is a mystery .
A rush of blood to the head , I suppose .
But at least the 9000 Bold is still there , proving that they have n’t really lost it .
I am sure founder Mike Lazaridis and his fellow CEO Jim Balsillie will have the courage and wisdom to learn from this .
If you want a BlackBerry – and why would n’t you ?
– make a Bold move and steer away from the Storm .

I would love now to be able to turn to Sony Ericsson ’s new Experia X1 smartphone , which has replaced their long line of P series UIQ flavoured Symbian phones , which I liked in principle and in look and feel , but which were flaky and prone to crash , not to mention being possessed of a WLAN connection procedure that made one almost long for a WinMob device .
Experia X1 © Sony Ericsson 2008
Sony Ericsson , like Palm , have made the fateful and imponderably daft decision to ditch their previous OS and offer a WinMob phone instead .
Windows Mobile is so ghastly that all manufacturers these days hide it as much as possible behind their own proprietary front ends .
But underneath it all the Experia is a Windows Mobile phone and I ’m not going to fork out over $ 1,000 bucks to report on a device whose front door I will admire and whose interior will make me want to sick up .
Sorry , but twenty - five times bitten , once finally shy .
Nokia ’s most exciting looking phone for years is the N97 which has n’t hit American shores yet .
When I get back to Europe I intend to get my hands on one as soon as I can .
Samsung ’s entry into the iPhone knock - off market meanwhile is the nah-ish WiFi free Eternity , which looks like the closest physical rip - off of an iPhone yet .
GEE !
ONE OF THOSE !
But that leaves us with the most interesting rival to the iPhone of all , the G1 , the first of the so - called Googlephones .
The G1 is manufactured by HTC , the Formosan funsters who release WinMob phones like the TyTN , the Touch , the Diamond Touch , the Touch Pro and so on … but it ’s not the phone that ’s interesting , it ’s the operating system behind it .
Google announced a year or so ago , following the earlier acquisition of the name and key personnel of a company called Android , that the rumours were true , they really were going into the smartphone business .
They would produce an operating system for smartphones in cooperation with the Open Handset Alliance .
Based on the Linux kernel , Android would be a true Open Source entity , around which any manufacturer could build his device .
HTC ( part of the Alliance ) were the first to produce such a phone – the G1 , which is badged T - Mobile , but which in the spirit of Open Source ( how unlike Apple and ATT ) can be unlocked within three months and run with any SIM inside .
There ’s another Android phone ready to be released , the Kogan Agora , which is just becoming available in Australia and looks for all the world like the bastard son of a BlackBerry 8800 and a Samsung i320 .
In China the QiGi offers the unlikely combination of both WinMob and Android .
Well , there you are .
HTC G1 © HTC Corporation 2008
The G1 is a little narrower than an iPhone and has an attractively light , semi-matt , almost rubberised texture to its back and a glossy enamelled lustre to its front that I happen to like .
I am assured by a friend that ‘ coffee bean ’ would be a good description of the colour of the one I bought , a kind of dark army brown / grey , officially designated ‘ bronze ’ .
‘ Metallic mocha ’ is also suggested by this colour literate acquaintance .
Black and now white are also available and I must say it does my heart good to see a phone that is n’t trying too hard to imitate the iPhone in its exterior lineaments .
When I saw pictures on the web I thought , as did many , that the ugly stick had given the G1 a damned good thrashing , but in the hand and up close it ’s much better than I expected .
It has a gentle , somehow retro form factor that I find comfortable and appealing without eliciting screams of desire .
The bronze version reminds me of GPO brown from the days before BT : trimphones could come in that colour and also had those simultaneously square yet rounded corners .
The lower section of the front , which carries five buttons and a trackball is tilted forward and up in such a way as to have earned the soubriquet ‘ the chin ’ .
Otherwise standard volume rockers , an angled camera lens and a camera button in the usual place complete the outward appearance , in the closed position at least .
Yes , ‘ closed position ’ , for this is a slidey - open phone which reveals a full qwerty keyboard when the top half of the sandwich is prised away from the bottom .
More on that later .
The hard buttons , incidentally , are Menu ( context specific ) , Green Phone , Home , Back and Red Phone .
Pretty basic and all one could need .
I am pleased by the addition of a trackball .
Apple ’s purity can sometimes get in the way of convenience and I like thumbing balls .
Hang on … look … stop it at once …. you know perfectly well what I mean .
I bought a ( quite legally ) unlocked G1 which I was able to register and activate after a bit of lateral thinking which involved calling up the menu after three failures and inputting my SIM network ’s APN information .
The moment you do activate and the device is roaming ( in EDGE , I ca n’t get 3G here , even though the SIM and account are bona fide 3G ) the phone exultantly reveals one of its strengths – its seamless integration with a Google account .
If you use Gmail ( and who would n’t ?
it has the best Spam filter around and you can send ‘ as from ’ any of your preferred email addresses ) you will already have a Google account .
If you do n’t , it ’s a snap , as Americans like to say , to be up and running with one in no time .
It ’s free and comes with lots and lots of serverside storage .
Of course you ’re instantly a unit in Great Google ’s Adword databank of commercial trickery and avarice – but if you ’re cool with that , as I lazily am , the advantages are legion .
I use Gmail as a hub for all my email accounts and I am hopelessly devoted to Google Calendars .
The G1 had all my Google data installed and syncing within moments of connection .
[ Sidebar of interest for Mac users only : one stupid and typical wrinkle in today ’s digital world .
Apple ’s address book is brilliant .
Using it with an iPhone either syncing by cable or OTA via MobileMe is fantastic .
Apple ’s iCal , on the other hand is less impressive , in either desktop or MobileMe web form .
Conversely , Google ’s Calendar is superb , but its Contacts nothing less than a pile of rancid old pants .
So the ideal device for me at the moment would sync my Mac address book and my Google Calendars : I need the latter because I have several different GCals for different projects which can be read and / or amended by the various people I ’m working with .
There ’s no proper client for syncing Google Calendars with an iPhone and no way you can sync a G1 to your Apple Address book .
All the utilities ( and there are at least four , Spanning Sync and BusySync being the best ) while coping with calendars well , run into the stark truth that syncing Apple Address Book with Google Contacts is horrible . ]
So I ’ve got the G1 working and it ’s already loaded with my major details .
A home screen , entirely customisable , offers four apps in basic , rather clunky cartoony icons at the bottom of the capacitive touchscreen .
A capacitive touchscreen , incidentally , is the ultra responsive kind , like the iPhone ’s , which can only be operated by a finger , as opposed to the slightly more sluggish resistive sort , as seen on plenty of WinMobs , Treos , the Nintendo DS etc , which respond to styli too .
Unfortunately , multitouch , the ability to use different kinds of finger action to manipulate screen objects , is n’t yet available .
The G1 recognises differing speeds of flicking / scrolling as well as the distinction between a touch and a long hold .
It does this responsively and accurately , you very soon learn to trust the screen in exactly the way you do n’t with the BB Storm .
There is currently no way to input text except by sliding out the qwerty keyboard .
I do n’t like this keyboard .
Others do .
I find its keys okay , it ’s simply that it is hard to read , being always in shadow and underlit .
I ’m never quite sure how to grasp the device for the best keystroking either .
The slide mechanism seems robust enough , which it will need to be of course , for the hinge will be used scores of times a day every day .
For those familiar with the iPhone , and even I suspect those not , the G1 is similarly intuitive and simple to use .
Icons can be dragged around and placed wheresoe ’er sir or madam desires .
Among the standout features are the notifications at the top of the screen , informing you of incoming emails , texts , missed calls and so on , which can be expanded into the full screen by pulling down a kind of a window blind .
An equivalent at the bottom pulls up a drawer style screen containing all the home screen applications , settings , utilities and other icons as well as an Android Market button , which opens the system ’s equivalent of the iPhone App Store .
The Market is where Android will prove itself .
At the moment there is nothing even close to the number of programs that the App Store can boast , but the G1 is all about the future .
It updates itself transparently over the air , it is open enough to allow for new and imaginative solutions to its current shortcomings .
Its current SDK does n’t allow for the kind of programming that will really take advantage of the OS , but then the OS does n’t yet take advantage of the possibilities of the Apps Market either .
Each needs to catch up with the potential of the other .
One thoughtful feature of the Market is a warning screen that appears when you select an app for installation and download if that app in the course of its use will access any or all of either your location information , your personal information , your system tools or your full internet network connection .
The web browser is good , it uses Webkit , the same rendering engine Apple uses for Safari on the iPhone and , like Google ’s Chrome browser , combines search and URL input in one field .
In the absence of multitouch you will probably find the trackball useful for zooming and selecting when you browse .
A YouTube player attempts to make up , in exactly the way the iPhone does , for the unfortunate lack of Flash .
The G1 YT player is fine and can even search categories , which is one up on Apple’s .
As you would expect , the specific Gmail handling is good – the app in appearance and handling is not unlike the mobile site one has been able for some time to access from web capable mobile browsers .
There seems to be a push system at work which means that emails come in very quickly indeed .
Setting up other email accounts through an entirely different ( and rather bland ) email application is easy enough too .
The 3.2 MP camera is fine , and ( auto ) focusable which I like .
This allows macro detail ( a business card reader app must be in the works somewhere , one feels : like the one the old Sony Ericsson P series boasted ) and for the camera to combine with a splendid Market app called Shopsavvy , which reads barcodes in shops , looks them up and compares prices with online stores .
Images on the screen however , which ought to be as good as the iPhone just are n’t as bright and clear .
I compared the same photographs on each and the G1’s were unquestionably murkier and bluer each time .
You can never be sure though , can you , that you have n’t got a duff screen ?
But the G1 ’s problems run deeper than a less than perfect display …
Finding satellites to link with the otherwise excellent implementation ( naturally ) of Google Maps is deeply frustrating .
Do n’t get lost and rely on it .
The G1 is no business phone , that ’s for sure : Enterprise servers and VPN are not possible at this time .
The G1 is no mediaphone , that ’s for sure : movie player not included , audio playing is primitive , the sound is sub par , and there ’s no audio jack socket – you have to use special ( crap ) headphones that connect thru the USB port .
Bah !
You cannot sync the G1 with your PC or Mac – your music files have either to be downloaded OTA ( your best bet may be Amazon ’s DRM - free collection ) or copied from your computer onto a MicroSD card that is then inserted in the G1 .
Cumbersome and disappointing .
There is a lot wrong with this phone , yet to my mind none of that fundamentally matters .
These imperfections may make you delay your immediate purchase of an Android phone , but they need n’t .
The chances are that with a good contract ( T - Mobile are the G1 ’s only network in the US and the UK so far ) you will be on a free upgrade path anyway .
Unlocked phones seem unnecessarily expensive in Europe , where customs imposts make the device close to prohibitive for most pockets .
One can bet that the G2 and G3 will better bear the luscious fruit of Open Source development before very long .
Meanwhile , the G1 stands as a reasonably priced and impressive first shot from HTC and Android .
The whole system can only improve and when it does it will truly give the iPhone a run for its money .
Especially if Apple stays as tightly closed as they are now .
For the moment , however , it has also to be added that it is hard to believe that T - Mobile and Google have quite figured out their intended market .
It is certainly not to be found amongst the suits who cluster so loyally round their BlackBerries nor amongst young people who cluster so disloyally around the favoured music and video playback device of the moment .
In the US the talk is of G1 being the natural upgrade for the “ Sidekick generation ” – ie those raised on the Danger Hiptop , a device that always struck me as weird .
Whatever the market , I wish the G1 well , I really do .
Apple needs the competition and the world needs diversity , confidence and imagination in its choice of do - it - all communication devices .

Instead , describing it as a hot mess would be overly generous …
On Wall Street , his name is legendary .
With money he had made as a lifeguard on the beaches of Long Island , he built a trading powerhouse that had prospered for more than four decades .
At age 70 , he had become an influential spokesman for the traders who are the hidden gears of the marketplace .
But on Thursday morning , this consummate trader , Bernard L. Madoff , was arrested at his Manhattan home by federal agents who accused him of running a multibillion - dollar fraud scheme  perhaps the largest in Wall Street ’s history .
Regulators have not yet verified the scale of the fraud .
But the criminal complaint filed against Mr. Madoff on Thursday in federal court in Manhattan reports that he estimated the losses at $ 50 billion .
“ We are alleging a massive fraud  both in terms of scope and duration , ” said Linda Chatman Thomsen , director of the enforcement division at the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ We are moving quickly and decisively to stop the fraud and protect remaining assets for investors . ”
Andrew M. Calamari , an associate director for enforcement in the S.E.C. ’s regional office in New York , said the case involved “ a stunning fraud that appears to be of epic proportions . ”
Possible problems with President - elect Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus plan must be thoroughly vetted .
While only a few details are known , one overlooked issue is that it could create a major electoral advantage for Democrats at taxpayer expense .
That would be unacceptable for what is being touted as a nonpartisan measure , and gives Republicans yet another reason to oppose it if not restructured .
President - elect Obama is constantly emphasizing the need for Congress to pass his stimulus plan .
The details are vague .
All that is certain at this point is that it is approximately one trillion dollars and Mr. Obama says it will create three million new jobs .
Government cannot create self - sustaining jobs .
Government does n’t create value ; it takes it from us as taxes .
While a government job involves work and earns a paycheck , every government job is a burden on the private sector because it takes money away from the people .
While some of those jobs , such as military personnel or FBI agents , are essential for our nation , it ’s no secret that government is full of countless bureaucratic and wasteful jobs that the private sector can better perform .
Indeed , massive government spending sometimes destroys more jobs than it creates .
Every dollar the government takes in through taxes is a dollar taken out of circulation from the economy .
It ’s a dollar that does not go to your local restaurant , or hardware store , or movie theatre .
When government spends massive sums financed through taxes , it can destroy more jobs in the private sector than it creates in the public sector .
The only other way to finance massive government spending is through simply printing more money .
Government can do that ; it controls the printing press .
However , creating money out of thin air does n’t create wealth .
If the money supply rapidly expands while the amount of goods and services being produced declines ( the definition of a recession , which America is in ) the result is massive inflation .
This inflation penalizes saving and investments and burdens long - term financial planning and capital formation , worsening the economic situation .
So whether it ’s through massive taxes or massive injections of new money , a major spending bill entails consequences .
And when this amount of money is at stake , the sheer size of it could make the consequences severe .
But what may be most objectionable with Mr. Obama ’s plan is its potential for political mischief .
The first such shenanigans come from earmarks .
One of the proposed projects to receive this federal largesse is a museum on organized crime located in Nevada .
Does n’t Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid live in Nevada ?
Is that the kind of project that requires emergency federal funding ?
Is it irrelevant that Mr. Reid is facing a tough reelection next year ?
Even if the earmark issue is somehow resolved , however , there is another issue that it seems no one is discussing .
A week ago , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Republican , mentioned Mr. Obama says his goal is for 80 % of these three million jobs to be private - sector .
That means , Senator McConnell continued , that 20 % would be public - sector , meaning this bill would create 600,000 new federal government jobs .
For comparison , Mr. McConnell noted this would be the size of the entire Postal Service workforce .
Once government creates a job , it rarely eliminates it .
Government swells by nature , feeding on tax dollars taken away from private citizens and employers until it becomes a bloated , sprawling bureaucracy .
So if Mr. Obama creates 600,000 new government bureaucrats , those jobs should be expected to be kept around permanently , long after this economic crisis is resolved .
After all , eliminating those jobs means laying off 600,000 people .
Who wants to take responsibility for that ?
But most federal employees , that are not political appointees , vote Democrat .
Since Washington , DC is the seat of government , whenever new federal bureaucrats are created many live in Maryland and Virginia .
In 2008 , Virginia went Democrat for the first time since 1964 , and Mr. Obama won it by 130,000 votes .
Creating 600,000 new jobs might help cement Virginia in the Democrat column , making it harder for Republicans to retake the White House .
So this bill , as currently designed , has serious flaws , some of which convey a partisan advantage .
These must be thoroughly discussed and understood , and any major legislation cannot be allowed to benefit one party in what must be a bipartisan solution .
Home loans and other loans to become cheaper , fixed deposit rates also maybe cut Posted in Car Loans , Fixed Deposits , Home Loans by Ram Vishnu
December 7 , 2008
December 06 , 2008 , Ratekhoj.com .
Measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India to boost economic growth are likely to result in home loans , car loans , personal loans and other loans becoming cheaper .
As announced in a press release by the RBI : The Reserve Bank has reviewed the evolving macroeconomic and monetary / liquidity conditions and has decided to take the following further measures :
It has been decided to reduce the repo rate under the LAF by 100 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent and the reverse repo rate by 100 basis points from 6.0 per cent to 5.0 per cent , effective December 8 , 2008 .
…
We are working on a similar refinance facility for the National Housing Bank ( NHB ) of an amount of Rs 4 , 000 crore .
We will announce the details after consideration of the proposal by the Central Board of the Reserve Bank which is meeting next week .
…
It has been decided that loans granted by banks to Housing Finance Companies ( HFCs ) for on - lending to individuals for purchase / construction of dwelling units may be classified under priority sector , provided the housing loans granted by HFCs do not exceed Rs.20 lakh per dwelling unit per family .
However , the eligibility under this measure will be restricted to five per cent of the individual bankâs total priority sector lending .
This special dispensation will apply to loans granted by banks to HFCs up to March 31 , 2010 .
Repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow money from RBI and the reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks park their short - term excess liquidity with the RBI .
A reduction in the repo rate as announced by RBI above will help banks to get money at a cheaper rate .
It is expected that this will be passed on to consumers in the form of cheaper housing , car and other loans to stimulate economic growth .
As reported in The Hindu , the RBI GovernorÂ D Subbaro expectsÂ cuts in both lending as well as fixed deposit rates : Giving a clear signal to banks to cut the interest rates , the Reserve Bank of India on Saturday reduced the short - term indicative rates â the repo rate and the reverse report rate by 100 basis points each to 6.5 per cent and 5 per cent â with effect from December 8 .
This is likely to result in a further cut in interest rates of housing loans and other consumer and personal loans by banks .
… âThe cumulative impact of the measures in Saturdayâs package , together with earlier measures , should be to step up demand and arrest the growth moderation .
In particular , the reduction in the repo and reverse repo rates should result in a reduction in the marginal cost of funds to banks and enable them to improve the flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy on viable terms , â RBI Governor D. Subbarao said here while announcing a slew of measures to stimulate the economy .
â Our expectation is that banks will respond to the measures today by lowering lending and deposit rates , â the RBI Governor added .
Earlier , the RBI signalled a lowering of the interest rate structure by reducing its key policy repo rate by 150 basis points from 9 per cent as on October 19 to 7.5 per cent on November 3 .
Taking the signal from the repo rate cut , the top five public sector banks have reduced their benchmark prime lending rates ( BPLR ) from 13.75â  14 per cent as on October 1 to 13â  13.50 per cent now .
The central bank expects more banks to reduce rates following the latest measures .
As reported in Indian Express : The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) sent a strong signal to banks to lower interest rates on all types of borrowings by cutting the repo and reserve repo rates by 100 basis points .
The cuts are part of a mega economic stimulus package to make borrowing more affordable .
Â … In another measure that will result in lower home loans , the RBI has decided that loans granted by banks to housing finance companies ( HFCs ) for on - lending to individuals may be classified under the priority sector , provided the loans granted by HFCs do not exceed Rs 20 lakh per dwelling unit per family .
The priority sector status will enable banks to reduce interest rates on such loans significantly .
The RBI had cut the repo rate from 9 per cent to 7.5 per cent in October - November as a signal to commercial banks to bring down rates , but not many private banks did that .
This time , RBI Governor D. Subbarao , while announcing the cut in rates in Mumbai on Saturday , said in no uncertain terms that commercial banks âneed to get the signalâ .
Â âWe hope that commercial banks ( will ) act accordingly .
It is a matter of time before banks take a decision on interest rates on home loans .
Monetary transmission takes time .
However , as there is adequate liquidity in the system now and the demand for money is also falling , interest rates will also move down , â Subbarao said .
On Friday , ICICI Bank reduced its interest rate for home loans of Rs 20 lakh and below by 1.50 per cent to 11.50 per cent .
Bankers said that with a comfortable liquidity position and fall in inflation , interest rates would now fall across the board .
Â
As reported in Business Standard : Housing finance companies ( HFCs ) are contemplating a cut in their prime lending rates ( PLRs ) following the latest measures of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to stimulate the economy .
… â Naturally , we would reduce our prime lending rates as we are expecting an instant fund flow at a cheaper rate , subsequent to the policy , which would lower our cost of funds , â said LIC Housing Finance Director and CEO R R Nair .
Â
It ’s likely that there will be cuts in home loan and other loan rates in the near term in response to RBI ’s measures .
Therefore , people contemplating a home purchase in the near future can expect benefits from these measures .

Exclusive : Foreign banks may get help
In a change from the original proposal sent to Capitol Hill , foreign - based banks with big U.S. operations could qualify for the Treasury Department ’s mortgage bailout , according to the fine print of an administration statement Saturday night .
The theory , according to a participant in the negotiations , is that if the goal is to solve a liquidity crisis , it makes no sense to exclude banks that do a lot of lending in the United States .
Advertisement
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson confirmed the change on ABC's " This Week , " telling George Stephanopoulos that coverage of foreign - based banks is " a distinction without a difference to the American people . "
" If a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution , " Paulson said .
" That 's a distinction without a difference to the American people .
The key here is protecting the system .
...
We have a global financial system , and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world and encouraging them to do similar things , and I believe a number of them will .
But , remember , this is about protecting the American people and protecting the taxpayers .
and the American people do n't care who owns the financial institution .
If the financial institution in this country has problems , it 'll have the same impact whether it's the U.S. or foreign . "
The legislative outline that went to Capitol Hill at 1:30 a.m. Saturday had said that an eligible financial institution had to have “ its headquarters in the United States . ”
That would exclude foreign - based institutions with big U.S. operations , such as Barclays , Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank , HSBC , Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS .
But a Treasury “ Fact Sheet ” released at 7:15 Saturday night sought to give the administration more flexibility , with an expanded definition that could include all of those banks :
“ Participating financial institutions must have significant operations in the U.S. , unless the Secretary makes a determination , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , that broader eligibility is necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets . ”
The major change in the suggested eligibility requirements is the biggest change that Treasury publicly made after a day of briefings and conversations with Capitol Hill , and is likely the first of many .
Aspects of the $ 700 billion , two - year proposal that are still under negotiation include what , if anything , will be added to the administration ’s simple but sweeping proposal .
And the parliamentary route , such as what committees or hearings might be involved , has not been finalized .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) has a hearing scheduled for Wednesday that is likely to focus on the proposal .
Under what congressional officials called a likely scenario , the measure could go to the House floor on Thursday , with passage expected the same day .
The Senate could take the package up as soon as Friday and send it to President Bush for his signature , although the Senate schedule is less predictable and had not been determined .
Officials expect passage by huge margins in both chambers because Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have told congressional leaders the country ’s financial stability depends on it .
House Democrats plan to insist on adding protections for homeowners facing foreclosure .
They also want to add a measure to help homeowners facing bankruptcy and an executive compensation restriction designed to prevent golden parachutes for the heads of troubled institutions .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , who was supportive of the bailout concept in a statement released Friday , believes that “ whatever gets done in Congress has to protect Main Street , ” senior adviser Stephanie Cutter said on MSNBC on Saturday .
On “ Fox News Sunday , ” Paulson told Chris Wallace that he would resist the Democrats ' desired limits on executive compensation .
" If we design it so it 's punitive and institutions are n't going to participate , this wo n't work the way we need it to work , " Paulson said .
" Let 's talk executive salaries :
There have been excesses there .
I agree with the American people .
Pay should be for performance , not for failure .
We 've got work to do in that regard .
We need to do that work .
But we need this system to work .
And so reforms need to come afterwards .
My whole objective with the plan we have is to give us the maximum ability to make it work . ”
And the secretary told NBC’s Tom Brokaw on “ Meet the Press ” that he does n’t want new regulations simultaneously : “ That 's not doable to do that immediately .
But we very much need new regulations . ”
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) told Stephanopoulos on ABC : “ If we ’re going to spend taxpayer money to get rid of bad debt in these places , what is the reciprocal obligation … from the firms ? …
I think there ’s going to be a strong interest to deal with the Main Street aspects . ”
Appearing with him , House Republican Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio retorted : “ We ’ve already dealt with that , when we had the housing bill last summer .
I did n’t vote for it , because it ’s $ 300 billion bailout for scam artists and speculators and others around the housing industry .
But there are a lot of tools in there to help the Federal Housing Administration deal with the foreclosure problem that ’s out there .
We need to rise above partisan politics … and deal with this as adults . ”

The monster success of girly vampire pic Twilight at the US Box office last weekend could kick open the door for a big - screen return of Joss Whedon ’s much - loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
Rumours are circulating in Hollywood that Whedon has a feature - film script based on his hit TV series ready to roll as soon as a studio is prepared to commit .
is planning to resurrect Emmy - Award Winning American cult television series “ ” on the big screen , an Australian newspaper has claimed .
Quoting the Australian newspaper Moviehole Reports : The original television series of “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer ” follows the story of , a young woman fated to battle against vampires , demons and other forces of darkness .
The series which started its run in 1997 was starred by .
The Buffy concept was first unveiled as a movie in 1992 with Kristy Swanson taking the titular role .
The Senate Health , Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee conducted a hearing and then voted favorably on “ The New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act ” S119 , on Monday , December 15th in the State House Annex .
Six of the senate committee members voted in favor of the bill and only one member voted against the bill .
There were two abstentions .
Nick Scutari , the original senate sponsor of the bill , argued passionately for its approval .
He said there was , “ No price we would not pay , no limits we would not go ” to protect our loved ones from suffering needlessly .
He also quoted the National Academy of Sciences ’ Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report when he said to those who argued that we should wait for FDA approval of marijuana : “ There is little comfort in the promise of a better drug 10 years from now . ”
Sen. Scutari also noted how the IOM ’s recommendation to conduct clinical trials of medical marijuana has been ignored by the federal government .
Many professional healthcare organizations have endorsed medical marijuana and a number of them testified to this at the Senate Health Committee hearing .
Dr. Denis Petro explained how he conducted the first American study of marijuana ’s beneficial effects for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients that was published in 1981 .
Testimony was also heard from members of the Drug Policy Alliance and from supporters of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana New Jersey , Inc. ( CMMNJ ) .
A representative of Prairie Plant Systems was videoconferenced into the hearing to explain how medical marijuana was grown and distributed in Canada .
CMMNJ applauds the committee ’s vote as this represents significant progress in medical marijuana legislation in New Jersey .
The bill now goes to the entire Senate for a vote , possibly as early as January , 2009 .
The bill has yet to be voted on in the Assembly , but Governor Corzine has said that he would sign the bill when it gets to his desk .
Thirteen states have laws that protect medical marijuana users and now New Jersey is poised to become the 14th state to protect patients who use marijuana with a doctor ’s recommendation .
For more info , contact Ken Wolski , RN , MPA , Executive Director , Coalition for Medical Marijuana New Jersey , Inc. , 844 Spruce St. , Trenton , NJ 08648 , or call 609.394.2137
We spoke with Ken on Friday about this hearing and we ’re excited at the result !
We will follow the New Jersey bill in the next year and hope that the Garden State becomes at least the 14th state to legalize medical use of cannabis .
With Minnesota , Illinois , Wisconsin , Kansas , North Carolina , Massachusetts , and even Idaho and Alabama considering medical marijuana in the next term , there may be a mad dash for that 14th spot !

Torture is the act of inflicting severe pain to force someone to do or say something .
It has been used against prisoners - of - war , suspected insurgents , and political prisoners for hundreds of years .
In the 1970s and 1980s , governments began to identify a specific form of violence called " terrorism " and to identify prisoners as " terrorists . "
This is when the history of torture and terrorism begins .
While many countries practice torture against political prisoners , only some name their dissidents terrorists or face potential threats from terrorism .
Torture and Terrorism Around the World
Governments have used systematic torture in conflicts with rebel , insurgent , or resistance groups in long - running conflicts since the 1980s .
It is questionable whether these should always be called terrorism conflicts .
Governments are likely to call their non-state violent opponents terrorists , but only sometimes are they clearly engaged in terrorist activity .
Examples of torture used by governments around the world include the Israeli Supreme Court 's " License to Torture " ruling , Russia 's use of torture techniques in the Chechnya war , and Egypt 's torture of both domestic and foreign terrorists .
Interrogation Practices Considered to be Torture
The issue of torture in relation to terrorism was raised publicly in the United States in 2004 when news of a 2002 Memorandum issued by the Justice Department for the CIA suggested that torturing Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees captured in Afghanistan might be justified to prevent further attacks on the U.S .
A subsequent memo , requested by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2003 , similarly justified torture on detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center .
The UN has a clear definition of torture , as determined by a General Assembly resolution that dates to 1984 .
A scandal erupted in the U.S. media in 2004 when photos from the Abu Ghraib prison surfaced , proving that the American military has been engaged in some practices that break with this resolution .
It has since been proven that America uses several specific torture techniques when questioning prisoners .
It was reported by " The New Yorker " that these techniques turned deadly at least once at the Abu Ghraib prison .
Legislation Since 9/11
In the years immediately preceding the 9/11 attacks , there was no question that torture as an interrogation practice is out - of - bounds for American military personnel .
In 1994 , the United States passed a law prohibiting the use of torture by the American military under any circumstances .
Furthermore , as a signatory , the U.S. was bound to comply with the 1949 Geneva Convention .
This specifically prohibits torturing prisoners - of - war .
After 9/11 and the beginning of a Global War on Terror , the Department of Justice , Department of Defense , and other offices of the Bush Administration issued a number of reports on whether " aggressive detainee interrogation " practices and suspending Geneva Conventions is legitimate in the current context .
These documents include the 2002 Justice Department 's " torture " memo , the 2003 Defense Department Working Group Report , and the 2006 Military Commissions Act .
International Conventions Against Torture
Despite ongoing debates about whether torture is justified against terrorism suspects , the world community finds torture repugnant under any circumstances .
It 's not a coincidence that the first of the declarations below appeared in 1948 , just after the end of the Second World War .
The revelation of Nazi torture and " science experiments " performed on German citizens in World War II produced a global abhorrence of torture conducted by any party — but especially sovereign states .
International Conventions Against Torture
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
1948 European Convention on Human Rights
1955 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners
1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
1969 American Convention on Human Rights
1975 World Medical Association Declaration of Tokyo
1975 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Torture
1984 Convention Against Torture

VOLVO'S new XC60 sport-utility vehicle comes , as you might expect of the safety - conscious Swedish carmaker , with a number of features designed to look after its occupants in the event of a collision .
It has airbags , rollover and side - impact protection and so forth .
But it is also fitted with mechanisms to help avoid a crash in the first place , including an automated braking system .
As more cars acquire features that can assist a driver in a dangerous situation , or even take control , the rules of the road may need rethinking .
The Volvo system , called City Safety , operates at up to 30 kph ( 19 mph ) .
This speed range was chosen because it is when most collisions take place , especially rear - end shunts in slow - moving traffic .
City Safety uses a laser sensor fitted behind the windscreen to scan the road ahead , calculating relative speeds and distances .
It applies the brakes if a collision cannot be avoided .
( The system switches off at very low speeds , so that drivers can park close to other vehicles . )
A number of carmakers already have or are introducing automated - braking systems .
Germany 's Daimler uses a radar - based one in some of its Mercedes - Benz vehicles .
Called Distronic , it also operates at high speed and adjusts both braking and acceleration to maintain a constant distance from other cars .
If a collision seems likely a warning is given .
When the driver puts his foot on the brake pedal the system automatically applies the optimum pressure required to avoid hitting the car in front .
If the driver fails to respond , the brakes come on automatically .
Staying on the road
These so - called “ intelligent ” vehicle - safety systems have the potential to make roads a lot safer , according to a new study by VTT Technical Research Centre , a big contract - research organisation based in Finland .
It reckons the most promising is electronic stability - control , which can improve a car 's handling by detecting and helping to prevent a skid .
The centre calculates that if this system alone were fitted to all the vehicles in Europe it would reduce the number of people killed on the roads there by almost 17 % .
Devices designed to prevent a driver straying from a motorway lane would reduce deaths by about 15 % .
Those warning drivers about speed limits and other hazards would cut fatalities by 13 % .
Some of these systems may be combined ; the forward - facing camera that monitors road markings for the lane - departure system in the new BMW 7 Series , for instance , is also capable of recognising speed signs and displaying the limit on the dashboard .
Eventually these safety systems will make their way from expensive cars to most models , just as anti-lock brakes have .
This will make cars much more “ aware ” of their surroundings .
Even smarter stuff is coming .
Jan Ivarsson , head of safety at Volvo , believes it should be possible to build a car in which people will not be killed or injured .
The company is experimenting with devices that would automatically steer away from an oncoming vehicle .
Such a car would also spot a pedestrian stepping into the road and brake .
In 2009 Daimler will introduce a device that warns drivers of fatigue .
It uses multiple sensors to set up a profile of the way someone drives and sounds the alarm if he departs from it .
In particular , it monitors steering behaviour — which , when it becomes a bit erratic , is a good indicator of tiredness .
Daimler is also working on ways to make cars brake at red traffic lights .
Many of these safety systems at first give warning of impending danger before taking over .
Despite that potential delay they still provide what Rodolfo Schöneburg , Daimler 's head of passive safety , has described as an “ electronic crumple zone ” : applying the brakes a bit late rather than not at all will at least reduce the impact of a collision .
Yet sometimes there is no room for any delay in avoiding an accident , for instance when a vehicle jumps a stop sign at a busy junction .
This means safety systems will need to become even more autonomous in order to act faster — faster , probably , than people can .
But because cars will be acting independently of each other , this raises safety concerns of its own .
Researchers worry , for example , about what might happen if a child ran into a busy road .
If one car automatically slammed on its brakes and swerved , it could prompt others to take evasive action .
The result of all these automatic , independent decisions could be a pile - up causing more deaths , injuries and damage than there would have been had drivers remained in charge .
So some researchers are now looking at ways in which vehicles could co-ordinate their crash - avoidance manoeuvres .
This means that in an emergency cars would have to tell each other at once what they were about to do , says Thomas Batz of the Fraunhofer Institute for Information and Data Processing in Karlsruhe , Germany .
His work is part of a broader project on “ cognitive automobiles ” involving other groups , including the University of Karlsruhe and the Technical University in Munich .
Last year some of the researchers entered the Urban Challenge , an event organised by the American government 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to produce vehicles capable of operating autonomously in a city .
DARPA wants to use such technology to produce robotic vehicles for military convoys in areas of conflict .
Taking charge
Mr Batz and his colleagues are devising software that can gather information from vehicles ' sensors and use it to co-ordinate group behaviour in an emergency .
Although the project is still at the simulator stage , it has already shown that one car in a group driving along a road will have to be nominated as co-ordinator .
This shortens the lines of command for split - second decisions .
The group co-ordinator could , for instance , order two vehicles travelling in adjacent lanes to swerve in the same direction and another to brake sharply or even run off the road if no obstructions or pedestrians were detected .
The system would also have to cope with the presence of cars with no autonomous functions .
Carmakers are thinking about such things too .
Daimler , for instance , believes that if details like the weight of vehicles and their rigidity could be communicated in the instant before a crash , then protection systems , like pre-tensioning seat belts , could adjust optimally in anticipation .
Volvo 's engineers envision cars being able to warn each other of hazards such as slippery roads .
Some GPS units already tip each other off about traffic jams .
Collaborative anti-collision systems will encounter not only engineering problems , but perhaps legal ones too : whose insurer pays when one vehicle instructs another to take emergency action , causing it to bump into a third ?
And no one is yet sure what the effect will be if semi-autonomous systems relieve the driving load to such an extent that motorists become less alert — a problem which airline pilots face in computerised cockpits .
The answer , eventually , may be to let computers take over completely and drive cars robotically .
An S - Class Mercedes with all the extras can already be left largely alone to make its way along a moderately busy and fairly straight Autobahn .
The experience of the DARPA challenge has shown that dealing with road junctions and traffic queues in cities is becoming possible too , especially with advances in machine vision .
Bit by bit , the day is coming when it will be possible to jump into an empty car and say : “ Home , James . ”

The other day I wrote about how the GeoEye - 1 satellite would be taking images of President Obama ’s inauguration from 423 miles up — in space .
This could only have worked on a clear day so clouds did n’t block the view .
Good news :
It was a clear day , and the pictures ( above and below ) look great .
The images show the view from the Capitol , the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument and surrounding areas .
See those things that look like ants ?
Yeah , those are people — millions of them .
The GeoEye - 1 is also known by some as the “ Google Satellite ” because Google has the rights to use some of its images for its Google Earth and Google Maps products .

HOUSTON -- After Houston thwarted two fourth - down attempts and recovered a fumble in the first quarter , the Cougars had to know it was going to be a good night .
They could n't have predicted it would be this good .
Case Keenum threw a career - high six touchdowns and ran for another score to help Houston stun No. 23 Tulsa 70 - 30 on Saturday night .
" Obviously , any team that is averaging 52 points per game , any time you can stop them , that is big , " Houston coach Kevin Sumlin said .
" Our defense really rose to the occasion .
I thought we had a great plan on both sides of the ball and our kids executed it . "
The Cougars ( 6 - 4 , 5 - 1 C - USA ) took advantage of Tulsa 's miscues to jump out to a 14 - 0 lead and never trailed .
Keenum threw five TD passes in the first half .
Two were to Tyron Carrier , who added a third touchdown on a 93 - yard punt return .
Houston sophomore Loyce Means had three interceptions , one of which he returned 69 yards for a touchdown .
It is the second straight loss for Tulsa ( 8 - 2 , 5 - 1 ) after it started the season with eight straight wins .
The Golden Hurricane were uncharacteristically sloppy Saturday and finished with five turnovers .
" When we take the ball away and score , that 's a great momentum swing , " Means said .
" Tulsa 's a great team , so you need to take advantage of your opportunities . "
The win left Houston , Tulsa and Rice tied for the C - USA West Division lead .
" It was an embarrassing loss for us , " Tulsa coach Todd Graham said , but " as bad as it is , we 're still tied for first place . "
The two high - powered offenses combined for 1,142 yards of offense and 59 first downs .
Keenum was 24 - of - 37 for 402 yards , his school - record 11th straight 300 - yard passing game .
He has thrown a touchdown in 13 straight games and has 60 for his career .
" This win is huge , " Keenum said .
" This is just step two of our four - game season .
This is another step of clinching the West .
That is our goal right now . "
The Cougars led 42 - 17 at halftime and scored touchdowns on their first three possessions of the second half , adding a fourth on Means ' interception return to push the lead to 70 - 30 early in the fourth quarter .
Keenum had a 6 - yard run early in the fourth quarter before he was replaced by Blake Joseph .
Tulsa 's David Johnson was 18 - of - 29 for 271 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions .
Johnson was replaced by Jacob Bower early in the fourth quarter .
Tulsa , which entered the game leading the Bowl Subdivision in total offense and scoring , looked off from the outset .
Two failed fourth down attempts and a fumble in the first quarter kept the Golden Hurricane scoreless in the opening quarter for the first time this season .
" It just did n't seem like things were going our way , " Johnson said .
" We just played absolutely horrible tonight ... they shut us down offensively and really confused us a little bit at times . "
Carrier 's first touchdown reception gave the Cougars a 7 - 0 lead in the first quarter .
Carrier finished with six receptions for 127 yards .
Means intercepted a wobbly pass on a fake punt by punter Michael Such to set up that score .
" It was there and we made a bad throw , " Graham said .
" That was kind of indicative of how the night was going to go .
Bad call probably on our part .
Everybody had a hand in tonight .
It just was n't our night . "
Tulsa went for it on fourth - and - goal from the 1 on the next possession and the Cougars got to Johnson and forced him to throw the ball away .
Houston 's 70 points were the most Tulsa has allowed since an 82 - 28 loss to Houston in 1988 .
Carrier finished with six receptions for 127 yards .
Means intercepted a wobbly pass on a fake punt by punter Michael Such to set up that score .
Carrier 's punt return just before halftime made it 42 - 17 .
He evaded the first wave of defenders before shaking off three tackles and tight - roping the sideline for the score .
" Tulsa is a really good team and this really surprised me , " Carrier said .
" Everything was just clicking tonight .
Just like the goal line stand .
That showed them that we could play with them .
That showed them that we came to play . "
OTTAWA — Michael Ignatieff is poised to become the new leader of the Liberal party after rival Bob Rae bowed out of the leadership race this afternoon .
Rae gave a gracious exit from the race that he entered just three weeks ago , pledging his " full and unqualified " support to Ignatieff and urging his supporters to do the same .
" He will make a great prime minister , " Rae told a news conference this afternoon .
The former NDP premier of Ontario insisted he had no regrets leaving the leadership contest , saying that " extraordinary " events on Parliament Hill had forced the Liberal party to move fast to find a permanent replacement for Stephane Dion .
" We can not control the flow of events , " he said .
" It 's just politics .
It 's not the end of the world . "
He spoke glowingly of Ignatieff , saying the former academic will bring " tremendous energy " to the job of party leader .
Ignatieff , in a one - paragraph statement posted on his website , paid tribute to Rae and welcomed his support .
" Bob Rae has dedicated his life to serving Canadians and I have always felt privileged to count him as a friend and colleague .
His decision today reflects his commitment to the unity of our party and our purpose in these challenging times .
" I am grateful for his support , and I look forward to continuing the work of rebuilding the Liberal Party with him , and all Liberals , in the weeks and months ahead . "
Rae said his decision to quit was sealed this morning when the party 's national executive decided on a narrow consultation to pick an interim leader , rather than polling the grassroots as Rae had demanded .
Rae realized that he little chance of winning under such a scenario .
With Rae and Liberal MP Dominic LeBlanc now out of the race , Ignatieff will be acclaimed as " interim " leader of the party , with that selection likely to be ratified at a party convention in May in Vancouver .
Yesterday , Rae , the former NDP premier of Ontario , had argued strongly against a " coronation " and refused to bow to growing pressure to drop out of the race , like LeBlanc did .
" I do n't think coronations are generally very successful in political parties . . . most people believe it 's better to have a contest , it 's better to have a choice , " a defiant Rae said .
" I think it 's appropriate for both of us to be running , " he said .
That 's why party members were shocked to hear the news today that Rae was abandoning his bid for the leadership .
" It 's a surprise to us all , " one Liberal said this morning .
" I think Bob concluded that the support in the party was not there .
I think it 's that simple , " he said .
Rae told close advisors this morning and planned a wider teleconference call to advise his supporters of his decision .
which he reached after the party 's executive council last night rejected a wider consultation with the grassroots of the party on the leadership issue .
The executive chose instead to consult riding association presidents and various ex-officio members of the party , including the heads of the women 's and aboriginal commissions .
It was a decision that vexed Rae and his supporters , given " you can organize a conference call with confidential PINs in half an hour , " said one .
" We 're repeating massive mistakes , " said one senior Liberal .
" Michael could 've well won , but leaping for the reins of power without giving the grassroots a voice - these are people who are going to do your organizing and legwork for the party .
It says the party can't move , can't be nimble .
It 's very dismaying . "
In the end , Rae decided that party unity was more important than waging a campaign of the grassroots versus the elites of the party , said the source .

" Do you wage a pitched battle that would be extremely divisive at a time where we have a national and economic crisis , and layers of political crisis still to work through ?
That 's the call you make at the end of the day . "
The Liberals are in a rush to have a new leader in place by the end of January , when a key budget vote could see the minority Conservatives defeated , sparking a new election or paving the way for a Liberal - led coalition to take power .
" At this critical time in our country 's history , the National Executive , in consultation with caucus , is now tasked by our party 's constitution with selecting an interim leader who will preside over a very volatile minority Parliament , and a possible general election , " Doug Ferguson , Liberal party president , said in a statement .

Three male Greensburg - Salem students , described as 16 and 17 years old , were charged with possession of child pornography after the pictures were found on their cell phones .
Lisa Rullo , former principal of the high school and current district director of student services , said students are made aware of laws and district rules regarding pictures on cell phones .
" We inform the students that it still is child pornography ( if they give or possess it ) and ... this is something they do n't want to have at all , " she said .

Is curing your headache with
acupuncture all in the mind ?
Many swear it is as powerful as any headache pill – but the benefits of acupuncture could be all in the mind .
Researchers have found a fake treatment is as good as the real thing at relieving the pain of headaches .
An analysis of dozens of studies involving almost 7,000 men and women showed the ancient Chinese art to be better than tablets at warding off migraines .
Those who had needles incorrectly inserted benefited nearly as much as those who had proper acupuncture
However , fake treatments , in which the needles were placed randomly on the skin , were just as effective at stopping migraines – and almost as good at preventing tension headaches .
The findings suggest many of the benefits of acupuncture are in the mind .
Researchers say it is likely patients benefit from the ' placebo effect ' , in which care , attention and the simple belief the treatment will work , lead to improvements in health .
The analysis , published in the respected Cochrane Library 's science review , is far from the first to cast doubts on the validity of the multi million - pound acupuncture industry .
For instance , recent research has shown that acupuncture does nothing to boost a woman 's chances of having a baby through IVF – and may even cut her odds of becoming a mother .
However , other studies have proclaimed it to be effective .
In order to establish whether acupuncture helps prevent headaches , the German researchers combined the results of 33 clinical trials involving 6,736 patients .
The men and women were treated for at least eight weeks in order to evaluate acupuncture 's ability to ease tension headaches or the more severe but less frequent migraines .
Some were treated with normal acupuncture , in which needles are inserted at specific ' energy points ' in the skin .
Others had a sham procedure , with the needles inserted at other points .
The analysis showed the fake acupuncture to be just as good as the real thing at preventing migraines and almost as good at stopping tension headaches .
Researcher Dr Klaus Linde , from the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the Technical University of Munich , said : ' The studies suggest that migraine patients benefit from acupuncture , although the correct placement of needles seems to be less relevant than is usually thought by acupuncturists .
' Much of the clinical benefit of acupuncture might be due to nonspecific needling effects and powerful placebo effects , meaning the selection of specific needle points may be less important than many practitioners have traditionally argued . '
But , with the studies also showing acupuncture to be better than drugs at controlling migraines , the researchers said patients should have access to the treatment .
Dr Linde said : ' Doctors need to know how long improvements associated with acupuncture will last and whether better - trained acupuncturists really achieve better results than those with basic training only . '
Dr Mike Cummings , medical director off the British Medical Acupuncture Society , said : ' We certainly do n't call what we do a " sham " procedure , as we believe there is growing evidence for a mechanism behind what we do .
' However , we still do n't fully understand what is happening when needles are inserted , although these reviews suggest that for certain conditions , it is effective . '
Louisiana man says he was beaten for wearing Obama t- shirt David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 9 , 2008
Print This Email This A Barack Obama supporter in Shreveport , LA says he was badly beaten by two men at a gas station just because of his Obama bumper stickers and t- shirt .
" They were screaming ' fuck Obama , fuck Obama , ' you know , and something about a ' nigger president ' -- and basically I was hit , " Kaylon Johnson told KSLA News .
" Seem like some rednecks , pretty big guys , and they were blasting music or whatever -- I mean , by the time I turned around and looked at them , they were on me . "
A local Democratic Party blog adds more details about the assault on Johnson , noting that " anyone who 's ever been in the Shreveport for Obama office knows him very well as our go - to IT guy and one of the office coordinators . "
" On Saturday night at a gas station in Shreveport , " blogger Versha Sharma recounts , " he was accosted by two white males who were yelling racial slurs , incensed by the Obama bumper stickers on Kaylon 's car and the Obama t- shirt Kaylon was wearing .
He waved them off , went into the gas station , and when he came out , they jumped on him . "
" Kaylon was badly beaten , " the account continues , " and has sustained several head injuries .
He will have surgery on Friday to repair a broken eye socket , broken nose , and torn tear duct . "
Johnson , who was extremely active in the campaign and even opened a store to sell Obama t- shirts , appeared philosophical about his injuries when he spoke with KSLA .
" Things go on every day , " Johnson stated , " and all this does is show that we did have purpose throughout the campaign and we still have work to do after the campaign . "
The Shreveport Police Department has assigned a detective to investigate the incident .
KSLA has more details here .

I got this email from Tim Spriggs today , regarding his Lisp Machine :
I 'm not exactly sure which model I have as it is on the other side of the country .
The nickname that comes to mind is " The Air Conditioner " because it 's big and loud .
In any case , I have to get rid of it finally ( long story ) and it is located in Tucson AZ .
Last time I turned it on ( some years ago ) I recall it booting into Genera .
It 's has a thicknet ethernet port on the back , some kind of tape device ( with tapes ) and lots of books on the OS / software .
I even recall seeing an open telnet port when I looked at it .
It also has two hard disks inside that are add up to a couple hundred MB I think .
Also I recall the memory on the machine was measured in mega words ( since it is a 36 - bit arch ) .
I can remember the exact number anymore , I want to say 512 but then that 's too perfect a number .
Of course the original monochrome monitor / keyboard / mouse come as well .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama affirmed his support for a woman's " right to choose " on Thursday , the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that led to the legalization of abortion , as thousands of anti-abortion activists descended on the National Mall to challenge his position .
President Obama issued a statement defending Roe v.
Wade for protecting " women 's health and reproductive freedom . "
Roe v. Wade " not only protects women 's health and reproductive freedom , but stands for a broader principle : that government should not intrude on our most private family matters , " Obama said in a statement .
The landmark 1973 decision held that a woman 's right to abortion was protected by the right to privacy under the Constitution 's 14th Amendment , voiding most state laws against abortion at the time .
Nellie Gray , who helped organize the anti-abortion March for Life on the Mall , invited Obama to speak at the rally .
" America needs your strong leadership as president of all the people to stop the intentional killing of an estimated 3,000 pre-born boys and girls each day and the brutalizing of mind , heart and body of pregnant mothers . "
Kim Gandy , president of the National Organization for Women , said she believes that while abortion should remain an option , increasing the availability and affordability of birth control and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies is the real solution .
" I think what everyone ought to be interested in doing , whether they are or not , is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies , " Gandy told CNN .
" Because if we reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , it will by definition reduce the number of abortions and reduce a lot of the pain and despair that has befallen women in these economic times , who cannot afford to enlarge their families when they do n't have a job and they do n't have a way to put food on the table for the kids that they have now .
" If we could all work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , it would dramatically change the debate on this issue . "
Obama has so far not struck down rules reinstated by the Bush administration eight years ago , prohibiting U.S. money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information , counseling or referrals about abortion services .
The " Mexico City policy " was initially put in place by President Ronald Reagan and suspended during Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Its opponents refer to it as the " global gag order . "
About 20 anti-abortion rights lawmakers spoke at the rally Thursday , pushing for a renewed effort to overturn Roe v. Wade .
" At what instant does life begin ? " asked Rep. Steve King , R - Iowa , focusing on younger crowd members who answered , " Conception ! "
" And the next question is , " he continued , " President Obama , when did your life begin ? "
Other legislators detailed their plans to keep the issue on the table in Congress and on the minds of voters .
Rep. Jean Schmidt , R - Ohio , told the crowd she plans to introduce what she calls the " Juno Bill , " referencing the hit 2008 film of the same title in which a high school teenager gives her baby up for adoption .
" It will provide a tax credit to those women , just as we allow abortions to be tax deductible , it will provide a tax credit so that they can carry out their pregnancy , give that baby to a loving arm and not have to worry about the consequences or the costs involved , " she said .
Throughout the rally , speakers urged bold action for their cause .
Gandy said the fight will also continue on the pro-abortion rights side .
" There 's no question we have a pro-choice president now , but he can't do it alone , " she said .
" He ca n't pass legislation .
He can't stop what 's going on at the state and local level and so the battle rages on ... at the congressional level , at the state and local level and certainly at the Supreme Court . "
She said the number of unwanted pregnancies is rising , as congressional action has increased the cost of contraception for college students and low - income women , " something we hope this administration will reverse . "
Two pieces of federal legislation are pending , she said .
The first will expand accessibility and availability of birth control , and the second , the Freedom of Choice Act , is a codification of Roe v. Wade .
NOW will continue pursuing both at the congressional level , she said , but noted that even though Congress has a Democratic majority , it does not have a pro-abortion rights majority .
" So that will continue to be an uphill battle , " she said
CNN 's Paul Courson and Mary Grace Lucas contributed to this report .

The upcoming 5.11 Tactical Series Light For Life UC 3.400
Flashlight might not have the most memorable name , but this incredible new device makes up for it with its high - tech , ultracapacitor power storage which can fully recharge from dead in as little as 90 seconds .
The torch uses no batteries and is likely the first small gadget to utilize the rapidly developing ultracapacitor technology .
Without batteries , the unit is also considerably lighter than most decent flashlights at just 16 oz .
Ultracapacitors are starting to become common in electric and hybrid vehicles due to their unique ability to rapidly recharge .
This is particularly important when capturing energy from regenerative braking systems , as well as for consumer convenience .
The limited capacity of ultracapacitors has stood in the way of their widespread use , but this is rapidly improving , as evidenced by the 90 minute life of this flashlight .
The torch is slated for release early next year and is rated for 50,000 charge / discharge cycles , which means even if you use and charge it everyday , it will likely outlive you – something you could never achieve with batteries .
It uses 3 LED ’s rated at 50,000 hours , which are capable of producing 270 lumens in bright mode and 90 lumens in standard mode .
The 5.11 is available for pre-order at a pricey $ 170 , but should offer a good return on investment from all the batteries you wo n’t have to buy .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said he wants Israeli troops to leave Gaza " as quickly as possible " after Israel 's three - week offensive .
Troops began pulling out after Israel said it had met its war aims and declared a unilateral ceasefire .
Hamas later declared its own truce with one of its leaders claiming a " great victory " over Israel .
As Gaza enjoyed a second quiet night , local sources said the conflict had left 4,000 buildings destroyed .
A further 20,000 buildings were severely damaged , Gaza municipal officials said after an initial count .
An Israeli military spokesman told the BBC it appeared that the ceasefire was holding .
Critical of tactics
Correspondents say the ceasefire in Gaza remains fragile .
Our demand is the withdrawal of the enemy forces from the Gaza Strip within a week

Gazans confront shattered lives Broken town shows destruction
Palestinian militants fired about 20 rockets over the border after the Israeli ceasefire announcement , and Israel responded with an air attack .
Surrounded by an array of European political leaders , some of whom were highly critical of Israel 's tactics in the conflict with Hamas , the Israeli prime minister said his country was not interested in staying in the Gaza Strip .
" We did n't set out to control Gaza , we do n't want to remain in Gaza and we intend on leaving Gaza as quickly as possible , " he said .
The European leaders had travelled to Israel to lend their support to the ceasefires .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the opening of the crossings into Gaza was important to " make possible a resumption of the talks that are necessary for a permanent peace " .
Boasting of victory , Ismail Haniya , the top Hamas leader in Gaza , said Israel had " failed to achieve its goals " .
In a speech broadcast on Hamas TV station , he said : " Despite all the wounds , our people did n't surrender , but demonstrated a legendary perseverance . "
Hamas said it would hold fire for a week to give Israel time to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip .
" Our demand is the withdrawal of the enemy forces from the Gaza Strip within a week , along with the opening of all the crossings for the entry of humanitarian aid , food and other necessities for our people in the Gaza Strip , " said Hamas 's deputy chief in Syria , Moussa Abou Marzouk .
Meanwhile , the BBC's Paul Wood entered northern Gaza via the Erez crossing as part of the first group of journalists to gain independent access to the Strip from Israel .

He says that in the town of Beit Lahiya he saw the first real destruction - streets churned up by Israeli heavy armour , overturned cars , a lake of raw sewage in the street and a mosque left as a charred ruin .
Hamas officials stopped the BBC from filming at one site where bodies were still being removed - a sign , perhaps , that there had been some kind of military target nearby , our correspondent says .
The BBC's Bethany Bell , on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza , said Israeli helicopters and drones had been flying overhead and Israeli troops were on high alert on Sunday .
Many people are hoping that a ceasefire will last , but no - one on either side of the border will be surprised if the fighting starts up again , she adds .
At least 1,300 Palestinians , according to Palestinian sources , and 13 Israelis have been killed since Israel launched its offensive on 27 December .
Palestinian medical sources say at least 95 bodies have been pulled from the rubble since Israel halted its offensive .
The BBC's Christian Fraser , in Rafah on the Gaza - Egypt border , says many of the 40,000 people who fled the town during the conflict , were returning to pick through the ruins of their homes on Sunday .
People are salvaging whatever they can , our correspondent says - even the broken bricks and corrugated iron are taken away on donkeys .
Hamas is still very much in control of the town , our correspondent adds .
One fighter told the BBC their determination and ability to fight was undiminished .
Speaking after the talks , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said he would be sending a team to assess the immediate humanitarian needs of the people in Gaza .
" Within 10 days , I think we 'll be able to make an assessment report and we will issue a humanitarian urgent , a humanitarian flash appeal . "

The spoof edition fooled many readers
A fake edition of the New York Times announcing the end of the Iraq war has been handed out to commuters in the US .
More than one million free copies of the 14 - page " special edition " newspaper were distributed , mainly in the cities of New York and Los Angeles .
Another bogus story was about all Americans being given free healthcare .
A liberal group called the Yes Men , well known in the US for its practical jokes , claimed responsibility for the elaborate prank .
The fake paper - dated 4 July 2009 - had a motto on its front page which read " all the news we hope to print " .
The hoax was accompanied by a website that mimicked the look of The New York Times 's real website .
A page of the spoof site contained links to dozens of liberal organisations , which were also listed in the print edition .
The fake edition surprised commuters , many of whom took the free copies thinking they were legitimate .
Later , the Yes Men issued a statement claiming responsibility .
" In an elaborate operation six months in the planning , 1.2 million papers were printed at six different presses and driven to pre-arranged pick - up locations . "
The statement added that thousands of volunteers helped to distribute the fake edition .
A spokeswoman for the newspaper , Catherine Mathis , said : " This is obviously a fake issue of The Times .
We are in the process of finding out more about it . "

When my tour comes through a city , a lot of times athletes will call me up or have their managers get in touch with my management and come by and say what 's up .
JaMarcus Russell and Darren McFadden came by in Oakland , and LeBron , Daniel ( Boobie ) Gibson and Ocho Cinco came to the Cleveland show .
James
Posey also turned up at one , too .
Oh , and I met Gibril Wilson at the Oakland show , too .
I introduced myself to him and he was like , " I know who you are : you rented my condo in Atlanta ! "
We 'd never met before , so that was cool .
I 'd seen pictures of him in drawers in the kitchen , so I put it together .
LIL WAYNE ON THE SUPER BOWL
As you guys know , I picked the Ravens to win the Super Bowl a few months ago , and I 'm not happy they lost .
I did not like that game .
They were so banged up and they just looked tired .
So now I 'm gonna have to go with the Cardinals .
When the playoffs started , I had 'em going to the NFC championship game and losing , but I 'm still pretty happy they 're gonna be in the Super Bowl .
They 've got a tough challenge ahead of 'em going up against the Steelers , but I 'm gonna go ahead and pick them to win the Super Bowl .
Why ?
I like Kurt Warner .
Remember him with the Rams in the Super Bowl ten years ago ?
Yeah .
He 's back .
And he 's got a whole new offense to work with .
The Steelers were able to stop Joe Flacco , but , with all due respect to my man Joe Flacco , Kurt Warner is not a rookie quarterback .
I like Larry Fitzgerald a lot .
He 's not the best receiver in the NFL — that would be Steve Smith or Terrell Owens — but he 's the best receiver in the Super Bowl .
And if Warner has any time to throw to him , it 's over .
I 'm taking the Cardinals by 14 to 17 points .
A lot of people will think that 's crazy , but you gotta understand the Cardinals have all the motivation right now .
Nobody expects them to be there , so they 're out there trying to prove something .
That 's the best situation to be in , period .
That 's the way all the most successful people on the planet motivate themselves .
So yeah , Arizona is gonna stomp their hearts and Kurt Warner is going to win the Super Bowl MVP , go into the Hall of Fame and become an excellent commentator for ESPN in a few years .
LIL WAYNE ON THE NFL
Did you see Ray Lewis might go to the Jets ?
If Brett Favre stays and Ray Lewis joins that team , that will be my most favorite team in all of history .
I will get season tickets and paint my face green and go to every game .
It would be like Clyde and Hakeem .
Honestly , I do n't know if Brett is coming back next year .
There are a lot of ifs , like IF Ray comes in there and IF Rex Ryan wants him back .
I know that in the middle of the season they told him they wanted him back next year , and whenever he 's wanted back , you know what he does .
But Ryan may not want him , and he's the guy who 's probably going to make that call .
I like that they hired Ryan as the coach .
I 'm with that move ' cause his dad coached the team in Super Bowl III , so he grew up a fan .
This is a dream for him , so it 's a great story and all that .

He 's rehabbing his ankle and he 's going to be ready for the Pro Bowl . )
LIL WAYNE ON THE NBA
Did you guys see that game earlier in the week when the Cavaliers played the Lakers ?
Did you see what happened after Kobe got injured ?
He got better .
He taught that boy a lesson .
He said , LeBron , you 're good , but I 'm great .
And the crazy thing is he 's getting better every year .
There is no doubt in my mind the Lakers will win the championship this year .
None whatsoever .
I see he was talking about how he'd go play left field for the Dodgers and hit third if Manny Ramirez did n't re-sign , and I would n't put it past him .
Kobe would probably be a great baseball player , because he 's so damned determined to be the best .
He was on TV talking about how he was Randy Moss-ing it , and that made me laugh .
I would like to see Kobe try another sport in his spare time , just like MJ .
What if he can throw a curveball or something ?
Can you imagine that ?
If the Dodgers are smart , they 'll re-sign Manny .
I 'm not really sure what 's taking so long .
It seems like they 're trying to teach him a little lesson about who really has the power here .
But it 's almost time for spring training to start , so I think the Dodgers are about to get real in a minute .
I got to see Chris Paul the other day .
He came to my show in New Orleans and then he came to cut the ribbon on this new basketball court I built for the community , where a bunch of trailers used to be .
He asked me if I wanted to play him , but you know , I had to decline because it was cold .
Also , I did n't want to go out there and show my shot to the news cameras .
Did n't want to have to turn down offers to go play in the league because I 've got this tour going on .
LIL WAYNE ON TIGER WOODS
The Masters are coming up and Tiger is gonna dominate .
He 's had his time off , and he 's gonna come back so crazy and win the Masters by four strokes at least .
There 's no way he 's gonna come back and suck .
This is a man who is on the same level as Kobe and Michael in terms of skill and competitiveness , so I do n't see him coming back and NOT dominating .
He says he has n't been playing , but I think he 's lying .
I think he sits there in his crib on his Nintendo Wii , working on his form .
I 'm not that good on the Wii so I do n't like to play it .
But can you imagine Tiger Woods on that thing ?
That would be ridiculous .
I bet he's on there every day practicing away so he can come out and whip some a — .
ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL
Shoutout to Jodie Meeks from Kentucky for dropping a cool 54 points the other night and following it up with an easy 22 in a win .
He 's got a nice little streak going and I 've got my eye on him .
He was only averaging like 12 points a game and now he 's up to 25 or something , so watch out for him .
Oh , and shoutout to Greg Monroe from Georgetown ' cause he 's from New Orleans .
Stephen Curry , I love you , but you need to do something amazing this week , because you 're kind of falling off the radar .
Time to go for 40 , kid .
Man , he 's going to be great in the pros , ' cause with a shot like that coming off those hard screens , he 's got a bright future ahead of him .
He 's also getting better overall each year , he just needs to have a big game that gets him back on SportsCenter soon so people do n't forget about him .
Have you guys been watching the Connecticut women 's basketball team ?
Oh my God .
They beat North Carolina something like 87 - 58 .
Much props to Geno Auriema , man .
He 's got his girls playing to where the ball does n't even touch the court .
They pass the ball so well , it 's amazing to watch .
Shoutout to Rashanda McCants ' cause she 's balling for UNC .
I want to go to Chapel Hill and catch Tyler Hansbrough before he leaves next year .
I 'm gonna try my best to get over there before this season is over because I really want to see him .
LIL WAYNE ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Well , I told you that Florida was gonna win the national championship , so shout out to the Gators for fulfilling your destiny .
I think it 's a great thing that Tim Tebow is returning to school for his last year .
He probably would have gone anywhere from the second to the fifth round in the draft if he'd come out this year , and next year I bet he 's a first rounder .
Coming out of college early to declare for the draft is a tough decision .
I know Pete Carroll was n't too pleased that Mark Sanchez decided to go .
As a coach , I can understand being upset , but it goes beyond football .
I mean , it 's this person 's life .
It 's a tough thing when you make the leap to being a pro .
You 're gonna have a lot of people in your ear telling you this or that , and it 's easy to get taken advantage of .
And then once you get that first paycheck , look out , man .
If I were Mark Sanchez , or any of these guys going pro , the first thing I would do is find a great attorney I could trust with my life .
Someone who can handle all that and call me up and tell me if my cousin is trying to get $ 10,000 from me .
Because when you 've got so much going , you do n't have the time to oversee where every dollar is going .
The second thing I would tell Mark Sanchez is that a phone is optional .
If you are n't constantly giving everyone your number , then people have to go through your manager , agents or whatever to get a hold of you , and you 're much less likely to get taken advantage of .
You pay people to handle this kind of stuff so you do n't have to .
Sometimes I just leave my phone off when it gets to be too much .
I 'm glad that I signed a record deal and all that before everyone had cell phones and Facebook and Myspace , because I 'm not hooked in with all that .
Everybody I 've ever met does n't have direct access to me .
I know that most of these kids in this generation of athletes are hooked in that way , and it makes things a lot more complicated for them .
Saying no is hard , but if people can't get a hold of you , then you do n't really have to .
Looks like a perverts dream come true ...:)
COMMENTARY :
News that Toyota Motor Corp. will delay indefinitely construction of its yet - unfinished North American plant in Blue Springs , Miss. , provides further proof , if any is needed , that government should not be in the economic development business .
It also makes plain that government “ investments ” in infrastructure , green technology and other public works , as proposed in President Obama ’s stimulus package , will be little different than other government spending programs , funneling taxpayer money to favored special interests .
Just over a year ago , when gasoline was selling for around $ 2 a gallon , Mississippi state officials announced with great fanfare that Toyota had chosen Blue Springs as the site for a new , several - hundred - million - dollar facility to produce the company ’s popular Highlander SUV .
When prices at the pump headed north last summer , the company revised its plans , deciding that Blue Springs would be retooled to produce the suddenly popular Prius hybrid instead .
Then the economy collapsed .
Mere weeks before Toyota disclosed that it would report a 2008 operating loss - the first in company history - construction at Blue Springs was halted .
Investors in private firms knowingly assume the risks associated with economic events that affect their companies , industries and the broader economy .
Toyota ’s stockholders were no different .
But because state and local officials teed up some $ 235 million in incentives to lure Toyota to Blue Springs - cheap land , infrastructure improvements , tax relief , low - cost electric power and remedial worker training - Mississippi taxpayers involuntarily will be left holding the bag .
Armed with rosy projections of the economic benefits the Toyota plant supposedly would bring to North Mississippi - new high - paying jobs and new sources of tax revenue - the incentives were an easy sell .
Had sober minds prevailed , however , they would have realized the deal was unlikely to pay off .
Purchasers of new cars - if any are left - do n’t much care whether their Highlanders or Priuses are made in Mississippi or Timbuktu .
They want value .
So any money government spends to entice a company to locate here , rather than there , is wasted from a broad societal point of view .
Such incentives also are poor public policy because most companies choose plant sites prior to entering negotiations with local officials .
Convincing economic development agencies that their state or city is “ in the hunt ” often is simply a ploy to extract a more generous subsidy package from the place where they already plan to locate .
There is also no such thing as “ free ” growth .
Even in the rare case where public subsidies actually do attract new business , additional public services will be needed to accommodate the business and its employees .
New classrooms will have to be built and new teachers hired , highway budgets will have to be increased to maintain more heavily used roads and bridges , more sanitation workers will be needed , and so on .
The extra burden on the public sector needs to be factored in .
When the new company has been granted relief from state and local taxes , the higher tax bill falls on existing residents and businesses , possibly destroying as many or more jobs as the politicians pompously credit themselves for creating in the first place .
The truth is :
It is not government ’s function to create jobs .
Putting people to work is easy , as demonstrated by Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s Depression - era Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , more accurately known as “ WPA : We Piddle Around . ”
The bigger challenge is to create wealth .
Toyota failed to foresee the economic events that caused its expansion plans to unravel .
Keep this in mind when Congress and the White House are selecting economic stimulus projects to fund this year .
If highly successful private firms like Toyota - with their extraordinary market research and years of savvy and experience - sometimes embark on projects that turn sour , how can we expect politicians , most of whom have no such business know - how , to pick winners ?
There is a difference , however .
Companies usually risk their own money .
In Washington , the politicians will be risking ours .

Please lobby your Members of Parliament to prevent them from exempting the details of their expenses from Freedom of Information Act requests ,
Specifically ask them to vote against the draft Freedom of Information ( Parliament ) Order 2009 ( .pdf ) , this Thursday .
FOIA campaigner Heather Brook clearly lays out the case for full disclosure and transparency of MP 's expenses , just as is routine in the Scottish Parliament .
- MPs ' expenses -
We have until Thursday to stop this rot
As usual , the excellent people at mySociety.org have provided some online tools to make this easy for you and your friends :
mySociety blog » MPs expenses - pulling out the stops
By Tom Steinberg on Monday , January 19th , 2009 A few moments ago the team rolled out changes to our biggest and best known site , TheyWorkForYou.com meaning that every visitor to any page of the site will be greeted with a call to arms on the issue of some MPs voting this Thursday to conceal their expenses .
And after the vote , we ’ll be prominently publishing who voted which way - there should be a couple of million visitors at least before the next election .
Our explicit goal is to have a lot of constituents from around the country let their MPs know they wo n’t be impressed with a ‘ yes ’ vote or an abstention ( the same thing in this case ) , and to build our Facebook group to the point where the mainstream media starts to take notice of this Net driven discontent .
Please do everything you can to get as many people as possible writing to their MPs and joining that Facebook group .
We ’re doing our bit - please do yours .
Together we can stop the encouraging trend of more openness in our Parliament scrunching into reverse .
UPDATE :
Astonishingly , we appear to have won , for now at least !
The Labour Government , despite imposing a 3 line whip to try to force this controversial nonsense through , appear to have retreated for now , and have withdrawn the controversial Order .
BBC :- Brown backs down in expenses row
mySociety blog :- Blimey .
It looks like the Internets won
Thanks to everyone who did lobby their MPs through WriteToThem.com , or by other means .
" The price of freedom is eternal vigilance " .
The holidays have always been a time for reflection .
And so with the sun now chasing New Year ’s parties around the world , here are three of the biggest loads of crap that the mainstream media dished out in 2008 .
3. Russia ’s attack on Georgia was as act of unprovoked aggression
During the August conflict that focused on the Georgian breakaway province of South Ossetia , syndicated columnist Gwynne Dyer did an admirable job outlining a narrative for the war that was seldom found elsewhere .
While CNN consistently echoed the Bush administration ’s condemnation of Russia for an unprovoked attack and warned that the “ Soviet Union ” would soon be marching on Europe , Dyer pointed out that it was actually Georgia that attacked South Ossetia .
“ Russia did n’t threaten Georgia , ” Dyer wrote as the conflict continued , “ it responded to a surprise Georgian attack on South Ossetia , a territory where there were Russian peace - keeping troops by international agreement . ”
During the conflict , the mainstream media all but erased this fact and opted to stoke the flames of a greater conflict between the U.S. and Russia that simply did not exist .
2. Hamas started the Israel - Gaza conflict in December
I ’ve heard this line repeated on major news networks countless times since Israel ’s most - recent assault on Gaza began on December 28 : “ Hamas started this conflict by firing rockets into Israel and Israel has a right to defend itself . ”
Israel does have a right to defend itself .
But the conflict is so much more complicated than this that repeating such a line is simply ignorant .
When Hamas was democratically elected as Gaza ’s government in January 2006 , Israel instituted a blockade , sealing Gaza ’s borders and sharply restricting what went in and out of the already - oppressed territory .
At the same time , many countries around the world ( including Canada ) cut off badly needed food and medical aid to Gaza .
The result has been a territory under siege , where unemployment hovers around 50 percent , fuel is scarce , hunger is increasingly widespread , and medical supplies have dwindled to dangerously low quantities .
( For a comprehensive overview of the effects of Israel ’s blockade on Gaza , Sara Roy ’s recent piece in the London Review of Books , If Gaza falls ” ¦ , is definitive . )
Hamas ’s practice of targeting civilians with indiscriminate rocket attacks is unacceptable and justifies a measured response from Israel .
But as the government of Gaza , what should Hamas ’s response have been to a siege that is slowly killing its people ?
Furthermore , commentators such as Gwynne Dyer and Tariq Ali have emphasized the political implications of a war so close to an Israeli presidential election and suggested that the whole mess is nothing more than political posturing .
There ’s a lot more going on here than ” ˜who hit who first ’ .
1 . The “ Surge ” brought peace to Iraq
Perhaps no falsehood of 2008 was repeated so often by so many people as three simple words : “ The Surge worked ” .
If George W. Bush is remembered as the man who brought peace to Iraq , the media ’s failure to relate the real story of the 2003 U.S. invasion will be as great as the war itself .
Three things brought about a calm in Iraq ; the least significant of the three was the increase in U.S. troop numbers known as the “ Surge ” .
More important was the so - called “ Sunni awakening ” , which is the media - friendly term for the cessation of sectarian killings by Sunni groups in Iraq .
But as the Straight previously noted , the Sunni awakening was not so much a change of heart as it was a shift in the labour market .
Around the same time that the U.S. sent more troops to Iraq , it also began a strategy of simply buying off its enemies .
As reported in the Washington Post in August 2007 , extremist Sunni groups were given large sums of money to stop killing American soldiers and Shiite civilians .
That article pointed out , “ Shiite leaders fear that the United States is financing highly trained and well - armed militias that could undermine the government after American troops withdraw . ”
And the third and most significant reason that violence in Iraq declined through 2007 and remained calm this year is that by 2008 , the Iraqi civil war was largely over .
As early as December 2006 , the New York Times was reporting that most mixed Sunni - Shiite neighbourhoods in Baghdad had been cleansed of minorities and that American forces were building walls throughout the city to separate feuding communities .
By the end of 2007 , as these maps published in the New York Times show , it was clear that the war was not resolved peacefully ; it had simply been fought to completion .
Bush ’s surge did n’t bring peace to Iraq , it only arrived in time to observe a peace that came as the result of a very bloody civil war .
Honourable mentions
Barack Obama will bring change to America : Flip through bios of his appointments thus far and you realize that America is likely heading into four years of centrist policies that will maintain military operations in the Middle East and South Asia and continue to bailout whatever corporate failure asks for it next .
( John Pilger has more to say on this . )
Offshore drilling will ease oil prices in America : Despite John McCain ’s chants of “ Drill , baby drill , ” a few pennies off a gallon of gasoline 10 years from now is not worth the destruction of America ’s coasts .
And finally , a bailout will save the auto industry : Pouring money into incompetent companies without sufficiently addressing incompetence will only delay the industry ’s demise .
( On this topic , Thomas Friedman might have said it best . )
Here ’s to 2009 and all the stories to come .

Greeetings to listeners of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 .
About 20 minutes ago I was on the show talking about detox nonsense .
Nas Amir Ahmadi of detoxinabox.com denied the rather foolish contents of her own website , and confidently claimed that I must be thinking of the wrong company .
I read a quote .
She laughed and said I was mistaken .
The audio is here :

I promised on air that I would double check and post on badscience .
net .
It will not surprise you to hear that she is completely wrong , and I am completely correct .
EDIT : The Today programme , bless them , share my anality and clarified that I was right and she was wrong .
Audio clip : Adobe Flash Player ( version 9 or above ) is required to play this audio clip .

You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser .
Here is Nas Amir Ahmadi , managing director of Detoxinabox ( which earns her the soubriquet “ MD ” ) :
www.detoxinabox.com/nas.html
And this is her webpage .
I read directly from it on the air :
www.detoxinabox.com/diet-a-detox/detox-benefits.html
One of the most complex detoxification functions is against heavy metals such as lead , mercury , cadminum , nickel , arsenic , and aluminum .
As I said , they ca n’t even manage to spell “ Cadmium ” correctly .
The website goes on to explain that their detox programme will expedite the removal of these nasties from the body , without troubling itself to offer any evidence for these claims .
Nas explained that she did n’t need to because it had nothing to do with her .
It strikes me that to confidently deny the contents of your own website can only denote a rather careless approach to the facts , or at worst , we might tenuously speculate , in our darkest thoughts , a rather clumsy attempt to obfuscate when caught out .
I have emailed Nas Amir Ahmadi to inform her of her error , in the hope that she will be able to clarify on this issue , and look forward to her apology for misleading the 2 million listeners of the Today programme , and for incorrectly claiming that my research into her absurd website was mistaken .
I ’ve also rung the Today programme on the one in 5 million chance that they will clarify this on air , partly because I am the most anal person in Britain , and partly because I think it is important to be clear about these things .
If it had happened on any subject I would want them to clarify .
Seriously .
The barefaced cheek of these characters will never cease to amaze and delight me .
EDIT : And on that comment they have now changed the text of their website .
Heh .
Note to Nas : changing your website does not change the fact that you were wrong and pwned .
If you enjoyed this dogged anality in the cause of scientific clarity you may also enjoy my vaguely bestselling book .

Michael Edwards
zipping down the hill of his private island like something out of a Bond movie .
He floats past his private helicopter .
Past his amphibious landing craft .
His lighthouse rises up behind him .
He 's wearing his uniform , the one he wears whether he 's tinkering with an engine or visiting the White House : work boots , blue jeans , and a short - sleeved work shirt .
He 's fifty - seven but still skinny as a ten - year - old , with a lean face and full head of Superman hair .
He wears a dead - serious expression as he 's perched up there on his electric gizmo , even looks a bit regal , which is sort of appropriate when you consider the rules of his alternate universe -- on his tiny private island off the coast of Connecticut , he's not just the man who invented the Segway and the stair - climbing wheelchair called the iBOT and the first portable dialysis machine and a new water filter called the Slingshot that could literally change the world , if he couldget thetoHe 's also Lord Dumpling , leader of the Empire of North Dumpling .
Dumpie to his friends .
He sort of seems serious about this , in a whimsical way , and now Lord Dumpling sweeps right by on his royal scooter , heading down to the landing to greet his guests from America .
He has seceded from the United States , you see , having notified the president himself , and Kamen 's vision of better living through technology is under assault from the usual gaggle of small minds .
As his guests clamber off the boat and walk down the dock to greet Dumpling , two clean - cut young engineer types rush out of the bushes waving signs that say COALITION AGAINST TECHNOLOGY and GREEN IS FOR WIMPS .
" Protesters , " Kamen says , the same benighted fools who failed to immediately ban cars and change the way cities are designed to welcome the Segway .
As the protesters drop their signs and go back to work , his bemused guests follow him up the hill , past a sign reading DUMP DUMPIE IN '08 , plodding like mere humans as Kamen glides along beside them .
When they reach the house , a flawlessly renovated caretaker 's cottage built around the lighthouse , Kamen urges them to enjoy the catered lunch and slips off to join his eighty - three - year - old mother .
As he will be happy to tell you , he rarely eats lunch and has n't had breakfast in thirty years .
Unless someone reminds him , he can go two or three days without eating anything at all .
He emerges again when the guests , thirty in all , gather in the living room , an elegant little space with views of Long Island Sound from every window .
" My people told me , Dean , keep it simple , " he begins .
" Unfortunately , my greatest asset is ADD . "
The man is small in stature , has a slight Long Island lilt , and tends to speak in italics .
He 's attracted a curious and enthusiastic group of scientists and business leaders to have them participate in transforming North Dumpling into the greenest nation on earth , and create a proof - of - concept center for all of Kamen 's wild ideas .
And off he goes , proving his point with a dizzying mixture of dreams and statistics .
" And remember , you can't leave .
I run the boats .
I run the helicopter .
It 's no coincidence we 're on an island . "
So , item one : Welcome to the first completely green nation in the world .
Welcome to the first carbon - neutral nation in the world .
You 're here because you understand that advanced technology is not only better for the environment but that it 's cool products , not clunky cars and harsh lights but sweet LEDs like the ones flashing overhead right now -- see that rainbow of colors pulsing in sequence ?
Is n't that cool ?
They wo n't be commercially available until 2009 !
You 're the first to see them !
It takes just 90 watts to replace 1,200 watts of regular lights !
The Dumplonian Empire has zero tolerance for filaments !
But wait , let 's introduce everybody .
Here 's a guy from Philips who won the National Inventor of the Year Award .
The LEDs are his babies .
Here 's another guy who 's inventing giant kites that will produce megawatts of power -- really big kites .
Here 's a woman who planned the biggest charity event in history , pulling in $ 71 million in a single night for the Robin Hood Foundation .
And the former chief technology officer at Goldman Sachs .
And a guy from a little company called Coca - Cola .
And a guy from another little company called Wal - Mart .
" We were worried he would n't feel comfortable , so , for the first time , the Dumplonian Empire granted a commercial variance so they could have a store here . "
Of course , one of their superstores is larger than the whole empire , so Kamen gave them a three - inch - by - three - inch plot , appropriately scaled to the tiny island .
But where were we ?
Oh yeah , the green nation .
That business started six weeks ago , when the Coast Guard cut the cable to North Dumpling .
They only maintained the cable to run the lighthouse and now they 're running it on photovoltaics , so Kamen had the option of crying in his beer or making lemons into lemonade , which is when he decided to deploy the Slingshot .
The " sling " is Lord Dumpling 's revolutionary new version of the Stirling engine , a no-emission power source that engineers have been trying to perfect for almost two hundred years .
Instead of the tiny explosions that drive the pistons of a standard internal - combustion engine , the Stirling drives its piston by forcing gas from one chamber to another in a perfectly closed system .
He 's pretty much got it nailed , aside from a few tweaks and a few niggling questions about who will pay for it .
The " shot " is his equally revolutionary vapor - compression water distiller , which can make pure medicinal - grade water out of anything that 's wet , even urine or toxic waste -- water so clean you could inject it into your arm .
Together , the sling and the shot could save millions of lives .
That 's why he spent $ 50 million of his own money developing the prototypes and testing them in Third World villages , and they work , and we have to get the word out because 50 percent of all human illness is caused by waterborne pathogens .
Item number two is a benefit for FIRST , the robotics competition Kamen started in 1992 .
This is even more important because you get what you celebrate in a free market and America builds monuments to the things it values and unfortunately most of those monuments are giant sports arenas , which do n't contribute anything to the future .
Why waste so much time on bounce - bounce - throw when FIRST can turn aimless kids into the engineers of the future ?
So he had to form an organization that would change the culture of the entire country and make all the kids in America understand that science and engineering really are cool and fun and if they do n't study hard , they 're going to end up dumb .
He had to make the whole country see what he saw -- that if some foreign power came into this country to pervert our kids from doing the things that sustain our quality of life the way sports does , we would find them and prove that they were treasonously undermining our way of life and kill them .
In its first year , Kamen started with twenty - eight schools and signed up twenty - eight companies and universities -- giants like General Electric and MIT -- to mentor students .
In January he gave the teams shoe boxes filled with parts .
Six weeks later , they played the first game in a high school gym .
Within a few years , he had sixty teams .
Then a hundred .
Now it 's in thirteen thousand schools and thirty - eight countries .
Last year they gave out $ 10 million in scholarships .
It should be as big as the Olympics !
So here are some visa forms , please fill them out , and if you do n't become a FIRST supporter by the end of the day , your visa will be revoked and this will be the last time you see North Dumpling Island .
Kamen 's last agenda item is a kite - surfing contest , because the event has to be fun or nobody will want to come .
So he has invited famous kite surfers like Larry Page and Sergey Brin from Google and Richard Branson of Virgin to come compete against the Dumplonians .
That 's what he wants , the Slingshot and FIRST and the kite surfing all wrapped into a big media event that will show the world that technology is cool and fun and also -- minor point -- the last best hope of mankind at a time when the lunatics are running the asylum .
" Use your imaginations , " he commands .
" I would like , by the end of the day , to have a sense of what you 're going to do to make these things all come together . "
But right now , you probably all have headaches .
So let 's take a break .
Come out this door and walk past the three - inch Wal - Mart -- that tiny gyroscope provides all its light and power -- and check out this twelve - foot - high version of Stonehenge .
Squeeze in , there 's plenty of room for everyone .
They used to sacrifice virgins here back in the early days , he says .
" But it was politically incorrect and we could n't find any virgins , so we switched to lawyers .
That turned out to be an enormous crowd - pleaser . "
Next stop , the basement .
Now you 're in the heart of the machine .
Here 's the vapor - compression distiller .
The vapor goes through this hose and comes into the turbine heat exchangers here and there 's no noise and no consumables and no activated charcoal and no chemicals and no filter and no membranes .
It makes a million liters of water in a thousand days with no human intervention .
The goal is to get volume up and cost down .
Maybe Wal - Mart can help ?
Coca -Cola ?
And here 's the Stirling , handcrafted by some of the most brilliant engineers in the world .
It 's running on propane now but a piece of burning cow dung will generate enough power to run a small refrigerator and charge a cell phone and run all the house lights -- and remember , more than 20 percent of the people alive today have never used electricity .
They need the tools .
So who 's going to step up ?
Who will spend the millions and millions it will take to put this baby into production ?
But enough fun and games .
Now it 's time to work .
And the guests obey , breaking into groups to tackle the issues separately .
Could they anchor a barge off the island for a technology display area ?
Should they make the visitors buy carbon offsets ?
Should they get some FIRST graduates to come display their robots ?
Every so often , Kamen jumps in to goose them along .
When the guy from Wal - Mart offers a contribution , he whips out an ink stamp that says DUMPLOMATIC STATUS and bangs it down on his passport .
" By the way , " he says , pulling some funny - colored bills out of his pocket , " if that gets you in trouble , sometimes a few Dumplings can help . "
Alas , the day ends in a palace revolt .
" You need a clear story , " says the lady from Coke .
" You need a data point where people can enter . "
" You 've got to have a primary goal , " says the woman who planned the largest charity event in history .
" As Lord Dumpling 's Secretary of Cynicism , " says another guest , " what aspect of this do you want to optimize ?
The green nation ?
FIRST ?
The kite surfing ?
You have too many ideas . "
" The answer is yes , " says Kamen .
At this juncture , the average human might conclude that Dean Kamen is totally out of his mind .
Michael Edwards
As it turns out , the day on North Dumpling was Kamen restrained .
Today he's in his office in Manchester , New Hampshire , wearing his uniform , sitting under a full - length portrait of himself wearing his uniform , talking about FIRST and growing up and the Slingshot and FIRST and FIRST some more .
He goes on for hours .
There 's a whiff of Maximum Leader in the room .
His friends say this is normal for him , that he is in fact thinking as he speaks , but the word perseverating keeps coming to mind .
Straightened out so it makes some kind of sense , this is his story :
When he was a little kid growing up on the south shore of Long Island , still so young he did n't know how to read , someone told him the tale of David and Goliath .
The slingshot is what stuck in his mind .
" Here 's this little guy with a really big problem , a Goliath of a problem , and he realized he could take a stone and a slingshot and solve that problem .
Technology is cool . "
That thought germinated while he soaked up the role models around him .
His father was an artist who made a living drawing comic books like Tales from the Crypt and Weird Science .
He was working when Dean got up in the morning and still working when he went to bed at night , which taught him the importance of doing something you love .
His mother taught accounting in high school and that gave him a taste for the business world .
His older brother was a brilliant student who dissected rats in the basement and went on to get his M.D. and his Ph.D. in the same day .
His younger brother and sister loved to work with tools and do home - construction projects .
But Kamen felt stupid .
He did n't understand why a hot glass of water on the counter gradually got cooler .
Why did n't it get hotter ?
What were the rules ?
He assumed that the grown - ups understood .
Then he realized they did n't .
Then he realized -- he was about thirteen at the time -- that he could figure out the rules by himself , deducing the laws of nature from first principles .
That 's when he stopped caring what anyone else thought .
He became spectacularly stubborn .
His father called him a " human irritant . "
One of his teachers called him " Dino the Relentless . "
As his little brother , Mitch , puts it , " He was always focused on what he wanted to do , and nobody could ever talk him into doing something he did n't want to do . "
Shortly after that , he discovered Sir Isaac Newton .
A kindred spirit !
He was n't alone !
His excitement is still vivid almost fifty years later .
" F = ma , that 's a pretty simple linear equation .
Force equals mass times acceleration .
You can't come up with a more simple statement that 's not trivial .
Yet it describes the motion of billiard balls and of galaxies .
On a galactic scale , you can predict where the next eclipse will be because of F = ma .
You can predict where atomic collisions happen because of F = ma .
That 's astounding . "
The rest of Kamen 's story is scientific legend , and he does n't mind telling it : how he started tinkering with transistors and built a light box that pulsed along with the family stereo ; how he snuck into the Hayden Planetarium in New York to install a new light show and launch an electronics career that was earning him $ 60,000 a year when he was just out of high school ; how his brother came home from medical school and suggested he invent an automated way to deliver drugs , and so he set up a machine shop in his parents ' basement , developed a working prototype , wrangled a rave review from The New England Journal of Medicine , put his younger brother to work on assembly and his mother on product testing ; how he hired an architect to jack up the house and expand the basement into a small factory ; how he refused to go to college classes and focused his relentless will on bending the Worcester Polytechnic Institute to his purposes .
" I said , ' I 'm paying my tuition to have the entire faculty as business consultants .
I recognize that is not consistent with your model , which is ,
You know better than I and I have to take this much math and these electives , and all that stuff is valuable , but right now I 'm focused , I 'm allowed to make a rational decision , I can pay you this tuition and avail myself of this extraordinary faculty , but I 'm not going to waste my time in class because the opportunity costs would be too high . ' "
Eleven years after he started , he sold AutoSyringe to Baxter International for $ 30 million .
Pondering his next move , he realized he had put more than a decade into developing one idea .
" I said , Wow , you do n't have a lot of cycles left .
I do n't want to spend my whole life building a company around this product or that product .
I want to focus on lots of things . "
The answer was Deka Research & Development , one of the most unusual companies in the country -- a state - of - the - art engineering lab tucked away in a series of old brick industrial buildings in Manchester , with few rules and little paperwork , built on his royalties and staffed with three hundred brilliant and quirky engineers dedicated to a single purpose :
Helping Dean Kamen change the world .
Now he 's go to move .
This is what he does .
He roams the halls of Deka like a starving animal rooting for food .
Here 's a young engineer working on a tiny round circuit board for a new invention that could revolutionize the way heart surgeons do cut - and - stitch .
" How much of this have we run so far ? " he asks .
" Most all of it .
This is probably pretty darn close to what would be on a final version . "
" Jesus Christ .
How many pins did you just pop ? "
" I think it 's a ten pin , something like that .
It 's teeny .
I think it 's the smallest connector made , just about . "
They go on like that for a while , their voices quiet .
This is when all the spinning gears and gyroscopes in Kamen 's head line up .
As long as he 's staring at the circuit board , he has the quiet focus of a doctor studying a patient , the devotional calm of a priest taking confession .
It helps explain why his engineers are willing to start well below market rates , fired up by the chance to work with someone who can push them beyond their limits .
It also helps explain why a man with such humane ambitions never had children and scorns marriage .
( The Dumplonian visa application asks if you have ever been married " or otherwise institutionalized . " )
He says it 's because kids would be " too much risk , " that he could n't live with himself if he did n't like them and became a rotten parent , oblivious to how Vulcan that reasoning might sound to a normal person .
Finally the engineer shows him how it all fits together .
" You drop this guy in and that guy should just fit on top and click into place , " the engineer says .
" God , that 's nice . "
" And that 's it for assembly . "
" That 's so nice . "
He moves on .
Down the stairs , up the stairs , into a big loft where a group of engineers puzzle over a titanium robotic arm commissioned by the Department of Defense .
Kamen calls it " Luke " after Luke Skywalker , the Star Wars hero who lost a hand to Darth Vader 's lightsaber .
Saying a quick hello to Matt DeWitt , an Iraq veteran who lost both his arms in the battle of Fallujah and now serves as one of Luke 's test pilots , he approaches another young engineer .
This one is hunched over a thin piece of plastic shaped like a foot .
Veined like a leaf with wires and sensors , it serves as a remote controller for the arm .
" We 're modifying it to get it to work better for Matt , " he says .
" We 're not getting a really good response . "
" How long will it take ? "
" Half an hour or so . "
When he comes back , DeWitt stands at a table .
He 's got the titanium arm strapped on and he 's stacking plastic cups .
The arm whirs and spins and the metal fingers close on a plastic cup .
It 's soft and dents a little bit .
To give DeWitt a sense of how hard his fingers are pushing , there 's a pressure sensor just above his shoulder blade that vibrates soft or strong .
He whirs a cup across the table and drops it into place .
" Nice job , " Kamen says .
" Give him some Skittles , " one engineer suggests .
A minute later , the arm whirs and spins and the metal fingers close on a tiny candy .
DeWitt concentrates and brings it to his mouth .
" Look at that , " Kamen says .
" It 's more impressive when it 's something small like that , " whispers another engineer .
" We do it with grapes too . "
DeWitt says the arm is pretty easy to use and not as heavy as it looks .
" It only bothers me kinda because I 've lost so much of my arm here .
But it 's manageable .
I could wear it all day . "
He picks up an electric screwdriver to demonstrate the chuck grip .
The mechanical finger moves over the drill 's trigger .
It has a black metal fingernail , which looks oddly beautiful .
DeWitt concentrates and the drill whines .
" That 's awesome , " Kamen says .
" Compared to the other stuff that 's out there , it 's just light - years ahead . "
Now they have to work it till it breaks .
Then DeWitt can take it home and break it again , steps on the long journey from prototype to product .
Michael Edwards
These projects are all part of Kamen 's day job , as he likes to call it .
This means they 're relatively practical and funded by outside sources .
The tricky part is getting the funding in the first place , a process that usually begins with Kamen fixating on a pressing human need and following his nose with little regard for precedent or practicality .
One day , for example , he saw a man in a wheelchair struggling to get over a sidewalk curb .
Instead of trying to build a better wheelchair , he asked himself what that man really needed .
To be able to go up stairs , to cross rough terrain , to rise up and look normal people in the eye .
It hit him in the place where Lord Dumpling was born , where the highest good is independence .
So he was pondering all that and he got out of the shower and slipped on the wet floor , windmilling his legs to regain his balance .
That was the solution !
Wheels that could spin back and forth so precisely and so fast , you could balance on just two of them .
People said it was impossible , but Kamen hates that word .
Do n't tell me it 's impossible , he says , tell me you can't do it .
Tell me it 's never been done .
Because the only real laws in this world -- the only things we really know -- are the two postulates of relativity , the three laws of Newton , the four laws of thermodynamics , and Maxwell 's equation -- no , scratch that , the only things we really know are Maxwell 's equation , the three laws of Newton , the two postulates of relativity , and the periodic table .
That 's all we know that 's true .
All the rest are man 's laws .
Thinking this way , he made the iBOT come true .
It 's an amazing accomplishment , but the practical issues still dog him -- at $ 26,100 , it costs way too much for most wheelchair users .
Same with the Segway , which he put $ 50 million of his own money into before giving any serious thought to the problem of selling it .
Which brings us to the alcove where a pair of engineers are working on the Slingshot , another supposedly impossible dream .
He needed a way to power the iBOT , so why not reinvent the engine ?
And he needed a cheap way to provide sterilized water to his home dialysis machines , so why not reinvent the water distiller ?
Then he realized that fresh water and electric power were a Goliath of a problem for little guys all over the Third World and the dream got even bigger .
Was it practical ?
Would it be cost - effective ?
Would anyone be willing to finance it ?
Who cares ?
The little guy needed a slingshot !
Dean Kamen could give it to him !
He could combine two big ideas into one really big idea !
More than fifteen years and another $ 50 million later , he 's still trying .
Back in his office , Kamen fires out explanations for why the Slingshot has n't taken off yet .
It starts with the day Deka finished the first prototype and realized -- shades of the Segway -- there was no real market for it .
The poor people who needed it could n't even begin to afford it , so no big corporation wanted to invest $ 50 million or $ 100 million or more to tool up a factory and take it to market .
" So now you 've got these things , and you go , ' Wow , the kinds of companies that we do business with have to make their return .
They 're not going to do this . '
A few of them said , ' Dean you 're --' "
He stops himself before he says the word .
But he knows these big corporate guys , and they 're good guys , this is just an example where the great power of capitalism fails .
So where do you take an idea that 's not right for big companies ?
How about the United Nations ?
The World Bank ?
This was something he had never thought about before .
What does the World Bank do ?
Does the World Bank loan money to poor people ?
Does the World Health Organization flood the Third World with doctors ?
Does the United Nations unite nations ?
" I absolutely thought you could go to the United Nations or the World Bank or the World Health Organization or USAID or any of these organizations that have moral imperative and even a legal obligation to find the best solution to a given problem .
You 'd think they would be obligated to look at this .
But they 'd say , ' Great , Dean , as soon as you have these in production , call me , I 'm here to buy them . ' "
Okay , so what about the big foundations ?
What about Bill Gates ?
" I 've come to learn , a foundation makes big government look like a bunch of entrepreneurs .
They make Fortune 500 companies to be these agile little groups . "
So he talked to people like Mohammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank , who won the Nobel prize for giving microfinance loans to poor villagers so they could start small businesses .
That 's the model for the twenty - first century , rock - skipping over the traditional infrastructure of telephone poles and IBM to the cell phone and the personal computer -- perfect for the Slingshot !
But they all said the same thing : Great , give me a hundred or a thousand machines .
So he did some field trials , putting the distiller in a village in Honduras and the Stirling in a village in Bangladesh .
And they worked .
Marvelously .
Magically .
He proved that .
And still nobody would finance them .
It makes his brain hurt .
To think that 20 percent of the people alive today are perfect -- more than perfect , desperate -- customers for this beautiful technology and organizations like the UN and WHO are so rigidly organized and their thinking is so monolithic and their model of risk and reward is so narrow that they can't conceive of taking a prototype to production even if it will save millions of lives ....
That 's when he decided he was approaching the problem from the wrong angle .
The cell phone became successful because the developed world wanted it , so corporations spent the billions of dollars it took to develop the technology and put transmission towers everywhere .
That 's what he needed .
He had to find a " killer app , " a way to sell the Stirling and the distiller to the developed world .
So he went searching .

" Let 's take a walk , " Kamen says , leading the way through the halls .
His first stop at the bottom of a flight of stairs is something that looks like an ordinary vending machine , but is , in fact , Kamen 's magical water distiller .
He opens it up and points out different parts .
" This is the vapor - compression distiller , this is the evaporator condenser , these are the chemical heat exchangers , and this half is the refrigeration unit . "
He puts a plastic water jug under a spout .
" This you can fill in under half a minute , one gallon in fifteen seconds .
Or a glass of water , all from the same machine .
Is n't that neat ? "
To get the Slingshot to the 20 percent of the world that does n't have electricity , Kamen came up with the idea of splitting it in half .
Leaving the Stirling aside , he would try to develop a market for his distiller in parts of the developing world that have electricity but not reliable clean water .
" There are five hundred thousand little stores in Mexico , " he says .
" If we can put one of these in 10 percent of them , that 's enough to put it in production . "
That may be the killer app for the distiller .
The next stop is just outside the back door , a parking space occupied by a little Scandinavian electric car called the Think .
Kamen opens the hatch and lifts up the floor panel .
Instead of a spare wheel , there 's a little Stirling engine no bigger than a football .
" It has a long life , low maintenance , it does n't have an exhaust system , mufflers , you do n't have to worry about the points and the plugs .
To make an electric car but have that as an insurance policy may be a very attractive feature .
" Without the Stirling , the Think has a battery range of sixty or seventy miles .
With the Stirling , its range could be unlimited .
This could be the killer app for Kamen 's engine .
But alas , the Think corporation is too small to finance it .
And the big car companies are too traumatized by the plunge in their markets .
So now Kamen 's in the process of hiring a guy to pitch it around .
Maybe auto - component companies will go for it .
Another possibility is backup power for homes .
Or a cheap way to heat swimming pools .
He has more ideas , lots of ideas .
Moving down the halls , Kamen asks another engineer if he 's working on the water distiller .
" I 'm not working on it , " the engineer answers , looking dazed and just a little bit testy .
" I 'm working on a paying customer 's job . "
Kamen moves on .
A couple of weeks later , Kamen 's in a cheerful mood .
Nokia kicked in $ 150,000 for FIRST .
He has an upcoming meeting with Ratan Tata , head of India 's biggest company , to talk about putting the Stirlings into Tata 's little $ 2,500 cars .
And the guy from Wal - Mart called to say that he almost missed a plane because of that Dumplonian stamp .
" Why do you have diplomatic status ? " the airport security guys asked .
" It 's Dumplomatic status , " the man from Wal - Mart explained .
Kamen thinks this is hilarious .
" An international incident ! " he laughs .
He climbs the stairs to the roof and gets into his helicopter .
He used to dream of this when he was a kid , the idea of rising up out of the backyard and just hovering .
When the first big check arrived , the first toy he bought was an Enstrom helicopter .
Then he bought a piece of the company and redesigned the helicopter to his own specs .
As he rises above the town , and all the little houses turn into toys below him , the setting sun casts a golden light on the green hills of New Hampshire .
" Is n't it beautiful ? " he says .
" It 's like a magic carpet .
" But wait , we need the right music .
He cranks up the theme from Star Wars -- dum , dum , da da !
Up here , the music seems freshly rich with glory and wonder , restored to its boyish exuberance .
" There 's something exhilarating about cheating gravity , " he says .
Ten minutes later , he soars over his mansion .
It 's on top of a hill he built with truck after truck of dirt and rock , cooled and heated by water piped from a 3.8 - million - gallon pond he created .
He lands the helicopter on a motorized pad and steers it into a hangar built right into the house .
" Is n't that neat ?
Nobody in the world has anything like this , not even Bill Gates .
" He designed the house , too , shaping it around a three - story steamboat engine once owned by Henry Ford .
He spent fifteen years rebuilding the engine himself , cutting every nut and bolt in the vast machine shop just below his living room .
" Eighty - seven thousand pounds of love , " he calls it .
Because there 's nothing so soothing as cutting a piece of steel when it 's late and you can't sleep because you 're trying to work out some problem in your head .
Because machines are more than machines , they 're a road map to the people who built them .
They tell you what kind of problems they had and what they wanted .
Just as Kamen 's inventions are his own autobiography in steel -- every one designed to cheat gravity , to declare independence , to make every man the king of his own empire .
He leads the way to the cupola at the top and watches the sunset , chattering happily .
This is why he never got married or had children .
He loves being away from everywhere , completely alone .
He can watch planes land at the airport .
He can watch the weather change .
And it does n't bother him that he usually comes home at nine or ten and drops into bed exhausted .
It 's like the private island he rarely visits , the girlfriend he rarely sees , the vacations he never takes .
It 's the idea that counts .
Just knowing he has it is enough .
Anyway , what should he stop doing ?
FIRST ?
Water ?
Power ?
Medical equipment ?
" I ca n't stop , " he says .
" As a practical matter , I can't put the world on hold . "
He really can't .
There 's just too much he wants to do .
When he proved that FIRST worked , he was sure it would be in every school in the country the next year .
Same with the Segway .
It 's 100 percent more efficient than cars , those metal boxes designed for the open road when 50 percent of the people alive live in cities .
It 's just stupid .
It 's lunacy .
And someday , the Slingshot will go into production , too .
And one of the kids from FIRST will win the Nobel prize or cure cancer .
But it takes time for an innovation to become a commodity .
Because the Wright brothers flew a plane and it was a long time before frequent - flier miles .
You have to be patient , give the world time to catch up .
For fun , he 's starting to dream about something that flies .
A new form of personal transportation .
It will be , he says , Dumplonian .
It will empower the individual .
Some kind of helicopter ?
" Not a helicopter , " he says , staring intently at the helicopter .
" I 've got a couple of ideas . "
He smiles , turning inward for a moment , lost in the vision of a new machine .

Thanks to Andrew Glass at Politico.com for penning the This Day In Politics column reflecting the legislative origins of America ’s off - and - on temptation with prohibitions , notably today ’s 171st anniversary of America ’s first prohibitionist laws in Tennessee .
Of course , the parallels to today ’s 71 - year old marijuana prohibition are unavoidable .
Tennessee bans sale of alcohol , Jan. 26 , 1838
By : Andrew Glass , Politico.com
January 26 , 2009
On this day in 1838 , the Tennessee Legislature passed the nation ’s first Prohibition law .
The statute made it a misdemeanor for residents to sell alcoholic beverages in taverns and stores .
Tennessee had been admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state .
Under the new law , any person convicted of selling “ spirituous liquors ” could be fined at the “ discretion of the court . ”
Such fines would help fund public education .
The roots of Prohibition in North America reach back to 1657 , when the General Court of Massachusetts outlawed the sale of liquor “ whether known by the name of rum , strong water , wine , brandy , etc. , etc . ”
In the early years of the republic , some Americans formed religiously oriented temperance societies to combat what they believed were the adverse effects of strong drink .
A consensus emerged in those circles that while alcohol was a gift from God , its abuse through excessive consumption remained the work of the devil .
Benjamin Rush , a prominent physician and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , called for moderation , arguing that excessive use of alcohol damaged both physical and psychological health .
Influenced by Rush ’s writings , some 200 Connecticut farmers founded a temperance association in 1789 .
Similar associations were formed in Virginia in 1800 and New York in 1808 .
By the late 19th century , “ dry ” groups had emerged as a powerful political force , calling for nationwide abstinence .
In 1917 , Congress passed the 18th Amendment , barring the manufacture and sale of alcohol .
During the 1920s , the federal government nevertheless failed to curb the widespread distribution of alcoholic beverages by crime syndicates .
In 1933 , the nation repealed Prohibition with the 21st Amendment , although some states and localities continued to enforce a ban for many years to come .

A US sex offender who posed as a 12 - year - old boy to enrol in schools has pleaded guilty to seven criminal charges , two stemming from the charade he pulled for two years .
- Sex offender posed as boy
- Enrolled in schools
- Pleads guilty to seven charges
Authorities did n't find any victims of sexual abuse at the schools 30 - year - old Neil Havens Rodreick attended in Arizona .
But when his ruse was discovered in January 2007 , they found an extensive collection of child pornography at his home .
Rodreick had originally faced 28 counts , but pleaded guilty to only a quarter of them Friday in Yavapai County Superior Court in northern Arizona , according to a plea agreement document obtained today .
Rodreick pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual exploitation of a minor stemming from the pornography , as well as one count each of failure to register as a sex offender , fraud and simple assault .

Oh this is SO overdue .
Kudos to Congressman Conyers for staying on top of this .
It 's time to bring all the crooks , liars and cheaters down and put them where the belong - behind bars .
Only after a " fair and balanced " trial , of course !

" I predict ... "
Anybody here remember The Great Kweskin rising from his coffin and making predictions ; his first line being " I predict ... " ( the reference is appropriate I think because of the last 78 years of the mind numbing effects of the Neo-con zenith .
After all this time the soul - killing and mind - numbing effects of the PTSD beginning to fall away ... )
I predict that when / if Conyers starts to cave he will be visited by Vice President Biden .
That 's Joe 's job .
That also assumes that Senator Conver 's is n't acting in response to a visit or call from the VP .
Rove could well be the first opportunity for the new President Obama 's use of force majeure .
Rove could very well end up sitting in a cell for presumptive contempt if he blows this subpoena off .
I may be too optimistic but President Obama is playing chess while most everybody else is still playing checkers .
He needs to break a couple of bones early so he wo n't need to slow down to do it later .
Rove is the perfect target .

Ooooooh , another strongly worded letter from Mr. Conyers .
If the last time Rove ignored his subpoena did n't have legal standing , why not go straight for contempt and put porky behind bars ?
Is there a statute of limitations on Contempt of Congress , because KKKarl has been in Contempt since he blew off the last subpoena ?

Seeing the enforcement of this subpoena is believing .
I have n't yet seen it .
I will not believe it until I see it .
And , by the way , I am not holding my breath either .
So , Mr.Conyers , if you really believe in the rule of law , PROVE IT !!
COMMENT #9 [ Permalink ]
... Lottakatz said on 1/26/2009 @ 8:20 pm PT ...
I respectfully disagree with the nay - sayers for a couple of basic reasons :
The Democrats have been under the heel of Neocons for so long they forgot how to close the deal , they do n't know how to play an end game and they had no support for an end game .
They do now and it's to their and the Administrations benefit that they play to a successful end .
The people are screaming for blood ( myself included ) and that is a distraction .
No matter how morally correct it may be in the long run it is a distraction to have it occupy a lot of time and attention up front .
The criminal fallout for Bush and his folks needs to go on in the background because it 's going to take a long time and be distracting .
Rove is the first target for Conyers because he stands a good chance of being the arrogant asshole that he is and will give Conyers a good reason to put his head on a pike .
This literally tosses red meat to those of us that need it ( and our name is ' Legion ' ) and scares the hell out of other folks that will be called to inquiry .
It will assuage the desperate need for obvious justice and allow us to put that pot on the back burner where it belongs .
We need some obvious process ( for us process wonks ) but the process is going to take so long all we really need is a highlight every now and then to make sure the process is working .
This will solidify Conyers usefulness to Obama .
The House to some good extent , and the Senate Specifically , is also a club , a fraternal organization , a medieval body that draws strength and derives authority from it 's leader .
Their leader ( and their leader is President Obama because Reid and Pelosi , not global thinkers or good chess players , have failed them .
Obama has the voters , Obama has the political capital and he has made it clear that they must prove themselves if they want a seat at his ( the grownup 's ) table .
Obama assembled the Republican leaders to his table along with the two biggest impediments to his agenda : Democratic leaders Reid and Pelosi , and owned them with three words , " Because I Won " .
That was a remarkable thing and no one in the media on the left seemed to truly value the significance .
If Obama had said " We " it would have been ambiguous .
President Obama is not an ambiguous guy .
" We " would have included Reid and Pelosi as well as the voters as his team mates .
By using " I " he refused Reid and Pelosi spots on his team .
It was an astounding rebuke .
They have to earn a place on his team .
( Did you see the faces at that table ?
EVERYONE was obviously in shock and confused at what had gone on . )
With three words he unilaterally dismissed the authority of the most powerful members of the Republican party in the House and Senate .
Obama did exactly the same to Democratic leaders Reid and Pelosi and anyone not a natural ally or that was not immediately and effectively useful .
And he made it personal .
" I " . ( ( Aside : he made it look like ' mentoring ' and ' shadowing ' for Reid and Pelosi which it was and this is how it played in the media .
The media is n't on to him yet . ) )
Real politics is going on here and a lot of it is subtle and it's got deep patterns and small things easily dismissed as ' lighthearted moments ' have deep and significant meaning .
Conyers IMHO is one of the few people who gets it .
Obama 's playing chess on a masters level and we just have n't seen anything but the brutish checker playing of the right for so long we are n't used to seeing real politics anymore .
We need to get up to speed .
The smart guy won and I think the change is gonna ' astound us all .
Maybe I 'm just over - thinking it and wrong as hell .

The title of the post makes me slobber , but I understand the skepticism .
At least we can hope Karl Rove does n't have assurances he 'll come out of this smelling like a blossom .
If we want to proceed with cleaning up the turds , we have to get rid of the asshole .
I 'm optimistic .

At the split second that the Rethuglicans believe that Rove is vulnerable , they will cut him loose and let him twist in the wind .
Nobody really ever liked him , but they were scared to death of him .
I await the moment with glee .

I tend to agree with NCC ( comment # 3 ) .
The House Judiciary Committee just does n't have any teeth left , anymore .
Rove is Rubber , they 're glue .
I doubt they can , even with all their new - found super - majority - subpoena - power , barely chaffe Rove 's impenetrable exoskeleton of hardened turd .
But I am very taken with LottaKatz 's comments ( especially # 9 ) and I 'm glad to entertain the notion that Obama is indeed that gifted .
Forgive me for not remembering , but someone posted an astute comment here recently re : an independent prosecution of the Bush administration by the war crime investigative branch of the U.N .
That thought has been shadowing me all week .
How delightfully appropriate .
How deliciously vindicating .
How distinctively ... inevitable ?
I 've been amazed this week that the drum beat for investigations and prosecution of these shit - bags has become deafening !
It 's coming from the Blue Dogs , the Progressives , the MSM , and the rest of the whole world .
This , for me , causes my sneaking , creeping optimism to come out of the closet for a spell and have a nice , uninterrupted , unpolluted cup of coffee .
Perhaps , says my " abused optimist " , I 'll live to see the Return of Justice .
Maybe as LottaKatz supposes , just maybe if Joe Biden pays Conyers that visit to tell him to cool his heels -- maybe it could be an indication of a back - room deal between Obama 's people and the international community ?
Now THAT 'd be ' check mate ' for the books .

Well , how in the hell would we get any of them nabbed and put in jail ?
Would the deal have been you - prosecute - and - we'll - extradite ... really ?
Can he do that ?
Would he do that ?
I do n't think so .
That 's a dream , and Obama is not a dream .
Believe me , I hate to sound like Hillary Clinton , but Obama is charming and going way too far into his unification of the warring factions thing for me to believe that .
We just want heroes .
We just want saviors .
We are n't getting them because we do n't deserve them ... we wo n't back them with our bodies , our deeds , our lives .
We will adore them in words and on the internet , but that 's as far as it goes .
It will be a miracle if any of these criminals pays with more than just his or her [ putative ] conscience .

They do that over and over and over because most of the people see the tough rhetoric and think it 's all being handled ... never think further about it ... and then they vote for them next time they come up for election .
That 's the whole gig with sheeple .
They 've got our number , and Obama really has it .
He 's making some scary appointments , and showing every sign of continuing as though he were a darker shade of * in the Middle East .

I hate to be a hope - monger .
I 'm not a hopeful person and would steal Skeptical Cynic 's ' handle ' if I could .
If it being comprised of a double negative means the opposite of absolute cynicism then it does n't suit me , but the word - play is choice President Obama is actually using standard negotiating tactics in a very well thought out and skillful way .
I have been going over his moves routinely and even made lists and notes because he seemed to be pissing me off at every opportunity but making me feel he did the right thing .
A few days later I would see the benefit of his actions in the context of an overall strategy .
The only way it made sense to me is if he considered his campaign promises a contract with the voters and now had to be a negotiator skilled enough to get a good contract .
I 'm reverse engineering the argument of course .
I got to that conclusion in a forward manner but once I got to that point everything fell neatly into place .
Nothing to support my conclusion has to be forced .
It feels and thinks right .
To me anyway .
Again , maybe I am just totally wrong .
But I never left Missouri , I still live here ( literally and figuratively ) Jacki and I 'm kind of wondering just what I 'll see .
I 'm not going to automatically assume anything though , I stopped doing that about 3 days ago .
Even if he does n't deliver a damned thing beyond what he has already it 's way better than McCain and Palin would have done .
Our new Attorney General just said water - boarding IS torture .
I feel like someone just turned off the shit shower .
I do want to debate ( in the most convivial and classic meaning of the term ) some comments made though because they 're good comments and are central to exactly why I was so angered by what Obama was doing and continues to do .
Agent 99 made most of them and Jim made another and I 'm in no way on your case 's or ass 's ' 99 and Jim .
You just made the points that I 've been obsessing over and I 'm sleep disrupted ; I wo n't go to sleep for the night for a couple of hours yet and I may as well write as watch another DVD
Also your comments are an opportunity to clarify these points I 've been mentally developing into actual positions and arguments to see if they hold up coherently .
It 's a form of self - checking .
--------
" This will prove to be a dog and pony show .
Quite possibly Karl will be thrown under the bus only to appease those that want their heads .
To indict one means to indict them all ( both parties ) . "
Once you get past the Executive office and senior appointees everyone else has good political cover .
Congress was voting on horrific programs and policies based on what they were told by the White house and hand full of Congressional Committee chairs assure them .
The Committee chairs gave assurances based on what they were told and were sworn to legally binding secrecy .
The Justice Department positions had not been overturned by any courts when the early votes were taken .
No liability .
This does not relieve them of culpability on later votes specifically the one protecting the tel - com companies .
Congress will not be indited except at the ballot box IMO .
Low level appointees that were not privy to strategy sessions and documents and other incriminating communications wo n't face indictment either .
Who planned and knew what , and when , is why the e-mails went missing and private accounts were used and the shredders in the Vice President 's office overheated and started that fire .
The shredder / fire connection is only a suspicion but I think a good one .
--------
" The drill is come - out - with - tough - rhetoric - on - TV - and - then - completely - cave .
They do that over and over and over because most of the people see the tough rhetoric and think it 's all being handled ... never think further about it ... and then they vote for them next time they come up for election . "
Absolutely correct .
It 's good politics .
Anything that gets a politician elected is good politics to a politician .
' At least he 's trying to do something ' is good enough to get one re-elected if the standards are set low enough .
The last two elections indicate that the bar is being incrementally raised for the House and Senate .
Just ' trying ' is n't going to be good enough because the longer the pain goes on the more demanding the electorate will become .
People are sick of the shit and I have thought for quite some time now that cities could start burning .
Last weeks riot in Oakland did n't surprise me .
The country is threatened in every major aspect of it's function and this should enhance Obama 's chance to succeed in delivering on his electorate - endorsed agenda as long as progress is seen by the electorate .
If his opposer 's are seen to be prolonging the pain of a dysfunctional government they will be punished in two years .
A smart politician does whatever he has to do to get re-elected .
-------
" Obama is charming and going way too far into his unification of the warring factions thing for me to believe that "
The Neocon strategy and toolkit are well known after 20 + years of their ascendancy to power in various branches of government .
Their moves are well known to Democrat 's and likewise the Democrat 's moves in opposition are well known to Neocons - con's .
So far President Obama has confounded both traditional sets of moves by developing a third set of moves unknown to both parties .
He has removed the comfort of ritualized , well known game - play .
Obama 's latest deal making regarding the budget is being decried as ' caving ' on the tax cuts .
An op - ed on another blog or TV pundit said that this was a serious mistake because it played into the tactics that the Neocons have been using for years .
That an early concession was always met with resistance and the initial concession then became the threshold for even further demands .
This is accurate as long as the method of tactical moves remains ' conventional ' .
It no longer is IMO .
Obama is a counter - puncher .
He sets up a situation by playing to a conventional scenario and then uses it to his advantage to deliver a stronger punch ; his opposer 's strength can become their weakness .
Instead of starting low and negotiating upwards Obama started high and did so quickly .
His op poser 's see it as weakness or inexperience but it 's not .
By responding typically , they have have cast themselves as obstructionists and full responsibility for any delay is theirs .
Obama spoke today and was not conciliatory , he was serious in tone and speech affect and said this was not a time for delay .
He did not respond to McCain and Boehner is a conventional way .
All he or his surrogates need to start doing now is to make it clear that further delay of the American Economic Recovery
Act for the purpose of continuing and expanding Bush 's tax policies is insulting after those policies were repudiated by voters less than 90 days ago .
---------
" He 's making some scary appointments "
He 's consolidating his revolution as early as possible .
He is reorganizing the nature of the power structure without regard to Party loyalty or personal loyalty .
It will be comprised of those people that can be most effectively used .
Obama has appointed natural allies to trusted positions because they love the work , are moving in the same direction he is anyway and are going to be easy to deal with .
Obama has appointed holdovers that were neutrals or dissidents because they fall easily into the natural ally column and already had a network of other neutrals / dissidents built up in order to do their job .
One knows and cares for ones own as a matter of survival .
Their network will be useful to circumvent the Bush bureaucracy that is left at the lower levels .
These are people hired for career positions of high authority ( Senior Executive Service positions ) by Bush appointees .
Obama is appointing ' enemy ' holdovers to high positions because he knows that they sold their soul and knowingly broke the law for a couple of dicks like Bush and Cheney .
These appointee 's need the President 's cover .
They are not motivated by morality .
They will do anything the President asks to get what they need .
He knows , they know , everybody knows .
We want them in jail but they can actually be more useful in the Administration if they 're used right .
----------
" I want him to do well .
I 'm on his ass because I want it so much " Exactly .
I 've got a shortcut to the new White House site and written a couple of ' questions ' already but prior to him actually taking office .
I still e-mail the Senate and House , my representatives and Committee heads and members .
Obama 's minions are looking for ways to keep us engaged because we are the key to his / our power ; power is success .
If we drift away the momentum stops .
The Administration wants us to call the recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans and raise hell just like we did with the stimulus package and Telecom immunity .
And we need to follow up those calls with calls to , now , the White House whenever that 's appropriate .
I 'm holding off on the White House because I do n't know if the President is doing right by me or not and he 's surprised and confounded me routinely so I 'm giving him breathing room .
Clever bastard probably planned it that way

Chairman John Conyers needs to talk to the Justice Department about offering a plea bargain to Jack Abramoff , R.R. , G.N. , M.S. , and T.R. who used Indian casinos money to fuel Bush 's Lieutenant Karl Rove political Hit Program .
The scheme involved Bush appointing willing candidates , a major publishing company , money launderings , and tens of millions of Dollars .
Some victims still do n't have the slightest idea .
Siegelman has been in Rove ’s sights for over two decades , because he has not been easy to squash .
He is very much like Joseph ; God is with him .
Watch what I say , Siegelman will be restored to a position greater than he ever had .
I 'm not going to speculate what God has in mind for those who conspired against him .

Does anyone else ever get struck by the physical resemblence of Karl Rove and Rush L.?
Anyway I do n't really care so much if bush and cheney are strung up or executed for warcrimes or face life imprisonment , etc .
However , I DO feel strongly that Rove is the single most damaging influence for the good of the United States to have hit this country in a generation .
Rove needs to go to prison at the minimum , and if his actions can be construed as treasonous ( because effectively he was trying to overthrow the US government by illegal means ) , he should be one of the few ( the first ? ) person to be put to death under the treason clause .
I 'm highly skeptical Conyers has the backbone to follow through with the arrest after Rove ignores his subpoena .

Lotta
He 's consolidating his revolution as early as possible .
He is reorganizing the nature of the power structure without regard to Party loyalty or personal loyalty .
It will be comprised of those people that can be most effectively used .
This assumes he can control these people effectively and he 's chosen some of the least controllable people there are .
Rahm Emanuel will have absolutely NO compunction about eating him for breakfast if he does n't toe the line on a bunch of issues , foremost among them the further enrichment and empowerment of Israel , and Rahmbo does n't have a thing to lose by torpedoing Obama .
Hillary will give him the Medal of Freedom in 2013 if he does .
The old " friends close and enemies closer " chestnut is good counsel for gladiators .
Obama is a one - man charm offensive and you can't charm people like Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton .
They are political Caligulas .
Obama fucked up badly by alienating Howard Dean , and he better be going to the gym every day because he 's going to get beaten to a bloody pulp if he can't turn into Mohammad Ali really fast .
I really want to think he's got the balls , heart , and brains to deal with this stuff , but that 's just it !
I want to think that .
Objective assessments do n't bear out what I want to think .
There really is some truth to the campaign tactics used against him .
He is extremely short on substance , and very long on charisma .
Is his brain only going to out - charismaticking everyone involved in the issues he has to face ?
That is so not going to cut it !
Here , watch him doing his campaign bit to al - Arabiya via CNN .
That 's a damn modified for Muslims campaign speech .
It 's taking the myth of al - Qa'eda , " The Toilet " , and that OBL is still alive , and turning it into a basis for sounding smart and tough .
It 's promising to go to them and charm their pants off to get back their good will .
He fucking made his first call as POTUS to Abu Mazen , the NOT president of Palestine who is very clearly selling his own people down the river , and has made it clear that he's not going to deal with the elected body of the Palestinian government ; to wit : Hamas .
He 's virtually indistinguishable from * on the Israel / Palestine question , even as you know Jimmy Carter has to have impressed upon him that Hamas is the genuinely elected government of Palestine .
So , anyway , as I say , he 's made some terrifying choices and is not doing such a great job in his first week .
Every time I hear him , he still seems more to be on the campaign trail than anything else .
He 's made for soaring oration , but he 's not showing me any statesmanship .
He did n't in the Senate and I am scared to death he wo n't in the White House either .

Assuming Rove even shows up which is doubtful all it will be is a dog & pony show .
One or 2 people ( probably only Kucinich ) may ask a decent question , Rove will LIE there will be no follow up questions and rove will stand up flip them the bird and stroll out .
Hell even if Rove admitted to everything the seriously inept Democratic congress will do absolutely nothing anyway so why bother ?
If anything this will only close the book on the crimes committed by these fascist .
Better to keep this pathetic congress out of it completely and let the private sector handle this .

Yeah , a bounty to turn them into the Hague for a tribunal , similar to the bounties that Sadam and Noriega had put on them .
Once it gets to $ 100,000,000 , ( maybe less ) I 'd bet there would be some blackwater types out there looking to cash in .

" They are political Caligulas . "
True , as are they all .
There is no historical name / reference that is too horrific to apply to a skilled , long time politician ( as a class ) and they ALL scare me .
Emanuells ' close ties are a worry because any solution based on anything but what will work toward justice for all parties is morally repugnant .
He is by no means the only staunchly pro-Zionist in a powerful position .
If there are religiously extremist countries in the ME with a nuclear arsenal you want one tied to you .
all President 's will have a strong Pro-Israeli position .
I think that 's where we are now .
I know the plutonium for some of their arsenal ' came from ' South Africa but I do n't know that it was proved that it came from the US THROUGH SoA .
Would n't doubt it a minute .
I stopped being a Zionist when I got old enough ( about 12 ) to realize that they were n't given flat , empty desert by the British and Allies after WWII .
Whoever in Egypt gave the go - ahead for the first war was an idiot IMO because it gave the Israelis an opportunity to put in place the religious / imperial policy that no one in the West was prepared to stop or speak against at that time ; which kind of brings us to where we are today and speaks to ( in a way ) your stated concern above .
The sky raining WP is a war crime under any condition IMO and so is a disproportionate response .
So is stealing some ones / homeland country a bite at a time because you can .
Lot 's of luck ( to us sane people ) with getting any that prosecuted .
Bah !
" Abu Mazen ... "
The dismissal of the coalition government that included Hamas was stupid in the extreme and led directly to Hamas gaining the governent .
Between Bush and Mazen calling for elections how could the depth of cr+p not rise neck deep ?
Thanks guy's , the world needed that complication .
I knew what would happen and I know you did also 99 .
Yes , calling him was an insult ; he 's looking for ' moderates ' to talk to IMO .
Was n't a female Israeli politician that wants to halt and roll back the settlements ( and who has aspirations to the Prime Minister position also invited to Washington ?
I could be / am probably wrong about that - I did n't pay much attention to her name and could n't find her on Google when I looked .

Tzipi Livni .
She is a war criminal .
She is an exterminator of babies .
She is a rabid exterminator of babies , and by many reports this is the popular stance within the Israeli electorate ... which is meaningful to her party at this time because their election is a week away .
Calling Abu Mazen first of anyone , let alone at all , was unforgivable , even if we want Obama to press ahead and do better .
I wo n't ever forget that he did that , even if he manages to earn a measure of forgiveness down the road .
He is under pressure as no new president in history has ever been , so I do try to take that into account , but he is also , or should be , one of the best - informed new presidents in history and some of the screw ups are outright no brainers for people of good will .
I know he has other shit to consider than just good will , but he is making plenty of seriously disappointing and extremely consequential decisions , no matter what the pressures , even if understandable when the consequences are n't so dire .
DON'T go obsessively pro-Obama .
It will blind you .
It will help give him room to underperform and wuss out on vital stuff .
You are only his friend if you keep the pressure on him to live up to his promises of change .
Already he 's installing a solidly mainstream DC administration and insisting that he , himself is the change he meant .
Hubris , Lotta , that 's called hubris .
You do n't want it leading to nemesis ?
You be careful about cutting him slack .
For him .

For all of us .

Viewers back broadcast of suicide film as Brown says it is ' a matter of conscience '
Viewers of the " assisted suicide film " which shows a terminally ill man dying have come out in support of it .
The Sky documentary , which sparked anger among anti-euthanasia campaigners , was the first time a suicide has been shown on British television .
Despite a public outcry over the film , audience members left messages of support on the website of the broadcaster 's Real Lives channel .
One said : " It was a privilege to watch Craig go with dignity and my heart goes out to his family and friends . "
But regulator Ofcom was today bracing itself for complaints about the film , which showed motor neurone disease sufferer Craig Ewert , 59 , dying in a Swiss assisted suicide clinic .
A " handful " of people contacted the regulator before the broadcast but it could not take complaints until after the film was aired .
The end :
This is the moment Mary bids farewell to her husband Craig Ewert as he slips away into unconsciousness at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland
A spokesman for Sky Real Lives could not comment on the number of complaints it has received .
One viewer wrote on the Sky Real Lives website : " I have just had the privilege to watch the wonderfully moving documentary about Craig Ewert 's life and death .
Why , oh why can't the so called ' do gooders ' see that there is a definite need for a shift in opinion over a person 's right to die ? "
Another viewer said : " It was only after seeing the programme tonight that I realise the enormous amount of courage and understanding required to make such an extraordinary leap .
" I truly feel my life has been enriched by this documentary and I would love to thank the Ewert family for allowing and sharing such an amazing and frightening moment . "
An Ofcom spokeswoman said today : " UK broadcasters must adhere to the broadcasting code , which sets standards for the content of TV programmes , and we assess all complaints against the code . "
Ofcom will consider whether the code 's provisions on " harm and offence " have been breached .
It states that " methods of suicide and self - harm must not be included in programmes except where they are editorially justified and are also justified by the context " .
No return : Craig Ewert is dying a quick and painless death as Mary reaches out to touch him
It could impose a fine on Sky of up to £ 250,000 , and may also direct Sky to broadcast an apology .
Mr Ewert paid Swiss euthanasia group Dignitas £ 3,000 to arrange his death .
In last night 's documentary he was seen turning off his ventilator with his mouth and drinking a lethal dose of drugs through a straw .
He died 45 minutes later with his wife of 37 years by his side .
Phyllis Bowman , of Right to Life , said : " What kind of effect do they think this will have on a depressive ?
It undermines the vulnerable and it undermines people 's right to life . "
But Gordon Brown has said that helping someone to commit suicide was a matter of conscience .
His comments followed a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute anyone over the assisted death of paralysed rugby player Daniel James .
Tearful goodbye : Although knowing for many years that her husband wanted an assisted suicide , Mary is overcome by emotions at the reality that she will not see Craig again
Responding in the Commons to an outcry over the televised suicide of motor neurone disease sufferer Craig Ewert , the Prime Minister condemned the idea of a law to allow assisted suicide .
But critics fear his belief that aiding suicide is a matter for individuals , combined with a refusal to press charges over Mr James ’s death by DPP Keir Starmer QC , indicates that no one will now be prosecuted for taking a relative or friend to kill themselves at the Dignitas suicide clinic in Switzerland , unless they gain from their actions .
It appeared to seal the reluctance by courts and prosecutors to act against Dignitas and those who use the right to commit suicide given by Swiss law .
Anyone found guilty of aiding or abetting someone in arranging their own death in Britain can be jailed for 14 years under the 1961 Suicide Act .
Debate : Gordon Brown during Prime Minister 's Questions at the House of Commons today
But even though Mr Starmer said there was evidence to convict Daniel ’s parents and a family friend , there was no public interest when no one had tried to persuade the 23 - year - old to die .
His parents paid Dignitas and travelled with Daniel to Zurich , while the friend booked the family ’s flights .
But Mr James ’s family had begged the sportsman , who was left paralysed after a rugby accident , to reconsider taking his own life until the last minute .
During clashes in the Commons over the televised death of Mr Ewert at the same clinic , Mr Brown appealed for compassion for families agonising over the suffering of a loved one .
The death in September 2006 of Mr Ewert , 59 , an American former university professor , was shown on a Sky documentary channel on Wednesday night .
The Prime Minister was asked if the broadcast of an assisted death was in the public interest or whether it was distasteful voyeurism .
He said : ‘ We should all remember , at the heart of any individual case are families and people in difficult circumstances who have to make difficult choices .
None of us would want to go through that .
‘ I believe it is a matter of conscience .
It is necessary to ensure there is never a case
where a sick or elderly person feels under pressure to agree to an assisted death or somehow feels it is expected .
That is why I have always opposed legislation for assisted deaths . ’
Craig Ewert switches off his ventilator to begin the suicide process
The end : A doctor checks Mr Ewert 's pulse
The shift towards allowing assisted suicide was condemned by campaigners .
Phyllis Bowman , of Right to Life , said : ‘ What kind of effect do they think this will have on a depressive ?
It undermines the vulnerable and it undermines people ’s right to life . ’
Phil Willis , Liberal Democrat MP for Harrogate where Mr Ewert lived , said the film was
trying to ‘ promote assisted suicide ’ and should not be shown .
Dr Peter Saunders , of the group Care Not Killing , said : ‘ There is a growing appetite
from the British public for increasingly bizarre reality shows .
It is a slippery slope . ’
Mr Ewert 's wife Mary held her husband 's hand as he passed away less than 45 minutes after drinking a lethal dose of sedatives and setting a timer to switch off his ventilator
There was also growing pressure on Sky , which said its programme was meant to ' inform public debate about even the most challenging subjects . '
OFCOM earlier said it had received complaints but it could not act on them until after the programme has been broadcast .
But Joan Bakewell , the Government ’s champion for the elderly , said : ‘ There is nothing
frivolous about this and there is nothing that everyone who is alive cannot envisage and think about and many people are anxious and worried .
This film might allay their worries . ’
Mr and Mrs Ewert in happier times .
Footage of Mr Ewert 's death will be the first time an assisted suicide has been shown on UK television
Mr Ewert ’s wife Mary yesterday revealed that he had battled feelings of depression .
She told Sky News :
‘ He at times felt depressed – and who would not , facing that fact that you had an incurable disease and there was absolutely nothing that could be done and , on top of it , the demise could be quite slow and quite uncomfortable ?
‘ Many people would react to that with a sense of sadness , but that was n’t pervasive in his approach .
I think he had the idea all along that he could choose not to do this even
when he arrived at Dignitas . ’
Suicide : Daniel James with his parents Mark and Julie .
He killed himself in September after being paralysed from the chest down in a rugby accident
She added that her husband had discussed the possibility of assisted suicide for more than 30 years before he opted to go through with a decision that was ‘ part of his make - up ’ .
A poll showed yesterday that 47 per cent of Britons would like to end their life when they ‘ feel it ’s time ’ , while 31 per cent disagreed in the Ipsos Morisurvey of 2,019 people .
More than 100 people are claimed to have ended their lives at the Dignitas clinic .
However , despite police investigations in some case , no prosecutions have followed .
Mr Ewert explains his decision to visit the assisted suicide clinic earlier in the documentary , The Suicide Tourist
Four years ago a High Court judge made it possible for an unnamed 65 - year - old terminally ill woman to kill herself by lifting an injunction that had prevented her husband from travelling with her to Switzerland .
The law is , however , used in cases where there are suspicions that someone may have procured a suicide out of self - interest .
A recent case was that of prison officer Patricia Mulpeter , who encouraged her dying lesbian lover to commit suicide by suffocation after the couple had spent a £ 10,000 bank loan travelling around the West Country together .
A charge of murder was dropped , and a judge said she deserved compassion .
Miss Mulpeter was given a 28 day suspended sentence for assisting suicide in July .
The Dignitas clinic : Switzerland is the only country in the world where assisted suicide is legal
Subject : [ ANN ] Sinatra 0.9.0 released !
From : Ryan Tomayko < rtomayko@ a . m
Date : Sun , 18 Jan 2009 19:11:35 +0900
Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web - applications in Ruby with minimal effort .
e.g. , require ' rubygems ' require ' sinatra ' get '/ ' do ' Hello world ! ' end Run with `ruby myapp.rb ' and view at http://localhost:4567/.
This is a major release with a good number of new features and bug fixes .
Please be sure to test your apps under the new version before upgrading production environments .
$ gem install sinatra
For more information about Sinatra see : http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/
http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/
Please report any issues to the Sinatra mailing list < sinatrarb / googlegroups.com > or open a ticket in lighthouse : http://sinatra.lighthouseapp.com/
Huge thanks to everyone that helped out with this release by testing , reporting bugs , submitting patches , etc .
We were able to make some large and invasive changes to the codebase in a very short amount of time due largely to everyone 's willingness to help out .
From the CHANGES file : * Works with and requires Rack >= 0.9.1 * Parameters with subscripts are now parsed into a nested / recursive Hash structure .
e.g. , " post [ title ] =Hello&post [ body ] =World " yields params : {' post ' => {' title ' => ' Hello ' , ' body ' => ' World '}} . * Regular expressions may now be used in route pattens ; captures are available at " params [ : captures ] " .
* New " : provides " route condition takes an array of mime types and matches only when an Accept request header is present with a corresponding type .
[ cypher ] *
New request - level " pass " method ; immediately exits the current block and passes control to the next matching route .
*
The request - level " body " method now takes a block ; evaluation is deferred until an attempt is made to read the body .
The block must return a String or Array .
* New " route conditions " system for attaching rules for when a route matches .
The : agent and : host route options now use this system .
* New " dump_errors " option controls whether the backtrace is dumped to rack .
errors when an exception is raised from a route .
The option is enabled by default for top - level apps .
* Better default " app_file " , " root " , " public " , and " views " location detection ; changes to " root " and " app_file " automatically cascade to other options that depend on them .
* Multiple Sinatra applications can now co-exist peacefully within a single process .
The new " Sinatra : : Base " class can be subclassed to establish a blank - slate Rack application or middleware component .
Documentation on using these features is forth - coming ; the following provides the basic gist : http://gist.github.com/38605 *
Error mappings are now split into two distinct layers : exception mappings and custom error pages .
Exception mappings are registered with " error ( Exception ) " and are run only when the app raises an exception .
Register custom error pages with " error( status_code ) " , where " status_code " is an integer ; custom error pages are run any time the response has the status code specified .
Or , register an error page for a range of status codes : " error ( 500..599 ) " .
*
In - file templates are now automatically imported from the file that requires ' sinatra ' .
The use_in_file_templates !
method is still available for loading templates from other files .
* Sinatra 's testing support is no longer dependent on Test :: Unit .
Requiring ' sinatra /test ' adds the Sinatra : : Test module and Sinatra : : TestHarness class , which can be used with any test framework .
The ' sinatra/ test/unit ' , ' sinatra/test/spec ' , ' sinatra/test/rspec ' , or ' sinatra /test / bacon ' files can be required to setup a framework - specific testing environment .
See the README for more information .
* Added support for Bacon ( test framework ) .
The ' sinatra / test / bacon ' file can be required to setup Sinatra test helpers on Bacon : : Context .
* Deprecated " set_option " and " set_options " ; use " set " instead .
* Deprecated the " env " option ( " options.env " ) ; use " environment " instead .
* Deprecated the request level " stop " method ; use " halt " instead .
* Deprecated the request level " entity_tag " method ; use " etag " instead .
Both " entity_tag " and " etag " were previously supported .
* Deprecated the request level " headers " method ( HTTP response headers ) ; use " response [ ' Header - Name ' ] " instead .
* Deprecated " Sinatra.application " ; use " Sinatra : : Application " instead .
* Deprecated setting Sinatra.application = nil to reset an application .
This should no longer be necessary .
* Deprecated " Sinatra.default_options " ; use " Sinatra : : Default.set ( key , value ) " instead .
* Deprecated the " ServerError " exception .
All Exceptions are now treated as internal server errors and result in a 500 response status .
* Deprecated the " get_it " , " post_it " , " put_it " , " delete_it " , and " head_it " test helper methods .
Use " get " , " post " , " put " , " delete " , and " head " , respectively , instead .
* Removed Event and EventContext classes .
Applications are defined in a subclass of Sinatra : : Base ; each request is processed within an instance .
Thanks
I 'm very pleased to announce that Questionable Content is now partnering with Topatoco to handle all of our merchandise shipping !
QC has just gotten too big for Cristi and I to handle everything ourselves anymore , and Topatoco has a well - deserved reputation for being awesome .
What does this mean for you , the ( potential ) QC customer ?
Faster and more reliable order turnaround , faster shipping , greater shopping and payment options , and better customer service .
Basically YOU WIN IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY .

Not wanting to kill ourselves because WE HAVE SO MANY T - SHIRTS TO MAIL OUT OH GOD which has pretty much been our state of mind for the past four years .
Now , here are the important details :
We are discontinuing several designs to make the transition easier and free up room for new merchandise .
Deahtmole , ZAP , Bomb the Blogosphere , Irony , Dashing Hat ( aka the Indiana Jones shirt ) , Rockin ' Pintsize , and Coffee of Doom * .
We are also eliminating some of the extra color options on the following designs : Royal Blue for " Evolution Kills , " Serene Green for the Hannelore shirt , Purple LGBTerrific , Red and Grey Hobocore , Pink and Navy Broken Heart , " Red Everything Is Ruined Forever , " and Pink " I Feel Pretty . " , just getting rid of the less popular color options .
Again , you must order by the 23rd to get them before they 're gone .

If you currently have an outstanding order , do n't worry - we will get it filled as quickly as we can .
We 're trying to make this transition as smooth as possible but appreciate your patience in case of any delays .
Anyway I am COMPLETELY PSYCHED that we 're partnering up with Topatoco and I think you will be too !
* I 'm working on an update of this one .
It will be SEXY and EXCELLENT .
The sorrowful rise of neuter man .
by Fred Reed
Ever wonder why masculine men are dying out –the old
strong , silent type who rolled cheroots one - handed while roping dogies
with the other–and being replaced by delicate androgynous Ken-dolls who
look like Tinkerbell with a flat chest ?
Or why women look increasingly .
. . not masculine so much as sexless ?
Tell you what I think .
( I ’ll bet that surprises you . )
Used to be , men and women were different , and they knew it .
They
were n’t in competition .
So a guy could be Marlboro Man , or sort of
anyhow , and grunt , and stand tall in the saddle , and say ,
“ Hoo - ahhhh ! ” and ride Harleys .
And if anybody messed with his
kids or women , he ’d take a tire iron to ’em , or a thirty - thirty ,
depending–or at least imagine that he might .
He had sense enough ,
anyway , to know that it was a good idea .
Back then , a woman could like a big hairy - chested hunk , because she
was n’t competing with him .
In fact , the hairier and chesteder he was ,
the better , because she was vying with her girlfriends to see who could
get the manlier man .
And a lot of women liked the idea of 240 pounds of
muscle in a Stetson that meant to take care of them .
She meanwhile could afford to be cute , feminine , and curved , and
dress like a woman , and maybe wield a gorgeous smile that she used to
play him like a banjo–which he probably knew , and figured that was OK
too , because that ’s how things worked , and anyway guys are guys .
She
did n’t have to out - hairy him .
She was n’t trying to be a guy .
East was east , and west was west , and the twain would meet at the
drop of a hat .
Then everything changed .
Women decided they wanted to compete with
men . OK .
I can understand it .
If I were a woman with an IQ of 160 , I ’d
probably want to be a biochemist instead of child - herd and
doily - polisher .
The idea seemed reasonable to most women , and to most
men .
A kajillion gals poured into the workplace .
Thing was–and nobody had really thought this out –they did n’t expect
to compete on their merits as individuals , get as far as they got , and
figure that was the hand God dealt them .
They wanted to duke it out
head - to - head , self - consciously and avowedly , as a class , with men .
It
was n’t Sally wrestling with the law boards .
It was Us agin Them .
Which was a Whole Nuther Thing .
No society or species had ever tried
it .
Problems arose .
Fact is , men are hard to compete with .
Physically ,
they are taller , heavier , much stronger , more durable and more enduring .
Except for nymphet gymnastics , there may be no sport in which women hold
the record .
Intellectually men have a large advantage mathematically and
a slight one verbally at the high end , that becomes rapidly greater as
one moves to the right of the mean ;
This is the Glass Ceiling .
Men are
more aggressive , exploratory , adventurous , and versatile .
Sorry , but
there it is .
Women moved up some , and some moved up a lot , but they did n’t catch
up numerically with men .
It was because they could n’t , and that ’s a
pretty good reason .
And when you got down to it , women just did n’t care
enough .
They had other things on their minds , like families and rugrats .
They did n’t quite understand this .
Nobody did .
All women wanted , they
said early on , was to be judged by the same standards as men .
It was a
bad idea .
If I judge Cup Cake as a woman , I note that she is sleek ,
smart , funny , graceful , sweet as sorghum on a Moon Pie , and dances like
a dream raised in Arkansas .
I ’m smitten .
If I judge her as I judge men , she ’s an emotionally unstable dwarf .
How much respect am I supposed to have for a 5 ’ 3 ″ guy who bench presses
a twenty - ounce Pepsi ?
Antagonism inevitably ensued .
Men said that the ladies did n’t want to
be women , and could n’t be men .
Why , they asked each other , did a
first - rate woman want to be a second - rate man ?
The women said men were
bigoted .
Men said they were just observant .
Women , who had always
regarded men as commitment objects and pre-med objects , became enraged
that men regarded them as sex objects .
Men were puzzled .
They did n’t
know what else to regard as sex objects .
I was confused myself .
I remember a woman screaming at me , “ Women
do n’t want to be objects ! ”
Trying to be conciliatory , I said , “ OK , you
can be subjects . ”
That did n’t suit her either .
They do n’t know what they want .
And that ’s the problem .
They got angry and developed chips on their shoulder pads .
War
ensued , in which women raged and men did n’t know what the hell was going
on .
When natural ability failed , women discovered , politics would serve .
And so we got affirmative action , which means , “ pretending . ”
Depending on the venue , the women needed very little or lots of
pretending .
The military was worst .
It pretended either that women could
climb obstacles , or that wars did n’t involve obstacles .
Soon soldiers
discovered that most women could n’t throw a grenade beyond its bursting
radius .
This will make you unpopular on battlefields .
Besides , a woman
throwing a grenade looked like a sea lion waving its flipper .
So the
Army built a little wall for them to drop grenades over .
It was ridiculous .
It is ridiculous .
Affirmative action always is .
Nobody is fooled .
Still , it spread like peanut butter on a hot day .
For
those women who did n’t like men anyway , it was sweet revenge .
Except–it
was n’t quite .
The men knew , and the women knew they knew .
On the other
hand , the checks cashed .
Intuitively women knew they had to push for unisex .
To compete with
men , women had to act like men , who are competitive , and get men to
behave like women , who are n’t .
They bought ugly sexless suits , did
boring things with their hair , and practiced being disagreeable , often
succeeding wildly .
Meanwhile the media , fronting for them , went in for
pretty male models who waxed their chests and were n’t threatening .
The
compassionate man emerged like a grub from a log .
The women won .
Marlboro Man , or anybody too clearly of one sex or the
other , is out of style .
Both the New - Age woman , and her docile
man-surrogate , would be intimidated , and ol ’ Marlboro would have trouble
knowing which was the girl .
God it ’s boring .

Look , you have a new 16×9 high definition television .
I get it .
So do I .
There is something in us that WANTS to have every single , beautiful pixel filled with entertainment awesomeness .
But here ’s the deal — your 4×3 footage was never meant to be displayed like that .
It ’s just wrong .
Picard did not have a head that fat .
I ’ve had this discussion in real life , and people say they are annoyed by the black bars on the side of the television if they watch it in the native aspect ratio .
These are ( ironically ) the same people that bought “ fullscreen ” DVDs because they did n’t like the black bars on the top and bottom of their old 4×3 televisions .
Fullscreen DVDs are wrong .
Stretched 4×3 video is even wronger .
Just do n’t do it , you make big screen TV people everywhere look bad .
Now go rent Star Trek the Next Generation , and watch it like it ’s supposed to look .
You wo n’t be sorry . 🙂
UPDATE : OMG , I see THIS on Engadget today .

Performance tip of the day
If your Firefox , like mine , insists on doing huge amounts of I/ O when closing , as well as acts slow when using the awesomebar , try the following ( close down Firefox completely first ) :
for f in ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/*.sqlite ; do sqlite3 $f ' VACUUM ; '; done
It ’s harmless , no data will be lost : it compacts your SQLite databases .
Noticable gains for me .
Praise be to Allah .
Firstly :
The question of acting and related issues has already been dealt with in Question no .
10836 .
We may add to that :
Shaykh Abu Bakr Zayd ( may Allaah preserve him ) said : chivalry [ i.e. , behaving in a proper and decent manner ] is one of the aims of sharee ’ah , and anything that undermines that renders a person unfit to give testimony in court .
Islam enjoins the loftiest characteristics and forbids base and vile characteristics .
How often do viewers see an actor doing silly actions or moving or speaking in a silly manner , or even playing the role of a madman , idiot or fool .
Based on this , it is clear to the wise man that acting is one of the things that most undermine chivalry , so it is one of the things that render a person unfit to give testimony in court .
Anything that is like that is not approved of in sharee ’ah .
See al - Muru ’ah wa Khawaarimuhaa , p. 221 , by Mashhoor Hasan
Secondly :
Marrying a young girl before she reaches the age of adolescence is permitted in sharee ’ah ; indeed it was narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point .
( a) Allaah says ( interpretation of the meaning ) :
“ And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses , for them the ‘ Iddah ( prescribed period ) , if you have doubt ( about their periods ) , is three months ; and for those who have no courses [ ( i.e. they are still immature ) their ‘ Iddah ( prescribed period ) is three months likewise ”
[ al - Talaaq 65:4 ]
In this verse we see that Allaah has made the ‘ iddah in the case of divorce of a girl who does not have periods – because she is young and has not yet reached puberty – three months .
This clearly indicates that Allaah has made this a valid marriage .
( b) It was narrated from ‘ Aa’ishah ( may Allaah be pleased with her ) that the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) married her when she was six years old , he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine and she stayed with him for nine years .
( Narrated by al - Bukhaari , 4840 ; Muslim , 1422 )
The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) married ‘ Aa’ishah when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine . ”
( Narrated by al - Bukhaari and Muslim ; Muslim says ‘ seven years ’ )
The fact that it is permissible to marry a young girl does not mean that it is permissible to have intercourse with her ; rather that should not be done until she is able for it .
For that reason the Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him ) delayed the consummation of his marriage to ‘ Aa’ishah .
Al - Nawawi said :
With regard to the wedding - party of a young married girl at the time of consummating the marriage , if the husband and the guardian of the girl agree upon something that will not cause harm to the young girl , then that may be done .
If they disagree , then Ahmad and Abu ‘ Ubayd say that once a girl reaches the age of nine then the marriage may be consummated even without her consent , but that does not apply in the case of who is younger .
Maalik , al - Shaafa ’i and Abu Haneefah said : the marriage may be consummated when the girl is able for intercourse , which varies from one girl to another , so no age limit can be set .
This is the correct view .
There is nothing in the hadeeth of ‘ Aa’ishah to set an age limit , or to forbid that in the case of a girl who is able for it before the age of nine , or to allow it in the case of a girl who is not able for it and has reached the age of nine .
Al - Dawoodi said : ‘ Aa’ishah ( may Allaah be pleased with her ) was reached physical maturity ( at the time when her marriage was consummated ) .
Sharh Muslim , 9/206
It is preferable for a guardian not to marry off his daughter when she is still young unless there is a valid reason for that .
Al - Nawawi said :
It should be noted that al - Shaafa ’i and his companions said :
It is preferable for fathers and grandfathers not to marry off a virgin until she reaches the age of puberty and they ask her permission , lest she end up in a marriage that she dislikes .
What they said does not go against the hadeeth of ‘ Aa’ishah , because what they meant is that they should not marry her off before she reaches puberty if there is no obvious interest to be served that they fear will be missed out on if they delay it , as in the hadeeth of ‘ Aa’ishah .
In that case it is preferable to go ahead with the marriage because the father is enjoined to take care of his child ’s interests and not to let a good opportunity slip away .
And Allaah knows best .
Sharh Muslim , 9/206 .
More rain and snow was forecast for isolated areas of central New York state and northeastern Maine while the rest of the region was expected to remain dry but bitter cold .
Conclusion
Combining applications by type allows us to easily assess the relative performance of each system in a single chart .
As we ’d hoped , performance scales directly to dollars spent , but not proportionally .
Performance increases are almost linear whereas build - cost increases are exponential .
Doubling our $ 625 PC budget produced a 78 % performance gain in the $ 1,250 PC , but doubling the $ 1,250 budget gave our $ 2,500 PC only a measly 13 % gain .
Overclocking helped the $ 2,500 PC more than the rest , but the value of high - end systems is always somewhat questionable .
Using our $ 625 system at stock speed for the basis of comparison , we calculated performance per dollar spent for each configuration .
While our performance chart clearly shows nearly - linear performance boosts as a function of exponential cost increases , everything is turned upside with our value chart , in which the hierarchy is now in reverse order and the cheaper machines dominate .
Overclocking improved our $ 625 PC ’s value by 31 % .
Meanwhile , our $ 1,250 PC started with only 93 % of the $ 625 system ’s value and only reached 113 % of that value when overclocked .
Worse still , our $ 2,500 PC had only 54 % of the $ 650 system ’s value at stock speed and climbed to a final value score of only 72 % when overclocked .
The $ 625 system is a great choice for true value - seekers on extremely tight budgets .
While its gaming performance is barely adequate in many of our tests , we ’re certain that choosing lower details will help owners to justify the ratio of performance lost to money saved .
With 94 % of the value of the cheapest system , our $ 1,250 PC appears to be the best solution for performance seekers with medium budgets - – builders who ca n’t quite afford it could justify waiting a few weeks to save up for the parts , while those with slightly larger budgets can happily put the left - over money into other projects .
We saw huge performance leads in many benchmarks from our $ 2,500 PC , but none of those gains were large enough to offset its enormous price tag .
Still , we ’re sure that there are a few gamers who will appreciate the added performance of its 3 - way SLI configuration , a system that beat two HD 4870 X2 graphics cards in most games at resolutions up to 1920x1200 pixels .
But what about the 2560x1600 resolution for which our previous $ 4,500 PC was designed ?
We 've already seen how value further suffers in our comparison of $ 2,500 and $ 4,500 builds .
An overwhelming number of readers demanded an enthusiast - level system they could actually afford , and we simply did n't have enough time or money to add a fourth PC to this month 's comparison .
Each month Tom's Hardware reconsiders its budgets based on reader feedback , and our highest - priced system budget is the most flexible .
We ’d love to do another " elite - enthusiast " build , so do n't be afraid to voice your opinion .
Debris from a dismantled planet could be placed around a star to collect solar energy for power - hungry extraterrestrial civilisations .
Such ‘ Dyson spheres ’ were the brainchild of physicist Freeman Dyson ( Illustration : Vedexent / Wikimedia Commons )
A search for colossal feats of alien engineering called ‘ Dyson spheres ’ has so far found no convincing candidates within 1000 light years of Earth .
But some say the prospects for finding the hypothetical structures , which could cocoon stars in order to collect solar energy for power - hungry aliens , may be getting brighter .
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is focused largely on detecting signals sent from afar .
But in 1960 , physicist Freeman Dyson proposed a way to directly search for artifacts of alien civilisations .
Dyson envisioned that population pressure and the demand for energy would drive civilisations to dismantle planets and use the debris to surround a star , creating a massive solar collector .
A number of Dyson sphere structures have been proposed , including a solid , rotating ring and a spherical shell of debris .
These structures might be habitable themselves , or they might be used as remote solar power collectors .

The structures would partially or fully block the star ’s visible and ultraviolet light , but they would still be detectable .
A Dyson sphere or ring would be warmed by the star ’s energy and would radiate infrared light that could be detected from Earth .
Some researchers have previously searched for signs of the spheres in data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) , which launched in 1983 and made an infrared map of the entire sky .
Hundreds of candidates
IRAS took data in different modes , sometimes looking at its sources through a handful of colour filters , and sometimes looking at sources with its spectrograph , which carefully studied a wide range of colours .
The previous searches focused on sources that had been studied with the colour filters .
They looked for objects that radiate most of their light at relatively long infrared wavelengths .
That would be the case if a Dyson sphere located at about the Earth ’s orbital distance from its star absorbed the energy emitted by a Sun - like star and then re-emitted it as heat .
But with only a few colours available to scrutinise for the temperature signature of a Dyson sphere , the previous studies could not whittle down the list of 250,000 IRAS sources to a few good candidates .
Now , Richard Carrigan , a retired physicist who had worked at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois , has combed through data from the probe ’s spectrograph , which provides a more detailed portrait of the source ’s light .
Whittling down
Beginning with more than 10,000 infrared spectra taken by IRAS , Carrigan identified only 17 possible “ spheres ” , four of which seem most promising .
Unfortunately , all the objects have features that could just as easily be explained by clouds of hydrogen gas , dust engulfing ancient stars , or even asteroids in our own solar system , Carrigan told New Scientist .
“ There are very few candidates that come close to fitting the bill , ” Carrigan says .
“ Many different kinds of astrophysical objects could masquerade as Dyson spheres , ” says infrared astronomer Charles Beichman of Caltech .
“ I think the search . . . is looking for a needle in a field of haystacks , when you ’re not even sure there ’s a needle there .
But he ’s done a very nice job of working through the available data . ”
Carrigan ’s approach is good at whittling down sphere candidates from many sources , agrees astronomer Dan Werthimer of the University of California , Berkeley , and chief scientist of SETI@Home , a project that harnesses the idle time of people ’s computers to search for possible extraterrestrial radio signals .
“ It gets it down to a manageable number of stars you can follow up on , ” Werthimer told New Scientist .
“ That ’s been a big problem with these Dyson sphere searches . ”
More precise
The 17 sphere candidates Carrigan has identified have been added to SETI ’s list of interesting objects , to be investigated for radio and laser signals .
“ If we ’re lucky , maybe one of these things will pan out and be the first evidence of an alien civilisation , ” Werthimer says .
But Werthimer adds more promising evidence for Dyson spheres could come from NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope .
IRAS was not precise enough to identify individual stars , particularly in crowded parts of the sky , such as the plane of the Milky Way .
“ You might have 10 or 20 sources within the IRAS beam , but what you ’re getting is the sum of all that flux , not the signature of a single Dyson sphere , ” says astronomer Ed Churchwell of the University of Wisconsin .
Spitzer ’s GLIMPSE survey may offer better prospects for Dyson structure searches .
The all - sky infrared map contains more than 100 million objects and has some 60 times IRAS ’s resolution , Churchwell told New Scientist .
A final version of the survey ’s data may be available as early as the end of 2008 .
With no fighting in the last 16 hours , there is some hope that the 1.5 million people in the Gaza Strip can eventually return to some kind of normalcy .
But for now their time is spent digging through the rubble of their former homes , searching for loved ones long unreachable because of persistent Israeli shelling .
After three weeks of intensive attacks , the odds of finding much in the way of survivors seems remote , and the death toll has reportedly past 1,300 now as 95 more bodies have been pulled from the rubble - filled streets of Jabalya and Beit Lahiya .
The Israeli press is reporting that 20 of the dead are believed to have been “ gunmen ” but many women and children have also been found .
As the days go on , assuming the fighting does n’t resume , the true toll of the Israeli offensive will eventually emerge .
As for normalcy , that will likely have to wait as thousands of Israeli troops will remain in Gaza for an indeterminate period of time , and it remains unclear , despite international pressure , whether the lull in violence will actually mean Israel will allow more humanitarian aid through its border crossings .
She had , by her own account , been wildly in love with Follieri since they met through a friend in 2004 .
Follieri's business had been based on acquiring properties , largely from the Catholic Church in America – he boasted of links to the Vatican that might give him special rights to buy such assets .
He had impressed enough to make some powerful business associations , forming a joint venture in 2005 with Yucaipa , an investment firm run by the billionaire supermarket mogul Ron Burkle , a friend of Bill Clinton .
Follieri had even set up a charitable foundation in his name with Hathaway on its board , which in 2006 began a programme of vaccination against hepatitis A in Nicaragua .
On one occasion he was publicly thanked by Clinton for pledging $ 50 million from the foundation to the Clinton Global Initiative ( a donation that has not been paid ) .
But from May 2007 , when Yucaipa filed a suit against Follieri for ' systematically misappropriating the assets ' on maintaining an A - list lifestyle with Hathaway ( ' five - star lodging ' , ' inappropriate jet travel ' ) , Follieri 's dealings came under increasing scrutiny .
He settled the $ 1.3 million Yucaipa suit , but in April 2008 he had to visit a New York police station to address the matter of a $ 215,000 bounced cheque , a prelude to the charge sheet brought against him in June ( among other things , he was accused of hiring two monsignors to accompany him to business meetings and , once , of asking a monsignor to wear the robes of a more senior clergyman in order to make Follieri's Vatican connections appear more important . )
awsは申し込んで必要なサービスさえ選んでしまえば簡単に運用できると考えていることもあるでしょう。しかし、自由度の高いサービスなのでawsを運用するときには適切な社内体制を整えることが必須です。その条件の一つとしてスクリプトを書けるエンジニアを確保することが挙げられますが、なぜそのようなエンジニアが必要なのでしょうか。
⇒awsのecrを運用するポイント
そもそも運用には何が必要なのか
awsの運用にスクリプトを書けるエンジニアが必要なのはなぜかを理解するためには、まず前提条件として運用に何が必要かを理解することが必須です。awsを運用するときには申し込んだサービスやアプリをただ利用していれば良いというわけではなく、割り当てられているリソースを適切に使用できるようにしたり、セキュリティーの管理をしたりすることが必要になります。
awsはクラウドサーバーを提供してもらえるサービスというのが基本になっていて、その上で利用できるサービスやアプリにも従量制の料金で申し込める仕組みなのが特徴です。提供されているサーバー領域は自前で管理しなければならないのが原則になっています。
このような基本の仕組みに基づくとawsの運用をするには何が必要なのでしょうか。安定してサーバーを利用できる状況を作るためのインフラを整えるのが最も重要なことで、一般的にサーバー監視と言われている業務の担い手が欠かせません。
サーバー監視とはサーバーのリソースが適切に使用されているか、サーバーの不具合が発生していないかなどといった状況をリアルタイムで確認し、リソースの効率的な利用が可能な状況を作りつつ、障害の予防や対策をすることです。
適切な監視をできるようにするためにはサーバーに詳しいエンジニアの力が必要になるのは明らかでしょう。
サーバー監視の目的をよく理解しよう
awsを運用するときにサーバー監視をする目的は安定してサーバーを利用できる環境を作り出すことです。社内の業務システムや顧客向けのサービスサイトなどをサーバー上で稼働させていると、頻繁にユーザーからのアクセスがあります。
その負荷のかかり具合によってリソースをうまく振り分けていかなければ動作が不安定になるリスクがあることは否めません。その不具合を解決するためにサーバー領域を大きくしてしまうとコストが無駄にかかるようになってしまいます。
容量を増やすと管理しなければならない範囲も広がるのでサーバー監視の業務負担も大きくなる問題があるため、最小限の領域を有効活用するのが大切です。サーバー監視はawsのサーバーを使用しているユーザーがいる限りは常に行っていなければならないのが原則です。
ユーザーがどのように利用しているかによってリソースの割り当てを逐次変更しなければならないことに加え、障害が発生したときには速やかに対処する必要が生じます。そのため、昔からサーバー監視は業務時間内は常に行える体制が整えられてきました。
残業をしているあるいは休日出勤をしている社員がいる現場や顧客にいつでもアクセスしてもらえるようにしている場合には、基本的には24時間、365日の対応が必要になっています。
サーバー監視でのスクリプトの必要性
サーバー監視でスクリプトを書けるエンジニアが必要なのは、スクリプトを活用することで業務負担の軽減と運用の効率化を実現できるからです。24時間、365日の体制でサーバー監視をする状況を作るのはコストもかかり、エンジニアの確保の大変さを考えると事業の継続性についても疑念が生まれざるを得ません。
この問題を解決できるのがスクリプトの活用で、監視の自動化を実現することにつながります。端的に言ってしまえば、こういう状況が生じたらこんな対応をするというのを自動化してしまえば、人が目で見ていなくてもある程度のリソースの最適化や障害への対応は可能です。
自動化のためにはスクリプトを書く必要があるため、その能力があるエンジニアが求められるのです。現場での運用状況に応じて適切なスクリプトを作成し、自動監視できる状況を作り上げることが必要になります。そのため、awsを導入した時点でスクリプトを全て完成させておくことは難しく、継続的にサーバー監視の自動化に取り組めるエンジニアが重要になっています。
社内エンジニアが必須かはケースバイケース
awsの監視のためのスクリプトを書けるスキルがあるエンジニアを社内エンジニアとして雇おうとすると人材を探すのが大変なだけでなく、雇用をするコストも大きな問題になりがちです。ただ、社内エンジニアが本当に必要なのかはよく考えてみなければならないでしょう。
確かに社内エンジニアがいれば常に新しいスクリプトを作り上げ、いつも安心して運用できる体制ができる可能性が高くなります。社内事情をよく理解している人が最適化をすれば効率が上がりやすいからです。しかし、スクリプトの作成を業務委託して対応することも可能です。
サーバー監視の代行業者に依頼して自動化を進めてもらう方法はよく行われています。運用の現状だけでなく、将来的な対応も含めて考えたい場合には社内エンジニアがいるに越したことはありませんが、当面の運用のサポートをしてもらいたいという考えであれば代行業者に任せてしまうのがコストパフォーマンスが高いでしょう。
監視体制は最小限にしよう
スクリプトを書いて自動化を進めることにより監視体制は最小限に抑えることが可能です。awsの利用にもコストがかかるので、全体的にかかるコストをいかにして削減するかは大きな課題になります。サーバー監視にかかるコストは初期からきちんと自動化を進めていけば長期的に見るとかなり抑えることが可能です。
大勢のサーバーエンジニアを常駐させて監視する体制を整えるのも方策の一つではありますが、最小限の監視体制にするという考え方を持った方がコストパフォーマンスは高くなります。最初は運用に支障が生じるリスクもないわけではないものの、長期的な視野でメリットが大きい方法を選ぶのが肝心です。
スクリプトを書けるエンジニアを手配しよう
awsの運用を効率良く行えるようにするためにはサーバーに詳しいエンジニアにスクリプトを書いてもらって監視の自動化を進めるのが肝心です。社内エンジニアがスクリプトの作成に常に対応できるようにする必要があるかはケースバイケースですが、業務委託によって確保することも考慮して安心して運用できる体制を整えましょう。
Dictatorship of the Minorities [ May .
25th , 2005 | 08:51 pm ]
Ulrich Drepper Minorities can certainly always wreak havoc on the freedom of others .
There have been plenty of examples throughout history where small group dictate the masses .
This almost always happens with violence ( dictatorships with the help of 1984 - style mind control has n't become known as of today ) .
Now you 'd think that dictatorship of minorities could n't happen in a realm where there is no violence and generally democratic or republic control .
I'm of course about groups connected through the Internet .
More specifically : collaborative development .
But this is where one is wrong .
There often is such a dictatorship .
The worst part is that it is self afflicted .
The more structured and democratic of these collaborating groups give themselves guidelines and this is where things can go wrong .
The guidelines are written , for real or just as a common understanding , in an effort to maximize the collaboration .
This means getting as many people as possible and useful involved and they reflect the situation at given point in time .
This has a number of problems :
it is not always a good idea to maximize the participation
the circumstances in which the project lives change
The second point is certainly acceptable by all people , the first needs some explanation .
The fundamental problem is that configuration options are bad .
Be it at runtime or at compile .
Ideally there is one configuration which works everywhere .
Every new configuration increases complexity .
Not linearly but instead exponentially .
Each option might influence every other option .
This is a disaster not only for users , but also the developers .
It means exponential growth of testing .
Which of course wo n't happen and therefore the code is basically untested .
For developers this means that often only one or two configurations are really tested .
Any us of another configuration is probably doomed to failure in any non-trivial project .
A second aspect is that multiple configurations mean diverts energies .
Despite comments in the press , most collaborative software development projects are chronically undermanned .
Many configurations means that at least parts of the energies devoted to the project by one person is of no interest to a second person who does not care about the affected configuration option .
Integrate this over time and you 'll get a lot of wasted energy .
Examples for this are plenty .
Many of the GNU projects are ported to a wide variety of platforms , even to undeserving once like cygwin and mingw .
The use of autoconf makes this to some extend quite easy ( I 'll write some more about winers who complain about the auto * tools at some later point in time ) .
In the early days of the GNU project , a time most of who are using the code today know nothing about , this was kind of necessary since there was no GNU system ( or simply a free + libre system ) which could be used for the development .
But this time is over .
We have such a free + libre system today : Linux .
There is no need to develop on those proprietary or irrelevant systems anymore .
It does not further the cause of free software .
But even for Linux the situation is clouded .
The OS ( kernel + everything else ) has been ported to many architectures .
While I do n't care a bit about it , I concede that having it available for some embedded architectures like Arm is useful .
And there certainly should be more than one mainstream architecture to keep all the players real , so I welcome PPC in addition to x86/x86-64 .
But there is no benefit at all in supporting something like PA Risc , m68 k , cris , etc as configurations of the generic code .
So the question is : why are there all these configurations ?
One answer is : because of violent minorities supporting such configurations .
And supporting here mainly in the sense of demanding the existence and not in helping out with the project which supports these configurations .
Another answer is : because people are too nice , induced by the spirit of the democratic / republic model of control .
Are these all unverified rants on my side ?
Well , judge yourselves :
IMO the most notorious case is how the gcc development is held hostage by Edelsohn and maybe IBM as a whole by requesting that everything always works perfectly well on AIX .
How often has one seen this patch breaks AIX , back it out .
It cannot reasonably be expected that everybody tests on AIX .
It is an proprietary OS running on proprietary and expensive hardware which not many people have access to .
The overall development speed could be significantly improved by dropping the AIX requirement which , in some form or another , has been agreed upon by the steering committee .
AIX is irrelevant in general today , i.e. , the situation changed .
And the people in the steering committee are too nice to just tell the very small minority causing the problem to take a hike .

AIX is irrelevant in general today , i.e. , the situation changed .
And the people in the steering committee are too nice to just tell the very small minority causing the problem to take a hike .
Deployment on windows systems requires many programs to be crippled .
There are still problems with something as fundamental as upper - and lowercase characters , the huge differences in APIs , and many more problems .
Crippling here means not only that the programs functionality is n't what it could be , it also means that through the used additional indirection to resolve the differences in APIs the code gets bigger and slower .
And of course there is the problem that people used to Unix programming in general do n't know enough about windows programming to not cause breakage and vice versa .
Looking at the complexity needed to cover up the differences between architectures should convince everybody that for every configuration people have to spend more time on a change than it would be needed otherwise ( a concrete example : the Debian distribution of the older days where are architectures were required to work at the same level ) .
Take the Linux kernel .
The main code is mostly free of #ifdefs for architectures but at the price of having very complex macro and inline function combinations everywhere .
Even if one learns how to use the abstraction layer for one arch does n't mean one knows all the necessary details to not break another architecture .
There is always ample proof to be found when reading the patches for non-mainstream archs which fix up patches which have originally been tested only on a few architectures .
This additional work is thankfully not required from most patch authors ( Linus realizes this problem ) but the resolution of the problem still is time consuming for the general public ( because Linus is too nice and does not dismiss the minority configurations ) .
The fight for saving the software world from the evil of proprietary , IP - enforced , non-transparent software has only started .
One could argue that only a small piece of the puzzle is in place and that the upcoming tasks are much bigger .
Look at required work like free MQ subsystems , free controlled runtimes , they are huge and have n't been tackled successfully in a free software project so far .
This is why I encourage project leaders to take a good look at their projects and reconsider previous decisions :
Do n't let Minorities dictate the direction !
Is it really necessary to support all these configuration options ?
Which ones are hardly used ?
It almost certainly helps the majority in terms of development speed and testing quality to drop the options used only by minorities .
This does not mean minorities are deprived of their rights .
This is free software , nobody can take away the code .
But make the special interest groups pay the price for their options .
For source code this means require the extra code to be maintained outside the project 's sources .
If necessary create an infrastructure to enable out - of - tree sources .
For binaries it might mean somebody will have to recompile the binaries with additional patches and configuration parameters to get access to the extra functionality .
Which are the OS targets which should be supported ?
Support for proprietary OSes should be dropped .
Companies like Sun and HP have for far too long survived without providing a decent compiler in the default configuration since there was always gcc .
The Unix tools of most Unix OSes were / are appalling in quality and people did n't care since there always were the GNU tools ( just read the studies made in the early 90's were garbage was fed to the various tools ) .
Free software should only support free OSes and even among those the group needs to be trimmed significantly ( ideally to one ) .
Having just one is no problem ( unlike in the case of processor architectures ) since the entire code is free .
Which architectures are worthwhile supporting ?
There the situation is even more complex and interesting .
Not only do we have to look for irrelevance ( what percentage cares about Vax , PArisc ) support , we also have to look at the level of added complexity the support requires .
Some ABIs are just deliberately defined to be different from others ( see IA - 64 ) which requires huge amounts of effort to be spent .
There are also significantly diverging capabilities ( e.g. , the lack of atomic operations in too many architectures ) .
This far too often causes to unnecessarily crippled code since writing code in a way which allows optimal use in all situations is very difficult .
The solution must be to restrict support to only a handful of architectures which are supported in the project .
All other support must happen outside the tree and therefore all the work has to be done by the special interest groups .
I do n't want to say we follow all these points perfectly , but for a big project glibc certainly comes closest to this .
The only OSes supported in the tree are Linux and to some extend Hurd .
The latter is certainly not a preferred target and does not hold back the development by requesting that no patch breaks the Hurd configuration .
The supported architectures in the tree has been cut and probably should be cut even more .
Only the architectures which are regularly tested ( since they are supported in the various enterprise Linux distributions ) are maintained plus a few historically supported architectures .
The latter group should be cut down to the minimum .
No global edits for the tree are required , they are voluntarily .
I.e. , fixing configurations which are negatively impacted by a patch is the duty of the people with interest in the configuration .
All other configurations are maintained ( or not ) outside the tree .
People can decide to use this additional repository at compile time to get access to the additional configurations .
Nobody is robbed of the freedom but the costs are distributed fairly .
For my new projects the razor is even sharper .
Only Linux is supported and only the few interesting mainstream architecture with reasonable APIs are maintained .
Support for architectures with deliberately different APIs ( i.e. , IA - 64 ) can be contributed .
No other configuration is supported , actively or not , and people would have to exercise their right to add patches or fork the entire code to add other support .
IMO this is the only viable development model to allow free software to succeed since the remaining projects are huge in size and need concentrated efforts not diluted by diverging interests caused by a myriad of configurations .
There are undoubtedly people who will want the flame me to death .
But these people are almost certainly all members of said violent minorities who want to force their opinions on the majority .
Safe your breath , I do n't care and I certainly wo n't change my mind on this .
As in every society from the dawn of time , the benefits of the majority must outweigh the rights / benefits of the minority .
If preserving the rights / benefits of the minority becomes to high for the majority , the losses must be cut .
This is how the world works as can be seen every day on the business news .
Nice people almost never win and especially not if your opponents are pure evil .
Fennec , Mozilla 's Mobile Browser , Marches On
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 20 , 2009
Last month we checked in on the alpha version 2 of Mozilla 's open source mobile browser , dubbed Fennec .
That alpha version has been in widespread testing on Windows , Mac and Linux desktop systems , in order to reach more developers and users than would be possible only on mobile platforms .
Now , according to a list of milestones on Mozilla 's site it looks like we 'll see the official beta version of this very promising browser show up on February 27th .
There are even more reasons to believe that this mobile browser could be a game - changer .
As Ars Technica notes , an embedded Linux developer named Jaya Kumar has successfully tested the Fennec browser on an E - ink device .
There were some limitations , such as not getting an on - screen keyboard to work , but video posted in the Ars Technica piece , and other videos that Kumar has on YouTube , show Fennec to be promising on E - Ink and Amazon Kindle - style devices .
There have already been strong indications that Mozilla has its eyes on much more than just mobile phones for Fennec .
The browser runs on Nokia 's n810 tablets at the moment , and could have promise for tablets , e-books and many kinds of mobile devices .
As we 've covered before , Fennec 's interface is built in such a way that off - screen components play a part in the browsing experience through extensive use of zooming , scrolling and more .
That was Mozilla 's original design intent , is a big part of why the browser is promising , and why it is promising on devices such as e-books .
The Kindle and other devices in its class have not typically had very advanced browsing features .
In keeping with the Firefox tradition , there are also extensions headed for Fennec , which could really differentiate it from other mobile browsers .
I covered the very first extension forked to Fennec here , and it was a Firefox extension .
I 'm betting Mozilla will encourage many developers of Firefox extensions to follow suit .
A reader of our previous post on Fennec made this point : " The key here is going to be OEM adoption .
Just having a mobile browser is one thing .
Getting it on to user devices is another . "
I could n't agree more , and Mozilla will probably proceed with a three - pronged approach : 1 ) getting OEMs to adopt Fennec as a default mobile browser ; 2 ) getting it onto many more devices than just mobile phones ; and 3 ) encouraging developers of Firefox extensions to adjust their offerings for Fennec .
Just as Android is heading for multiple types of hardware platforms , Fennec should too .
This project remains one to watch , and I 'm looking forward to moving beyond the screencasts and videos and working with the beta next month .

I am not a celebrity , a landmark , nor an abnormally large fish .
I am a man .
Please do n't take souvenir snapshots of your husband with his arm around me batting his eyelashes like a silent - screen actress .
It 's offensive .
And I 'm not photogenic .
I am not bisexual .
Please do n't assume that your kink is my kink .
Great .
Your husband likes guys on occasion .
And you like watching your husband liking guys on occasion .
If I wanted some hoo - hoo , though , I 'd cut out the middle man and go straight for the snatch .
And , BTW , if I were into cooch , what , in God 's name , makes you think that I 'd be attracted to you anyway ?
There 's a reason why your husband likes the occasional cock .
I am not mentally ill ( at least not in terms of my homosexuality ) .
Nor am I a shrink .
" Why do you think gay men have an abnormally close relationship with their mothers ? " I do n't know .
I talk to my dad more often than my mom .
Why do n't you ask your mom ?
You live with her .
I am not a drag queen .
" Why do guys want to dress up like girls ? " I am asked .
I do n't know .
Why does Toby Keith dress like Yosemite Sam ?
Drag is drag .
Gay is gay .
Sometimes the twain meet .
I am not a transexual .
I do not know why some men / women choose to lose / gain sexual organs and identities .
For the most part , I like my dick and my gender : so much so , enjoy sleeping with men with dicks .
I can , however , refer you to the Internet for further reading / viewing .
I am not a pedophile .
When , out of common courtesy , I ask about your son , please do n't reply : " He 's straight . "
That 's like someone asking me how my grandmother is doing and replying : " Well , her twat might be a little dry , so I highly recommend lube . "
Besides , do you really think that if I were interested in your 16 - year - old son , I would be asking YOU about him ?
" So , what 's he look like in the shower ?
Bet those pubes are coming in real nice .
You really should hook us up .
" I am not a gloryhole .
Just because you have a 9 - inch cock , does n't mean I want your dick in my hole .
I would n't want it in me if you were gay ; what makes you think I 'd want it in me if you are straight ?
While I must confess to falling prey to the allure of a cute , straight daddy from time to time , being straight does not automatically make you appealing .
Nor does my being gay automatically make me the bottom .
Ask your buddy , Mike .
I am not your Scout buddy .
Whatever you and your pubescent friends experimented with when you were 13 is between the two or three of you .
Please do n't try reliving it with an adult gay man .
I do n't want to go camping with you ( while your wife is visiting friends in Portland ) ; I do n't want to come over and play ( Wii , Nintendo , whatever ) while she is at work ; I do n't want you to jerk me off in the bathroom ( we might lose the pool table ; and , besides , I can jerk myself off , thanks ) ; and I do n't want you to come over to watch the game , get so drunk that you pretend to pass out , then ( while I 'm in the bathroom ) slip in some porn .
You wanna fuck ?
Be a man .
Ask .
If I 'm into you , rock and roll .
Nor am I your ego booster .
Bend over .
Whip it out .
Drop to your knees .
Whatever .
But STOP flirting !
Jesus .
If you are straight , then go , boy , go .
If you just want to play with another guy for the night , again , ask me and we 'll see .
I agree .
Those hot little girls are idiots for not sleeping with you .
Yes , you are good looking .
Yes , you do have a great ass .
Yes , you are smarter and more interesting than your average Joe .
But for fuck 's sake , stop teasing me .
Do n't stand behind me rubbing your cock up against me while I 'm shooting pool ( " I 'm just fucking with you , dude " ) .
Do n't pinch my ass while I 'm trying to break .
Do n't use your pool cue to scratch your balls .
Otherwise , do n't be surprised one night when I appear from your backseat , pull you back there with me , and grudge fuck the shit out of your straight ass .
Walking home ?
Watch the alleys .
I am not omnipresent .
No .
I do not know your 70 - year - old gay uncle from Hot Springs , Arkansas .
No . I never met Liberace .
Yes , I did go to a George Michael concert once .
No , I do not know if he 's a good kisser , I sat in the balcony .
I am not a fashion designer .
But , yes , your ass does look fat in those jeans .
I am not into Appletinis .
I like Bourbon .
Straight .
I am not butch .
Telling someone that they do n't " act gay " is not a compliment , folks .
Being " butch " is not a noble attribute .
Nor is femininity a negative attribute .
How would you like it if I came up to your husband and said : " Wow !
You do n't act straight .
Are you sure you do n't like cock ?
You just do n't seem like the pussy - eating kind of guy .
" I am not handicapped .
The reason I play shitty pool is because I just started playing the game 6 months ago , not because I 'm gay .
But , guys , when I do beat you , please do n't get pissed off and start making excuses .
It 's OK to get beat by a Mo .
It 's not as bad as getting beat by a chick .
I am not a urinal hound .
Guys , you do n't have to go in the stall to piss , you can use one of the 4 or 5 open urinals next to me .
I go in the restroom to relieve me bladder , not to sneak a peak at your package .
And , too , you do n't have to publicly exhibit your masculinity by slamming your fist on the ( door , paper dispenser , toilet handle , wall , etc. ) after you pee .
I got it .
You are straight .
Might as well beat your chest and leave the poor facilities alone .
They did n't challenge your sexuality .
In summary : I 'm a decent guy .
Hi .
It is a Sunday morning and there is still dew on the grass outside Faith Inspirational Missionary Baptist Church .
Already , God has received a standing ovation .
The thermometer on the wall claims it ’s only 75 degrees in here , but congregants are dancing in the aisles , some with their shoes kicked off and stashed under the pews .
Their sweat mixes with their tears , and for once in Compton , they are tears of joy .
“ People of faith ! ” thunders the Rev. Rafer Owens , a native son who is also a veteran Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy .
“ Are you ready to praise the Lord ? ”
Six hundred people respond : “ Ha-roo ! ”
“ Are you ready to take back Compton ? ”
Louder this time : “ Ha - ROO ! ”
“ We disrespected the city of Compton , ” Owens says , more quietly now .
“ And when you do n’t want something , you give it to the rats and the roaches . ”
They ’ve been praying for a long time in Compton , praying hard .
For a long time , it seemed no one was listening .
“ Father God , some people in here are hurting , ” the pastor says , head bowed .
“ They have given what they feel is their last mile . ”
But change , he insists , is afoot .
Takin ’ a life or two
That ’s what the hell I do
By the time the hip - hop group N.W.A released its seminal 1988 album “ Straight Outta Compton , ” with those lyrics , the city ’s fate seemed sealed .
The album was a celebration of the gang life ; killing was described as an inescapable part of life .
The town that many still refer to as “ Old Compton ” -- poor but proud , with an abiding sense of community -- had been ravaged by guns , crack and joblessness .
With just 100,000 people , Compton developed an outsize but deserved reputation as a national epicenter of gang violence .
Today , there are 65 gangs jammed into 10 square miles -- Front Hood Crips and Pirus and Seminoles , bored and broke , jaded and angry , sure that life has little to offer .
The turf for some is no bigger than a football field , and they will defend it against any perceived slight .
That ’s how it ’s been here for almost three decades .
So it came as something of a surprise when the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department , which contracts to provide police services here , added up the community ’s 2008 homicides .
The total for Compton , including smaller , adjacent pockets of unincorporated county land : 38 .
It was the lowest number in at least 25 years and a 50 % drop since 2005 .
From 1985 to 2000 , said Sheriff ’s Capt . William M. Ryan , an average of 66 people were slain each year within the city limits ; that number fell last year to 28 .
Gang - related aggravated assaults have fallen too in the city and the county pockets , nearly 25 % over four years -- “ dramatic indicators , ” Sheriff Lee Baca said at a recent news conference , “ that we are doing the right thing . ”
The sheriff did not mention an irony : Compton , while widely viewed as a success story , is one of the few L.A. - area communities where crime is rising .
Both the city and county of Los Angeles saw declines in major crimes last year ; in Compton , such crimes rose by 13 % in the same period .
However , officials said , most of the increase was in property crimes -- burglary , up 39 % ; larceny , up 27 % .
Authorities attribute that to the bad economy .
A poor community with high unemployment , Ryan said , “ is affected the most . ”
So in a sense , Compton is trading blood in the streets for stolen lawn mowers -- and around here , that ’s a bargain many will live with .
Indeed , there is a palpable sense that the streets are safer .
In a neighborhood called Sunny Cove , residents take a group walk on Mondays now , unthinkable a few years back .
Owens ’ church offers free movies in local parks ; the program started slowly , but 900 people came out for the most recent screening , at Lueders Park off Rosecrans Avenue .
“ People jog .
People walk their dogs .
That ’s different , ” said William Kemp , a business owner who was born and raised in Compton and is running to fill a vacancy on the City Council .
“ Is Compton completely safe ?
No .
But are we safer ?
Absolutely . ”
Satra Zurita and her sister pooled money six years ago to buy a small home on the west side of Compton , in a neighborhood that , like many others , is known by the name of its gang : Nutty Blocc .
Since they moved in , a young man has been killed on the corner and a neighbor shot in the leg during a drive - by .
“ There ’ve been times , ” said Zurita , a local school board member and the daughter of a former City Council member , “ when we ’ve said : ‘ What . . . were we thinking ?’ ”
But she said they now believe they made the right decision .
“ There is a sense of safety that I do n’t think I ’ve ever felt , ” she said .
No , Zurita said , she will not be taking the bars off her windows any time soon .
And everyone here knows the tide could turn again at any moment .
But for now , she hears fewer gunshots outside her house and is only rarely awakened by police helicopters .
It ’s a start ; she ’ll take it .
And those soaring theft rates ?
“ Oh , ” she said , “ people are just stealing to feed their family . ”
Late on a recent night , Det. Joe Sumner , part of the sheriff ’s gang detail , rumbled through the narrow streets in an unmarked cruiser .
Sumner ’s knowledge of Compton gangs is encyclopedic ; put him on any block and he can instantly tell you whose turf you ’re on .
This night , though , many blocks were dark and empty ; they ’ve been that way lately .
Amid a concerted law enforcement push , scores of gang members have been imprisoned , and more have given up and moved away -- to Riverside , Fresno , Las Vegas .
“ There has been so much pressure put on these guys , ” Sumner said .
Suddenly he jerked his car toward the sidewalk and bolted from the car .
Two young men , documented gangsters , raised their hands , almost instinctively .
They knew the drill .
They lifted their shirts to show that they were not hiding guns , then spread their legs and put their hands on the warm hood of Sumner ’s car while he patted them down .
Sumner found no drugs and no weapons .
“ Take off , ” he said .
To the younger man , he added : “ Say hi to your dad . ”
That , officials said , has been the key to combating gang violence : pairing aggressive enforcement with programs designed to improve the relationship between the community and the cops .
It is a stark contrast to the 1980s , when area law enforcement agencies launched a gang crackdown that resembled a military operation , destroying any semblance of a relationship between the agencies and the communities they served .
Since Ryan took command of the Compton station two years ago , the number of Explorer Scouts has risen from eight to 25 , that of station volunteers from 10 to 55 , and reserve deputies from just one previously to eight .
Neighborhood Watch and business watch programs are popping up all over town .
The department runs the Compton Youth Activities League in a former National Guard armory , and about 150 kids come each month for after - school programs .
Almost all have a close relative in prison , officials said , and many have been removed from their families and placed in the foster care system .
The other day , a tutor helped children with homework , while other youngsters played pool with a deputy .
Ricardo Villeda , 14 , said he ’d been coming to the armory to learn boxing for about a week .
He said his mother would have forbidden it in the past because his 20 - minute walk home would have been too dangerous .
Programs are free , including the newest , “ Science Alive , ” designed by a veteran sergeant .
So far , about 160 fifth - graders have graduated , after dissecting pigs ’ hearts and learning about weather systems .
The two participating schools reported that the number of students ranked “ proficient ” in science last year jumped 20 % .
Still , crises arise in Compton that are unthinkable in most communities .
Last year , several students reported being robbed after school and deputies had to step in to calm the situation when scores of fearful kids abruptly stopped going to school .
“ It ’s a tough life , ” said Deputy Alfonso Rodriguez , who runs the youth center .
“ If you give a damn , there is a lot at stake . ”

Bonjour , je suis Olivier , je dirige une entreprise de services informatique à Lille , TPE de 3 salariés , et le client le plus important de mon entreprise est Peugeot .
Mon chiffre d’affaires a augmenté de 35 % lors des six derniers mois .
La Crise ne me touche donc PAS .
J’en ai même profité pour placer de l’argent en Bourse .
Et pourtant , le secteur informatique est touché , Peugeot subit la crise de plein fouet , et le Nord n’est pas particulièrement renommé pour son dynamisme économique .
Mais comment je fais ?
Suivez le guide .
Première étape : Est-ce que la Crise VOUS touche ?
Est-ce que la crise vous affecte matériellement d’une quelconque manière ?
Cette question simple que j’aime poser fait souvent que mes interlocuteurs me regardent avec de grands yeux sans rien dire pendant plusieurs secondes .
Or la majorité des réponses que j’entend après quelques secondes de réflexion c’est “ euh … non . ”
Tout simplement parce que la crise est pour le moment limitée à quelques secteurs , et s’il y a certes un effet de domino , la majorité des personnes ne sont pas affectées du tout .
Enfin si , elles peuvent acheter des actions en Bourse pour des prix dérisoires .
Et le prix de l’essence est revenu à des niveaux décents .
Par contre , presque tout le monde est moralement touché par cette crise à cause du matraquage incessant des médias , qui font même croire à des personnes qui ne sont pas du tout affectées que cela les concerne directement .
Ceci dit la crise existe réellement donc elle peut vous toucher .
Si c’est le cas , passez à l’étape 2 . Sinon passez à l’étape 4 .
Deuxième étape : OK , la Crise VOUS touche .
Est -ce que vous êtes employé ?
Si non , passez à l’étape trois .
Note : Attention , ce passage est conçu comme un électrochoc , il est donc volontairement cynique , c’est à dire mordant et sans pudeur .
Âmes sensibles s’abstenir .
Vous êtes prévenu 🙂 .
Si oui , arrêtez immédiatement .
Si vous êtes employé et que vous êtes touché par la crise et que votre emploi est menacé , vous ne pouvez vous en vouloir qu’à vous -même .
Enfin je veux dire , je comprend que vous voulez passer votre vie à aider à bâtir une structure qui ne vous appartient pas , à suivre des directives avec lesquelles vous n’êtes pas d’accord , à subir le train - train du 9H - 18H , des RTT et des congés maladies , à donner ce que vous avez de plus précieux – votre temps – contre de quoi survivre et acheter cette nouvelle télé 16/9 à écran plat HD avec TNT intégré et lecteur BlueRay sur le coté , mais honnêtement , vous n’avez rien d’autre à faire de votre vie ?
Si vous êtes employé , il y a de forte chance pour que vous n’obteniez en retour de ce que vous donnez qu’une fraction de ce que vous valez réellement .
C’est normal , pour que l’entreprise qui vous emploie reste rentable , il faut qu’elle vous paie moins que ce que vous lui rapportez , pas vrai ?
Mais de votre point de vue à vous , ce n’est pas un marché qui est en votre faveur .
En plus si vous vous retrouvez au chômage à cause de la crise , vous serez jeté sur le bas - coté par une structure dans laquelle vous vous êtes peut - être investi corps et âme , et à qui vous avez tout donné , oui mais , problème , qui n’est pas la vôtre , et qui donc peut être tenté de se débarrasser de vous .
Que voulez - vous , quand les temps sont durs il faut savoir lâcher du lest , c’est comme une mongolfière …
Bref si votre entreprise vous plante à cause de la crise , vous en souffrez alors même que vous avez sacrifié votre liberté contre la manière la moins efficace de gagner de l’argent .
Si vous vous plantez en essayant de créer quelque chose qui vous importe , au moins vous plantez - vous pour quelque chose qui a de la gueule , pas pour avoir été un stupide mouton qui a trimé dur pour obtenir l’approbation de ses chefs et une maigre prime de fin d’année .
Ceci dit , si vous êtes employé et que vous êtes viré à cause de la crise , je vous envie .
Je veux dire , vous avez droit au chômage .
Jusqu’à 2 ans d’indemnités , à être payé à ne rien faire , c’est une extraordinaire opportunité pour faire le point et commencer enfin à bâtir le projet de vos rêves et à réfléchir à des moyens plus intelligents pour gagner de l’argent .
Parce que moi , comme beaucoup de chefs d’entreprise , si demain ma boîte se plante , je n’ai pas le droit aux indemnités chômage .
Rien. Nada .
Donc profitez -en .
Mais surtout ne vous forcez pas , restez employé si vous trouvez l ’idée de devenir votre propre patron trop difficile .
Je veux dire , j’ai besoin de gens comme vous pour construire mes business et créer la vie dont je rêve .
Les employés sont un des moyens les moins chers qu’ont à leur disposition les gens désireux d’être libres et de créer des choses qui en valent la peine .
Vous nous êtes indispensables – et pour un peu je vous ferai même une bise tiens , allez .
Si toutefois vous décidez de vous lancer dans l’aventure et de créer votre entreprise , ou toute autre structure ou projet capable de vous faire gagner de l’argent , essayez de créer un business et pas simplement votre job .
Il y a une vrai différence entre les deux – travailler pour sa boîte contre travailler dans sa boîte – et j’ai mis des années à le comprendre .
Évitez - vous des années d’errance en lisant The E-myth Revisited : Why Most Small Businesses Do n’t Work and What To Do About It .
Et si vous ne lisez pas l’anglais , lisez La Semaine de 4 Heures , ça devrait déjà bien vous retourner le cerveau .
Maintenant que vous avez compris que si la crise vous touche , c’est de votre faute et que donc elle pourrait ne pas vous toucher , passez à l’étape 4 .
Note :
Pour approfondir ce sujet et bien comprendre le fond de ce passage , je vous invite à écouter mon podcast Proactivité , Responsabilisation et Crise .
Troisième étape : Vous avez VOTRE entreprise .
Essayez de la rendre Petite et Agile , pas Grosse et Pesante .
J’ai toujours cru et je crois encore que notre réussite économique personnelle est davantage due à nos efforts personnels qu’à l’environnement économique externe .
Si vous dirigez une petite entité qui n’est pas mono - cliente , il y a de fortes chances pour que sa bonne tenue économique soit bien plus liée aux actions que VOUS faites dedans plutôt qu’à une embellie ou une crise financière ou tout autre facteur extérieur sur lesquels vous n’avez aucune influence .
Quoique d’un point de vue purement égoïste , vous ne serez sans doute pas touché matériellement par la crise si vous êtes patron d’une grosse PME et que celle - ci est directement touchée – mais vous serez sans doute touché moralement .
On a beau dire , la plupart d’entre nous n’aimons pas licencier , même si c’est pour sauver d’autres emplois .
Avec une petite entreprise agile et rapide aux changements , vous pouvez louvoyer entre les récifs et saisir toutes les opportunités qui s’offrent à vous , en permanence , peu importe le contexte .
D’ailleurs souvent une crise est une période très riche en opportunités que les optimistes et les malins saisissent pendant que les autres passent leur temps à se plaindre et à avoir peur .
Donc si vous avez une petite entreprise , ayez cette démarche optimiste et soyez à l’affût des opportunités pendant que vos concurrents se plaignent et se plantent .
Avec un peu de chance , ils géreront mal leur trésorerie et vous pourrez les racheter pour pas cher , ou ils déposeront le bilan et vous pourrez récupérer leurs meilleurs éléments – et leurs clients .
Peugeot a vu ses ventes diminuer de 8.7 % en 2008 .
De nombreux salariés sont au chômage technique , des usines sont en pleine restructuration .
J’ai décroché quatre gros contrats fin 2008 avec différentes filiales Françaises , alors même que les consignes sont de serrer les vis et de réduire les coûts au maximum .
Pourquoi ?
Parce que :
Je suis une goutte d’eau dans leur océan .
Mais une de leur goutte c’est une rivière de bon calibre pour moi .
pour moi .
Je leur apporte des outils et des méthodes pour améliorer leur productivité et réduire leurs coûts .
et réduire leurs coûts .
Je fais donc partie de leur solution plutôt que de leur problème .
Que ce soit en plein milieu d’une crise ou en plein boom économique , si vous faites parti des solutions de vos clients et pas de leurs problèmes , vous avez peu de choses à craindre et beaucoup à gagner .
Pour cela il faut :
Un bon positionnement stratégique .
Les secteurs qui sautent en premier lors d’une crise sont généralement ceux qui sont considérés comme du luxe , du confort ou du gadget .
Si vous faites partie d’un de ces secteurs , vous faites partie du problème et pas de la solution .
.
Les secteurs qui sautent en premier lors d’une crise sont généralement ceux qui sont considérés comme du luxe , du confort ou du gadget .
Si vous faites partie d’un de ces secteurs , vous faites partie du problème et pas de la solution .
Un état d’esprit optimiste et positif qui vous fait adopter une démarche proactive qui se concentre sur les chose sur lesquelles vous avez une réelle influence .
Pendant que les autres se plaignent et attendent une aide du gouvernement ou du ciel , vous êtes conscient des opportunités qui passent près de vous et vous les saisissez .
Vous définissez un plan d’action .
Vous agissez .
Ainsi , plutôt que de me dire “ Ahlala , c’est la crise , Peugeot se casse la gueule , moi qui voulait leur proposer des produits , tant pis je n’ai plus qu’à attendre l’année prochaine ou 2010 , de toute façon ce n’est pas ma faute , c’est la faute à la crise ” , j’ai foncé et ait présenté mes produits et notre expertise comme des moyens d’agir pour contrebalancer la crise actuelle , ce qui est le cas , et le message a été reçu 5 sur 5 .
Donc si vous avez une entreprise et êtes touché par la crise , arr êtez de vous plaindre .
Agissez .
Je vois certains de mes clients chefs d’entreprise ou dirigeants mettre sur le dos de la crise des maux qui n’ont rien à y voir .
C’est si commode de reporter le problème sur quelque chose que tout le monde craint plutôt que de se remettre en cause .
Ne faites pas comme eux .

Quatrième étape : La Crise ne vous touche PAS matériellement .
Donc
Elle ne devrait PAS porter un coup à votre Moral .
Remède : Faites Une Diète Médiatique .
Cela fait environ 9 mois que j’ai lu La Semaine de 4
Heures et je pratique activement depuis une diète médiatique , qui est une des choses les plus extraordinaires que j’ai fait de ma vie en terme de coût et temps passé sur ce que ça rapporte .
Je ne lis plus de journaux , n’écoute plus la radio , ne regarde pas le JT – tout comme la télé d’ailleurs – ne lis plus les news sur Internet , je me suis coupé des bruits parasites du monde pour mieux me concentrer sur le silence de mon âme .
A présent je ne subis plus de manière réactive le déluge d’informations qui me parvient du monde , je le choisi avec discernement , en ne lisant que les sites et blogs qui m’intéressent , en choisissant avec beaucoup de parcimonie les sites d’informations spécialisés que je consulte , en écoutant des podcasts préalablement soigneusement sélectionnés pendant mes trajets .
Et en lisant des livres exceptionnels qui m’apportent beaucoup – et qui je l’espère vous apporte un peu à travers mes résumés .
Car ne confondez pas le fait de se goinfrer d’informations avec le fait de se cultiver .
Ou d’être au courant de ce qui se passe avec l’éducation .
C’est comme si vous compariez
avec
Avec le premier , vous vous goinfrez de choses malsaines et non nourrissantes pour votre esprit , qui ne feront que l’encombrer un temps en vous causant des dommages , tandis qu’avec le deuxième vous vous nourrissez de choses choisies avec discernement et qui vous font grandir intellectuellement .
Car les news et les informations , c’est en général 80 % de choses qui ne vous affectent en rien , dont vous ne vous souciez absolument pas au fond de vous -même , et que vous aurez oublié au bout de deux semaines .
Et qui pourtant auront transités par votre cerveau , sans aucun autre objectif que celui de l’occuper un peu à tourner à vide pour des sujets sur lesquels vous n’avez aucune influence .
Et en plus , vous vous ferez sévèrement influencer par les médias d’une manière que vous n’imaginez même pas .
Moi je le vois , puisque je ne subi pas son influence , ou juste par ricochet .
Les sujets de conversation sont en grande partie faits et défaits par ce que les médias vous ont demandés de penser ou de dire .
Mais alors je vis dans ma bulle ?
En partie oui .
Il y a énormément de choses dont je ne suis pas au courant , et ça me va très bien .
En général ce sont les choses insignifiantes qui n’ont aucun intérêt .
Je veux dire , elles peuvent être terriblement importantes pour ceux qui les vivent , mais pour moi elles ne signifient rien et je ne peux pas agir dessus , que j’en sois informé ou non .
Je décide donc de ne pas en être informé .
Je préfère être davantage conscient de moi , de mes objectifs , de mon environnement immédiat , des choses qui se passent près , tout près , que de celles qui se déroulent à des milliers de kilomètres .
Une Diète Médiatique fonctionne comme un filtre automatique : les nouvelles les plus importantes vous sont rapportées par les personnes que vous côtoyez toute la journée , ce qui élimine d’office les 90 % de nouvelles sans intérêt .
Ma pratique de la Diète Médiatique est selon moi une des pierres angulaires de mon optimisme et de ma faculté d’être proactif dans cette période “ troublée ” .
J’ai vu arriver la crise dans les conversations , dans les mines inquiètes , dans les blogs que je lis régulièrement , avec un train de retard sur tout le monde .
Et pendant ce temps là je regardai autour de moi et je me disai : “ la plupart des personnes ne semblent pas du tout affectées matériellement , mais ils ont la plupart un coup au moral , ils broient du noir , voient l’avenir sous un jour sombre , ne cessent de se plaindre ” .
La Diète Médiatique m’a permit de garder la tête froide .
Et comme je sélectionne avec soin mes sources d’informations , j’ai découvert de nombreuses manières de tirer partie de cette crise .
C’est une période formidable et pleine d’opportunités .
Une Diète Médiatique a ainsi de nombreux avantages :
Elle évite de vous encombrer l’esprit avec des choses inutiles
avec des choses inutiles Elle diminue ainsi votre stress
Elle vous permet d’être moins influencé par les médias
par les médias
Elle vous fait gagner un temps fou , ce qui vous permet de vous concentrer sur ce qui vous importe vraiment
Et au delà de ces avantages , il y en a un autre à ne pas être un mouton pendant une crise :
Cinquième étape : Une Crise s’entretient tout seule : c’est une Prophétie Auto - Réalisatrice .
Si Vous n’êtes pas Touché Matériellement , mais que vous agissez comme si , vous CONTRIBUEZ à entretenir la crise par votre comportement défensif .
Arrêtez et dites - vous “ La Crise Ne Passera Pas Par Moi ” .
Vous ferez un bien immense à tous ceux qui sont autour de vous – proches , commerçants , employés , entreprises .
De nombreuses personnes agissent comme si elles étaient affectées par la crise et restreignent leurs achats et leurs investissements , même si concrètement elles ne sont pas touchées .
Il est normal de vouloir être économe et de dépenser judicieusement son argent .
Mais le faire par crainte d’un lendemain hypothétiquement noir , c’est stupide .
Je ne dis pas qu’il ne faut pas prendre quelques précautions et ne pas anticiper un minimum l’avenir .
Je dis que votre comportement ne doit pas être affecté négativement par une crise , aussi importante soit - elle .
Prendre des précautions et anticiper un minimum , cela se fait de tout temps .
Si vous agissez pendant la crise , il est souvent déjà trop tard .
Ainsi , vous devriez toujours avoir un fond d’urgence de 3 à 6 mois , ce qui vous évite en cas de coup dur de vendre vos possessions ou vos actions en bourse au plus mauvais moment .
Si vous anticipez vraiment l’avenir , vous disposez , quand une crise survient , d’une réserve confortable et de liquidités qui vous permettent d’en tirer partie .
Cela peut faire la différence entre le gagnant et le perdant .
Et ceux qui sont vraiment prévoyants continuent à dépenser pendant une crise comme ils dépensaient avant , tirant même souvent parti d’une hausse de leur pouvoir d’achats liés à la baisse des prix – comme celui de l’essence – et contribuant ainsi à alimenter le tissu économique local et enrayant la crise .
Si la crise ne vous touche pas matériellement , faites en sorte qu’elle ne passe pas par vous .
Ne modifiez pas vos comportements d’achats , sauf pour ce qui touche aux opportunités ( voir plus bas ) .
Enrayez - la .
Ainsi en accomplissant quelque chose qui peut sembler égoïste – en pratiquant une diète médiatique et en vous étant assuré de disposer de réserves et de liquidités suffisantes vous permettant de profiter des opportunités de la crise – vous pouvez contribuer de manière intelligente et plaisante , modestement , à jouer un rôle positif dans un contexte négatif .
C’est souvent le seul moyen d’action que vous aurez pour améliorer les choses .
Sixième étape : Tirez partie des opportunités de la Crise : Quelques pistes .
Une crise est donc pleine d’opportunités .
Voici quelques pistes pour en tirer partie :
Si vous vous retrouvez au chômage , bravo !
Vous avez une chance inespérée pour réfléchir à votre vie et commencer à créer quelque chose qui vous importe .
Ne la laissez pas passer .
Vous pouvez par exemple racheter une entreprise ( voir plus bas ) .
pour réfléchir à votre vie et commencer à créer quelque chose qui vous importe .
Ne la laissez pas passer .
Vous pouvez par exemple racheter une entreprise ( voir plus bas ) .
Si vous avez une entreprise , soyez à l’affût .
Et faites partie de la solution de vos clients , pas de leurs problèmes .
de vos clients , pas de leurs problèmes .
Pendant une crise , de nombreuses entreprises déposent le bilan pour un simple problème de trésorerie , parce qu’elles sont mal gérées .
Ce qui ne remet aucunement en cause leur rentabilité intrinsèque .
Les tribunaux de commerce regorgent d’entreprises en faillite à racheter pour une bouchée de pain pour peu que vous proposiez un plan de sauvegarde des emplois minimal .
Ces entreprises se vendront que vous soyez dans la salle à ce moment ou non .
Soyez là .

Ces entreprises se vendront que vous soyez dans la salle à ce moment ou non .
Soyez là .
Le très faible niveau de la Bourse fait que c’est le moment idéal pour investir .
De nombreuses entreprises sont sous - évaluées à cause de l’influence qu’ont les médias sur les boursicoteurs et investisseurs , qui préfèrent vendre leurs actions en se basant sur leur peur plutôt que sur une réflexion poussée .
Ces entreprises sont pour la plupart parfaitement saines .
Leurs actions devraient remonter en flèche une fois la crise passée .
Si comme moi vous ne voulez pas passer trop de temps en bourse , n’avez pas les connaissances nécessaires pour vous y plonger et voulez minimiser les risques , investissez dans fonds indiciels qui reproduisent fidèlement le CAC40 ou tout autre indice boursier .
Le CAC est aujourd ’hui sous les 3 000 points .
Je parie que d’ici 2 ans il sera au dessus de 5000 .
Et même si ce n’est pas vrai , le CAC a gagné en moyenne 10 % par an depuis sa création .
Bien mieux que votre livret A… Lisez cet excellent article de Jean - Jacques Hénin pour le comprendre , et d’autres comme Pourquoi les fonds indexés vous rapportent autant ? , Dénichez les fonds indiciels de votre assurance - vie ou Gagnez encore plus avec vos fonds indiciels .

Dans quelques mois , ce sera le moment d’investir dans l’immobilier , qui a déjà connu une forte baisse qui semble pour le moment continuer inexorablement …
Mon petit doigt me dit que ce n’est que le début .
Bon moi j’ai acheté fin 2007 , donc au plus fort de la hausse , mais j’ai quand même fait une affaire .
Soyez à l’affût de la vôtre .
Et , enfin , cessez de vous plaindre .
Bordel .
Arrêtez de voir des obstacles .
Voyez tout au plus des contraintes .
C’est toute la différence entre la réactivité et la proactivité .
Entre l’esclavage et la liberté .
Entre une prison mentale et un horizon sans limite .
Entre une vie subie et une vie choisie .

Like a negative image of farmers breeding progressively larger chickens and cows , human hunters are making their prey become progressively smaller .
Animals hunted by humans are evolving faster than any other animals of their kind in the wild , according to a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists .
By killing big percentages of the largest , sexually mature big - horn sheep or cod , humans can apply a withering selective pressure on huge numbers of animals .
But it 's not just that overall harvested animal numbers are shrinking — it's that the individuals themselves are shrinking , too , losing an average of 20 percent of their mass over mere decades .
" You 've changed the very essence of what they are and what they can do reproductively , " said ecologist Chris Darimont of the University of California , Santa Cruz , lead author of the paper .
Evolution does n't always move slowly .
Biologists have found a growing number of wild examples of rapid evolution , such as the increasing resistance of bacteria .
Animal breeding programs have also shown that when humans try , they can alter the size of their animals in just a few generations .
One turkey breeding program we covered last year increased the average size of a turkey variety 18 pounds , or 85 percent , over the last 40 years or so .
Taken together , it is becoming clear that human behavior can exert incredible evolutionary pressure , generating genetic differences over years that might have taken natural selection millennia to produce .
The paper 's findings make sense , given what we know about the occasional speediness of evolution , said Steve Palumbi , a Stanford ecologist and author of the book , The Evolution Explosion : How Humans Cause Rapid Evolutionary Change .
" We 've known for a long time we 've been accelerating the rate of evolution for little things — bacteria , insects , etc .
But this paper is about big things — big -horn sheep and fished populations , " Palumbi said .
" That raises the bar . "
Natural experiments , like those conducted by co-author Thomas Reimchen at the University of Victoria , have also shown that predator - prey relationships specifically can drive rapid changes in the hunted .
Reimchen's work focused on the massive variations of a single species of stickleback fish within a set of 200 isolated lakes that formed a mere 10,000 years ago .
" You have the most amazing differences in body form , especially with defensive traits , and it matches really well with what predators are in the particular lake , " Darimont said .
By comparing the data from dozens of previous studies on fast evolutionary change that was induced naturally as with the stickleback , by human pollution or invasive species introduction , or by hunting , Darimont 's team found that the highly specific nature of hunting drove never - before - seen changes in animal size and shape .
" From a purely evolutionary perspective , we 're excited in that we did n't know before that organisms of this type were capable of changing this quickly , " Darimont said .
" Human predators awoke the latent ability of organisms to change very , very rapidly .
In that context , as a purely scientific evolutionary gee - whiz thing , it 's pretty cool .
But the impacts are huge . "
Those impacts are particularly fraught in populations harvested commercially , like many species of fish .
" The fact is that you and I can observe that these salmon are much smaller .
And so can the whole food web , " Darimont said .
" Size is really , really important in nature in determining how species interact .
If there is one [ species ] that has changed dramatically in size , its relationship to natural predators could be lost . "
Beyond the size changes , many species are reproducing an average of 25 percent earlier , too .
" As a consequence of targeting large adults , we 're targeting reproductive age adults , so those that have genes that say , ' I 'm going to reproduce early ' have an evolutionary advantage , " Darimont explained .
" They can have their babies before they enter our rifle scopes or gill nets . "
The problem is that these younger mothers do n't produce as many babies , which could have major impacts on how humans estimate fishery population and potential .
A small change in the age of a fish when it reproduces can change the number of babies it produces by up to an order of magnitude .
" The shift to breeding at younger ages and smaller sizes has a disproportionate effect on how fecund those individuals are , " Darimont said .
However , while the work convincingly shows harvested animals that are smaller behave differently , it does n't explain the mechanisms behind those changes ,
Stanford 's Palumbi said .
Scientists are n't sure whether the new smaller sizes , for example , reflect modifications in the actual genetic code or whether a more subtle type of adaptation — known as plasticity or simply acclimation — accounts for the differences .
Under the second mechanism , the animals would retain their genes but use them differently to adjust to new environmental circumstances .
Either mechanism , or likely some combination of the mechanisms , could account for the variation .
A 2003 study on red squirrels in the Yukon
(.pdf ) found that actual genetic changes in response to global warming accounted for about 15 percent of the shift in the red squirrel 's reproductive behaviors .
The amount of the shift that is actually genetic is important , Palumbi said , because even if you could stop hunters and fishermen from pressuring the population , genetically altered animals would have to re-evolve their previous phenotypes , or forms .
" If it was acclimation , then the individuals who were in the population could just change back .
You would n't need the whole evolutionary process to happen , " he said .
" The phenotypic plasticity would be an easier thing to recover from . "
Both Darimont and Palumbi agreed , though , that from an ecological management standpoint , whether the animals changed because of their genes or how they used them , the same human behaviors would be required to restore a more natural order to the ecosystem .
" In the context of what we refer to as phenotypic restoration — the idea of restoring old phenotypes — ideally , you could impose moratoria , close fishing or hunting in areas , or you could much more closely mimic natural predators , " Darimont said .
That would mean taking younger fish or animals , not the full - grown adults that humans , and the machines that process our food , prefer .
" Most natural predators like to eat the newly born or the almost dead , " Darimont said .
" Predators focus on babies . "
In many states , younger animals are actually protected from hunting and fishing , requiring their release while older animals are fair game .
" A lot of the harvesting regulations say that if you catch a small salmon , you have to put it back because those are future breeders , "
said Darimont .
" In the context of evolutionary management , it has a perverse effect . "
Darimont said what he called " evolutionarily enlightened " fishing and hunting management was slowly taking hold , as the realization has sunk in that the sheer number of fish in the pond is n't the only important metric for the system .
" Harvest managers often do n’t recognize differences among individuals .
That 's where evolutionary biologists start , " Darimont said .
" There 's an incredible amount of diversity among individuals , and this matters because they might differ in how many babies they have and what they look like , and that sets in motion a whole bunch of things . "

I love Python , but a few things still bug me about it .
I ’ve bashed on several other technologies ; here ’s some Python bashing .
In no particular order :
Update :
This has started a pretty good discussion on Reddit .
Many people correctly guessed that I ’m using singleton in the mathematical sense , not in the sense of the programming pattern .
The comments from Cairnarvon and tghw are particularly worth reading .
Years after passing a groundbreaking law aimed at bringing San Francisco 's pot clubs under government control and giving patients safe access to medical marijuana , the city is finally regulating those businesses , which for years operated with little oversight .
The Board of Supervisors approved legislation requiring medical cannabis clubs to get city permits in late 2005 .
But initiating the law has been a complicated and controversial process .
More than three years later , the city has issued 10 permits to cannabis clubs , and 13 more are in the pipeline , according to the Department of Public Health .
There are now 23 clubs in the city , officials said , as compared to more than 40 when the process began in 2005 ; five applications have been rejected and many others clubs apparently closed without bothering to apply for a permit .
A number of medical marijuana advocates , who had concerns when the legislation was introduced , recently praised the program , though they added that it is still a work in progress .
The program has admittedly taken far longer to get started than city officials initially envisioned .
The deadline for existing clubs to secure the permits was last Tuesday , a date that was already extended twice over the past three years .
Acknowledging how difficult it has been for clubs to secure the permits , the Department of Public Health announced on Jan. 16 that some clubs could apply for temporary permits .
And freshman Supervisor David Campos is working with patient advocates and other city officials to craft new legislation that will aim to work out any remaining kinks in the regulatory process .
" It 's taken a long time , " said Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , who wrote the original legislation and agreed the process could still be refined .
" But the regulations are working . "
Most of the delays , according to pot club owners , stem from zoning rules , a requirement that the clubs be handicap - accessible and the fact that four city agencies are involved in the process .
To receive a permit , the clubs have pay a $ 7,000 fee to the Department of Public Health and then gain approval from the Planning Department , the mayor 's Office on Disability and the Building Department .
" The process is difficult - that 's why less than half of the clubs have completed it , " said Charlie Pappas , who owns Health and Wellness Alternatives at 935 Howard St . " But I really give city officials and staff credit for trying to make it work and not dragging their feet . "
Pappas , who is in a wheelchair , has ironically not yet received his permit because of accessibility issues .
He expects to get the permit within two months , he said .
Those sorts of problems are not unique , said attorney Patrick Goggin , who represents two other cannabis clubs .
Goggin said the biggest hurdles for club owners has been the cost of upgrades and the fact that the easiest solution to the disability - access problems - moving to another building - forces owners to start the permitting process all over .
Goggin said one of his clients , the Vapor Room on Haight Street , had to move next door because its original space was not properly zoned .
After the move , the Vapor Room still had to spend more than $ 100,000 making the necessary building improvements .
" In theory what the city has done with the regulations is great , and I think it surpasses any other city or county regulations in the state , " he said .
" But in addition to it being a complex system , numerous agencies have jurisdiction - one of our clients has had their permit lost numerous times . "
The original law was proposed as the city 's number of pot clubs exploded , from nine to more than 40 over a five - year period .
The law grew out of concern that the clubs were operating with no oversight , often near schools and recreation sites , and were attracting criminal activities such as street drug dealing .
In addition to the permitting process , which includes public hearings , the law established rules for who can run the clubs and restricts their locations to commercial and industrial areas and places more than 1,000 feet from schools or youth facilities .
The city stepped in because while medical marijuana is legal under state law , it is illegal in the eyes of the federal government .
Officials in San Francisco - whose elected leaders generally support medical cannabis - have had to weigh the need for regulation with the concern that any paper trail will make it easier for the federal government to prosecute club owners and medical marijuana users .
The federal government has continued to go after cannabis clubs , in late 2007 threatening landlords who rent to the businesses with criminal prosecution .
In response , the state attorney general issued a set of guidelines last year for medical marijuana clubs , including that they operate as nonprofits .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has proposed legislation to require that the clubs operate as nonprofits .
While many medical marijuana advocates support the nonprofit requirement , Goggin and others said that it , combined with the cost associated with getting city permits , have resulted in a de facto moratorium on clubs .
Others , however , said that the shuttering of some clubs means that the system is working .
Patient advocate Shona Gochenaur said the permitting process and nonprofit requirement have pushed some clubs out of business .
Those were generally dispensaries focused on making money , not providing safe access to patients , she said .
" There were bad players and those things discouraged them and that 's good , " Gochenaur said .
" We want to show the rest of the nation that there are good players and that the safe - access system can work . "
A few days ago , there was an interesting post by Rafael Gustavo da Cunha Pereira Pinto , dated “ Mon , 5 Jan 2009 09:08:37 - 0200 , ” on the Haskell - beginners mailing list on the Haskell programming language , referencing a monad tutorial for the O’Caml programming language that provided an alternative perspective in helping to illustrate monads in Haskell , mentioned in the thread “ Yet Another Monad Tutorial . ”
In my response , I introduced an alternative monad tutorial for the Qi programming language , which also referenced Haskell .
Since the O’Caml monad tutorial mentioned design patterns as an alternative to category theory in forming a basis for describing monads , this reminded me of the book How to Design Programs , by Felleisen , Findler , Flatt , and Krishnamurthi , on Scheme , which led to a mention of Typed Scheme , which in turn led to a mention of Qi .
In turn , this led to a cross- language comparison of monad definitions in Haskell , O’Caml , and Qi , and their implications .
Hereinafter I have quoted parts of my response for reference ( with minor edits to hyperlink various keywords , as opposed to leaving the link URL ’s separate from their references ) :
The focus on design patterns brings to
mind the book How to Design Programs , by
Felleisen , Findler , Flatt , and Krishnamurthi , on Scheme , and the
recent dialect of Typed Scheme , as well as the
language Qi .
There is a somewhat similar tutorial on monads using Qi ( see
“ Programming Kung Fu Qi : Monads in Qi ” ) .
For reference , I shall use the Haskell - based monad tutorial “ All About
Monads ” as a base for one of the Haskell versions of the examples .
Most of my
descriptions of the Haskell version will be borrowed from the
descriptions contained in the section there entitled “ Meet the Monads ” .
Let ’s compare the Haskell version with the O’Caml version and a
hypothetical pure Scheme version :
Haskell version of monad rules ( borrowed from the Qi-based tutorial ) :
> class Monad m where
> return :: a -> m a
> (>>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
O’Caml version of monad rules ( borrowed from the O’Caml - based
tutorial ) :
> module type MonadRequirements = sig
> type ‘a t
> val bind : ‘a t -> ( ’a -> ‘b t ) -> ‘b t
> val return : ‘ a -> ‘a t
>end ; ;
Hypothetical pure Scheme version of monad rules ( borrowed from the
Qi-based tutorial ) :
> ( pipe ( lift x ) f ) = ( f x )
> ( pipe m lift ) = m
> ( pipe ( pipe m f ) g ) = ( pipe m ( lambda ( x ) ( pipe ( f x ) g ) )
The Haskell version is the most concise .
The “ return ” and “ ( >>= ) ”
( “ bind ” ) operations in Haskell correspond to the “ return ” and “ bind ”
operations in the O’Caml version , and to the “ lift ” and “ pipe ”
operations in the hypothetical pure Scheme version .
In the Haskell version , “ m ” is the type constructor , “ return ” is an
operation that creates a value of the monad type “ m a , ” while “ ( > >= ) ”
( a.k.a. “ bind ” ) is an operation that combines a value of that type “ m
a ” with a computation that produces values of that type to produce a
new computation for values of that type “ ( a -> m b ) -> m b . ”
Superficially , so far , the three versions seem fairly equivalent .
Now for examples of list monads :
Haskell version ( adapted from combining the Haskell - based and the
Qi-based tutorials ) :
> instance Monad [ ] where
> l >>= f = concatMap f l
> [ ] >>= f = [ ]
> return x = [ x ]
O’Caml version ( borrowed from the O’Caml - based tutorial ) :
> module ListMonad = struct
> type ‘a t = ‘ a list ; ;
>
> let bind lst f = List.concat ( List.map f lst ) ; ;
>
> let return x = [ x ] ; ;
>end ; ;
Qi version ( borrowed from the Qi-based tutorial ) :
>( define bind
> [ ] _ -> [ ]
> [ X | Xs ] F -> ( append ( F X ) ( bind Xs F ) ) )
>
>( define return
> X -> [ X ] )
Here we start to see some differences .
In the Haskell version , “ return ” simply creates a singleton list
( “ [ x ] ” ) , while “ ( >>= ) ” ( i.e. , “ bind ” ) either returns a blank list “ [ ] ”
in the case of a blank list , or otherwise creates a new list
containing the results of applying the function to all of the values
in the original list “ concatMap f l . ”
In the O’Caml version , notice the “ List.concat ” operation .
After the
List.map operation , we are left with not a “ ‘ a list ” , but instead
with a “ ‘ a list list ” , so this is necessary to obtain the correct
type “ ‘a list . ”
Otherwise , the reasoning is similar .
In the Qi version , we have split the monad into two functions : “ bind ”
and “ return . ”
Splitting a large function into a smaller functions is
typical Scheme style .
Here , “ return ” simply pattern - matches an
element into a list containing that element , while “ bind ” either
pattern - matches an empty list “ [ ] ” followed by anything “ _ ” to an
empty list “ [ ] , ” or pattern - matches a list consisting of a car and a
cdr “ [ X | Xs ] , ” followed by a function “ F , ” to “ F ” applied to “ X , ”
which is “ ( F X ) , ” appended to a binding of the cdr of the list “ Xs ” to
the function “ F . ”
It seems that studying the Qi version may shed some insight into the
Haskell version by approaching it from a different perspective .
This
may also be true of the O’Caml version , but personally , I think that
the splitting of the monad into separate functions for “ bind ” and
“ return ” in the Qi version helps to differentiate it from the other
two versions , and hence offers additional insight into the nature of
the monad .
It may also be said that the use of both “ List.map ” and “ List.concat ”
in the O’Caml version offers similar insight .
Now for a pet peeve that I have with one of the examples in the O’Caml
monad tutorial :
> module SerialMonad = struct
> type ‘a t = unit -> ‘a ; ;
> let serial_mutex = Mutex.create ( ) ; ;
> let return x = ( fun ( ) -> x ) ; ;
> let bind m g = ( fun ( ) -> ( g ( m ( ) ) ) ( ) ) ; ;
> let access m =
> Mutex.lock serial_mutex ;
> try
> let r = m () in
> Mutex.unlock serial_mutex ;
> r
> with
> | e ->
> begin
> Mutex.unlock serial_mutex ;
> raise e
> end
>end ; ;
>
> This monad is basically identical to the previous FunMonad with the addition of the access function - which executes the
> process while holding the serial_mutex lock , which is always unlocked when the process completes ( even if the process
> throws an exception ) .
This forces all processes executing within a SerialMonad to be executed sequentially and serially
>( thus the name ) .
While a clear example , one problem that I have with this approach is
that the emphasis on forcing “ all processes executing within a
SerialMonad to be executed sequentially and serially ” reminds me of
the Imperative Way .
This brings to mind a posting by Paul Hudak on
Haskell - Cafe , entitled “ a regressive view of support for imperative
programming in Haskell , ” dated “ Wed Aug 8 14:20:39 EDT 2007 ” ,
in which he writes as follows :

Although I greatly applaud alternative perspectives in learning
Haskell , I am somewhat suspicious of the emphasis on a
quasi - imperative approach .
One of the factors that initially
attracted me to Haskell in the first place was the emphasis on a
functional style .
In particular , purely functional code has a number
of advantages , including easier reasoning about program behavior ,
easier formulation of proofs of correctness , and referential
transparency .
Together with referential transparency comes
applicativity of formal methods of program analysis .
All this is lost
once the Functional Way is replaced by the Imperative Way .
Here , the Qi-based monad tutorial seems to focus more on examples that
use the functional approach , but perhaps this is just my opinion .
Comparative programming languages can be a very interesting topic .
If
anybody knows of any alternative monad tutorials in other functional
programming languages that could help to shed light on monads , please
feel free to mention them in this thread .

Introduction HtmlCleaner is an open source HTML parser written in Java .
HTML found on the Web is usually dirty , ill - formed and unsuitable for further processing .
For any serious consumption of such documents , it is necessary to first clean up the mess and bring some order to the tags , attributes and ordinary text .
For any given HTML document , HtmlCleaner reorders individual elements and produces well - formed XML .
By default , it follows similar rules that the most of web browsers use in order to create the Document Object Model .
However , you can provide custom tag and rule sets for tag filtering and balancing .

How does it work ?
Here is a typical example - improperly structured HTML containing unclosed tags and missing quotes : < table id =table1 cellspacing =2px < h1 > CONTENT </h1 > < td > < a href =index.html > 1 -> Home Page </a > < td > < a href =intro.html > 2 -> Introduction </a >
After putting it through HtmlCleaner , XML similar to the following is coming out : <?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < html > < head /> < body > < h1 > CONTENT </h1 > < table id = " table1 " cellspacing = " 2 px " > < tbody > < tr > < td > < a href = " index.html " > 1 - > Home Page </a > </td > < td > < a href = " intro.html " > 2 - > Introduction </a > </td > </tr > </tbody > </ table > </ body > </ html >
HtmlCleaner can be used in java code , as command line tool or as Ant task .
It is designed to be small , independent ( no runtime dependencies except JRE 1.5 + ) , fast and flexible ( its behavior is configurable through number of parameters ) .
Although the main motive was to prepare ordinary HTML for XML processing with XPath , XQuery and XSLT , structured data produced by HtmlCleaner may be consumed and handled in manu other ways .
Features Summary HtmlCleaner parses input HTML and generates tree - structure suitable for programmatic manipulation .
Serializers are responsible for outputting the DOM structure to XML , HTML , DOM or JDom .
Parsing phase relies on tag descriptions which can be customized by the user .
HtmlClaner 's behaviour can be configured through number of parameters .
HtmlClaner is thread safe , meaning that single instance can clean multiple html sources at the same time .
HtmlClaner can be used from Java code , from command line or as Ant task .
HtmlClaner requires JRE 1.5+.
Greg Hardesty did n’t LOL when he got his teen daughter ’s cellphone statement .
All he could think was “ OMG ! ”
PHOTOS : Text - Crazed Teen
The California man ’s 13 - year - old daughter , Reina , racked up an astonishing 14,528 text messages in one month .
The online AT&T statement ran 440 pages .
“ First , I laughed .
I thought , ‘ That ’s insane , that ’s impossible , ’ ” the 45 - year - old dad said .
“ And I immediately whipped out the calculator to see if it was humanly possible . ”
He found it was – barely .
It works out to 484 text messages a day , or one every two minutes of every waking hour .
“ Then I thought maybe AT&T made some mistake on the bill , ” said Hardesty , of Silverado Canyon .
The reporter for the Orange County Register grilled his daughter on her texting habit – by text message , of course .
“ Who are you texting , anyway ?
Your entire school ? ” he asked .
“ Well , a lot of my friends have unlimited texting .
I just text them pretty much all the time , ” she explained .
She messages a core of “ four obsessive texters ” – all girls between the ages of 12 and 13 – on her LG phone .
Reina had a karaoke birthday party , and while other people were singing , she was texting her best friend sitting right next to her .
She even texted her friends to brag about the high number of text messages she had logged when her parents got the statement .
Her texting soared last month because “ it was winter break and I was bored , ” Reina told her parents .
Luckily , Hardesty has a phone plan that allows unlimited texting for $ 30 a month .
Otherwise , he estimates , he would have owed AT&T $ 2,905.60 at a rate of 20 cents per message .
The average number of monthly texts for a 13 - to 17 - year - old teen is 1,742 , according to a Nielsen study of cellphone usage .
Hardesty admits he himself punches in 900 messages a month – 700 more than average for his age group , according to Nielsen .
Hardesty and his ex-wife have since placed restrictions on Reina ’s cellphone use , ruling she cannot text after dinner .

Palleroni , along with the University of Texas at Austin students , developed the idea to build secondary units ( or " granny flats " ) in the vacant alley space of these neighborhoods that can be rented out , serving as a secondary source of income .
With added income , the residents can stay in East Austin and keep their homes , their families and way of life intact .
With 800 units in development , Palleroni is working closely with residents , local leaders , community organizations and state government to build sustainably -- using natural ventilation , natural light , ecological finishes , and local materials -- and to become " environmental citizens . "
Architect and activist Sergio Palleroni rolls up his sleeves , quite literally , and dives deep into the problem of regions wrought with inadequate housing .
Applying a grant from the Luce Foundation , Palleroni chose to explore the community - partnership approach in two projects : East Austin , Texas and Valle del Yaqui in the Sonoran Desert , Mexico .
BEGIN e2 INTRODUCTION
BRAD PITT :
They use 40 % of the world 's energy , emit 50 % of its greenhouse gases .
" They " are not the cars we drive .
" They " are the buildings where we work , live , and grow .
Buildings designed with an unconscious disregard for nature .
Adopting sustainable alternatives is not only a matter of progress , it 's a matter of survival .
Design : e2 , the economies of being environmentally conscious .
TITLE : e2 , THE ECONOMICS OF BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS
BEGIN EPISODE
BRAD PITT :
For the majority of the world 's population , what does green design mean ?
Is it just a luxury ?
Unattainable and elitist ?
Or can smart design work for the greater good ?
Can it strengthen communities ?..
Allow for health care ?
Help provide sufficient food , and adequate water supplies ?
Should design , after all , have a greater purpose ?
CAMERON SINCLAIR :
Right now there 's a split in the design profession .
And it 's the idea that design is about aesthetics and the idea that design can be about ethics .
MICHAEL MCDONOUGH :
For a whole school of architects , there is the social mission that has to deal with people in difficult circumstances , people in the developing world .
This is the sort of architectural equivalent of Doctors Without Borders .
STEVEN MOORE :
In the end , it 's not so important what we think because that just takes place , you know , between your temples , right ?
What really does matter however is what it is that we can figure out that we can do together .
CAMERON SINCLAIR :
If you think about 1 in 7 people are currently in what we call inadequate housing , informal settlements , slums , refugees , internally displaced camps .
1 in 7 people in the world .
In 30 years , it 's gonna be 1 in 3 .
So , we have this new global baby boom happening that are the poorest of the poor and that is going to affect the environment far more than driving a Hummer around .
And I think although it 's important that the United States and the West show an example of what a sustainable world can look like , we also need to be proactive in the rest of the world .
BRAD PITT :
What does it mean to be proactive ?
Is it about changing minds set in their ways ?
Or perhaps planting new seeds of socially sustainable design in more fertile grounds ?
SERGIO PALLERONI :
We got to be part of the visionaries that make the connection between ecological housing and sustaining their culture and their place in the community .
I tell my students that the responsibility of an architect is to be inclusive .
To include all things about this world and that means all communities .
The future , the vision of the future you guys have , the community bought into , so that 's good .
MICHAEL MCDONOUGH :
There is a sense among architects like Sergio , that something very fundamental has been lost in the training of architects .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
OK so there 's a challenge , we have to think about grey water cycle .
MICHAEL MCDONOUGH :
His idea and it's important to emphasize that it is not unique to one person .
It is sort of much in the style of the 60's a kind of collective notion , and there are a lot of different manifestations of it , that students in particular need to get out into the world , the developing world , and they need to do hands on projects .
BRAD PITT :
Sergio Palleroni has been involved with building sustainable , low - income housing for 20 years .
Recruiting hands , but more importantly , minds , in helping poor communities .
CAMERON SINCLAIR :
Sergio has created a way of working with communities and bringing together young designers to work alongside with that community to build .
And that means that the buildings may not be sexy or glamorous or on the front cover of magazines , but there 's a level of honesty in the buildings .
JEFF SPECK :
He 's doing about four different things .
Any one of them alone would make his practice remarkable .
First , he 's bringing design students into communities to build buildings .
That just is n't done very often .
There 's , only a small number of architecture schools have programs like that .
Secondly , he 's doing it in underserved communities so he 's reinforcing that social responsibility among architects and architecture students to serve communities .
Thirdly , he 's doing it in a sustainable way and so he 's using local materials and not wasting energy or polluting .
And fourthly , they 're cool buildings .
They look neat .
And they actually are meaningful within the context of design being interesting and innovative .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
Building sustainable communities .
That 's the basic thing we should be doing .
And that 's both a physical environmental issue and a cultural environmental issue .
BRAD PITT :
The Yaqui Indians , a nomadic tribe who roamed the North - Central and Western deserts of Mexico , have gradually seen their lives diminished by the expanding ranches and farms of the region .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
The Yaqui are just interesting because they 're in a sense one of Mexico 's forgotten people .
They survived all the way to the 20th century the way they did because they lived on a piece of land nobody wanted .
It was desert .
They could n't really even raise cattle here .
The Yaqui are , well in terms , in economic terms probably the poorest residents of North America .
Their income is somewhere a little less than $ 600 a year , so it 's , very poor people .
They need houses and they need houses which are inexpensive and that they can afford on under a $ 1000 a year .
BRAD PITT :
And the Mexican government did respond ; with thousands of low - income houses , unfortunately with no thought to the sustainability of the region 's environment or its culture .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
You know you just look at those streets and you think , did that person ever look at how the people live ?
I mean , would they live in the building they 're designing for others ?
You know , there 's no humanity to those streets .
Every single box is the same as the other and you see people 's efforts to make them individual , to make them their own and yet you see how much they 're working against .
The boxes are un-ecological .
They 're made of concrete block , they heat up , they do n't treat the water , they have all sorts of drainage problems .
They have the wrong type of solar exposure , they have no natural ventilation , you know they , and people walk outside and it's a no man 's land .
And then within that no man 's land they 're trying to create a community .
So that 's why the houses that we 're attempting to make are houses that are truly economical and economical in the long term .
Their heating costs , cooling costs , maintenance costs are cheap so in ten years their family is not driven out by the costs of maintaining the house .
BRAD PITT :
There are still close to 20,000 homes needed .
The Yaqui housing shortage united business leaders , residents , and politicians , who together developed a micro loan system enabling a lucky few , for five thousand U.S. dollars , to afford a home of their dreams .
MONICA ESCOBEDO FUENTES ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE : We listened to the families .
We never thought we would hear the same problems .
Like health problems with families that had children with chronic respiratory illnesses , because they lived in unhealthy and cold houses .
And when they get a house like this one , not only do the children get better , but the family has money to spend on other things because they 're not spending money on medicine .
So in a way we did n't realize we were investing in their health as well .
INTERPRETER ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE : Do you like your house ?
MARIA ESTRELLA CAMARGO ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE : I 'm happy , very happy because it is my own house .
INTERPRETER ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE : What comforts does this house have ?
MARIA ESTRELLA CAMARGO ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE : I like everything , especially the bathrooms .
Here we had no plumbing , that 's what bothered me .
That was why I was not so sure about building the house here , because what about the bathrooms ?
Then they told me they were going to build a septic tank , and that was it .
We made the tanks and then we did n't have to have outhouses .
BRAD PITT :
This early prototype was designed and constructed using local materials such as river reeds , recycled boxes and adobe .
MONICA ESCOBEDO FUENTES ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE :
It 's very beneficial because the materials we 're using are available right here .
And they 've been using these materials in construction for many years .
But the idea of commercialism which we have access to through the media leads the families feel that materials are disposable .
The market provides access to products that are more destructive to the earth .
When the families see that with the local materials they can build houses that are safe and more durable and that are more suitable to their environment , then they make them their own and pass them down to their children and neighbors .
So we 're helping the environment a lot .
BRAD PITT :
The University of Texas students understood these important economic and cultural factors .
Working directly with residents they came up with two models .
The first incorporates an open courtyard , a major part of the Yaqui life .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
We have this space , it 's been created by this , one of the schemes in this and it's an extraordinary space .
It 's such a simple move you know it 's just a parting of two buildings .
On one side we have the bedrooms and on the other side we have the bathroom and kitchen and a small dining area .
And we 've created a kind of living room in the middle .
And the center space is protected from radiation by this thatched roof which is actually made from the rush bamboo which is found in the riverbeds .
The trusses are made from found material in the dump , from pallets for shipping to the United States .
Here 's a very simple building , $ 5,000 , has exquisite light .
And the light is being celebrated in the shared common room of the house .
The most complex , most beautiful piece of light is in the shared space where everybody can share it .
BRAD PITT :
Socially responsible architecture is as much about sharing knowledge as it is about constructing houses and when Sergio Palleroni took his classroom to the Yaqui Indian building site ; it is debatable who learned more .
JAY SANDERS :
We brought 40 students from UT and 5 , you know , 3 or 4 instructors and volunteers and students from their university locally were out here working with us .
The first 24 hours were , were exciting because this was n't originally where the houses were supposed to go , they were supposed to go on another site .
So we had a lot of changes .
STEVEN MOORE :
You know reality intervened , you know , kind of like life .
They went back and found out well one of their clients had fallen behind in her commitment to the community and so one of the clients had to be switched .
The other thing that was discovered is that the soil conditions at the second site were not as anticipated so that the footing design had to be changed .
JAY SANDERS :
The original foundation for the house in Estacion Corral was this deep .
And this one is 90 centimeters , up in here .
So that , I mean , most of the , a lot of the money for these houses had to do into the foundations just cause the soil was so soft .
STEVEN MOORE :
What students are learning to do is to think on their feet , to understand that there 's an inter- relationship between social and political and economic and environmental variables that are always in flux .
So rather than design a pretty object , they 're designing this process that 's always in flux .
Kind of like the world , right ?
SERGIO PALLERONI :
You know , we only teach them half the process , in my mind .
We only teach them about what happens here on the table .
Which is wonderful , I mean , it 's dynamic and it's full of stuff , you know and full of the creative process .
What we do n't teach them about much is how do you make that creative process valued in the community ?
How do you take that creative process out on the street and engage the real problems of the world with it ?
MICHAEL MCDONOUGH :
The students tend to work in indigenous technologies , vernacular technologies and that 's very important to the education of an architect .
I think an architect who 's done a straw bale house , for example , may in fact do a better high - rise .
ANN TUCKER :
When you 're coming into this , you know , I did n't know anything about construction really , I mean besides sort of around the house kind of stuff or an occasional weekend with a group at Habitat .
STEVEN MOORE :
I think what these students are learning is a different kind of approach to problem solving .
Right ?
Because when you 're simply going through the American Institute of Architect 's handbook of professional practice and following the rules , I 'm not sure that you 're learning how to build a better building or a better world .
CAMERON SINCLAIR :
Part of being sustainable , um , is not just the materials you use but also the fact that there 's a level of ownership by the community cause they 're a part of the whole process .
He does n't finish the complete building ; he sets up the system to allow the community to finish it .
And by finishing that building , the community owns that building .
JAY SANDERS :
The problem that he has is that he 's out of material money .
He 's got 7 bags of concrete and that 's it .
And then all the concrete money went into the foundation .
ANN TUCKER :
But he 's got the sand and gravel outside .
JAY SANDERS :
He needs 17 bags of cement , in order to do it the old way .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
Well , he 'll probably need 17 bags even if he does ferro cement .
SERGIO PALLERONI ( in Spanish ) :
SUBTITLE :
In the meantime we 're going to design , something , Jay , Ann and I , we 'll make design a cement cap that works well .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
You know I can't , with my students , come and build a thousand houses that might be needed by a community .
But we might build just a few pilot ones but in those pilot ones , we 'll reclaim the community 's sense of ownership over their political and social process .
So , design can act not just to create new possibilities for how to live in the world .
But it also can act , and create possibilities of your political and social rights in this world .
ANN TUCKER - TRANSLATING FOR JESUS ENRIQUE :
For his neighbors , it 's really an admiration .
They really admire it .
Because we built it with a material that now nobody uses .
The adobe .
He said that they 're used to brick and concrete and they all say what 's this crazy guy going to do with all this adobe ?
And now they say hey what a pretty color .
The blue is great .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
For us what 's sustainable about this , or what we 're trying to achieve in sustainability , or what we call sustainability , is that the idea that it's both the physical and cultural environment that we 're trying to sustain .
Like strong , communities , you know it 's been pointed out , sustain themselves because they engage the world , they engage each other , they have the capacity to do things for themselves .
And so , what we 're doing here in Mexico , is helping this community , not only to have cheap energy and cooler houses and make better use of their land , but it's also the idea that the house reflects their use , reflects their , the way they live , reflects their traditional relationships .
Reassures them that the way they live is good , you know .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
My dream of dreams would be that someday we would sit down with the government and the government would say " you know , we think what you 're doing is really good . "
And they 're doing that in the sense that they 're supporting this project among all the experiments that are going on in the country , this is the one they have agreed to support .
That 's extraordinary .
But then the next step might be for them to say " we not only want to support that but we want to take the ideas that you 're introducing and introduce them to the hundreds of thousands of houses we 're building in Mexico and I think that those ideas can make a change in the way we do housing . "
And I think that that would be extraordinary .
BRAD PITT :
There 's no doubt that change must happen .
But when we think of poverty we must also think about it in the so - called " First World . "
In Sergio Palleroni 's case , right in his own backyard at the University of Texas .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
The whole region from 35 , which divides the city East to West , all the way to the airport is an area which is predominately Hispanic and African American and um it's a community that 's , that earns a fraction of the income of the other side of the tracks .
This is an immediate issue here that has a lot of parallels with Mexico .
Here is a community that is marginalized .
One of the things that it has working for it is that they have this ground that they consider their own .
But , which is in , potentially gonna be lost to economic development and higher taxes .
So , can we do anything to maintain them here ?
BRAD PITT :
With the Guadalupe Project , Sergio challenged his students to not only design houses , but to develop strategies that strengthen the community .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
I think that sustainability is about kind of crossing political and social boundaries so my idea of the Guadalupe Project is that , is getting students to understand that unknown neighbor , that distant neighbors , as it was once put , that is , we share so much political and social boundaries with but yet we so misunderstand .
BRAD PITT :
They began by simply cleaning up one of the neighborhood alleys as a way of reaching out to the residents .
GAIL TRACHTENBERG :
The reason that we chose the alley project is cause we could actually , like we could actually come here and do something that is noticeable in terms of cleaning it up and sort of saying this is possible .
There were ideas of taking some of the branches that we clean up and making compost piles out of them so that you could sort of suggest that the more that you use the alley the less the crime will be there .
The more you 're facing it and incorporating it into your life , the less it 's something its something that somebody else can come in and abuse .
LORI C. RENTERIA :
What 's important , what I 've seen in my 25 years in trying to organize my neighborhood is these little small action projects lead to bigger changes in the neighborhood and it gives people hope .
STEVEN MOORE :
A volunteer came up to me yesterday in the alley and said , well what are you doing ?
And I said well , we wanna make the alley a more pleasant place because if you notice right over there , there 's a house under construction that faces the alley .
So it becomes a new kind of pedestrian street .
And if you look at the mapping information that we have , this alley and the one next over it , each have six backyard lots that could have " mother in law " or " granny " flats in it .
Which means that we would almost be able to double the density of the neighborhood , which is certainly something that 's good for the city .
But you know it would also be a good thing for the people in the neighborhood because if they had access to something like a revolving fund and could borrow the money to build a granny flat here , it means that they could rent it out and instead of being pushed out of the neighborhood because of increasing taxes , they would actually have additional income .
BRAD PITT :
The student housing designs , at their core , utilized systems to reduce running costs and minimize waste .
By incorporating social , cultural and environmental aspects into their designs , green and sustainable choices were not seen as luxuries , but basic building blocks .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
This time next year we 'll be building two houses in the alleys .
So next year you 'll see the same kind of thing but in kind of kind of like 12 - 15 weeks of being out here building 2 houses , engaging the community , teaching them skills and how to build .
At that point we 'll actually be building maybe the entire alleys you know , natural fencing because what we imagine these fences to become eventually are like vertical gardens which kind of help cool the alley and bring moisture into the alley and help people raise tomatoes or other fruits or plants and that they would actually be fed from the rooftops .
And the long - term impact would be that the alleys would become this kind of product of the natural environment .
The water cycle , the houses , things like that .
They would be representative of the ecological potential .
GAIL TRACHTENBERG :
What we 're hoping to get is some residents to actually come out .
I mean we did a lot of surveying , canvassing , and it would be really nice to see some people come out .
We got a piñata , trying to make it a fiesta kind of thing to say , come on out and join us and see what we 're doing .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
Austin is the kind of community that has the kind of political and social awareness to make it happen but maybe all the pieces , all the small solutions that have existed have n't been pooled together .
So we 're gonna be part of the kind of , one of the weavers that 's gonna try to bring this together .
And so , it 's a great opportunity to teach students to kind of learn to be not just architects but to realize where the money might come from and how do you give them political rights and how do you find possibilities .
How can you be a visionary that 's inclusive of all issues and of all people .
BRAD PITT :
So what is design 's purpose ?
Is it responsible for great buildings , or possibly , responsible for the greater good ? .
Allowing for the potential of all living things .
STEVEN MOORE :
Who does n't want clean alleys ?
And who does n't want a place where every human being has a decent place to live ?
I do n't think that anybody is ideologically opposed to those things .
The issue is how do we get there ?
CAMERON SINCLAIR :
These global issues will only be solved by small solutions .
Small local solutions .
So , everyone says what 's the big answer ?
There is no big answer , there 's millions of little ones .
JAY SANDERS :
It 's nice that I can try to help a couple of families live in a nicer house or a better house , that improves their quality of life but much more importantly to me is that , you know that forever , it will change the way that I and 40 other students view the world and the way that they 're gonna practice architecture in the world .
JEFF SPECK :
If , one out of every 100 architects did what Sergio did , um there 'd be a lot less suffering in the world , a lot less poverty and a lot less you know people who are underserved in their communities .
So you know , I think he inspires all of us to think about how we might turn our skills to more altruistic ends .
SERGIO PALLERONI :
Knowledge is a resource and there 's need for that resource you know a mile away , ½ a mile away from us .
That knowledge can make a difference in people 's lives .
And that 's all we 're saying .
You know walk across the tracks , take your knowledge and the things you 're learning , just apply it .
Just walk 5 minutes and you can make a difference .
END OF EPISODE
A purely functional 2D scenegraph library with functionality similar to a barebones Processing .
Currently entirely implmeneted using Cairo , although I would like to go to OpenGL as well .
Most consumers trust that public health policies are guided by the best science and are enacted after medical experts have carefully weighed the health benefits for the public against the potential risks for harm .
The fact that this does not happen was demonstrated this week with the launch of a major nationwide campaign that could put millions of people at risk .
But this story received barely a blip of news coverage .
This new program is being led by the commissioner of New York City ’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . —
Yes , the same department that is requiring hospitals to give itself full access to your medical records and has also mandated that every lab in the state report to it all blood sugar results without patients ’ knowledge ( or informed consent or ability for patients to opt out ) so that it can identify people for state “ disease management . ”
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden wants to put the entire population on a low - salt diet and is leading a nationwide low - salt initiative , partnering state , local and federal governments and private stakeholders to cut salt in our foods in half within the next decade .
The significance of this initiative may have been lost on media .
Perhaps it sounded harmless and intuitively helpful because “ everyone knows salt is bad . ”
It deserves to be out in the open , though , because the best science for nearly half a century — including the government ’s own findings on examinations reflecting 99 million Americans ; more than 17,000 studies published since 1966 ; and even a recent Cochrane systematic review of the clinical trial evidence — fails to support the hypotheses that salt reductions offer health benefits for the general public .
Cochrane ’s reviewers specifically concluded that such interventions are inappropriate for population prevention programs .
It ’s not just that the salt reductions being proposed will be costly programs that wo n’t be of much help to people , but that they could hurt people .
Even more troubling , the public health messages in this new campaign appear to be most targeting minorities , fat people , the elderly and poor .
Public health bulletins on the program ’s website tell New York consumers that salt is harmful , bad for their health , and that eating too much salt means people are more likely to have high blood pressure , heart attacks and strokes .
And “ heart diseases is New York City ’s biggest killer . ”
Echoed by the City ’s director of cardiovascular health , Dr. Sonia Angell , M.D. , MPH , consumers are being told that they ’re eating twice the salt they need and that “ a low salt diet ( 1,500 mg ) can help lower or even control blood pressure . ”
It even claims that those who do n’t have high blood pressure can prevent high blood pressure by eating a low salt diet .
“ Lower sodium levels by 50 percent , and 150,000 American lives a year might be saved , ” said Dr. Frieden .
None of these claims can be scientifically supported .
Missing : a crisis of heart disease .
The latest vital statistics data from the CDC National Center for Health Statistics was just released and reported that age - related deaths from heart disease , cancer , diabetes , liver disease and hypertension — all of the causes some want us to believe are due to unhealthy lifestyles , rather than mostly aging — have continued to drop significantly for more than 50 years .
The latest Health US report from the CDC found our life expectancy has reached another record high and age - adjusted mortality for the leading causes of death have been cut nearly in half since 1950 , including heart disease .
Missing : a crisis of hypertension .
The latest National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data found no epidemic of hypertension , either .
Actual average blood pressures among American adults changed little between 1988 and 2004 .
There ’s been no statistical change for some two decades in systolic blood pressures among people being treated for hypertension .
And average systolic blood pressures among Americans without hypertension has gone from 115 to 117 , changes too small to be clinically meaningful .
Meanwhile , among all groups , average diastolic blood pressures has decreased during this period ( an overall average of 73 to 72 ) .
Missing : a crisis of high salt intake .
It may be popular to believe that we ’re eating dramatically more salt over recent decades , because of all that processed food and all .
The evidence does n’t support this oft - repeated claim , as was covered in the salt shaker article .
Researchers at the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York , found Americans are n’t eating anywhere near the amounts of salt being claimed .
Their third study in a series examining NHANES data representing 99 million non-institutionalized adults in the United States between 1988 and 1997 , showed average sodium intake among Americans has remained about 3,200 mg / day .
Missing : even an association between salt and heart disease or premature death .
As covered here , even following the NHANES participants for nine more years through year 2000 , the Albert Einstein researchers were unable to show among the general population that those eating the lowest salt diets had lower risks for developing cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure or dying prematurely .
In fact , heart disease , high blood pressure and deaths were inversely related to salt intakes : the higher the sodium , the lower the risks ; the lower the dietary salt , the higher the risks .
To parse out the effects of dietary sodium intake itself , they factored for confounding influences , including : age , gender , race , education , added table salt , exercise , alcohol use , smoking , history of diabetes , history of cancer , systolic BP , cholesterol , dietary potassium , weight , treatment for hypertension , and calories .
[ To rule out possibilities that the results could reflect the affects of cancers or illnesses , the authors excluded those Americans who ’d died within the first 6 months or those who’d had a previous heart attack , stroke or heart failure . ]
The associations between low - salt diets and higher rates of cardiovascular disease and all - cause mortality held .
The lowest sodium intakes — the 1500 mg / day that the New York health department says everyone should be eating — were associated with an 80 % higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with those consuming the highest salt diets .
The lowest salt intakes were also associated with a 24 % higher risk of all - cause mortality .
Clearly , low - salt diets are not associated with lower risks for the general population .
Conversely , the Albert Einstein researchers were unable to show that even the highest salt intakes were associated with increased risks for developing cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure or for premature death .
A major international research project in thirty - two nations showed that while the incidence of hypertension varied widely , salt intake had little to do with it .
Another major peer - reviewed study published in the European Journal of Epidemiology , examined sodium and potassium intakes and their relationship to cardiovascular disease and mortality .
Researchers from Wageningen University in The Netherlands followed a general population sample of people 55 years and older for five and a half years .
Clinical exams were done at the beginning of the study , including body measurements , blood pressure , blood tests and 24 - hour urine samples to measure sodium and potassium levels .
Dietary data was obtained from food - frequency questionnaires .
They found no association between any of the levels of sodium , potassium or sodium / potassium ratios and cardiovascular or all - cause mortality , nor was there a tenable relationship among the overweight study participants .
“ The absence of a relationship between salt intake and mortality in our study corroborates the findings from the large Scottish Heart Health Study among almost 12,000 middle - aged subjects with 24-h urine samples , ” they wrote , adding , “ follow - up data of the MRFIT trial neither showed a relationship between dietary sodium intake estimated by 24-h recall and cardiovascular events or mortality . ”
Decades of epidemiological evidence simply do not support fears that salt is deadly or that the amounts people naturally eat are associated with harm , or that low - salt diets are associated with improved health or longer life .
Benefits of salt
“ By virtue of its central role in maintaining intravascular and extracellular volume , sodium is essential to human survival , ” wrote Dr. Michael Alderman , M.D. , in the International Journal of Epidemiology .
Given free access to salt , humans consume surprisingly similar ranges of salt across a wide variety of diets , cultures , environments and heredities , he said .
In fact , some of the longest - living people in the world also have the highest salt consumptions .
Many point to the Japanese , for example — they have one of the highest salt intakes in the world , as well as the highest life expectancy .
Salt not only makes food taste better , it also improves the flavor of foods for those whose tastes or appetites are diminished , helping to prevent nutritional deficiencies especially among vulnerable populations , such as children and elderly .
Salt is n’t added to food for malevolent purposes , but because it has had invaluable roles in food preparation and preservation , baking , culturing cheese , and making our food safer to eat since the earliest days of mankind .
The healthful benefits of salts , discussed here , also include the importance of the very first functional food : iodized salt .
The European Society of Cardiology guideline experts reported that randomized clinical trial evidence also suggests that “ an abundant sodium intake may improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance , especially in diabetic , salt - sensitive , and or medicated essential hypertensive subjects . ”
Other unintended risks of low - salt diet
It ’s extremely rare to have too much salt in our bodies , called hypernatremia , ( it occurs in about 1 % of debilitated hospitalized patients as a symptom of an underlying disease or inability to drink water ) .
But , as covered here , low - salt diets significantly raise people ’s risk for hyponatremia , where the amount of sodium in our bodies can become dangerously low .
It ’s the most common electrolyte disorder and a special risk for infants and elderly , according to Dr. Sandy Craig , M.D. , at the Department of Emergency Medicine , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
It can result in swelling of our brain , seizures , coma , heat stroke , leg cramps , heart arrhythmias and circulatory collapse .
Low - salt diets put elderly especially at added risk for hypodehydration and death .
Growing numbers of clinical studies in the medical literature are suggesting other unexpected negative health effects of low - salt diets , such as activating the rennin - angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system and increasing insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance , especially for diabetics .
These effects could actually raise risks for cardiovascular disease , according to the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines .
Low - salt diets fail to lower blood pressure , heart disease and mortality
Cochrane recently released a systematic review of the clinical trial evidence on reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease , as well as the effects of low - salt diets on blood pressure and mortality .
After 1 to 5 years of follow - up , those who ’d received low - salt diets and intensive behavioral interventions , saw their systolic blood pressures reduced by a mere 1.1 mmHg , and diastolic blood pressures by 0.6 mmHg , even while successfully lowering salt intakes as confirmed by urinary 24 - hour sodium excretions by 35.5 mmol .
As the reviewers wrote : “ This reduction was not enough to expect an important health benefit . ”
Changes in blood pressures were also unrelated to the degree sodium had been reduced — in other words , more was n’t better .
Deaths were also no different between those on low - salt diets and control groups .
The Cochrane reviewers concluded that even “ intensive interventions , unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes , provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long - term trials . ”
In fact , while there have been more than 17,000 studies published on salt and blood pressure since 1966 , even following populations for decades , none has shown notable health benefits for the general population with low - sodium diets .
According to Dr. David Klurfeld , Ph.D. , professor and chairman of the Department of Nutrition and Food Science at Wayne State University , editor - in - chief of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition , “ the better controlled studies fail to show a significant benefit on blood pressure for large groups with sodium restriction . ”
The source of claims that reducing sodium intake by half would save 150,000 lives a year , used to petition the FDA to revoke salt as generally recognized as safe , was a CSPI paper .
As reviewed here , the claims were not supported by the research , nor even the study researchers ’ own conclusions .
Similarly , media claims that salt kills or that cutting down on salt adds 12 years to your life also proved unsupported .
The Albert Einstein College of Medicine authors were especially cautious about establishing population guidelines based on currently available evidence .
Guidelines calling for reductions are based on the modest blood pressure changes associated with low - sodium diets in short term clinical trials , they said .
“ However , these trials could not assess the long - term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality consequences . ”
They added :
[ B]asing a lower sodium recommendation primarily on intermediate effects such as blood pressure reduction is also unsatisfactory .
Unintended health consequences can result from seemingly reasonable expectations ....
In the case of sodium , extrapolations from positive effects on blood pressure may be offset by extrapolations from potentially adverse effects on the sympathetic nervous system , the renin- angiotensin system , insulin resistance , and the potential that other important nutrients might be decreased when free - living individuals alter diets to decrease sodium ...
The data here cannot sustain a conclusion that lower sodium is harmful .
However , these findings , along with the inconsistent results of other epidemiologic studies , and the propensity for substantial variability among individuals , do not lend support to any universal prescription for salt intake .
In sum , the inverse associations of sodium to CVD mortality observed in this large , nationally representative sample , raise questions regarding the likelihood that a survival advantage will necessarily result from a universal recommendation for a lower dietary sodium intake .
Even the New York Times reported that Dr. Friedman might encounter resistance to his low - salt campaign “ on scientific grounds . ”
Different people have different responses to sodium , dictated by genetics , with some people sensitive to high levels and for others low salt levels can be unhealthy , it concurred .
Dr. Michael Alderman found this campaign alarming .
“ Advocates of universal restriction of sodium intake , ” he wrote , “ base their case on the belief that this will produce a population - wide reduction of blood pressure which , in turn , will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
Indeed , these dogma are often preached with a fervour usually associated with religious zealotry . ”
He argued , however , “ that the available data provides insufficient evidence to justify any universal target for sodium intake for either the whole population or for its hypertensive subset . ”
What ’s up ?
As the New York City - led nationwide low - salt initiative is clearly not founded on a true health crisis , on the medical evidence , or on proven health interventions for the primary prevention of high blood pressure or heart disease , what might it really be about ?
As the New York Times pointed out today , the target is going after packaged foods and chain restaurant meals .
Reducing salt to levels unpalatable to their consumers appears to primarily be about getting people to eat less of foods these public officials do n’t think people should eat or others should sell .
His plan is based on the UK ’s traffic light program , reports the newspaper , earmarking such “ prime suspects ” as cheese , breakfast cereals , bread , pastas , cake mixes , condiments and soup .
“ Dr. Frieden says a quiet , mass reduction in sodium levels — stealth health , they like to call it around the department — might be more effective , ” wrote the New York Times , than relying on people to comply with the government ’s dietary recommendations .
Professor Lawrence O. Gostin , director of the Center for Law and the Public 's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities , may have called it when he commented :
You can imagine it getting to the point where you have a public health worker showing up at your door and asking , ‘ Did you remember to exercise , eat right and take your medication today ? ’
That appears to already be in the planning .
COURIC : You ’ve cited Alaska ’s proximity to Russia as part of your foreign policy experience .
What did you mean by that ?
PALIN : That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country , Russia , and on our other side , the land– boundary that we have with– Canada .
It– it ’s funny that a comment like that was– kind of made to– cari– I do n’t know , you know ?
Reporters –
COURIC : Mock ?
PALIN : Yeah , mocked , I guess that ’s the word , yeah .
COURIC : Explain to me why that enhances your foreign policy credentials .
PALIN : Well , it certainly does because our– our next door neighbors are foreign countries .
They ’re in the state that I am the executive of .
And there in Russia–
COURIC : Have you ever been involved with any negotiations , for example , with the Russians ?
PALIN : We have trade missions back and forth .
We– we do– it ’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America , where – where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska .
It ’s just right over the border .
It is– from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there .
They are right next to– to our state .

Frequently Asked CrockPot Slow Cooker Questions , Part 2 .
I 've gotten a slew of related questions the past few months , and while I absolutely LOVE answering questions
( I really do , do n't read this with sarcasm .
The idea of actually helping real , breathing people in any way I can is exhilarating --- please do n't ever feel like you 're bugging me with any of your questions .
I promise if you 're asking , somebody else already has . :-) )
I figured it might be helpful to round up some of the recent most frequently asked .
Part I of Frequently Asked A Year of Slow Cooking Questions is located here
.
1 ) How do you keep your slow cookers clean ?
I use Adam .
HA !
No , really , Adam is pretty much the slow cooker washer guy .
He 's an expert you know , one of his first jobs was washing dishes in the kitchen at the local hospital .
For the most part , I 'd suggest emptying the stoneware as soon as you can .
If you have leftover food , scrape it into a tupperware or some other sort of storage container .
This is n't mandatory , you can certainly store the food safely in the fridge in the stoneware , but it is NOT recommended to reheat in the stoneware in the crock for leftovers , so you might as well clean it out on day 1 .
If you have baked on gook , the absolute best way to get it off without ruining your manicure
can get a ( HA ! on the manicure .
Although youget a pretty nice pedicure .
..) is to fill the stoneware insert with hot water and add a tablespoon of dishwasher powder .
Then float a fabric ( dryer ) softener sheet in the water and let it soak overnight .
Then wash in the dishwasher , or by hand in the morning as usual .
If you do not have the dryer sheets , a gollop of liquid fabric softener will do the trick , too .
DO NOT ever put a hot stoneware into your sink and fill it with cold water .
It will crack .
And then you 'll be super sad .
As for the slow cooker base with the heating element , do NOT fill it with water , ever .
Make sure to read the pamphlet that comes with your particular slow cooker for the manufacturer 's suggested cleaning technique , but what I do is use a very slightly damp paper towel to wipe out any dribbles or a clorox wipe ( I puffy heart love clorox wipes ) .
2 ) What 's the difference between a Crock - Pot and a Slow Cooker ?
Nothing .
Crock - Pot is a brand name of the first type of slow cooker , formally under the Rival label .
There actually is n't such thing as a " crockpot " ---- although many people do call their slow cooker a " crockpot . "
3 ) What size slow cooker should I buy ?
It depends on what you are interested in cooking , and your family size .
Slow cookers work the best when they are 2/3 to 3 / 4 of the way full .
The recipe times are for this amount of food --- if your pot is n't full enough , the food will cook faster and might burn .
If it 's a bit too full , your food will take longer to cook than the suggested cooking times .
Before my year - long challenge , I had 2 slow cookers that I used for everything : a
5.5 - quart Smart Pot
and a
1.5 quart mini crock
I got at a Black Friday sale at Walmart for $ 4.95 ( score ! )
These pots served my family of 4 quite well until I started this challenge .
I then upgraded to a 6.5 quart eLume ( I was given it from Crock - Pot ) , and now my Go To is The Ninja Cooking System .
I also like the Hamilton Beach Set and Forget , especially the locking lid--- it 's fantastic for potlucks and travel .
hese are the slow cookers and accessories ( hand mixer , pyrex / corningware inserts I happen to use in my own home kitchen .
For a family of 2 - 3 , buy a 2 - 4 - quart
For a family of 3 - 5 , a 5 - 6 - quart
For a large family , or for entertaining groups of people , opt for a 7 - 8 quart slow cooker
I adore my
Little Dipper
4 ) What if I only have a huge slow cooker ?
Can I still make recipes that call for a smaller size ?
Yes .
It 's super easy .
Simply insert an oven - safe dish ( Pyrex , Corningware , etc. ) into your large stoneware , and load the ingredients into the dish .
This will create a smaller cooking vessel inside of your slow cooker .
Then cover and cook like normal .
It will take a bit longer for the dish inside to get up to temperature , but your food will cook just fine .
If you are cooking a dish ( chicken , for instance , which has the tendency to dry out ) and the recipes calls for a 4 quart , but you only have a 6 quart ( this is an example ... )
put the ingredients into your slow cooker , then put a layer of foil or parchment paper down near the food to help trap in the steam and moisture near the food .
Then cover and cook like normal .
This is also a big help if your slow cooker has one of those super helpful ( now this is sarcasm .. ) " vent " holes in the lid or in the side of the stoneware insert .
PLEASE BE CAREFUL when removing the foil or parchment paper at the end of the cooking time .
The steam will be quite hot and will shoot out .
Keep small children far away .
5 ) Are all of your recipes gluten free ?
What about the ones in the books ?
Yes .
We happen to be a gluten free family , because my 4 year old has been diagnosed with Celiac , which is an intolerance to gluten ( found in wheat , barley , and rye ) .
PLEASE !
read all labels carefully on your own , because manufacturers are known to sometimes change ingredients with little - to - no warning .
If you are not gluten - free , simply ignore my notes and use the ingredients you normally would use when cooking for your family .
Want more info on going gluten free ?
I
wrote about our journey a bit , here ,
and there are links at the bottom that will be helpful .
6 ) Do you peek while slow cooking ?
Yes .
I am not the best at following rules , and I often taste , stir , and poke at my food while it's in the slow cooker .
I 've heard from reliable sources that you can lose up to 20 minutes of valuable cooking time each time you peek , but I have not noticed that to be the case .
Peeking and tasting makes me feel like I 'm doing something , and it makes me happy .
I like being happy .
That said , if you are baking with your slow cooker , or are making a layered casserole such as lasagna or tamale pie , try not to peek until the very end of the cooking time , so moisture does n't escape .
And DO NOT peek on the yogurt recipe --- keep the valuable heat inside .
7 ) How come you are n't posting every day anymore ?
commitments , along with trying my hardest to give my children more of me than they got last year .
Because my year - long challenge is over !
I 'm currently slow - cooking baby number three , and am working on some other freelancing , along with trying my hardest to give my children more of me than they got last year .
I am still completely infatuated with my slow cookers and use them VERY regularly .
I 'd be absolutely lost without them .
8 ) Have you seen Julie & Julia ?
Not yet !
It looks like a group of my friends will go together next week .
I can't wait .
I hope this helps , some !
If you have other questions , let me have 'em in the comment section .

VALLADOLID , Spain 
The Macías Picavea primary school hardly looks like the seat of revolution .
But this unassuming brick building in a sleepy industrial town has become a battleground in an intensifying war between church and state in Spain .
In an unprecedented decision here , a judge ruled in November that the public school must remove the crucifixes from classroom walls , saying they violated the “ nonconfessional ” nature of the Spanish state .
Although the Roman Catholic Church was not named in the suit , it criticized the ruling as an “ unjust ” attack on a historical and cultural symbol  and a sign of the Spanish state ’s increasingly militant secularism .
If the judge ’s ruling was the latest blow to the Catholic Church ’s once mighty grip on Spain , the church ’s response showed Spain to be a crucible for the future of church - state relations in Europe .
A Somerset County man pleaded not guilty today to drug production charges for allegedly growing 17 marijuana plants outside his home .
John Ray Wilson , 36 , of Franklin Township , suffers from multiple sclerosis .
His lawyer said Wilson uses the drug to help alleviate his symptoms .
Wilson is charged with maintaining or operating a drug production facility and with drug manufacturing .
The plants were discovered on Aug. 18 .
During an arraignment and status conference in Somerville , Wilson 's attorney , James Wronko rejected the state 's plea offer of six years in prison , three of them mandatory .
A helicopter pilot noticed the plants and contacted State Police , according to court papers .
Members of the New Jersey State Police Marijuana Eradication Squad , Somerset County Prosecutor 's Office and Franklin met with Wilson , authorities said .
Wilson was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in February 2002 and has no health insurance .
He uses the marijuana and venom from bee stings to alleviate his symptoms , Wronko said .
" I can't conceive of any circumstances in which I would ever plead Mr .
Wilson , or anyone for that matter , to three years in state prison because they were growing marijuana for personal use to treat multiple sclerosis , " Wronko said after court .
The marijuana plants were mixed among other plants on the property .
Wilson was growing marijuana so he would not have to get involved with street - level drug dealers , Wronko said .
Wilson 's court proceedings come amid a debate in Trenton over medicinal marijuana .
On Monday , the Senate Health , Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee approved a bill that would grant patients of debilitating diseases and chronic illnesses access to the drug to ease their suffering .
Under the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana
Act , patients would need a written recommendation from their doctor and approval from the state Department of Health and Senior Services , which would issue identification cards .
The patients could possess up to six plants and one ounce of usable marijuana under the bill , which is awaiting a full Senate vote .
Wilson is accused of manufacturing more than 10 plants .
If convicted , he faces up to 20 years in state prison .
" I can't imagine the Legislature of the state of New Jersey would want to subject someone who is growing 10 marijuana plants outside to the same penalties as someone who is manufacturing methamphetamine , packaging and distributing " that drug , Wronko said .
" He 's facing a more severe sentence than a high - level dealer of crack cocaine would face . "

He fell out of his nest when he was a baby and at the time my cat had kittens so I thought what could it hurt to try to see if my cat would nurse him and she did .

Danish Prime Minister Fogh Rasmussen is preparing Denmark for admission to the Eurozone .
Despite my skepticism about the Euro as a currency , I would say that Denmark is a perfect candidate for entry .
The Danish economy is already very well harmonized with “ core ” Europe of France and Germany .
Their business cycle , monetary policy , political economy , and per capita GDP are all similar to France and Germany .
Below is my translation of part of a German - language article from Financial Times Deutschland which discusses the upcoming referendum in Denmark for joining the Euro in which Fogh Rasmussen makes some interesting contrasts between Denmark and the UK .
The Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen is moving aggressively toward an early referendum on Denmark ’s accession to the Eurozone .
The financial crisis demonstrates the problems of a small currency , says Rasmussen .
“ I think it would stabilize the Danish economy in times of crisis , if we had the Euro .
I have no doubt about that , ” Rasmussen said in a newspaper interview .
However he did not offer a specific timetable .
Unlike the much - discussed entry of Britain , the entry of Demnmark into the Eurozone would not be a burden on currency stability .
The EU Commission has said that Denmark is currently the only country that could join the Euro in a very short period .
On Thursday , the Danish parliament began a debate about the euro , during which EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia praised the benefits of the Euro .
Unlike in 2000 , when the Danes rejected the euro in a referendum , there prevails today in the major parties general agreement that candidacy is overdue .
However , the Danish People ’s Party DF , on which the liberal - conservative minority government is based , is EU - sceptical .
The leftist Party SF rejects the single currency as well ….
As a main argument for the Euro , Rasmussen points to the interest rate policy of the Danish central bank as compared to the ECB .
“ In order to stimulate the economy , currently the interest rates should be reduced , but in order to protect the currency , one is forced to raise interest rates .
That ’s a paradox , ” Rasmussen told the newspaper “ Politiken ” .
In recent months , Danish interest rates were significantly higher than in the euro zone — at times , the difference was 1.75 percent points .
At present , it is about one percent .
The national currency , the Danish Krone , is already linked to the common currency .
Compared to the British Pound or the Swedish Krona , it has not fallen as much in recent months .
“ My conclusion is that Denmark should be there at the heart of Europe .
That ’s were we belong , ” said Rasmussen .
“ I believe that in the Danish population there is strong agreement . ”
Other Eurozone members which are well - placed as members of the Euro include the Benelux countries and Austria .
Sweden is another country which would be an appropriate addition to the Eurozone .
On the other hand , poor macro fundamentals make Greece , Portugal and Italy a burden on the Eurozone .
Unsynchronized business cycles in Ireland , the UK and Spain make these three countries equally problematic for the Eurozone .
Ultimately , the Euro does have benefits for small countries .
It reduces overhead from foreign exchange , it increases markets for financial assets and it protects against currency attacks .
If any country outside the Eurozone is well - placed for entry , it is Denmark .
Anyone following developments in the European political economy should watch what happens here .
It will be instructive for future events elsewhere .
Note : I failed to mention that Denmark has rejected the Euro once and current opinion polls suggest they would do so again now despite the Prime Minister ’s claims to the contrary .

Whether you use your cell phone 's camera for business or personal use , most people agree it is a useful feature .
Camera phones allow you to send updates and status reports on prices or equipment from out in the field within seconds , and many cameras offer high - enough resolution to print out and put on the wall .
Perhaps the most annoying thing about camera phones is the phony shutter snap sound , which thankfully can be turned off .
But what if Uncle Sam said that sound was mandatory ?
Earlier this month , U.S. Rep. Pete King , R - N.Y. , introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would institute a ban on silent mode while taking a picture .
The King - sponsored bill , which has been referred to the House 's Committee on Energy and Commerce , is called the Camera Phone Predator Alert Act ( H.R. 414 ) .
Designed to protect children and adolescents who " have been exploited by photographs taken in dressing rooms and public places with the use of a camera phone , " the bill requires any camera phone manufactured in the United States to " sound a tone or other sound audible within a reasonable radius of the phone whenever a photograph is taken . "
If it passes , any mobile phone or handset manufactured a year after the bill passes would be required to have a clicking sound .
Any silencing option would go the way of the dinosaurs : Extinction .
However , the bill currently lacks a co-sponsor .
The bill raises a number of questions and issues in terms of enforcement and general seriousness .
Most people do not pay much attention to the ambient sounds around them , and the general term " tone " does not offer much detail as to volume , intensity or frequency .
Are we talking air raid sirens , an even louder , phonier shutter snap or perhaps a digital version of the evergreen ( but slightly creepy ) request " Say cheese ? "
While the issue of child exploitation is no laughing matter , one must pause to consider how valid this issue is at a time when the world economy seems teetering on the brink of collapse .
While the mandatory " audible tone " might prove to be a slight annoyance to those of us who use our camera phones for work or play on a daily basis , it is easy to imagine a large majority of camera phone manufacturers and users would be pleased to see this bill shuttered .
KUWAIT ( Reuters ) - Kuwait decided on Sunday to scrap a deal to form a $ 17.4 billion petrochemical joint venture with U.S. company Dow Chemical DOW.N .
Kuwait's Oil Minister Mohammad al - Olaim ( C ) , talks to the media about the status of the joint venture project between Kuwait Petroleum Company 's subsidiary , Petroleum Industries Company ( PIC ) and US - based Dow Chemical for a petrochemical joint venture called KDOW , in Kuwait City on December 22,2008 .
REUTERS / Stephanie McGehee
The cancellation of the deal , which had met opposition in Kuwait 's parliament , was acknowledged Sunday by Dow and is a blow to the largest U.S. chemicals company .
Dow had planned to use the proceeds to repay a large part of $ 13 billion in debt it will have to shoulder once its acquisition of rival Rohm & Haas ROH.
N closes , which is expected to be in early 2009 .
The Supreme Petroleum Council , at a meeting headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al - Mohammad al - Sabah , “ arrived at the decision to cancel the contract , ” state news agency KUNA said .
State - run Petrochemical Industries Co ( PIC ) signed a deal earlier this month with Dow to launch the joint venture , K - Dow Petrochemicals , and was due to pay $ 7.5 billion .
The deal was part of Dow ’s strategy to reduce its exposure to the cyclical nature of the commodity chemicals business .
Dow did not return calls seeking clarification about whether the deal ’s collapse would affect its plans to acquire Rohm & Haas .
The deal would have been the latest between a major U.S. company and Middle East investors .
General Electric GE.N and Abu Dhabi investment agency Mubadala Development
Co formed an $ 8 billion joint venture in July to provide commercial finance in the Middle East and Africa .
The deal had angered some Kuwaiti parliamentarians who said the project was not economically viable in light of the global financial crisis and slumping petrochemical sales .
A cabinet statement said the global crisis had prompted the cabinet to ask the council “ to take the necessary measures to cancel the contract ... within a sound legal framework while safeguarding the state ’s rights and interests , ” KUNA reported .
Four liberal MPs had threatened to question the prime minister , a senior member of the ruling family , unless the deal was scrapped .
Another move by some deputies to question Sheikh Nasser on another issue had prompted the cabinet to resign in November , though the ruler reappointed his nephew .
Parliament has a history of challenging the government with the same liberal MPs having opposed building the $ 15 billion Al - Zour refinery for which final contracts have not yet been signed despite an award in May .
Dow said in a statement Sunday , it was “ extremely disappointed with the decision by the Kuwait Government , and is in the process of evaluating its options pursuant to the Joint Venture Formation Agreement . ”
The Midland , Michigan - based company added that it “ remains committed to its Middle East Strategy . ”
Dow and other chemical makers around the globe face one of the worst slumps ever in chemical demand , due to recessions in most developed countries and a sharp slowdown in emerging economies .
Earlier this month , Dow said it would close 20 facilities , divest several businesses and cut 5,000 jobs , or 11 percent , of its workforce .
It also plans to temporarily idle about 180 plants .
Kuwait and Dow lowered the value of the joint venture more than 8 percent to $ 17.4 billion earlier this month after the Gulf Arab state asked to cut its contribution in light of a sharp slowdown in global demand .
The new company had been due to market petrochemicals and plastics such as polyethylene , polypropylene and polycarbonate , used in products ranging from plastic bottles and compact disks to computers and agricultural compounds .
In July , Dow said it would acquire Rohm & Haas for $ 15.3 billion in a move to broaden its specialty product offerings .
Israeli military forces have reportedly hacked into a Hamas - run TV station to broadcast propaganda .
The hijack of the Al - Aqsa television station last weekend represents the latest phase in a war in cyberspace that has accompanied the ongoing conflict in Gaza .
Al - Aqsa is known for featuring allegedly antisemitic childrens ' cartoons as part of its broadcast schedule last year .
Instead of the controversial Farfour character , audiences were treated to propaganda clips featuring the gunning down of Hamas ' leadership , accompanied by a message in Arabic that " Time is running out , " Israel 's Channel 10 ( via Wired ) reports .
The cyberattack on Sunday followed earlier propaganda broadcasts and the bombing of Al - Aqsa 's main studio by IDF planes last month .
On Saturday an Al - Aqsa broadcast was interrupted by the image of a ringing phone that was left unanswered , accompanied by an Arabic voiceover that stated " Hamas leaders are hiding and they are leaving you on the front line " .
Al - Aqsa radio has also been disrupted by propaganda broadcasts , Wired adds .
The conflict online that has accompanied real - world Arab - Israeli hostilities has been far from one - sided .
For example , an Israeli domain registration server was hacked last week by a Moroccan hacking crew .
Team Evil 's assault on DomainTheNet 's registration system had the effect of redirecting surfers hoping to visit ynetnews.com and Bank Discount to a webpage featuring an anti-Israeli message .
A huge upswing in hacker attacks since the conflict began last month has also been recorded , according to local reports . ®
Abraham Lincoln was a self - described billiards addict .
John Adams swam almost daily in the nearby waters of the often chilly Potomac River .
Gerald Ford made use of the White House facilities as if they were at his own private country club wedged in a corner at the intersection of Pennsylvania and Executive avenues in Washington , D.C .
Whether entertaining high - powered guests or for personal enjoyment , American presidents and their families have a long tradition of recreating on the grounds of the White House .
When the ability to find simple seclusion in the outside world is nearly impossible , these seven White House facilities can offer respite from the high - pressure job .
1. Basketball
It is no secret that Barack Obama is a huge basketball enthusiast .
From his high school days in Hawaii when he earned the nickname “ Barry the Bomber ” , right up until the day he gave his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention , Mr. Obama has played basketball as a way to keep fit , focused and healthy .
With an incoming cabinet basketball team said to be the best ever and with Obama ’s proclivity for shooting the rock around , the single - basket outdoor court may not be enough .
Installed by George H.W. Bush in 1991 , the 26 ′ by 26 ′ court sits near the swimming pool and just off the Oval Office .
But when Mr. Obama hinted throughout the campaign that he ’d like to upgrade from the driveway - sized basketball court to a full - sized indoor court by replacing the existing bowling alley , bowling industry groups raised vocal opposition .
2. Bowling
As opposed to his skills on the basketball court , Mr. Obama ’s skills in the bowling alley are , let ’s say , not as sharp .
Obama displayed his proficiency as a bowler in the Spring of 2008 whilst campaigning in Altoona , PA , when he bowled a less - than - stellar score of 37 .
But whether Obama will actually make good on his promise to replace the White House bowling alley , remains to be seen .
After news broke that Obama was considering gutting the bowling lane and building a basketball court , a coalition of bowling groups offered to redesign the White House lane (s ) with a decidedly twenty - first century feel :
The first White House bowling alley was actually built as a gift for President Harry Truman in 1947 in the location of what is now the Situation Room .
Though not much of a bowler himself , the Truman bowling alley was well used by guests and staff until it was relocated across the street to the Executive Building .
In 1969 , President Richard M. Nixon brought bowling back to the White House with a single lane in a basement area below a driveway that exists today .
3. Swimming
Nestled in the trees not far from the basketball court and the West Wing is the White House swimming pool , installed in 1975 by Californian and avid swimmer Gerald Ford .
Outfitted with a cabana , a solar hot water system for the pool and a spa that was later added by President Bill Clinton , the pool area is the perfect place to entertain guests , let alone Malia and Sasha .
The original White House swimming pool was built by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 .
Roosevelt , who suffered from polio , used the indoor West Wing swimming pool as therapy to strengthen his upper body .
The Roosevelt pool was ultimately filled in by Nixon who used the space as an area for press to gather .
I 've used Xubuntu on an old laptop in the past , and have been relatively happy with it .
My desktop , which has XP on it , is a ~ 5 yo Dell XPS 400 , with the original XP install .
It 's really started to creep the last year or so , and it takes forever for the thing to startup , and apps to load - when they finally load they frequently crash .
When I run the occasional antivirus / antispyware program I usually come up with something that needs repaired / quarantined .
So is this a good candidate for a complete wipe of windows ?
I have Wubi installed and the performance of Ubuntu does n't seem that great .
Could this be because of my shoddy windows partition ?
If I should just clear Windows , how exactly should I setup my partitions on the new Linux install ?
I 've heard of people making a separate partition for their home folder or something , so it makes upgrading easier .
Does this make sense ?
Finally , I basically just use my desktop for surfing , word processing , playing mp3's , and watching movies .
Is Ubuntu a good candidate for this - or is it mostly bloat ?
Would I be better off with something a little more customizeable ?
My highest priority would be speed , but I 'd also like a distro that looks clean and modern .
I do n't need any fancy rotating cube effects , etc .
Thanks for the help
I 'm thinking of getting rid of Windows XP and switching to a Linux distro .... and I have some questions .
Israel ’s leaders are not simply war criminals ; they are fools
I was brought up as an orthodox Jew and a Zionist .
On a shelf in our kitchen , there was a tin box for the Jewish National Fund , into which we put coins to help the pioneers building a Jewish presence in Palestine .
I first went to Israel in 1961 and I have been there since more times than I can count .
I had family in Israel and have friends in Israel .
One of them fought in the wars of 1956 , 1967 and 1973 and was wounded in two of them .
The tie clip that I am wearing is made from a campaign decoration awarded to him , which he presented to me .
I have known most of the Prime Ministers of Israel , starting with the founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion .
Golda Meir was my friend , as was Yigal Allon , Deputy Prime Minister , who , as a general , won the Negev for Israel in the 1948 war of independence .
My parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland .
Most of their families were subsequently murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust .
My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow .
A German soldier shot her dead in her bed .
My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza .
The current Israeli Government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt among gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians .
The implication is that Jewish lives are precious , but the lives of Palestinians do not count .
On Sky News a few days ago , the spokeswoman for the Israeli army , Major Leibovich , was asked about the Israeli killing of , at that time , 800 Palestinians — the total is now 1,000 .
She replied instantly that
“ 500 of them were militants . ”
That was the reply of a Nazi .
I suppose that the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants .
The Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni asserts that her Government will have no dealings with Hamas , because they are terrorists .
Tzipi Livni ’s father was Eitan Livni , chief operations officer of the terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi , who organised the blowing - up of the King David hotel in Jerusalem , in which 91 victims were killed , including four Jews .
Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism .
Jewish terrorists hanged two British sergeants and booby - trapped their corpses .
Irgun , together with the terrorist Stern gang , massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948 in the village of Deir Yassin .
Today , the current Israeli Government indicate that they would be willing , in circumstances acceptable to them , to negotiate with the Palestinian President Abbas of Fatah .
It is too late for that .
They could have negotiated with Fatah ’s previous leader , Yasser Arafat , who was a friend of mine .
Instead , they besieged him in a bunker in Ramallah , where I visited him .
Because of the failings of Fatah since Arafat ’s death , Hamas won the Palestinian election in 2006 .
Hamas is a deeply nasty organisation , but it was democratically elected , and it is the only game in town .
The boycotting of Hamas , including by our Government , has been a culpable error , from which dreadful consequences have followed .
The great Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban , with whom I campaigned for peace on many platforms , said :
“ You make peace by talking to your enemies . ”
However many Palestinians the Israelis murder in Gaza , they cannot solve this existential problem by military means .
Whenever and however the fighting ends , there will still be 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza and 2.5 million more on the West Bank .
They are treated like dirt by the Israelis , with hundreds of road blocks and with the ghastly denizens of the illegal Jewish settlements harassing them as well .
The time will come , not so long from now , when they will outnumber the Jewish population in Israel .
It is time for our Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that their conduct and policies are unacceptable , and to impose a total arms ban on Israel .
It is time for peace , but real peace , not the solution by conquest which is the Israelis ’ real goal but which it is impossible for them to achieve .
They are not simply war criminals ; they are fools .
Sir Gerald Kaufman has been a Member of Parliament since 1970 and when the Labour Party was in the oppostion served as Shadow Environment Secretary , ( 1980 - 1983 ) , Shadow Home Secretary ( 1983 - 1987 ) and Shadow Foreign Secretary ( 1987-1992 ) .
Since 1992 he has been one of the Labour Party ’s most influential back - benchers .
We 're in a teenage boy 's bedroom .
The alarm clock goes off , rock music starts to blare from the radio , and the tousled teen turns slowly from under his duvet to reveal ( millions of by now thirtysomething hearts flutter in unison ) Jason Priestley as Brandon Walsh .
" First day at school , " Priestley / Brandon 's voice sleepily narrates .
" Strange city ... new house ... no friends ... I 'm psyched . "
In the next - door bedroom , Shannen Doherty as Brandon 's sister Brenda is wheedling to her mother : " I 'm going shopping today and school tomorrow ... first impressions are incredibly important .
Everybody here looks like they stepped out of a music video ... I do n't even have the right hair . "
And there , in a pilot - episode nutshell from October 1990 , was the premise for Beverly Hills 90210 , the glamorous teen soap that , for 10 years , followed the spoiled rich brats and bitches who attended West Beverly Hills High , driving themselves to class in Porsches and Ferraris , forming cliques and falling in and out of love .
The show became a heartthrob factory , starting with Priestley and Luke Perry as the lip - curling rebel - without - a- cause Dylan McKay .
The girls were hot too , of course , but were more famous for the off - screen drama that was largely Doherty .
Beverly Hills 90210 was something shiny and new , especially in the UK , still engaged with the gritty realism of Grange Hill .
It spawned a genre that included Dawson 's Creek , The OC , The Hills and Gossip Girl .
That last show , set among the socialite teenagers of New York 's Upper East Side , was the first original drama from the fledgling network
The CW , aimed at 18 - to 34 - year - old women .
And it is The CW ( a subdivision of CBS and Warner Brothers Television ) that has now resurrected Beverly Hills 90210 , with the fashionably truncated title 90210 .
Successfully premiered in America , 90210 arrives on our screens in January , with E4 having fought off Five , ITV2 and Living for the privilege .

" It 's pretty much like the original , " says co-producer Jeff Judah ( Darren Star , later of Sex and the City , who created Beverly Hills 90210 is uninvolved ; its executive producer , Aaron Spelling , died in 2006 ) .
In spite of the strong suggestion of oral sex in the first four minutes , which would have been totally unacceptable in a teen drama in 1990 , it 's déjà vu time in sunny California .
" We even begin with the family coming from Kansas to Beverly Hills , " says Judah .
The difference now is that Harry Wilson ( Rob Estes ) is taking up the post as new principal at West Beverly Hills High , where his daughter Annie ( played with eye - scrunching tweeness by Shenae Grimes ) and adopted son Dixon ( Tristan Wilds , aka the tragically street - smart teen Michael Lee in The Wire ) are to become pupils .
Annie and Dixon are the Brenda and Brandon de nos jours , in other words , and the rest of the cast of characters – rebels , bitches , jocks , geeks – are also entirely familiar , as is the opening sequence , this time set to Coldplay 's " Viva La Vida " ( available to buy online , like all the music , from the CW website ) .
" One difference from the original show is that we have really strong adult storylines , " says Judah .
" Gabe [ Sachs , his co-producer ] and I are both parents and we did n't want to write just about the kids .
We 've seen this generation of baby - boom parents , who think they 're parenting by giving their kids money and excess and clothing and no rules .
" Also , if you grew up in the Seventies or Eighties or Nineties and you 're a parent , then you 've done pretty much everything – from experimenting with pot , or excessive drinking or premarital sex – that our kids are doing .
It 's a lot harder to lie to us – we know what they 're doing . "
All of which should broaden the appeal of the new show .
" People , especially women in their thirties , are really connected to it , " says Judah , who 's tapped into older viewers with some astute ( stunt ? ) casting , luring back Beverly Hills 90210 veterans Jennie Garth and Doherty as guest stars .
Garth 's character , Kelly Taylor , seems to have morphed from aspiring model into a school guidance counsellor , while Doherty 's Brenda , having left Beverly Hills 90210 at the end of the fourth series to travel to London and study at Rada , has returned ( as a successful theatre actor ) to direct the school musical .
Tori Spelling was reportedly eager to reprise her role as Donna Martin , but allegedly dropped out over salary issues .
It was Spelling 's recent autobiography , sTori Telling , that documented supposed friction on the set , especially between the now reconciled Garth and Doherty .
" I think when you 're 18 , your personalities conflict and then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and you 're fine , " says a mellowed Doherty , who denies ever punching Garth .
There might have been some scratching , however .
" The vast majority of Tori 's book is incredibly exaggerated , " she says .
Garth had qualms about returning to her role .
" I thought Beverly Hills 90210 was very neatly in its coffin and it was done , " she says .
" When they told me they were doing it , I thought , ' No ! '
Like something sort of sacred was being disrupted .
It took me a while to settle into the idea . "
Doherty had reservations , too : " I was kind of like , ' Why would I play Brenda Walsh again ? '
There was an ' I Hate Brenda ' newsletter .
Why would I possibly get myself back into that ? "
The new version does show progress on one score , albeit in a somewhat tokenistic manner , breaking up the all - white cast with a black leading actor – Tristan Wilds .
But why does his character have to have been adopted by a white family ?
Are there still no rich black families living in Beverly Hills ?
Maybe not .
Either way , it 's a pretty long way from Michael Lee , the hardened Baltimore teen at the centre of season four of HBO 's acclaimed police drama , to 90210's Dixon Wilson .
" Michael and Dixon are n't as dissimilar as they first appear , " says Wilds .
" I always think of Dixon as Michael with a better chance .
They kind of grew up in the same bad environment , but Dixon was adopted , so he 's gotten his second chance . "
Same zip code , different era , then .
And other things have changed since Beverly Hills 90210 .
" Thanks to Paris Hilton and reality TV , not much of what happens at the fictional West Beverly Hills High School seems all that shocking , " says the TV critic Laura Fries of the Hollywood industry newspaper Daily Variety .
" Even the biggest fan of the original would be hard - pressed to call it realistic , but that earlier incarnation did deal with many topical issues of the day .
This version does n't cover issues as much as exploit them .
With shows like The Hills and Gossip Girl exploring the upscale teenage lifestyle , this 90210 does n't really offer any fresh zip . "
And 90210 has had to work to compete with other newcomers , like ABC 's Juno - like The Secret Life of an American Teenager , which follows a pregnant 15 - year - old .
" The Secret Life ... outperforms both 90210 and Gossip Girl , " says Fries , who agrees that there will always be a place for good old - fashioned escapist fantasy .
For others , the zip code only ever stood for one thing : cheesiness .
" For a decade I adored 90210 for being a preposterous , cheesy show , " says Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald .
" I love the new 90210 for all the reasons I loved the old one .
Many of the actors are too old to be playing high - school students .
AnnaLynne McCord , who plays poor rich girl Naomi , looks more like a desperate housewife than someone just turned 16 .
" The new show has the same comfortable , predictable simplicity .
Do n't be fooled by that oral satisfaction scene in the opener .
Despite the racy hype , the series is an innocent throwback to another time . "
' 90210 ' will be screened on E4 in the new year
Class of 2008 : the new intake
Annie Wilson
The new Brenda Walsh , Annie has had her life pretty much up - ended by moving to Beverly Hills .
Boyfriend - less and no longer centre stage , she has the tough task of being the " new kid " .
Couple that with the fact that her old flame is her only contact and goes out with the most popular girl in school , and Annie becomes a classic female soap character who starts out by being a misfit .
Oh , and predictably she 's understatedly pretty .
Dixon Wilson
Annie 's brother , he mirrors the Jason Priestley / Brandon Walsh character to Annie 's Shannen Doherty .
Dixon 's struggles are many , stemming from being an adopted African - American in an all - white family .
This continues at school when – in trying out for the lacrosse team – his skill evokes acute jealousy among his team - mates , further marginalising him .
Harry & Debbie Wilson
The new parental presence in ' 90210 ' , they are good Samaritans , having made the move to California to look after Harry 's increasingly unwell mother .
The full range of soap tropes is again in evidence : Harry is the principal of West Beverly Hills High , but he faces the horror of discovering that he has a child by his high - school girlfriend .
Debbie does n't always get on with her mother - in - law and has a profitable job .
Some of this stuff almost writes itself .
Ethan Ward
The cherubic yet supposedly jock - like idol of the lacrosse team .
Talented and the apple of all the girls ' eyes , he takes the arm of the school princess – yet , as he once kissed Annie , a predictable ménage à trois is forming .
Naomi Clark
Think Regina George ( ' Mean Girls ' ) and Taylor Vaughan ( ' She 's All That ' ) .
Naomi is the rich
It girl with prom queen pretensions .
All she cares about is her status and ensuring that no other girl could possibly catch her beau Ethan 's eye .
She 's suspicious of Annie ; potential friend , potential foe .

Advice on fighting ageing has become as traditional in January as the sales – yet the various recommended strategies can demand far too much effort for few convincing returns .
So here 's some of the science on anti-ageing – along with four tried and tested ways to look and feel younger than you are .

The strong stay young
" Challenging exercise is the closest thing to an anti-ageing pill for everyone , not just for athletes and health nuts , " say the celebrity trainers Tim Bean and Anne Lang , authors of Turn Back Your Age Clock ( Hamlyn , £ 12.99 ) , to be published this month .
The emphasis here is on " challenging " – a stroll in the park wo n't do .
You have to work your muscles to the limit , exercising harder and faster to make your body perspire and your heart race , within an aerobic training zone that 's between 60 and 80 per cent of your maximum heart rate ( your age subtracted from 220 ) , according to Bean and Lang .
High - intensity aerobic exercise " increases the body 's need for oxygen and therefore improves the capability of heart , lungs and blood vessels to supply oxygen to the muscles , " they say .
And studies confirm the benefits of challenging your body with regular aerobic exercise to prevent ageing - related diseases .
There 's no need to join a gym or pay a trainer .
All you need is a pair of well - fitting training shoes , and women should wear a support bra , say Bean and Lang .
Four top tips for aerobic exercise are :
Brisk power walking :
By the time you have warmed up and got into your stride , do the " talk test " – you should be breathing harder and starting to perspire and be unable to hold a chatty conversation , although not so breathless that you can't utter a few sentences .
Jogging : Start slowly until your body has lost its cumbersome slowness and begins to feel fluid and streamlined .
Then set yourself a distance and a time , and work at beating your personal best in each workout .
Skipping :
This most inexpensive and portable cardiovascular workout is a wonderfully intense high calorie - burner for those who have built up a good fitness level .
Cycling :
This is especially good for the elderly or overweight .
To burn calories , you need to increase your intensity and distance .
Adjust the height of the seat so that the leg at the bottom of the down - stroke is almost but not quite completely extended .
Bean and Lang promise that you will " look and feel 20 years younger in only eight weeks " – but to get there , you 'll need to alternate 50 minutes of aerobic exercise with an anti-ageing workout made up of rejuvenator circuit exercises that " hit on ageing hot spot areas " .
The favourite exercise for celebrity clients who are preparing to appear on the red carpet is " the turtle " : repeat it 20 times three times a week for a defined and athletic appearance to back , buttock and shoulders .
Here 's how it 's done :
1 . Lie relaxed , prone on your front , on the floor with arms extended in front of you and legs together .
2. Inhale and raise your head , arms and legs just up off the floor .
Sweep the arms around in a wide arc until your hands reach your sides .
Squeeze your buttocks and thighs .
3 . Exhale as you return to the original position , then repeat the movement , keeping your arms up off the floor at all times until the exercise is finished .
Save your skin
Regular exercise , a balanced diet , and obsessive use of sunscreens and an adequate moisturiser should keep your skin glowing , whatever your age .
If you are going to invest serious money in your largest organ , dermal fillers are the only method that is scientifically proven to smooth crepey or damaged skin and fill out wrinkles .
The latest filler , Restylane Vital Light , launched in the UK this week , is a baby version of this successful range .
Consisting of a less concentrated hyaluronic acid gel , Vital Light has been specially designed for use in those more sensitive , difficult - to - treat skin areas that can add years to your appearance : crow 's feet , the neck and décolletage and the back of the hands .
By injecting the gel underneath the dermis , the filler is able to stimulate natural collagen production and replenish supplies of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid , thereby boosting skin elasticity and firming up these delicate skin areas .
" It 's very satisfying finally to have a treatment option for these difficult areas which can be ageing even in women in their thirties , " says Dr Tracy Mountford , medical director of the Cosmetic Skin Clinic and a member of the British Association of Cosmetic Doctors .
" The treated skin looks younger , more dewy and hydrated , and feels smoother and firmer . "
Vital Light costs £ 500 to £ 600 for an initial treatment , which will require an upgrade every six to nine months .
Fix your posture
Banishing back pain could well be your single most effective anti-ageing strategy in 2009 .
And the best long - term strategy to beat back pain , according to a major study published in the British Medical Journal in December , is a course of just six lessons in the Alexander Technique .
After a year , it is more effective than painkillers or massage because " it equips patients with life skills they are more likely to be able to use beyond the intervention period " , according to lead researcher Sandra Hollinghurst , a health economist at Bristol University .
With AT now set to be more widely available in general practice and for hospital out - patients , Alexander teachers are quick to point out that their lessons bring many anti-ageing benefits other than freedom from pain .
Most commonly , people experience improved mobility , alertness , confidence , general health and inner calmness , according to a recent survey of Alexander " pupils " , carried out by Stat ( the Society of Teachers of Alexander Technique ) .
" The key to a youthful appearance is getting a better relationship between your head , your neck and your back , " says the AT teacher Anthony Kingsley ( www.alexanderstudio.co.uk ) .
" By freeing up your neck muscles , you develop poise , vitality , flexibility and twinkling eyes – all more important factors in looking young than what you wear or how many wrinkles you 've got , " says Kingsley .
He gave regular AT lessons to the TV presenter Lisa Snowdon on her way to the final of the most recent series of Strictly Come Dancing .
A course of lessons , Kingsley says , lengthens and widens the spine , thereby freeing up the organs .
" Too many people spend most of their lives with their lungs , abdomen , liver and kidneys compressed .
When you lengthen the back , you free up the lungs so that your whole system is better oxygenated .
Your digestion improves , and your body functions better overall . "
There 's also evidence that AT training teaches us to exercise with more freedom and efficiency , helping to prevent injuries that are caused by people holding themselves too rigidly or putting to much effort into physical activity .
Above all , a more youthful posture helps to create a sense of joie de vivre , according to AT enthusiasts , including George Bernard Shaw , who started lessons in his late seventies .
" With your head uplifted , your eyes are more vital and you 're more sprightly whatever your age .
Alexander is all about learning good habits and real stress management where mind and body manage life 's problems harmoniously , " says Kingsley .
You can find an AT teacher on the Stat website at www.stat.org.uk.
Plan what you eat
Many of us will plan a full appointment diary for up to six months ahead but leave food choices to the last minute , warn Bean and Lang .
Such people then risk buying " any old thing that looks or smells good – a deli sandwich or a French pastry that will wallop you with as many calories as a full meal but leave you feeling hungry again soon afterwards " .
Instead of leaving meal plans until you 're hungry and tired , take 10 minutes every three days to follow this process :
1. Decide what you 'll eat for the next three days .
2 . Base the menu on unprocessed " superfoods " : wild game and fish , fresh vegetables and seasonal fruits and seeds , all eaten as close to their natural state as possible .
3 . You should plan four main meals a day ( breakfast , lunch , high tea and dinner ) .
But you can make your life easier by using the same meal that you have for supper one day for your lunch and tea the next , say Bean and Lang .
4 . Do your shopping list and work out your cooking and food preparation times .
5 . If you 're going to eat out , phone the restaurant ahead to pre-order your meal .
Here are two useful ( but controversial ) anti-ageing tips :
Bin the vitamins , and save the money .
A series of major studies published in November and December last year showed beyond doubt that , while a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is a great way to stay young , taking vitamin supplements has no effect whatsoever .
Low - fat or no -fat diets are ageing .
" Full - fat food supports our bones , protects the liver , enhances the immune system , boosts the libido and absorbs omega - 3s , " says the nutritionist Esther Blum , a member of the American Dietetic Association and author of the American bestseller Secrets of Gorgeous : Hundreds of ways to live well while living it up .
The trans fats in processed foods should indeed be avoided , she says .
But Blum has persuaded the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker ( left ) and Sharon Stone to stay youthful by starting the day with an omelette made from egg yolks and cooked in butter – a meal rich in saturated fats .
You may have heard the term " progressive infrastructure . "
We need it .
Let me explain .
Bush and the Republicans are out , but we have to consolidate that victory , keep them out and implement progressive policies .
We need to elect progressives to state office and we have to get " centrist " Democrats to do the right thing or run primary candidates who will .
" Progressive infrastructure " is the key to getting that done .
Look at how conservatives became so successful in elections and legislation battles .
Starting in the 1970s they built well - funded organizations employing researchers , writers , pundits , speechmakers , marketers , talk - show guests , operatives etc. all using channels like talk radio , Fox News , the Washington Times and blogs to tell the public one or another form of a basic propaganda message : " liberals and their ideas are bad , while conservatives and their ideas are good . "
Movement operatives infiltrated churches , sports ( NASCAR ) , interest groups ( NRA ) ... always working to convince people to identify as conservatives .
After a few decades of this the public had a negative view of liberals .
In surveys many people say they are conservative even though they line up with us on the facts and issues .
Their candidates rode that wave into office and their policies rode it into law .
In some races all a candidate had to do was point and shout " liberal ! " to win !
Meanwhile progressive candidates start from scratch in the late summer , have to decide " issues " to run on , develop a message and then reach their voters  on their own from scratch .
Like the frog in heated water , progressives did n't see what was happening .
It took Clinton 's impeachment and the 2000 election theft to really shake and wake people up .
Then came the blogosphere .
People started to study and understand the right and began to see a model for responding .
( The Commonweal Institute was a pioneer in this effort , and I have blogged and spoken about it through the years . )
Kerry 's 2004 loss was another shock .
and now progressives are building organizations outside of the election process , working between elections , developing policy ideas and researching how to talk in ways that create demand for progressive policies and candidates .
Media Matters , Center for American Progress , Air America and others are engaging in the national discussion .
Look at the difference this effort has already made !
But the record is spotty and funding is minimal to nonexistent .
For example , George Lakoff's Rockridge Institute had to shut down due to lack of funding .
That is why I am writing today .
I am asking all of us to start donating to progressive infrastructure organizations ( not issue organizations ) because of the tremendous leverage it offers .
Let me throw this down : donating a dollar to a progressive infrastructure today is like giving ten dollars to each progressive candidate in every local , state and national race two years from now , and every election following .
Look what we have been able to get done in this country with the smallest , minimally - funded hint at an infrastructure of organizations and media outlets .
We fought back against the conservative machine and we got the Democrats to start fighting back themselves .
Imagine what we could do if we actually started funding serious progressive infrastructure ( not issue - based ) organizations nationally and in every state , building an ecosystem where young people get training and jobs , writers and advocates actually make a living and activists receive speaking fees .
Imagine progressive non-profits having the budgets to reach out past the blogosphere and talk to the general public .
By explaining the benefits of a progressive approach these organizations can help build greater public acceptance of and demand for progressive policies and candidates .
As more people understand why progressive solutions benefit them more than conservative proposals , they develop a lasting positive identification with the progressive " brand . "
Then during the election cycle they vote for progressive candidates .
Donating to progressive advocacy organizations today builds long - term support for every progressive candidate and policy tomorrow -- lowering the need for massive last - minute election - cycle funding .
By helping the public understand what progressive candidates are trying to achieve we all benefit .
Discuss .
Fire ants love a disturbance .
Plow up some ground just about anywhere in the South , and chances are the red imported fire ant , Solenopsis invicta , will take over from native ant species .
That ’s why S. invicta , a major invasive pest , is found in subdivisions , shopping centers and other areas where the natural environment has been disturbed .
But is it the human - caused disturbance that makes S. invicta have such a negative impact on other ants , or something about the ant itself ?
One school of thought holds that the reason many invasive species succeed is that they are superior to other species and can outcompete them no matter what the situation .
Image A nest of fire ants , disturbance specialists ,  in Tallahassee , Fla. Credit ...

A large study by Joshua R. King and Walter R. Tschinkel of Florida State shows that for fire ants , at least , human disturbance of the environment is the main force behind their negative impact .
Keep an eye on your system monitor – it's the only way you 'll be able to tell if there 's any advantage from disabling services
In common with other parts of the early Unix operating system , the term ' daemon ' gives little away about what its function might be .
A daemon is a task that runs in the background , and there 's a small army of them that are started when you fire up your machine .
There are daemons for controlling automated tasks , daemons for managing power and CPU use , daemons for printing and daemons for writing the system logs .
Some denote their status by ending with the letter ' d ' , while others prefer the anonymity of names like ' binfmpt - support ' or ' brltty ' .
Daemons are obviously an important part of the running environment .
But there 's also a slight problem .
Without any divine inspiration , the average Linux distribution can't accurately guess which daemons are going to be of use to you , and which are n't .
The result is that they 'll normally play it safe and err on the side of caution .
This means that your desktop may include a laptop power management daemon , or Bluetooth tools , neither of which may be of great use .
These will still get loaded up and use valuable memory , so you can save boot time and memory by spending a little time pruning your daemons , and fitting them to your own requirements .
The trick is knowing which ones to cut .
Services are what most people think of when they consider daemons .
They 're often started at boot time and run silently in the background – but they do n't necessarily need to be lightweight system management processes .
There 's no reason why complete application suites can't be considered daemons .
Which services are and are n't running is entirely dependent on your distribution and what you 're using your distribution for .
If you 're using a distribution that 's suitable for a server environment , it 's likely that the Apache web server , along with its school of helper applications , is running as a daemon .
That 's a major resource hog if you do n't happen to require a web server , and it was n't so long ago that distributions like Mandriva installed and ran a web server by default .
This is unlikely to happen in these frugal times , but there 's probably still going to be something you do n't need running in the background .
List the possible offenders
There are many ways of listing which services are running , but one of the clearest ways to do so is to use a command line tool called chkconfig .
You might need to install this manually through your package manager , but when it 's run from the command line , it creates a list of running services and outputs these to the terminal .
Running the command on a default Ubuntu installation gave us 93 separate tasks , whereas running the same command on OpenSUSE 11 gave us 83 tasks .
The first thing you might notice is that it 's difficult to define exactly what each service is responsible for .
Here 's a cutting from the top of the chkconfig output on our Ubuntu machine :
acpi-support 2345
acpid 2345
alsa-utils off
anacron 2345
apmd on
The service names are listed on the left , while to the right of each is a description of that service 's runlevel .
Linux , and Unix before it , uses different runlevels to run different services .
For example , runlevel 1 is typically used as a single - user system maintenance mode .
This might mean there are no network services , and there certainly wo n't be a graphical desktop .
In the above example output , you can see that the anacron daemon , which handles running tasks at a specific time , will only be running when the system is booted into runlevels 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .
The problem with runlevels is that there 's no particular standard across distributions .
The only levels common to all distributions are 1 and 6 , which are used to halt and reboot the machine respectively .
Runlevel 3 in Gentoo is the full multi-user environment with a desktop .
That 's runlevel 4 in Slackware and runlevel 5 in Ubuntu , Fedora and OpenSUSE .

Out of this world : British teddy bears strapped to helium weather balloon
reach the edge of space
By Andrew Levy for the Daily Mail and Claire Bates
It 's not often that Britain can claim a win in the space race .
But these teddy bears drifting nearly 20 miles above Earth have become the first soft toys to take part in extra-vehicular activity ( to use correct NASA jargon ) at such an altitude .
The soft toys MAT and KMS were named after the first initials of the pupils who helped make their space suits .
Along with their two intrepid colleagues , they were strapped to a beam attached to a foam - padded box containing instrumentation and cameras on Monday .
Spaced out :
The first ever spacewalking teddies view the curvature of Earth at 30 km up
The other two teddy bears wore tin foil and plastic bottles to protect them from the freezing cold temperatures
After rising to an altitude of around 100,000 ft , a webcam caught their ' space - walk ' for posterity before the helium balloon burst .
They then fell to Earth before a parachute opened automatically to provide a soft landing .
During the 2 hour 9 minute flight the radio on board broadcast the location of the craft to a chase team on the ground .
The team predicted the landing site using wind speed data and arrived in time to watch the teddy bears parachute safely back to Earth in a field four miles north east of Ipswich .
They landed just 50 miles from their launch pad by Churchill College in Cambridge .
During ten previous experiments , half have ended up ditching in the North Sea .
One disappeared over Scandinavia before washing up on the coast of Denmark .
The teddy bears had to endure temperatures of - 53 C but had special spacesuits made by school children from the nearby Parkside and Coleridge community colleges .
This stopped them from freezing solid on their epic trip .
Temperature sensors were stuck to the teddies ' chests and connected to a laptop which allowed ' mission control ' to measure the extremes of temperature they experienced .
Going up :
The teddy bears were launched with the help of pupils from Parkside School
But the mission , led by aerodynamics student Henry Hallam , 21 , had a more serious purpose than giving the teddies the ride of their lives .
The aim of the experiment was to monitor weather conditions in the stratosphere and determine which materials provide the best insulation against the freezing temperatures experienced on the flight .
Mr Hallam said : ' We asked the children to build the space suits for the teddy bears and we monitored the temperatures inside and outside the suits .
It was great to involve these young people so they can learn about physics in a different and exciting way .
' The project was all about applying science into the real world .
I think it 's taught them a lot about running a real experiment . '
The latex weather balloon made by Cambridge University 's Space Flight science club is prepared for flight
Students at Parkside School , Cambridgeshire prepare to launch the first ever spacewalking teddies
Thia Unsworth , 12 , from Parkside College , helped to design the spacesuit for M.A.T .
She said : ' It was unbelievable to see the balloon take off and it's incredible to see the pictures of the teddy bears in space .
' I 've always loved science before , but I now understand how it helps in the real world . '
Classmate Sam White , 13 , helped programme the camera to take pictures in space and let go of the balloon on Monday .
He said : ' It was amazing to see it go up so quickly . '
The spacecraft carrying four teddies , cameras and a radio rose quickly into the air
Back with a bump :
The craft landed just 50 miles away from the launch pad
The student - run Spaceflight society is working towards reducing the cost of sub-orbital spaceflight .
Does a Cat Always Land on Its Feet ?
by Fiorella Gambale , Ph.D .
Institute for Feline Research
Milano , Italy
Cats have excellent balance , and are remarkably acrobatic .
When turned upside down and dropped from a height , a cat generally has the ability to land on its feet .
Until now , no one has systematically investigated the limits of this phenomenon .
In this study , I dropped a cat upside down from various heights , and observed whether the cat landed on its feet .
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 6 Feet
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 5 Feet
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 4 Feet
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 3 Feet
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 2 Feet
Dropping a Cat Upside Down from a Height of 1 Foot
I dropped the cat from a height of six feet .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat always landed on its feet .
I dropped the cat from a height of five feet .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat always landed on its feet .
I dropped the cat from a height of four feet .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat always landed on its feet .
I dropped the cat from a height of three feet .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat always landed on its feet .
I dropped the cat from a height of two feet .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat always landed on its feet .
I dropped the cat from a height of one foot .
I did this one hundred times .
The cat never landed on its feet .
Drop Height Attempts Landed on feet Did not land on feet 6 ft. 100 100 0 5 ft. 100 100 0 4 ft. 100 100 0 3 ft. 100 100 0 2 ft. 100 100 0 1 ft. 100 0 100
Discussion
Popular belief is that " a cat will always land on its feet . "
My experiments show this to be true for drop heights ranging from six feet down to two feet .
It is not true at a drop height of one foot .
Does a cat land on its feet when dropped from a height of less than one foot ?
This preliminary study indicates that the answer may be no .
However , further experiments , preferably with the same cat , are needed to settle the question .
Acknowledgments
I want to thank the cat , " Esther , " for her initial cooperation in this experiment .
Thank you , also , to Esther 's owner , M.R. Young .
And special thanks to the organization PFTAR ( People For the Tarring - and - Feathering of Animal Researchers ) , whose indiscriminate yacketing inspired this project .

Microsoft ’s cost - cutting move of slashing 5,000 jobs has attracted the attention of Republican senator Charles Grassley from Iowa .
He wrote to CEO Steve Ballmer about the job losses , specifically concerned that , “ Microsoft will be retaining foreign guest workers rather than similarly qualified American employees when it implements its layoff plan . ”
Microsoft ’s job -cuts were a reaction to lower than expected profits reported in its Q4 finances last week .
Microsoft is the latest technology giant to demonstrate that it ’s finding the going tough , but it ’s certainly not the first to react by slashing jobs .
Microsoft has many foreign employees in the U.S. under the H1 - B visa program , which is designed so that employers can recruit foreign nationals in “ specialty ” jobs .
It allows foreign experts , who must have at least a bachelors degree , to work in areas of highly specialized knowledge — of which the sciences , IT and software are obvious examples — for up to six years .
Furthermore , the regulations supporting the program state that “ the statute does not require employers … to demonstrate that there are no available U.S. workers or to test the labor market for U.S. workers as required under the permanent labor certification program , ” which effectively makes it easier for employers to use this program than other visa systems .
But Senator Grassley is asking Ballmer to supply data on what jobs will be cut , and how many of those will be people in the U.S. under the H1 - B program .
Microsoft has a “ moral obligation to protect these American workers by putting them first during these difficult economic times , ” he says .
It ’s an amazingly xenophobic argument in our modern world .
Although Senator Grassley he uses the “ similarly qualified ” line , he ’s largely ignoring the fact that H1 - B jobs are for highly - specialized workers — people who bring their own unique expertise in high - tech areas , and who may be hard to replace locally .

The Muslim community in Mumbai says it does n’t want the gunmen who attacked Mumbai to be buried in the Muslim cemetery , on the grounds that they are not Muslims .
A spokesman for the Muslim council said , “ ” These terrorists are a black spot on our religion , we will very sternly protest the burial of these terrorists in our cemetery . . . ”
Certainly the perpetrators are criminals from the point of view of Islamic law .
The Qur’an forbids murder ( qatl ) and the classical jurisprudence on jihad forbids the killing of innocent noncombatants , sneak attacks , or the undertaking of military action without the authorization of duly constituted Muslim authorities .
Although removing an avowed Muslim from status as a Muslim , which is called ‘ takfir ’ or faith - denial , is frowned on by the mainstream Sunni tradition , it may be legitimate in this case , given the egregious departure from Sunni law , practice and belief in which the perpetrators engaged .
It is an ironic twist , since the radical vigilantes are the ones who have been declaring normal people non-Muslims for the past few decades .
In India , moreover , there is an overlapping consideration of caste .
Although Muslims do not formally operate in a caste system , it inevitably shapes their social worldview .
There are high ( ashraf ) and low ( ajlaf ) statuses in Indian Islam that are caste - like .
One thing the Mumbai council may be saying is that by virtue of their actions the militants “ lost caste . ”
Cemeteries in India , like everything else , are influenced by caste conceptions , so it is implicitly being alleged that the attackers are ritually impure and would defile the Muslim cemetery .
I suppose they could always be cremated and their dust spread over the ocean from which they came .
That would resolve the problem of what to do with the bodies , and would mark their departure from normative Islam .
When federal prosecutors filed charges against Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich earlier this week , it may have felt like just another chapter in the state 's unseemly political history .
However , even though Illinois and Chicago have long been synonymous with political graft , corruption is obviously more than just a Midwestern problem .
In fact , a surprising number of American elected officials have been on the wrong end of convictions stemming from their time in office .
So if the evidence against Blagojevich is as damning as it seems , at least he 's got some company in the annals of history .
1. Budd Dwyer
After a 15 - year legislative career split between the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and the Pennsylvania Senate , Dwyer became the Treasurer of Pennsylvania .
During Dwyer 's tenure as treasurer , Pennsylvania 's state employees accidentally paid too much income tax , and once the irregularity came to light , the state started looking for a firm to help figure out how much each employee should be refunded .
Eventually , the $ 4.6 million contract for the job went to a California computer firm that gave Dwyer a $ 300,000 kickback .
Prosecutors uncovered the scheme , and after several co-conspirators in the case arranged plea bargains and testified against him , Dwyer was in a tough place .
He refused a plea deal that would have given him a relatively light sentence and continued to profess his innocence .
A jury found him guilty , though , and he faced up to 55 years in prison .
However , by state law Dwyer kept his job until his sentencing .
He called a press conference on January 22 , 1987 , to address the situation .
Although many reporters thought he might be announcing his resignation , a visibly agitated Dwyer instead read a long , rambling statement criticizing the judge in his trial and maintaining his innocence .
He then gave three notes to his aides , pulled out a handgun from a manila envelope and shot himself in the head in front of live television news cameras .
2. The Abscam Bunch
In 1978 the FBI started a sting operation called Abscam to expose political corruption .
Various FBI agents would act like Middle Eastern businessmen who wanted to arrange political favors for fictitious sheik Kambir Abdul Rahman .
The agents would meet with various members of Congress and the Senate and try to swap cash for political asylum and other favors for the sheik .
Of course , the FBI videotaped each of the meetings , and the tapes show a picture of almost comical corruption and greed .
In one notable example Richard Kelly , a Florida congressman , stuffed $ 25,000 cash into his pockets then nervously asked the agents , " Does it show ? " 
Kelly later claimed that he was n't taking bribes ; he was actually conducting an investigation of his own into this matter .
He simply took the cash because " I did n't want to blow my cover . " 
Believe it or not , prosecutors did n't buy it .
By the end of the investigation , Abscam had nabbed six congressmen and one senator , as well as a handful of local officials .
Most of the convicted legislators resigned their seats , although Michael Myers , a Pennsylvania Democrat , had to be expelled from the House of Representatives .
Several of the corrupt politicians , including Kelly and New Jersey Senator Harrison Williams , spent time in jail for taking the bribes .
Not every lawmaker came off quite so terribly in the investigation , though .
Larry Pressler , a Republican senator from South Dakota , immediately bristled when offered a bribe to do the sheik a favor .
The tapes memorably show him saying , " Wait a minute , what you 're suggesting may be illegal , "  and he quickly notified the FBI of the chicanery .
As a result of his integrity , Pressler became a celebrated figure of political virtue .
3. The Clark County ( Nevada ) Commissioners
If you 're going to be crooked , at least let your crimes involve some gratuitous nudity and dancing to old Def Leppard songs .
In 2003 , the FBI teamed up with the DEA and the IRS to raid Las Vegas - area strip clubs as part of a corruption investigation .
The probe was known as Operation G - Sting .
( Never let it be said that FBI agents do n't have a sense of humor . )
Over the course of the investigation , it became clear that several officials on the Clark County Commission , which oversees the unincorporated areas of Clark County , had been taking cash bribes from strip club owner Michael Galardi in exchange for using their political influence to push strip - club - friendly policies .
( Galardi wanted the bribed commissioners to fight new policies that were designed to curb sexual activities in the gentlemen 's clubs . )
In the end , four commissioners were convicted of conspiracy , wire fraud , and extortion .
All paid fines , and some received up to four years in federal prison , a locale notable for its lack of strip clubs .
4. Spiro T. Agnew
It must have taken some serious gall to be so corrupt that even the Nixon White House could n't stomach your exploits , but Spiro T. Agnew somehow reached that rarefied level .
Agnew served as Nixon 's vice president , but things took a turn for the worse in 1973 .
The United States Attorney 's office in Baltimore started investigating Agnew for a range of crimes including extortion , bribery , and tax evasion committed during his tenure as Baltimore county executive and governor of Maryland .
Eventually , Agnew faced indictments on these charges , and true to his bulldog role in the Nixon administration , he fought back tooth and nail .
He claimed that not only were the charges untrue , but a sitting vice president could n't be indicted .
If anyone wanted Agnew out of office , he contended , they 'd have to impeach him .
It must have sounded like a swell plan to Agnew , but there was a catch : none of it was true .
The solicitor general penned a brief saying that the VP could in fact be indicted , and it turned out that Agnew had accepted $ 29,500 in bribes to push through a construction company 's project .
Nixon and company were n't much help since they had their hands full with the burgeoning Watergate scandal and did n't like Agnew that much in the first place .
( Nixon allegedly once quipped that he kept Agnew on his ticket in 1972 because " No assassin in his right mind would kill me .
They know if they did that they would wind up with Agnew ! "  )
In the end , Agnew worked out a deal with federal prosecutors where he would resign the vice presidency and plead no contest to one charge of tax evasion for not declaring the bribe as income .
In a relatively plum deal , Agnew paid a $ 10,000 fine ( which covered the taxes and penalties ) and received three years of probation for the crime .
Who was the real beneficiary of all this corruption ?
Gerald Ford , who took Agnew 's place as vice president and eventually became president following Nixon 's resignation .
Agnew , for his part , was still as brash as ever .
A civil court ruling in 1981 revealed that he had actually accepted a whopping $ 147,500 in bribes while serving as Maryland 's governor , and $ 17,500 of the cash actually did n't come to him until he was already serving as Vice President .
Agnew eventually had to make $ 268,000 in reimbursements to the state for the bribes and interest , but he even tried to play that to his own advantage .
Agnew , who was living in California at the time , gamely attempted to use this reimbursement as an income tax deduction ; California 's tax courts politely disagreed .
And yet this affair , I sensed , was necessary for me to move forward with my marriage .
It was a test .
I believed , but could not be sure , that just as sex had cooled for my soon - to - be husband and me , it would cool with this man , with any man , no matter what or whom  in which case my fiancé was the person I wanted to marry .
Except suppose I was wrong ?
Suppose there was someone out there with whom I could have passionate sex the rest of my life ?
So I continued with my conservative Christian , and we had fantastic , obsessive sex while the whole time I waited to see when ( or if ) this affair would run out of fuel .
I prayed that it would , so I could marry the man I loved .
Actually , I never had intercourse with this man , though we did just about everything else .
He did not believe in sex before marriage .
Therefore , when my fiancé asked me if I was “ having sex ” with someone ( why was I coming home at 3 a .m. ? ) , I could answer “ no . ”
On the Christian man ’s end , when his God asked him if he was having sex with someone , he also could answer “ no , ” and so we both lived highly honest , righteous lives filled with perpetual sex .
But then the inevitable happened .
Sex with this man turned tepid , then revolting .
While the revolting part was particular to this crazy relationship , the tepid part was wholly within my experience and proved , for me , that there is no God of monogamous passion .
Thus freed from the tethers of this affair , I returned to the gentle arms of my pagan husband .
We are going on our 10th anniversary .
He wants hot sex .
I turned tepid long , long ago .
A University of Chicago study published in 1999 found that 40 percent of women suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction , usually low libido .
There are treatments for this sort of thing : Viagra or a prescription for testosterone .
But the real issue for me is that I ’m not sure I have a dysfunction .
On the one hand , I am miserable about our lack of a sex life because it makes my husband miserable and cold and withdrawn , and it is so unhappy , living this way .
“ Have sex with someone else , ” I tell him .
It will have surprised no one that Miriam Makeba died as she had lived , in full voice and in support of a political cause .
The 76 year old singer suffered a fatal heart attack , it was announced yesterday , shortly after performing at a concert in southern Italy in honour of Roberto Saviano , a journalist whose work in uncovering the Camorra mafia has earned him death threats and a life in hiding .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Makeba , or Mama Africa as she was known to her legion of fans around the world , became the first global African star both through her music and her lifelong willingness to adopt an outspoken stance on the political issue of the day – apartheid .
Yesterday it fell to South Africa 's other global icon , Nelson Mandela , to pay tribute to her : “ She was the mother of the struggle and the nation .
She gave voice to the pain of exile and separation .
It was fitting that her last moments were spent on a stage , enriching the hearts and lives of others - and again in support of a good cause . "
The woman hailed as the " Empress of Africa " left her audience calling for more .
After performing to more than one thousand people in Castel Volturno -- a Camorra stronghold where six African immigrants were shot dead two months ago by the mafia - the crowd was begging for one last song .
" There were calls for an encore and at that moment someone asked if there was a doctor in the house , ” said a photographer attending the show .
“ Miriam Makeba had fainted and was lying on the floor . "
She had died of a heart attack after collapsing on stage .
As the news reached her homeland yesterday morningm callers besieged radio talkshows , many of them in tears , all of them talking about her voice , her activism and her humour .
The emergence of the girl from Johannesburg onto the world stage had also come in Italy at the Venice film festival in 1959 .
After her first big break in the musical King Kong which had to be performed on South Africa university campuses for it to be seen by a black and white audience , she came to the attention of US film director Lionel Togosin .
He included songs by her in his controversial documentary ' Come Home Africa ' which caused a stir later the same year at Venice and Makeba was flown in for the occasion .
The film painted a bitter portrait of the life of black South Africans and the young singer 's voice drew critical acclaim .
The 27 - year - old decided not to risk a return to her apartheid - ruled country and instead moved to London .

A year later when she tried to go home for her mother 's funeral she discovered her passport had been revoked in South Africa , where they later banned her music after she denounced the evils of apartheid at the UN .
She began what was to be 31 years in exile .
Deceptively slender , with a sultry voice , she was courted by a who 's who of 1960s stars from Miles Davis , Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte to JFK , Marlon Brando and Bette Davis .
She became the first African to win a Grammy in 1966 -- a meteoric rise for a girl who began on the tough side of a racial divide , and who had only been encouraged to sing in her cousin 's group the Cuban Singers by relatives who told her that she sang like a “ nightingale ” .
It was during this period and with the backing of Belafonte who had arranged her US visa that she cut the two records that cemented her popularity beyond the shores of Africa : ' The Click Song ' ( Qongqothwane in her native Xhosa language ) and ' Pata Pata ' ( the last song she sang on stage in Italy before collapsing ) .
However , her instinctive , political compass would complicate and ultimately curtail her America honeymoon .
In 1968 at the height of the civil rights movement she married the black power activist Stokely Carmichael , her third husband .
This was too much for the American mainstream and radio stations and concert promoters quietly dropped her from their schedules .
This second rejection was cushioned by an offer to return to Africa from Guinea 's leader Sekou Toure , who gave her a diplomatic passport and used her star name to elevate his own status .
The fact that she never explicitly criticised her former sponsor
Toure prompted critics to accuse her of a human rights blind spot .
Warm relations with Cuba 's Fidel Castro only cemented this perception .
But she remained for millions on the continent the “ Empress of African Song ” .
While in Guinea she cut the stunning live album ' Appel A L'Afrique ' which included the tender love song ' Malaika ' , long seen as an unofficial Panafrican anthem .
It was produced by her compatriot and her second husband , the trumpet player Hugh Masekela .
After a comparative lull in her music career she came back to prominence in Paul Simon 's Graceland tour in 1987 .
By now experimenting by mixing traditional South African songs with jazz , soul and pop she was firmly acknowledged as a pioneer of what came to be known as “ world music ” .
After Nelson Mandela was released from prison she was finally invited home in 1992 , the ban on her music having been lifted four years earlier .
" It was like a revival , " she said of her homecoming .
" My music having been banned for so long , that people still felt the same way about me was too much for me .
I just went home and I cried . "
She always rejected the notion that she had been consciously political and said that circumstance had dictated what she chose to sing about .
“ Our surroundings make us what we are , ” she said in a recent interview .
“ Our surroundings were our suffering from apartheid and this racism business .
We have love songs and we have lullabies too , because we have children and we have love . ”
Musicians who played with her remembered her as a softer figure than some might have imagined who would always insist on cooking for guests and fancied herself as a great chef .
Although she played to packed auditoriums all over the world in 1997 on a “ farewell tour ” Makeba stayed musically and politically active with the UN and her own charities .
Earlier this year she performed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in support of a campaign against sexual violence .
As South Africa went into mourning yesterday the country 's foreign minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma summed up the loss : " One of the greatest songstresses of our time has ceased to sing .
Throughout her life , Mama Makeba communicated a positive message to the world about the struggle of the people of South Africa and the certainty of victory over the dark forces of apartheid and colonialism through the art of song . "
Parents and siblings of children with Down ’s Syndrome are amazing people , as are the children themselves .
Often times , the family members learn so much from the child with Down ’s , but it is definitely a challenge I can only imagine .
As a pregnant mother , I refused all testing that would have revealed if I had a child with Down ’s , as I would like to think I would have delivered , accepted , and loved my child no matter what .
I had two friends who received false positive results on their AFP tests , but they delivered healthy babies.[ social_buttons ]
Often times , families chose to abort rather than birth a child with Down ’s , but now there is hope this syndrome can be treated in utero .
According to News Scientist :
When fetal mouse pups that had a syndrome similar to Down ’s were treated with nerve - protecting chemicals , some of the developmental delays that are part of the condition were removed .
Children with Down ’s have an extra copy of chromosome 21 , while mice engineered to have a similar condition are given an extra copy of a segment of chromosome 16 .
In both species , the development of certain motor and sensory abilities is delayed .
These “ trisomic ” individuals may also have learning difficulties and symptoms of Alzheimer ’s later in life .
Inhibiting the neurotransmitter GABA in trisomic mice can improve cognition and some have suggested this could be used in children .
It would be even better , however , to treat Down ’s before a child is born and so improve cognitive potential .
As a mother of a child who has experienced developmental delays due to a congenital heart defect , I believe I would undergo in utero treatment to have eliminated these delays .
We need to accept humans in all shapes , sizes , and conditions , but it is wonderful that we can also heal them and provide them with a healthier life .
Armed with this knowledge , Catherine Spong and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , injected NAP and SAL into mice pregnant with trisomic pups in the middle of their pregnancy .
When the pups were born , they reached developmental milestones such as grasping a rod , righting themselves and responding to tactile stimulation at the same time as normal mice ( Obstetrics and Gynecology , vol 112 , p 1242 ) .
“ We were able to prevent a significant amount of the delay , ” says Spong .
If this research leads to treatment and less termination , than I think it would be a blessing .
I ’d be interested to know how families with children with Down ’s Syndrome feel about this study .

Advertisement Plans to abolish imperial measurements in the UK were officially dropped by Brussels this week , much to the delight of " metric martyrs " .
But why do we get so passionate about cold , hard units of measurement , asks Warwick Cairns ?
It 's nearly a decade since Britain officially " went metric " - or mostly metric , apart from road signs , beer glasses and one or two other special cases .
It 's well over a century since the change was first mooted in Parliament .
Yet after all this time , passions still run extraordinarily high on both sides of the argument .
FIND OUT MORE More or Less is on Friday 19 Dec at 1330 GMT on BBC Radio 4 Catch up at BBC iPlayer
There 's still a UK Metric Association , dedicated to pushing through final , total metrication .
There are still " metric martyrs " - die -hard opponents prepared to face criminal charges rather than sell their bananas by the kilo .
You could sort of understand it , if people as a whole , or just British people , were n't keen on change in general .
But over the same space of time we 've embraced all sorts of other changes without a second thought .
We swapped our VCRs for DVDs and our cathode - ray televisions for LCD flatscreens .
We got microwaves and dishwashers , up - to - date hairstyles and cars , changed our mobiles and the cut of our trousers , all to keep up with the times .
Fruit and veg sellers refused to use metric measures
But when it comes to measurements , things are altogether different - and always have been .
Often when a government has decided that its people might be better served by swapping their traditional system for a new one , many of those people have been less than enthusiastic , and often surprisingly stubborn about it .
For many people , changing one way you measure things seems to be much more than a simple practical step .
This is because at the heart of every system of measurement lies a whole way of seeing the world .
Every culture in the world has - or has had - traditional measures , with roots in the far distant past , when Neolithic farmers would measure the length of their fields by pacing them out , or the height of their cattle by " walking " up them with their hands .
These measures have been shaped by millennia of history - like the mile ( mille passus ) , pound ( libra pondo ) and inch ( uncia ) we get from the Romans - and then altered and adapted over countless generations to suit everyday human proportions and purposes .
The result is that most of the world 's traditional systems end up being remarkably similar .
The English foot , for example , is almost identical to the Japanese Kanejaku , and both are as long as the sole of an average man 's shoe .
But because of the way they 've come about , what you do n't tend to get from traditional measures is neatness , order or scientific rigour .
And if you think of the world in traditional measures , then you think of it in a way that 's broadly traditional , and none too fussed about strict adherence to logically thought - out principles .
Whereas if you think of the world in a metric way , your perception is somewhat different .
This was why , for the French revolutionaries , traditional measures had to go .
For them , old units like the pied de Roi ( King 's Foot ) kept people chained to ignorance and superstition , and had to be swept away for Reason to take hold .
And that , pretty much , has been the argument between the two sides ever since .
Metric is by far the best and most consistent for the world 's scientists and engineers and it often appeals also to those who are tidy - minded , who like the idea that life is run according to ordered principles .
French resistance Traditional systems , meanwhile , appeal to those who value a living link to history and prehistory ( plus lots of handy human - scale units ) - but they also appeal to bloody - minded individualists who just enjoy sticking two fingers up at bureaucrats ' neat plans .
BIG IN JAPAN Shakkanho is the traditional system of measurement
It dates back to ancient China Replaced by metric in 1924
It was forbidden in 1966
But it is still used today , chiefly in agriculture and carpentry
The tidy - minded versus the bloody - minded : it is an argument in which the two sides hardly speak the same language ; and it is one that - if historical precedents are anything to go by - is likely to run and run .
In France , decades after the Revolution , people remained so hostile to the metric system that Napoleon eventually allowed them to go back to the old " mesures usuelles " .
It was only after Napoleon went , and a government of hardcore modernisers got in , that metric came back ; and only when the full force of the law came down on them that the people saw that the game was up , and did what they were told .
But even now , in street markets , people still ask for their pommes in livres - even though the livre is now a nominally metric one of 500g .
The pound in weight is not going to disappear from sight , after all In 1924 , Japan officially abandoned its ancient Shakkanho measurement system and " went metric " .
However , people took so little notice that they had to do it all over again in 1966 .
Despite this , large areas of life continue to operate in Shakkanho - and although , in theory , it 's against the law to use it for official purposes , it 's creeping back even there , with the 2005 census allowing people , once more , to describe their properties in traditional units .
Traditional versus metric : there 's much more at stake here than simple convenience .
And short of both sides agreeing to disagree , it 's likely that there 'll be " metric martyrs " - and their opponents - for some time yet to come .
Warwick Cairns is author of About the Size of It , which supports traditional measurements .
Below is a selection of your comments .
This is one area where the British predilection for compromise is not appropriate .
The idea that maintaining the ' imperial ' system is our way of rebelling against Brussels is just fatuous .
Who does it hurt ?
The EU ?
No , us .
12" =1 ' , 3'=1yd , 1760yds=1 mile , 16oz=1lb , 14lbs=1st , 8st=1cwt , 20 cwt=1 ton ..
I ask you !
Geoff , Bayonne
Why does your graph show the Kanejaku as " 11.83in " ?
Should n't that be 11 7/8in ?
Oh , no , wait .
That 's not even close .
11 13/16in? Nope .
Still not right .
11 27/32in. Doh !
Still not right .
I know !
11 83/100in. Yes .
That works , and it 's darn well not metric .
Allister Jenks , Wellington , New Zealand I 'm lucky that I can easily slip between the two both in measures and weights .
Having worked as a haberdasher for a few years , the conflict between metric and imperial was obvious on a daily basis .
I think it should be phased in - it 's senseless expecting people who have used imperial all their lives to suddenly adopt metric .
Everyone learns metric in school now , it 's only a matter of time , so what 's the big rush ?
Anna , Belfast I do n't get the fuss about this .
I am 35 , and only learned metric at school in the UK .
Imperial measures were learned as a bit of fun .
Eventually all those people who learned imperial measures at school will be gone , and we 'll be able to use metric .
Even my parents who refuse to bow to metric ( thanks Daily Mail ) still buy ham as five slices , or five oranges - they would never say " half a pound please . "
They have no idea how much they would be getting .
It 's just that staunch British refusal to conform to the rest of Europe .

As a photography teacher I always measured chemicals in metric - 300 ml per film .
Then I found the other teacher was telling the students 10 fluid ounces per film .
Not only that , but some were using Imperial fluid ounces and some US fluid ounces .
No wonder the students got confused .
I thought we decided to go metric over 40 years ago .
Only Britain would get halfway there then stop .
The worst of all possible outcomes .
Oh , and I think cloth is still sold by the foot in width but the metre in length .
What madness !
Martin Winson , Bath , Somerset I use a combination of both metric and imperial due to a confused schooling system and inherited domestic skills such as cooking and baking .
Recipes handed down through generations of my family use lbs and pints AND proper size eggs - not small , medium , etc .
So much of our heritage resides in everyday things , it is no wonder we like to cling to " old fashioned " methods .
When shopping and I buy a lb of bacon I know what it looks like - I have no idea what 100 grams looks like .
There is no harm in having the metric as an official system , but there is a great deal of value in keeping the old system too .
Anita
Why should we drop metric ?
Because the decimal system is inefficient .
We should be using binary - based systems , such as octal or hexadecimal ( based on eight and 16 respectively ) for measurements .
This would speed up computer calculations enormously .
And if you think that might be difficult - pints and gallons is an octal system , and pounds and ounces hexadecimal , and we all managed with that for centuries .
Just to prove how inefficient decimal is , by using just your fingers to count , you can only add up to ten in decimal , whereas using binary , you can count right up to two to the power 10 - 1 , or 1023 .
Point proved , I think .
Kirsten Elliott , Bath
We should move to metric measures exclusively now .
Standard measures are needed for proper comparison and understanding .
What on earth is the point of being almost the only place in the world using imperial measures ?
No one has difficulty with decimal currency so we would all grasp metric measures easily if the old ones were faded out .
If we go on using both we will never change .
I go crazy hearing BBC weather forecasters constantly converting Celsius temperatures into Fahrenheit .
Please let us join the rest of the world and use generally understood international standard measures .
R Munting , Norwich Surely this article misses the point of why many British people hate metric .
The EU is perceived as forcing us to adopt metric .
The fact that every country in the world ( bar America ) use metric is besides the point - this is a EU conspiracy !
We stubborn Brits will never bow the knee !
Its our way rebelling against those eurocrats , who 've stolen our country .
Stephen , Middlesbrough
I would agree with you if your ' system ' was more or less workable .
The first time I came to the UK I had no idea of your measurements .
But I pretty soon learned how much beer is in a pint .
So I asked people how many pints there are to the gallon , just to get a rough idea , but nobody could tell me .
Metrics may seem overly tidy to you , but if hardly anyone knows how many pounds to the stone I think it would be wiser to change .
The children that grow up with the ' new ' system will have no problems with it , but all the benefits .
Kees van der Krieke , Rotterdam .

There are pro's and cons to both sides : Imperial : Easier to do mental arithmetic using base 12 rather than base 10 as it has more divisors ( same reason we use 360 degrees instead of 400 gradians ) .
Metric : MUCH easier to parameterise computationally due to the ease at which computers can handle floating point operators .
( example , Try telling a computer that you want to divide three and one eighth by two using c or c++ without using decimal points ) .
Also it 's much easier to gain an idea of proportions as we count in base 10 in everyday life .
Contrary to popular belief , when it comes to science it really does n't matter whether you measure velocity in metres per second , miles per hour , feet per second or furlongs per month - all that changes is the factor of proportionality .
Dave , Cambridge I have never understood the English ( and American ) obsession with Imperial weights and measures .
As the article points out , because they are based on human proportions , it means that you have to think in so many different number bases e.g. 12 inches = 1 foot , 3 feet = 1 yard , 1760 yards = 1 mile .
We count in tens , so lets adopt the system that uses that as its basis - metric !!
Colin Harrison , Leeds , England I really do n't see what these metric people have against the proper measurements .
Why can't we just use which ever takes our fancy or is appropriate for the job ?
I use mm and such like when doing science , and feet and inches , pounds and ounces when shopping , cooking or making things in the garage .
Frankly there is NO excuse with modern electronic scales , or with old fashioned balances , to FORCE one system or the other , let people use the one they like .
Dave , Mildenhall I agree with Dave ; I use the units that I think is easier to visualise and handle .
I prefer Celsius over Fahrenheit ; stones , pounds , and ounces for weight ; acres for large areas ; millimetres for tiny lengths ; inches and feet , for longer lengths ; and metric for design drawings .
Generally , I prefer to deal with small numbers , or small fractions ( ie 1/2 an acre ) , for everyday things , hence why I prefer Celsius over Fahrenheit .
I am not sure which I would prefer for measuring hours in a day : 10 hours / day , and sub parts , would probably be better than 24 hours / day .

" Some of the old guard still hold on to pipe dreams of an all - conquering Union . "
The Union is squaring off against the South again .
This time it 's Detroit 's union — the UAW — partnering with the auto manufacturers , politicians , and media supporters of the domestic auto industry to wage warfare against the entire South .
The problem here centers on certain southern states — Mississippi , Louisiana , Georgia and , in particular , Alabama — where certain bone - headed senators seem to have forgotten that the Civil War ended , with the appropriate outcome , almost 150 years ago .
What 's more , these Alabama representatives argued that they and other southern states had plenty of automotive manufacturing capacity to take up the slack and keep the country 's economy going if Detroit was to go belly up .
Specifically , Alabama 's Republican senator Richard Shelby called Detroit a ' dinosaur ' and said bankruptcy was a better solution to the problems facing U.S. carmakers .
The state 's other senator , Jeff Sessions , also a Republican , said Detroit 's collapse would " not be the end of the world .
We have a very large and vibrant automobile sector in Alabama . " [ 1 ]
That 's Detroit News columnist John McCormick , who labeled Southern politicians opposing the bailout " good old southern boys . "
Detroiters continue to embarrass themselves by placing the auto industry collapse into an us-versus - them framework .
In the midst of all the whining and begging for a bailout , the South has been declared the new enemy , along with the foreign - car manufacturers who are producing cars — in Southern plants — that consumers want to buy .
The army of politicians and opinion columnists in Michigan who lay the groundwork for resuscitating this fading industry do n't bother to acknowledge that it is in the best interests of any public company to maximize quality for its customers and efficiency of production and profits for its shareholders .
Instead , Toyota and Honda are pegged as evil because they are thriving .
They are especially evil for building plants that are n't located near Detroit .
However , it is important to remember that foreign auto manufacturers are able to build plants where they want to build them , according to what fits best into their strategic plans and potential for profit .
The US automakers have UAW officials making those decisions for them for the sole purpose of enriching the union 's overpaid officers and dues - paying members .
Moreover , the whole South is considered evil for luring foreign plants into the region .
Sure , the massive subsidies granted to foreign automakers to lure them to the South are the quintessence of corporate welfare .
But no country , no state , no region , is immune to such politics .
Michigan does the same to lure high - tech companies to the state , and most recently , it offered huge incentives to Volkswagen to build a new plant in the state .
The game is played the same everywhere .
The free - market method would be to allow for a business environment that would be ideal for businesses to thrive ( no taxes or stifling regulations ) ; thereby encouraging companies to relocate to low - cost states on a mutually cooperative basis .
This would engender competition among states that would drive down all costs everywhere .
But that would mean that the people in power — the politicians and government planners — would become less influential and less wealthy ; it is for that reason the free market has not prevailed .
Additionally , Southern members of Congress are seen as evil because they refuse to vote " yea " on a bailouts for debt - laden , deadbeat companies in the North .
Immediately following the failed bailout vote , Michigan Congressman John Dingell accused Southern senators of " unpatriotically blocking a bill that was supported by the White House , that passed the House with a bipartisan majority , and that had the support of 52 Senators . "
Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm referred to the lack of support for the bailout as " un-American . "
Along the way , the Detroit , pro-bailout contingent is frantically seeking outside parties to come to its aid — assorted journalists , neocons , politicians , and ideologically compatible sympathizers who all wish to preserve and fortify the Yankee mercantile system .
Perhaps the most preposterous line of attack I 've seen from one of the non-Detroit proponents is the tripe produced by Michael Lind in Salon , who is still fighting the War Between the States .
He stated , " The South will have risen by bringing down the North .
Jefferson Davis will have had his revenge . "
Lind refers to a " Southern economic strategy " as he charges the South with " poaching " key industries from New England and the Midwest in the early 20th century because it played dirty with less regulation and public spending .
" It is in the best interests of any public company to maximize quality for its customers and efficiency of production and profits for its shareholders . "
He goes on to declare that " the neo - confederates " are aligning with the economic axis — Germany and Japan — to defeat a common enemy , the Northern union ( as in UAW ) .
Lind is distraught because Reconstruction of the South was never completed and thus he calls for a Third Reconstruction ( the New Deal - Civil Rights era being the Second Reconstruction ) that could be carried out by engaging the majority Northern congressional contingent , along with the executive branch , to use " the power of the federal government to put a stop to the Southern conservative race - to - the - bottom strategy once and for all . "
Then the Feds could foist Yankee traditions onto those poor , backwards Southerners who just do n't know any better .
The new Reconstruction would be consummated by turning out national minimum - wage laws ( $ 12 per hour ) , more safety regulations , more environmental regulations , and higher taxes .
So the brilliant plan goes like this : if the Detroit model does n't work in Detroit , extend it everywhere else by the force of majority power and government fiat .
Doing so , he says , will finally fix the broken South , making it a more suitable place .
Poor Michael Lind believes he is still trying to free slaves from the ghosts of Southern plantation masters .
The failure of Congress to bail out Detroit 's failed automakers has been identified as the cause for Detroit 's flop .
In fact , hyperbole - laden journalists keep saying , " Detroit is collapsing . "
But Detroit is not collapsing .
Three auto manufacturers born of Detroit are no longer financially able to continue operations .
They are financially failed because they long ago sold their souls to union brutes who have run their businesses in the best interests of the UAW 's overpaid executives and managers , and their spoiled autoworker constituency .
They have become insolvent because of the parasite effect : too many years of a top - heavy , management scheme sucking the blood from each company 's long - term potential .
They have ceased to sell cars because they have , for decades , been turning out scores of dreadful cars — with serious design flaws and quality concerns — that do n't last as long as the car payments .
And finally , American automakers have never saved for the rainy days ahead .
All of their balance sheets reflect an attitude of " live for the day , " and indeed they did .
Ford , Chrysler , and GM all went hog wild during the boom years — they reaped gorgeous profits from consumers loaded with the credit bubble 's cheap cash and too much debt .
The Big Three 's financing arms became inordinately profitable while their profits from operations dropped and dropped — and then stopped altogether .
Still , not once did executive management look forward , beyond the peculiarity of the boom , and prepare for the business environment and consumer demands of tomorrow .
Instead , all three companies continued to put all of their resources into the short - term channel to secure today 's profits at the expense of tomorrow 's stability and survival .
Boom times and credit bubbles ( and recent bailouts ) have masked dead business models , considerable quality issues , and insolvency .
Now that the veneer of phony prosperity has been stripped off the economy , the naked auto companies are a frightening sight to behold .
And since Detroit came to rely so heavily on one industry , and put all of its eggs in that one basket , the region 's economy is starting to crumble .
In response , Detroit automakers and unions seek to use aggressive tactics against others to remain intact .
The automakers sought , and received , the theft and redistribution of other peoples ' money in order to sustain their failed businesses .
The UAW seeks to use legislative fiat to direct the terms of the bailout and extend their power by planting their gangs in the South .
Some of the old guard still hold on to pipe dreams of an all - conquering Union .
As one union president said ( apparently , a guy who never got past the intro to macro and micro in high school ) ,
What the economy needs now is rising wages so the country can get on the path of wage - driven consumption growth .
That means stronger unions .
Indeed , I believe eventually it will mean the unionization of the entire U.S. auto industry .
However , in the South the market has spoken in at least one respect — the unions are not welcome by the workers .
Getting back to John McCormick 's limp line of reasoning , he ends his column by implying that Michiganders should boycott Alabama — especially the retirees and warm - weather family vacationers .
As always , the little guys are told to give up their way of life to preserve the high - paying jobs of corporate and union executives — along with the jobs of people who make cars no one wants to buy .
But what 's in it for them ?
National pride ?
Perhaps Detroit should just send a battalion down to Atlanta to rough things up a little .
A new Civil War anyone ?

Two kinds of human smile exist across all cultures : the truthful " Duchenne smile , " and the fake " social smile . "
Now evolutionary psychologists believe the social smile evolved to prevent biting and screaming .
Advertisement
A recent study by San Francisco State psychologist David Matsumoto published today in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology offers evidence that facial expressions are innate rather than learned .
He examined over 4,000 photographs of blind and sighted athletes who had just lost important competitions .
Though the blind athletes could not have learned their facial expressions from seeing other people 's , they nevertheless produced very similar unhappy expressions when they first heard the news that they 'd lost .
Later , they moved almost the same facial muscles to produce social smiles during award ceremonies .
Matsumoto explained that a genuine Duchenne smile causes the cheek muscles to move , and also makes the eyes narrow ( some describe this as " twinkling eyes " ) .
A social smile affects only the mouth muscles , and usually the lips remain closed in a social smile .

Said Matsumoto :
The statistical correlation between the facial expressions of sighted and blind individuals was almost perfect .
This suggests something genetically resident within us is the source of facial expressions of emotion .
Losers pushed their lower lip up as if to control the emotion on their face and many produced social smiles .
Individuals blind from birth could not have learned to control their emotions in this way through visual learning so there must be another mechanism .
It could be that our emotions , and the systems to regulate them , are vestiges of our evolutionary ancestry .
It 's possible that in response to negative emotions , humans have developed a system that closes the mouth so that they are prevented from yelling , biting or throwing insults .

The first Australian soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross in 40 years does n't see himself as a hero , but the prime minister insists Trooper Mark Donaldson is " the stuff of Australian legend " .
Trooper Donaldson , 29 , was awarded the VC medal - the nation 's highest military honour - for rescuing a coalition interpreter during fighting in Afghanistan last year .
The Special Air Service ( SAS ) soldier is the first person to receive the Victoria Cross for Australia .
It was established in 1991 to replace the Imperial VC awarded previously to 96 Australians .
Trooper Donaldson said the award was a great honour , but it would n't change who he was .
Yet , we speak of an unsullied America , an America somehow free from sin , a past and perpetual shining city on the hill for all men and women .
That is a lie .
My parents ’ lives prove it is a lie , as did theirs before them .
And yes , as their offspring , I prove it is a lie .
It is my duty as their offspring to remind America that it is a lie .
I owe it to them and what they sacrificed to remind us all that the McCains and Bushes and Reagans continue the tradition of omitting the sons and daughters of African slaves .
I owe it to my forebears to remember that this perfect , mythical country is one where my past is quashed — psychologically deleted … one in which I am deleted .
In this mythical , exceptional land , I am the blight that must be forgotten .
I am its version of the shunned Victorian madwoman prone to blurt the family ’s filthy secrets , locked in an attic to keep them hidden .
The secrets slowly poison everything beneath the capacious manor roof , but the residents suffer the rot and stench to maintain their precious image of upright sanctimony .
Barack Obama , the half - black son of a Kenyan and a Kansan — and unmistakably “ black ” man who has unwaveringly adopted Afro-American culture , has just been elected President of the United States .
Some will say that this proves American racism is dead .
Some , like the Reagans and the Bushes and their political brethren , have been saying that for decades , and it remains transparently ignorant and self - serving .
Countless tales from this election alone prove the point ( here , here , and here , for a small taste . )
There is ample research to prove that we have neither outgrown our American cultural history nor our animal distrust of those who do n’t look like us .
No , this election does not mean the end of American prejudice , bias , racialism or racism .
Job applicants with black - sounding names will still be 50 % less likely to get a given job than those with less distinctive tags .
However , the election does have deep meaning , particularly to me , and I ’ll be so bold as to suggest that I may speak for many other blacks as well .
I am not trying to belittle the satisfaction that whites might feel at this sign of progress — their own progress .
However , such satisfaction is only personal if one overcame a conscious distaste for blacks in order to push the “ Obama ” button .
If not , the satisfaction is second - hand ; it ’s an easy kumbaya moment .
It costs nothing emotionally .
It demands that you neither acknowledge an altered reality about yourself , nor adjust any long - held belief .
I have often wondered what it meant to feel fully American .
Today , I received my first glimpse .
I have no illusions .
I know that the country ’s catastrophic state bears as much credit for the Obama victory as his rational , intelligent response to it , and his skillful , disciplined campaign .
Nonetheless , it is heartening to think that issues can trump our ugly racial scars — that we can stop picking at the scabs long enough to consider our own self - interest above our historical prejudice .
Considering from whence we ’ve come , that is huge .
Think of all the blood that has been shed to get here .
Hundreds of thousands died on U.S. soil to preserve the right to keep me in literal chains — to own me like you ’d own a dog .
Sociologists Steward E. Tolnay and E.M.
Beck identified
" 2805 [ documented ] victims of lynch mobs killed between 1882 and 1930 in ten southern states .
Although mobs murdered almost 300 white men and women , the vast majority - almost 2,500 - of lynch victims were African - American .
Of these black victims , 94 percent died in the hands of white lynch mobs .
The scale of this carnage means that , on the average , a black man , woman , or child was murdered nearly once a week , every week , between 1882 and 1930 by a hate - driven white mob . "
Untold numbers died from neglect , substandard , segregated medical care .
Millions went uneducated and locked away from opportunity .
Four little girls died when a white man bombed their church .
Three civil rights workers , one black and two Jewish , were murdered because some white men hated us unto death .
White assassins ’ bullets murdered Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King .
This is a small sampling .
Millions died in slave holds on the way to this country .
The list goes on .
Some white Americans rail against such litanies .
They call it living in the past , or insist that the past is insignificant .
They can speak so foolishly because , in general , white Americans just do n’t do the past .
They do n’t have to .
And they do n’t understand those who do .
It ’s at the root of many of our international failings .
Many American memories do n’t extend beyond their own lifetimes .
We do n’t understand that most of the world lives the past each and every day .
Unlike the majority , black Americans live the past every day .
We have no choice .
We are its children .
Southerners often live the past .
War was fought in their backyards , and they lost .
Americans have an uncanny ability to jettison the past with each generation .
You can do that when you do n’t have to look , every day , at scars it left behind .
The attacks of “ un - American ” did n’t stick to Obama the way they could have to another black candidate because his outlook is just as white as it is black .
For most of this country ’s history , the word “ American ” was preceded by the unspoken word “ white . ”
Only whites received the benefits of this country ’s freedoms .
To be fully American — to reap America ’s fruits — was to be white .
It is this attitude that McCain ’s Republicans tried to exploit .
Not only was the zeitgeist not on their side , they had a candidate whose upbringing spared him a deep sense of exclusion .
He did n’t defend his American bona fides with litanies of forebears who had fought in wars or who had labored in southern fields , thereby evoking memories that discomfit so many .
He did not react defensively in learned fear of the less - than - American status of earlier black generations .
He carelessly flicked off the opposition ’s arrows .
He did n’t have to remind America that he was part of what they want to forget .
He did not have to defend his Americanism because he was not looking at this country exclusively through a black history or white historical point - of - view that excluded him from it .
I remember as a young child in school in the late 60s and 70s hearing how in America , anyone can grow up to be President , and knowing that it was a lie , knowing that if America had the balls to bet her glory on that statement , America would lose .
If any American could grow up to be President , and I could not ( men died in the streets to secure my right to merely vote ) then I did not qualify as American .
Rivers of black blood have been spilled .
My parents and theirs fought and died to rip their rights from the majority ’s avaricious grasp .
To justify their illegal hold , the majority belittled , dehumanized , brutalized and sometimes killed me and mine .
So I have often wondered what it might mean to feel fully American .
Today , I , a black descendant of African slaves , get a glimpse , and it feels good .
I get a glimpse because the white part of a half - black man raised by whites who adopted black culture allowed him to see a different country from the one my history has burned into my mind .
In America ’s long , perverse history of race relations , such absurdist irony is fitting .

A new scientific study led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reaches a powerful conclusion about the climate change caused by future increases of carbon dioxide : to a large extent , there ’s no going back .
The pioneering study , led by NOAA senior scientist Susan Solomon , shows how changes in surface temperature , rainfall , and sea level are largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions are completely stopped .
The findings appear during the week of January 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ Our study convinced us that current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that will irreversibly change the planet , ” said Solomon , who is based at NOAA ’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colo .
“ It has long been known that some of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years , ” Solomon said .
“ But the new study advances the understanding of how this affects the climate system . ”
The study examines the consequences of allowing CO 2 to build up to several different peak levels beyond present - day concentrations of 385 parts per million and then completely halting the emissions after the peak .
The authors found that the scientific evidence is strong enough to quantify some irreversible climate impacts , including rainfall changes in certain key regions , and global sea level rise .
If CO 2 is allowed to peak at 450- 600 parts per million , the results would include persistent decreases in dry - season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe , northern Africa , southwestern North America , southern Africa and western Australia .

The study notes that decreases in rainfall that last not just for a few decades but over centuries are expected to have a range of impacts that differ by region .
Such regional impacts include decreasing human water supplies , increased fire frequency , ecosystem change and expanded deserts .
Dry - season wheat and maize agriculture in regions of rain - fed farming , such as Africa , would also be affected .
Climate impacts were less severe at lower peak levels .
But at all levels added carbon dioxide and its climate effects linger because of the ocean .
“ In the long run , both carbon dioxide loss and heat transfer depend on the same physics of deep - ocean mixing .
The two work against each other to keep temperatures almost constant for more than a thousand years , and that makes carbon dioxide unique among the major climate gases , ” said Solomon .
The scientists emphasize that increases in CO 2 that occur in this century “ lock in ” sea level rise that would slowly follow in the next 1,000 years .
Considering just the expansion of warming ocean waters — without melting glaciers and polar ice sheets — the authors find that the irreversible global average sea level rise by the year 3000 would be at least 1.3 –3.2 feet ( 0.4 –1.0 meter ) if CO 2 peaks at 600 parts per million , and double that amount if CO 2 peaks at 1,000 parts per million .
“ Additional contributions to sea level rise from the melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets are too uncertain to quantify in the same way , ” said Solomon .
“ They could be even larger but we just do n’t have the same level of knowledge about those terms .
We presented the minimum sea level rise that we can expect from well - understood physics , and we were surprised that it was so large . ”
Rising sea levels would cause “ … irreversible commitments to future changes in the geography of the Earth , since many coastal and island features would ultimately become submerged , ” the authors write .
Geoengineering to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was not considered in the study .
“ Ideas about taking the carbon dioxide away after the world puts it in have been proposed , but right now those are very speculative , ” said Solomon .
The authors relied on measurements as well as many different models to support the understanding of their results .
They focused on drying of particular regions and on thermal expansion of the ocean because observations suggest that humans are contributing to changes that have already been measured .
Besides Solomon , the study ’s authors are Gian - Kasper Plattner and Reto Knutti of ETH Zurich , Switzerland , and Pierre Friedlingstein of Institut Pierre Simon Laplace , Gif-Sur - Yvette , France .

Main page || Index || Prior Article [ 0380 ] || Next Article [ 0382 ] || 51 Comments || Send feedback Look , bottom line : REBOL makes me productive .
And , to me , productivity is everything .
That 's why I write and use REBOL .
That 's why I keep writing and using it .
I 'm not a techie .
Maybe you think I am .
No ... I live in the mountains .
I plant Redwood trees , grow grapes , make wine , learn French , watch the wildlife ( the coyote , deer , and a lot of wild turkeys this week ) , the fog , the sunsets .
I seldom leave the ranch , maybe to play tennis .
I watch the antics of the world from here - the news feeds , as many as I can find .
I like useful things .
I like systems I can control , shape , and put to work .
Small systems .
Smart systems .
Do n't give me a 500 MB software program if a 1MB can do what I need , or even better , 10 KB .
You know , I have to face up that in most regards , I 've lost productivity over the last decade .
These days , for me , computers seem to create more problems for me than they solve .
And oddly , when I look around , most businesses and families seem to have those same problems with their computers .
I think back to 1998 ... when computers actually worked well for me .
I wrote all my docs , created my diagrams , built web sites , created necessary web images , managed spreadsheets , sent faxes ... from a fine little Apple Macintosh of that era .
( I know that some of you want me to say Commodore Amiga here , but remember I worked in development at Apple Computer too . )
Well , I really do n't want to tell you what I use these days .
It 's not that I have n't kept up , it 's that I 'm tired of managing office suites , multi- gigabyte software packages , messed up installations , dealing with incompatible libraries , fixing registry conflicts , on and on .
What 's up with computing ?
It 's suppose to make us more productive , is n't it ?
I do n't mean more productive fixing our computers , I mean more productive making products , offering services , or enjoying our lives .
I do n't have time for modern software .
Every hour of my day needs to count for something .
I spend my time making things , writing , building ... not repairing my computer or updating endless components to make Bill richer or Linus cooler .
Well , ok , maybe I sound like I 'm getting old .
Maybe I am ?
But you know , a mattock pick and a Winchester 1894 lever - action 30 - 30 are still useful and elegant tools .
Time has not changed them .
Bill has not improved on them .
Linus has not reforged them as free .
Look , small systems are better systems .
Period .
Do n't tell me how your 12 layered software technology can do great things .
Maybe it can , but next week it will crash .
For me , that many layers says it 's a broken design , not a better design .
It 's like credit default swap financial derivatives .
Wow , do n't those sound great ?
The house of cards may bring us all down .
Anyway ... let 's see ... where 's that coyote ?
He was out front .
I need to keep an eye on him .

LONG ISLAND , New York ( CNN ) --
The death of a temporary Wal - Mart worker trampled by customers amid frantic Black Friday shopping could have been avoided , the union that represents retail workers said Saturday .
Jdimytai Damour , 34 , was crushed as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a Long Island , New York , store at 5 a.m.
Friday , police said .
" This incident was avoidable , " said Bruce Both , president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500 , the state of New York 's largest grocery worker 's union .
" Where were the safety barriers ?
Where was security ?
How did store management not see dangerous numbers of customers barreling down on the store in such an unsafe manner ?
" This is not just tragic ; it rises to a level of blatant irresponsibility by Wal - Mart , " he said .
Watch father of trampled worker react »
Wal - Mart spokesman Dave Tovar said Saturday that the company had no response to the union 's comments , referring CNN to a written statement the retailer released Friday .
The statement said the store added internal security , brought in outside security , erected barricades and worked with Nassau County police in anticipation of heavy crowds .
" Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the deceased , " Wal - Mart Senior Vice President Hank Mullany said in the statement .
" We are continuing to work closely with local law enforcement , and we are reaching out to those involved . "
Damour 's death was one of two high - profile violent incidents on Black Friday , the day after Thanksgiving and traditionally one of the year 's busiest shopping days .
Police say two men shot each other dead in a Toys " R " Us in Palm Desert , California , after they argued in the store .
The fight did not appear to be related to shopping , according to authorities .
At the Wal - Mart , police say that a line began forming at 9 p.m. Thursday and that , by 5 a.m.
Friday , there were as many as 2,000 customers outside .
A video showed about a dozen people knocked to the ground as the doors were opened and the crowd surged , breaking the doors .
Minutes later , police trying to give Damour first aid were jostled by customers still running into the store , authorities said .
The union is calling for an investigation " by all levels of government " to ensure justice for Damour 's family and make sure that such an incident never happens at Wal - Mart again .
Watch reaction to the incident »
" If the safety of their customers and workers was a top priority , then this never would have happened , " said Patrick Purcell , a projects director for the local UFCW .
" Wal - Mart must step up to the plate and ensure that all those injured , as well as the family of the deceased , be financially compensated for their injuries and their losses .
Their words are weak . "
The UFCW has long been a harsh critic of Wal - Mart 's , arguing that the world 's largest retailer offers low wages and poor health care for its workers and pushes competitors and suppliers to do the same or go out of business .
The group has had only marginal success in organizing Wal - Mart workers in the United States and Canada , citing aggressive anti-union efforts by Wal - Mart .
The UFCW has 1.3 million members working largely in the retail , food and food - processing industries .
CNN 's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report .
All About Wal - Mart Stores Inc .
The latest cause celebre of the GOP is to scuttle the $ 14 billion auto bailout because of their longstanding disdain for labor unions , and their highly selective application of " free - market " preferences — i.e. , they entertain socialist preferences for their fat cat buddies on Wall Street , but " free market " preferences when it comes to the average American .
I think they also have a yearning to show , a month after stinging defeats at the polls , that they can still stick together long enough to deliver one last middle finger to the American people and deliver us all the worst Christmas present since the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor .
What their ' no deal ' vote on the LOAN to Detroit boils down to is something other than the fancy rationale Republicans put forward on talk shows to save face ( " if we bail them out , who is next in line with their hands out ? " -- oh how odd that this same sentiment does not prevail when 350 billion was just handed over to Wall Street banks and insurance companies ) .
Do you know why Republicans are so hot to bust the Unions ?
Because the unions protect workers , but the GOP destroys them , abuses them and beats them down .
And politically they are on opposite sides of the aisle from the GOP .
Indeed , the Southern Senators ' " no " vote boiled down to plain old union busting and protectionism for their foreign car company patrons .
They were pleased to sell off Ameriican jobs to repay their benefactors from the foreign car companies who had built their plants all in Southern states .
Consider the big issue here which is not emphasized in the mainstream news media .
The Detroit 3 auto makers were asking for a LOAN ( they would pay it back ) , NOT a bailout like the banks received , with no questions asked , which they have no intention of paying back or of submitting to any accoutabiliity or oversight .
One hears hardly a word from the mainstream media about this double standard .
I wonder how many Americans remember that if were n't for the labor unions , this whole country would be working for wages similar to those of Mexico , Africa or Bangladesh , with no labor laws , no protections and no minimum wage or 40 hour work week ?
If we look at the diffence in actual wages between the unionized Detroit auto workers and their non union counterparts in the South , the wages are n't all that different from Toyota , Nissan , BMW and Volkswagen ..
What is different were or are the UAW 's benefits : benefits which were promised in good faith years ago to these American workers .
And since this financial crisis came up , the UAW and its workers have even been willing to cut back their benefits , in spite of being promised .
rightly or wrongly , years ago that they would receive them .
Also , look at the fact that the D3 going into Chapter 11 would not even work , contrary to the false pronouncements of the Republicans .
The reason is , that these companies do n't have the necessary liquidity for Chapter 11 .
They would be forced into Chapter 7 , which would mean that they would have to liquidate their assets and this would mean the end of their existence .
In reality , these health and benefit obligations that cost the big three so much ought , morally , to be be paid in good faith .
The workers have planned their retirements and their healthcare around them because they believed they would receive them .
If it is anyone 's fault , it is the D3's management that is at fault for not planning better .
So the " free market solution " of the Republicans for the auto companies but not for the banks , is excessively harsh .
If the Republicans WERE the party of moral values , they would issue the loan , in order to help the D3 companies honor their commitments made before economic conditions got so bad .
Whoever is to blame , the right thing to do is to help these companies restructure and honor their obligations .
General Motors can't even pay their parts suppliers as it is now .
Another thing to think about :
If the American worker goes down , so will the Japanese car companies , who also use our parts providers for their U.S. plants .
The foreign car makers also depend on a healthy American market to sell their cars .
I do n't see why it is too exorbitant to help Detroit restructure its business that employs so many people in our country and gives us homegrown manufacturers for our military equipment as well .
I thought the Republicans were the party of national security .
In spite of their mistakes ( not as bad as the banks made ) , why should n't the D3 be LOANED a relatively paltry 15 billion dollars ( not the $ 45 billion they originally asked for ) ?
They should actually be applauded for trying to honor their commitments to the American worker .
And the American people are still unaware of the fact that the cars Detroit produces now are every bit the equal of the vehicles their foreign competitors make .
And they have promised to allow government oversight in response to this crisis agreeing to change their way of doing business .
So what the hell is the Republicans ' problem ?
It is plain that " Wall Street corruption is OK , but they will not allow us Americans to drive a Chevrolet ! "
There !
Try that on for size , since the Republican party loves slogans .
Even President Bush and Dick Cheney have come out and just made the comment that " in denying the Detroit loan , the Republican party will be defining itself further as the ' Party of Herbert Hoover . "
For the love of Pete , the Republicans ' own president and vice president finally advocated doing the right thing , and now a handful of southern , die - hard feudalist reactionaries wo n't even listen to President Bush or Vice President Cheney .
These southerners are yes - men for the foreign auto interests and as such , the spiritual heirs of the old plantation with slaves .
They want to bust down the American worker so that we literally become Third World - style impoverished wage slaves with no guarantees of anything .
I still say that Abraham Lincoln made a big mistake bringing the South back into Union .
You can't trust neocons .
They are esconced in their hillbilly hideouts , and are still just neo -confederate snakes .
It is obvious then , that the GOP , whether at the federal or state level , seems to be intent on only one game plan : block everything and watch the country go down the tubes .
They do n't offer workable alternatives and they have a huge double standard in what they are for and what they are against .
The Republican Party is the party of two - tiered fat cat pandering , no -strings - attached , to Robber Baron thieves of Wall Street but then for the rest of us , " tough luck " and slave labor and zero favors or help .
They 're willing to tack almost a trillion dollars onto the already exorbitant bill owed by the American taxpayer , but then they are just as willing to cut the money that kids and old people need to survive , yet they offer nothing reasonable beyond a continual , " No " , to anything and everything .
The GOP , while clinging to it 's ideologies has proven it is the party of rich white jerks only .
Not only has the GOP brought this country to the brink of ruin , they still have the gall to refuse to accept that they 've made any mistakes .
The Republican party is NOT EVEN ASHAMED of betraying America , putting themselves before country , after putting the USA into the worst financial hole in history ...
Apparently , they will not be satisfied until they have finally broken America down so badly that it can not be fixed .
I sometimes think they must secretly work for some evil foreign government or governments , because otherwise why would they be so consistently anti-American in everything they do ?
We know they 're willing to go wherever the money is right for their own greed , but not where it 's good for the common wellbeing of Americans .
If the GOPers and their backers do n't secretly work for evil foreign government ( s ) , then they just are the most unprincipled thieves that there have ever been in American history .
They are obviously out to grab as much as they can for themselves , regardless of what it does to the country , and then they try to justify their behavior by various arguments that all boil down to hypocrisy .
Fiscal conservatism for the main masses in the country but ' grab what you can for yourself " for themselves and their rich patrons .
And they 're brazenly insulting toward all who do n't agree with them .
You suddenly become a ' liberal ' and a " socialist , America - hating sissy ' .
All of this tells me I am correct in asking , " WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN ANYMORE to these hateful , vectoring neocons that go blabbing their distortions around on the daily blogs , spewing out r half - truths , and outright lies , excuses , and their turning things inside out : .... calling black white , and white black .... with all of their slander and self - righteous hypocrisy ?
They are all of them like cultists who say " do n't bother me with the facts , my pea-brain is made up " .
WHY should anyone , anymore listen to these hardened scoundrels and scammers who have no shame and no mercy and who are not sorry that they have ' effed ' up our country and continue to do so , in such an extreme manner that we may never recover ?
Maybe Sarah Palin was right : there are some regions of America that are more " American " than others .
Namely The North , and West and East are more American than the South , because we like to support our last major manufacturing industry , the American automakers .
I am more American than any neocon because I will fly an American flag on my American car but they and their southern America - betrayers can drive their Republican cars wearing their sweatbands or their berets sewn with the symbol of the old Third Reich , with a rising sun flag on their un-American cars ' antenna .
One thing Republicans need to do is learn to shut their ignorant mouths and take a good hard look at themselves and look at the mess they 've made of everything .
I guess they want China or Japan to also build our military vehicles and our weapons , since they want to run our American businesses into bankruptcy while salvaging destructive Wall Streeters who raped our treasury .
We will , by this vote , never never forget that the Republican Party is the party of feeding the privileged while forcing the rest of us into slave labor ...
The outcome of Republican behavior when taken to its logical extreme can already be seen in Third World societies where the wealthy few live in guarded compounds protected by private armies , while the vast majority of the population scrambles for scraps , but the logical outcome of their craven pandering to the rich oligarchs and busting of the average citizen ... the outcome either eludes them or does n't bother them .
I think these guys would rather the US be a 3rd world country , than pay ANY taxes toward the common good .
They are THAT selfish .
They do NOT believe in a common good , only what 's good for themselves .
The Republican Party is , in the meantime , just trying to find any way it can to shoot down Obama before he even gets into the presidency .
The RNC , sore losers , are just seething in their attempts to connect Barack Obama to Rod Blagojevitch , the disgraced governor of Illinois .
They are not able to , but the fact that they are trying so hard just shows that they are not a party that can be reasoned with at all .
They need to be sued for slander and character assassination and stomped down .
I say it again , we also need to restore the " fairness doctrine , equal time provision " so that other points of view besides mainstream , right wing media can be aired nationwide .
UK developer Free Radical Design , the team behind Haze and the Time Splitters franchise , have closed their doors , apparently permanently , according to a number of inside sources .

We 've heard that some Free Radical Design employees were jumping ship in the week or two leading to today 's news .
Free Radical 's last game , Haze , was widely received as a mediocre game , but the company was working on a follow up for their popular TimeSplitters franchise and rumored to be working on a Star Wars : Battlefront game for LucasArts .

On Wall Street and in Washington , where the crisis is more palpable , comparisons with the Great Depression are frequent .
In interviews here , however , that association was never made .
Even those squeezed the most said they expect this recession to be no worse , or not much worse , than others since World War II  ending in six months , by Mr. Cook ’s estimate ; by late next year , according to others ; or , by still others , 18 months at the longest .

“ The belief in an early rebound is real , ” said Michael Toma , an economist at Armstrong Atlantic State University here .
“ The history of our economy in Savannah has been slow , steady growth since 1990 , and we are conditioned to believe this will resume . ”
STATELY antebellum mansions and Victorian homes , many of them newly renovated , fan out from the river here , clustering near rectangular plazas originally laid out in 1734 .
Savannah is proud of that heritage , and locals are determined to try to ensure that any economic malaise be short - lived .
No one has a greater stake in keeping the recession mild than Doug J. Marchand , executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority , which operates the port here , a mile upriver from the Atlantic Ocean .
It is now the fifth - largest port on the East Coast , as measured by cargo tons ; most cargo is shipped in huge steel containers .
But the tonnage in those containers , rising at an annual rate of 10 percent or more annually through most of the last 20 years , has lately “ flattened , ” as Mr. Marchand put it , to almost no rise at all  the first time that has happened in his 13 years as port director .
That unanticipated slowdown caught Savannah off guard .
The city has four million square feet of newly built , never - occupied warehouse space , intended primarily as temporary quarters for the growing flow of imports .
Big as hangars , these buildings sit shuttered and alone in industrial parks sprouting weeds .
Mr. Marchand helped ignite the building boom .
In a 2004 “ call to action , ” a speech that business and government officials still cite here , he declared that Savannah needed to make room for a vast new crop of warehouses to accommodate the cargo surge .
Good week for :
Deer , after a big buck shot and downed in Missouri suddenly reared up and attacked hunter Randy Goodman , knocking him to the ground and repeatedly bashing him with his antlers .
Goodman described the deer ’s revenge as “ 15 seconds of hell . ”
Die -hard fans , after a Massachusetts funeral home sold its first Boston Red Sox casket to the family of a longtime fan .
The coffin company will soon make them with other team logos , and also sell team - themed urns for those who prefer cremation .
Capitol improvements , after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared that his favorite thing about the newly opened $ 621 million Capitol Visitors Center is that it will keep hordes of tourists out of Congress itself .
“ My staff tells me not to say this , ” he said , “ but in the summer , you could literally smell the tourists . ”
Bad week for :
Actors , after a Japanese theater company staged the first play featuring robots acting alongside people .
The Montgomery Township , N.J. , police , who laid siege to a closed bank after a shadowy figure was seen through drawn blinds .
After a tense , two - hour standoff , police realized that the suspect was actually a life - size cardboard figure .
Ignoring the fine print , after a Seattle artist who was invited to submit a decoration for the White House Christmas tree painted a glass ball with tiny lettering calling for the impeachment of President Bush .
The White House said that rather than search through hundreds of balls , it would leave the disrespectful decoration on the tree .

Michael Oliveri , a digital media professor from the University of Georgia , likes to snap photos , but not with a camera most photographers use .
He prefers the scanning electron microscope .
In his recent project " Innerspace , " he explores the landscapes of nano - scale worlds where objects are up to 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair .
The samples in Oliveri ’s photos come from University of Georgia materials scientist Zhengwei Pan , who heats metals to vaporize them .
The vapours then settle down to form rods , spheres and other shapes , creating an extraordinary landscape .
In these images , the metal used was zinc oxide which was heated at temperature of 500 - 600 Celsius degree .

Leda And The Swan
A sudden blow : the great wings beating still Above the staggering girl , her thighs caressed
By the dark webs , her nape caught in his bill , He holds her helpless breast upon his breast .
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs ?
And how can body , laid in that white rush , But feel the strange heart beating where it lies ?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall , the burning roof and tower [ 20 ]
And Agamemnon dead .
Being so caught up ,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air , Did she put on his knowledge with his power Before the indifferent beak could let her drop ?

So much to read and learn , and so little time .
Thanks in no small measure to the energy that Ron Paul ’s candidacy unleashed , more people than ever are eager to cut through the propaganda and uncover the truth .
But where to start ?
And how can you get the most out of the time you have to devote to reading and study ?
I put together the resources that follow as my way of answering these questions .
I ’ve included books ( many in free online versions ) and articles , as well as audio and video files that are also free .
For the current crisis , see especially The Bailout Reader .
Take a look also at the reading list Dr. Paul includes in his book The Revolution : A Manifesto .
Many of these titles also appear in the categories below : economics , sound money , foreign policy , the Constitution , and civil liberties .
Can we read our way to freedom ?
No , but we cannot be effective activists in the Ron Paul tradition unless we know some economics and history , and the various depredations , foreign and domestic , of the regime .
Economics
These three books , all relatively short and available online or for purchase , are an excellent starting point for an education in sound economics .
Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt ; online here Essentials of Economics by Faustino Ballv ; online here ( .pdf ) An Introduction to Austrian Economics by Thomas C. Taylor ; online here and here ( .pdf ) A useful companion to Hazlitt ’s Economics in One Lesson is this series of videos , recorded in July — August 2008 , in which various professors comment on each of the book ’s chapters — explaining the argument , elaborating on it , and applying it to present conditions .
Video 1 : The Lesson Video 2 : The Broken Window Video 3 : Public Works Mean Taxes Video 4 : Credit Diverts Production Video 5 : The Curse of Machinery Video 6 : Disbanding Troops and Bureaucrats Video 7 : Who ’s Protected by Tariffs ?

The Business Cycle
What makes the economy experience periodic booms and busts ?
Contrary to what Karl Marx claimed , these are not an inevitable feature of a market economy .
Economist F.A. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in economics for showing how central banking ( the Federal Reserve System in the American case ) and its manipulation of the interest rate initiates unsustainable booms that lead inevitably to a bust .
This is known as the Austrian theory of the business ( or trade ) cycle , and it ’s the subject of this section .

Security agents have destroyed the shoes thrown at US President George W Bush by an Iraqi journalist , during checks to ensure they did not contain explosives , the investigating judge says .
" The shoes were examined by the Iraqi and American security services and then destroyed , " the judge said .
Journalist Muntadar al - Zaidi , 29 , has been in custody in Baghdad since Sunday 's dramatic shoe protest against Mr Bush , which made him an instant sensation in the Arab world .
But the judge said the lack of the key piece of evidence in the case would not prevent the investigation from proceeding .
" I would have preferred to have had the shoes as evidence for the case but since Muntadar al - Zaidi has confessed to his action and that the television pictures confirm it , the investigation can continue , " he said .
Mr Zaidi's brother has said he was hospitalised after being beaten by security guards and was suffering a broken arm and ribs , as well as injuries to an eye and a leg .
There were no details on his condition on Thursday ( local time ) .
In Bethlehem , about 50 Palestinian journalists staged a bare - footed protest to show solidarity with Mr Zaidi , who relatives and colleagues said had hurled the shoes because he detested Americans and Mr Bush .
The sit - in came as hundreds of pilgrims gathered ahead of Christmas celebrations in the city where Christians believe Jesus was born .

Cloud42 is an Open Source management framework for Amazon EC2 , Eucalyptus or any other cloud system compatible to the EC2 API , allowing you to easily manage and monitor your cloud instances and to exploit the whole power of Cloud Computing .
The Cloud42 web application provides a web - based , rich graphical user interface ( GUI ) that can be used to monitor and administrate EC2 AMIs and instances .
Apart from the GUI , Cloud 42 offers a well - designed Web service interface , thus allowing to invoke all its functionalities from within other applications or even to orchestrate EC2 instances using BPEL processes .
Because of the Web service interface , Cloud42 is especially interesting for developers , too .
Beyond the basic functions like starting and stopping instances or managing keypairs , the tool features some enhanced functionalities like transferring files from and to your computing cloud or from an AWS S3 bucket .
Furthermore , it is possible to remotely execute arbitrary commands on a running EC2 server instance only by using the GUI or the Web service interface .
Due to this remote control , Cloud 42 becomes an all - in - one solution , empowering full flexibility .
For instance , there is a notification mechanism that can be used to subscribe any kind of endpoint to event messages sent from EC2 instances according to the publish / subscribe pattern .
In the latest in a series of apparent personal data blunders , the government has been forced to admit that an Isle of Wight resident found a book containing the names and telephone numbers of hundreds of thousands of people ‘ literally left on his doorstep ’ .
‘ As soon as I found the book I knew something was wrong , ’ said Michael Sexton who found the incriminating volume .
‘ I started flicking through it looking for myself and my family , and it was all there .
I just ca n’t see how something like this could have been allowed to happen .
How could they know my number , my address , my postcode and everything ?
It ’s frightening . ’
Sexton fears that had the book been found by a less honest individual , they might have been able to commit identity fraud , although he admits that he is n’t sure exactly how .
‘ When I realised that , ’ he said , ‘ I immediately resolved to contact my MP and discuss the security breach with him .
Unfortunately I do n’t have his phone number .
Is there something where I can look them up ? ’
A representative of the Home Office told reporters that the information contained in the book does not constitute a leak .
‘ This is the telephone directory , ’ he said to the scorn of reporters .
‘ The phone companies compile it and you can opt out at any stage .
Everybody gets a copy .
I… I do n’t understand what you think has happened here . ’
But Sexton is not convinced , and with the backing of the Daily Express has launched a campaign to force Gordon Brown to start an inquiry into how so much personal information came to be left on his doorstep .
The campaigners have also announced that they intend to investigate the claim that a group of children recently visited his home asking for a donation of chocolate .
‘ How did they know where I live ?
That ’s what I want to know . ’

What 's it like working inside Apple when the MacWorld announcements are made ?
The man who set up many of its email systems and worked there 17 years explains the inside story of the preparation , the unveiling – and why it 's sometimes best to avoid Steve Jobs
Even two years after I left Apple , I still feel like I celebrate two Christmases : the one I celebrate with my family , and the one in January that we celebrate when Steve Jobs gets up on stage and says : " I have a few things to show you today that I think you 'll really like . "
When I worked there , the MacWorld speech was always the point at which most of us stopped work and gathered around the screens – there was always a big gathering and a special screen in the restaurant .
Work would stop for a while as everyone enjoyed the surprise .
And for most of us it was a surprise ; only for those in the small teams working on , say , the iPhone or the new release of Apple 's office suite iWork would know precisely what was coming ; and even they did n't know what the other teams had .
And afterwards people talk about it for days ; and the staff discount means that there are plenty of orders right after the speech ends .
Only , of course , this year it wo n't be Steve .
It 'll be Phil Schiller , Apple 's own Vice President of Demos , as we liked to call him , because he 'd always be the second guy who'd come out to help Steve out .
I 'll still tune in with great anticipation , and while people are already predicting there will be no major announcements , I 'm not so sure .
Instead , I think this is the first step in proving to the Apple community ( and investors ) that while Steve 's vision is important to Apple , Apple is not Steve , and Apple will not disappear when Steve retires from the company – which he is going to do , sooner or later .
Lots of people are making noise about this change , because they find change unsettling – but Apple 's history shows that these kind of changes are common , and once people settle in and get used to the changes , they generally find they had nothing to worry about and that the new Apple is pretty good .
We 'll probably look back to this event in a couple of years and wonder why we were so worried , too .
The fact is , MacWorld causes all sorts of problems for Apple 's workers , and is an expensive proposition for the company to be ready for .
It usually meant a bunch of people had to work through the Christmas break to make deadlines , and then get compensatory time later .
It 's terribly timed to Apple 's sales cycle : right after the holiday buying season .
Who really wants to announce new stuff then ?
It tended to force products out on a schedule Apple could n't affect , so sometimes products missed the deadlines and had to wait for another opportunity like WWDC , or it was pushed out the door early .
Early on , Apple needed Macworld and the hype to generate interest and excitement , but it 's been pulling back from it for about five years , moving introductions to other venues or to special events – or in many cases , just issuing press releases .
The hype machine was part of the plan to get people interested in Apple again , back when Steve needed to save the company , but today , the need for flexibility in releasing things outweighs the advantage of the large stage Macworld presents Apple .
Apple has proven it can create its own events when it needs them , too , which limits the need to continue supporting and being part of Macworld .
Why is Apple pulling out now ?
The budget was probably the last nail in the coffin , but this one 's been in the shop for years , being built for when it was needed .
So it 's going to change .
But that 's life at , and with , Apple .
Most people do n't know what to think when they find out I spent 17 years at Apple ; in a time and an industry where job longevity sometimes seems counted in hours , spending that much time with one company seems almost impossible .
When I 'm asked how I stayed that long , the only honest answer I can come up with is " one day at a time " .
I went to work for Apple in February of 1989 for simple reasons : I loved the technology .
It was a company that I felt could make a difference and improve society , and I wanted a chance to help make those changes .
I think it 's safe to say that most people who go to work for Apple go for similar reasons ;
Apple is a rare breed of company , one not afraid to try to improve the world around it .
It is constantly reinventing itself – five years ago , it was a computer company ; today , it 's a consumer products company that also makes computers .
When I joined , John Sculley was CEO and the Macintosh II was the state of the art .
Few people had heard of the internet , and nobody had URLs or web pages , because they were n't invented until years later .
Music came on CDs , videos came on VHS tapes , and the mobile phone was big , expensive and along with pagers more a sign of corporate servitude .
Cable systems may have had 15 , 20 channels .
Your VCR probably had a clock flashing 12:00 .
When I left , Steve Jobs was in charge and the Macbook Pro was the best of the best , the iPod was a global success and Apple was reshaping the music industry ( much to that industry 's dismay ) .
Life there was n't always fun .
Apple had its problems .
I rode the rollercoaster through four different layoffs , and was laid off once in the summer of 1993 – but talked them out of it .
I 've never regretted that decision , even though I left a stack of money on the table to stay with a company whose future was n't certain at the time .
Why ?
Because I still believed Apple was worth fighting for .
I came to Apple to work on its Unix products – at the time , a version of Unix called A / UX .
I spent the first half of my time there working with a wide array of things , mostly enterprise products – A / UX , Data Access Language , AppleShare , AppleSearch , 3270 and Token Ring .
Other than Unix , most of the products were at best marginal successes and generally soon cancelled .
AppleSearch was by far my favorite – a technology to help you find content on your server .
You may have heard of its grandson , called Spotlight , standard since April 2005 on Mac OS X .
Ten years ?
That 's a pretty long gestation for a feature .
AppleSearch was considered an enterprise product , with an enterprise pricetag , and a hardware requirement a generation or so ahead of the computers Apple sold at the time .
This was actually a common problem with Apple products during the bad years : really great ideas a bit ahead of the hardware or the market 's ability to understand them .
Many of the ideas , such as AppleSearch , got recycled later .
I also built and managed things designed to help Apple communicate with its users , or to help users communicate with each other – some of Apple 's first websites , Apple 's first public mailing list server , Apple 's first web forums , used for communicating with beta testers of various products .
The list server eventually grew into lists .
apple.com , the key communication tool for Apple developers .
The forums were the model for what became the Applecare support forums ; the goal for these systems to act as a way for users to support each other .
The biggest criticism of the forums is the strong moderation ( some would say censorship ) .
I can see both sides of this argument – inside Apple , I always lobbied for more discussion , more disclosure , more transparency .
That 's not always compatible with Steve 's focus on controlling the message .
When Steve was fighting to restructure the company and keep it relevant , that control really was necessary .
Today , I believe it hurts more than it helps , but there are signs that Apple is slowly opening up and starting to move in these directions .
Do n't expect
Steve ever to blog , though .
But maybe his successor will .
My not - so - covert goal was always to find ways to make it easier for Apple and customers to communicate with each other .
I spent a lot of time and energy talking to whoever would listen about how Apple could use blogging and other communication techniques to reach out to users .
That kind of informal communication just is n't in Apple 's DNA , and wo n't be as long as Steve is in charge .
If you look at how Apple 's done , it 's hard to argue it 's wrong , too .
Still , I have hope that some day , this will change and Apple will open up further .
I built a number of custom email systems for Apple .
If you get an email from Apple , it probably passed through a system that at one point I built or managed .
Those tools have allowed Apple to rethink how it markets its products and how it communicates with its users – they bring the customer and Apple closer together .
To me , that 's my best accomplishment .
It does n't hurt that these systems have saved a huge number of trees from being pulped into paper along the way .
But Apple does n't always get it right .
Remember the launch of MobileMe in June 2008 ?
It was that rare reminder that Apple could , in fact , royally screw up .
When Apple released it , it simply was n't ready .
Early users , myself included , suffered from committing to it before it was ready , and the Mac faithful had a field day complaining about it ( legitimately ) and using it to declare everything from the upcoming death of Apple to the impending nova of the sun and loss of all life in the solar system .
Not that it would n't have felt like that internally .
To people who wondered how what the atmosphere would be like inside 1 Infinite Loop , I said : " Just imagine Steve Jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand , asking random people ' do you work on MobileMe ? ' "
I never had Steve 's flamethrower aimed at me , although I came close a couple of times ; all in all , I was close to getting my butt fired three times – and all three times , I probably would have deserved it .
I do know friends who did .
It was n't always pleasant – but one thing I give Steve credit for is he held himself to the same high standards he held those around him .
He is a perfectionist , and that 's what makes him successful and what made Apple succeed .
But that kind of perfectionism is n't easy , and is n't done with gentle criticism .
Apple is a place where you work hard , but you get rewarded , and you help create things that are special .
I found being part of something that was able and willing to fight to change society a real adrenalin rush .
Seeing people react to what we did was even more of one .
In the end , I left to look for new challenges .
Even so : would I recommend people work for Apple ?
Absolutely , if you get the chance .
Think about the things that Apple innovation has fostered , from the mouse and the graphical user interface we all take for granted today , all the way to the iPod and the iTunes store and the revolution of music into an online , electronic industry .
And the iPhone , which is revolutionising how society works with data while on the move : I can do things with my iPhone that were difficult on a desktop machine five years ago , and were inconceivable in any way 10 years ago .
How awesome is that ?
Which is why I 'll even be watching Phil Schiller on Monday – just as I know hundreds of Apple staff will be too .
If Apple keeps turning out the kind of products it 's become known for , I 'll keep buying them .
And if the circumstances were right , I 'd go back and do it again .
So would most of the ex-Apple people I know .
After all , how many companies will you work for that give you an opportunity to be part of something that fundamentally changes society ?

7 Prisoners Have Surgery To Remove Mobile Phones Stuck ‘ Up There ’
37 prisoners in a Pakistan jail were caught hiding cellphones inside their bodies — presumably their rectums .
And for 30 of said prisoners , life continued as normal once the phones were removed .
But for an unlucky 7 , those stuffing themselves with smartphones , nature could n’t take its course .
So they underwent surgery .
Upon discharge ( the prisoners from the hospital , not the mobile phones from the butts ) , the prisoners will be moved to special punishment cells for their actions .
And it just goes to show , while push email sure is nice and Wi-Fi browsing can come in handy , it ’s all no replacement for a good shit .

The Inherent Danger in " Just Working "
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 02 , 2009
I am admittedly not a normal computer user .
I do n't always fully grasp what 's going on deep inside the operating system , nor am I always confident I 'm clear on how an application is working with all of the services it requires to function .
But I find it interesting , even if just on the most simple , conceptual level .
The majority of computer users want their machines to " just work . "
And though I like seeing how my hardware and software interact , it is preferable to have things " just work , " so I can get what I need done , and then spend the time I saved doing so leisurely poking at my application 's innards .
There 's an inherent danger in the " just works " philosophy , however .
When something does n't " just work " on a computer , it 's frustrating .
I 'd say when anything that you 'd expect to work does n't , it 's a nuisance .
But when people find the refrigerator is n't keeping anything cool , or the car engine is making knocking noises , they assume the appliance in question is broken for whatever cause .
At least some of these same people , when experiencing difficulties with their computers , reach a resigned acceptance that something is broken beyond repair from the start , or ( quite commonly ) adopt some form of " magical thinking . "
I 've jokingly referred to some technical difficulties I 've experienced as if the machine is a cognizant being that just is feeling uncooperative -- there are many sane , intelligent people out there who , on some level , seem to buy into that belief .
Your operating system , like your braking system in your car , should respond predictably to the commands you give .
Wait -- and what 's this got to do with open source ?
A lot .
It 's also got a lot to do with misconceptions ( not just the fear - uncertainty - doubt variety ) , and -- yes -- self - confidence of both end -users and programmers .
Linux usage -- if not outright , across the board , full time adoption -- has been on a healthy increase for several years .
Part of this is undoubtedly due to the focus on new - user friendly distributions ( such as Ubuntu , PCLinuxOS , and Mandriva ) that make the now rather wide range of hardware supported by Linux " just work " seamlessly .
Before we go further :
This is a good thing to strive for and make new users aware of .
It 's a good thing to strive for , whether the operating system you are developing is open -- or closed .
I 'd venture on a limb and say I 've had more luck in the past three or four years with hardware working out of the box ( no additional disks or special configuration needed in either GUI or textual .config file formats ) in Linux than I have with proprietary systems .
When I have had trouble on a closed front , getting things working is trickier all around -- both in terms of finding the solution ( usually hidden deep in a knowledge base -- sometimes with incomplete instructions ) , and applying the solution itself .
It is disturbing to me to make Registry edits when every Registry screen spells out the certain doom I face in doing so .
While do - it - yourself fixes might be simpler in Linux , a great many people who use computers do n't want to fix anything -- at all .
It should just work .
If it does n't , dialing tech support for help ( or to unleash their wrath and fury ) is generally where they find themselves .
Here 's the kicker : I 've heard many say that because some things did n't quite just work in Linux , they 've passed over it for another operating system , with which they also have issues ( though not necessarily quite the same ) , but " there 's a phone number to call . "
Here 's another zinger :
At a former life , in the systems department at a library , I found our printing software was having an issue with our lockdown software ( both closed source , with paid technical support ) .
For a few days , the solution I was given by the print provider was that we should probably invest in a compatible lockdown software solution -- no recommendations as to what a compatible application might be , even , except that it was n't one we were using .
The lockdown software technical support staff took a few calls before I broke through the " find another print solution " barrier , but after a few weeks , together we got everything to cooperate .
The question arises as to why this is acceptable with computers at all , especially when support is purchased as part of a license or by subscription .
Yet it goes on , and I believe a lot of it is a magical thinking scenario -- the idea that a computer is not simply a machine .
How many people who call tech support and accept at face value questionable fixes would be onboard with their mechanic telling them that the knocking in their car engine can be solved by turning up their radio ?
It 's not realistic to expect every person with a computer to hunt down the answers as to why applications , or hardware , are n't working as they should .
If they like to look under the hood to discover why themselves , they should be able to -- they should n't be required to .
They should n't have to wrangle with technical support services that send them in an endless loop of finger - pointing and blame .
They would n't accept it with a broken kitchen appliance , and computers are marginally different in the end .
I could see a viable market opening for independent Linux / open source tech support services .
These sorts of services have traditionally fallen on LUGs , but would probably best work as a commercial venture just from the time investment needed to launch and tend to a service such as this .
But before this happens , there 's a real need for software developers and end -users to come to terms that not everything " just works " every last time -- and this is n't necessarily a failing of the code , the hardware , or a personal bias of the machine against the user .

Mr Vail spends time at the Creek rather than working Pajani Vail came to Dubai a year ago to work in construction .
He is on a three - year contract , but has not worked or been paid for four months .
Mr Vail spends most of his time at the Creek in the old town in Dubai , chatting to friends who are looking for jobs and watching the dhows and abras sail past .
" There are quite a few people like me , " he says .
" There are four or five people from my company looking for a job . "
Waste of time Mr Vail 's employer is holding his passport and has told him to wait until work picks up again .
Developers have got serious cash flow problems
Colin Foreman , Middle East Economic Digest
In the meantime he sleeps on the streets or in the back of trucks .
" " One day I have food , one day I do n't , " he says .
" I have to borrow money from friends . "
Having left a steady job in India to come to Dubai , Mr Vail is struggling to support his wife and two children back in Chennai .
" What is the point in being here when I have no food , no money and no job ? " he asks .
" This is a waste of time .
If I go back to India at least I am at home with my family . "
No reserves
There are about 1.5 million Indians in the United Arab Emirates .
Guest labourers often leave Dubai when work dries up Many of them are blue collar labourers , living in rooms with six to 10 fellow workers .
An increasing number are , like Pajani , victims of the credit crunch .
Unlike its neighbour Abu Dhabi , Dubai does not have vast oil and gas reserves to fall back on .
In many , ways Dubai is a victim of its own success .
It has embraced globalisation and aggressively diversified its economy into non-oil sectors such as financial services , tourism and real estate .
The Emirate is home to some of the most ambitious building projects on the planet .
It is building the world 's tallest tower and has just opened the world 's biggest shopping mall .
Not to mention the vast offshore islands .
Struggling developers
But now financial forces have turned , it is exposed .
The announcement by the property developer Nakheel last week that it is delaying construction of a tower that is set to soar more than a kilometre high , is a sign of the times .
The real estate market is beginning to unravel .
" Developers have got serious cash flow problems , " says Colin Foreman from Middle East Economic Digest .
" Their revenue was coming from selling properties which had n't been built yet and they were supplementing this with financing .
" Banks are n't interested in lending them money and nobody is interested in buying property , so their two avenues for finance have gone .
" At the same time they have got huge outgoings because they are building projects that they no longer have money to pay for . "
Few statistics
It is easier for companies to lay off workers in Dubai than in the West because there are no unions .
Industry insiders have told the BBC that tens of thousands of workers in the construction and real estate market alone have lost their jobs over the last few months .
Some workers have just dumped their cars at the airport and fled the country , reportedly fearing for their jobs and nursing large debts .
But it is tricky to quantify the extent of the job losses here as there are few hard statistics .
Regional relocation
Some workers have moved to other countries in the region , such as Qatar , in order to find work .
Thanks to revenue generated by its vast gas reserves , Qatar 's economy is booming .
It is expected to grow by 9 % in 2009 , which would make the Gulf state one of the fastest growing economies in the world this year .
The British project management company Mace is one of many companies in Dubai trying to relocate its employees within the region .
" The largest reaction or action has been making redundancies , " says Ian Tarry , Mace 's Middle East director .
" However we have managed to relocate people to other parts of the group .
In some case this has involved salary reductions .
" So far Abu Dhabi has taken some of the slack and we have relocated other workers to Saudi Arabia . "
Expats and tourists
The worry is that the slowdown in the construction and the real estate sector could seep into the wider economy .
Around four - fifths of Dubai 's population are expats .
Fewer expats mean less demand for property .
The tourism market is also being hit .
Western tourists are cutting back on spending , and occupancy rates at many of Dubai 's luxury hotels are down .
The slump in the non-oil sector is part of the reason why the Egyptian investment bank EFG - Hermes says the United Arab Emirates ' economy will shrink this year .
" There are two factors which have supported private consumption , " according to Monica Malik , director of economic research at EFG - Hermes .
" The expats who have spent money setting up houses and buying products and secondly the tourists .
" These are both going to fall , and with greater uncertainty in the economy those who are remaining will be more careful with their spending .
This shows that private consumption will fall . "
Desirable slowdown
Many say a correction is long overdue , and also healthy .
Khalfan Saeed Al Kaabi runs a handful of construction related companies and is based in Abu Dhabi .
" This is normal , " he says .
" We were not having enough time to plan and to design .
" Projects were being awarded and designs were done on site .
" It 's good for the construction industry to reduce its speed from 200 miles an hour to 40 miles an hour , and let the momentum restart again on a different foundation . "
Damaged credibility
Many companies around the world and countries in the region have bought into Dubai 's success .
It is the financial , retail and tourism centre for the Gulf .
But what does the future hold ?
" Looking at the long term , Dubai has built itself on the promise of tomorrow and people have been buying into the dream it will deliver , " according to Mr Foreman .
" It now says it will not be able to deliver these dreams , so as an investor that credibility has gone .
" Dubai needs to do a lot of work to restore that credibility over the next two years . "

Bank of America fell a whopping 18.43 % today , hitting a new 52 week intraday low of $ 7.35 on concerns it is not going to easily be able to digest the merger with Merrill Lynch .
I suggest Bank of America has easily bitten off more than it can chew and said so at the time , on September 15 , 2008 in Market Votes " No Confidence " In Merrill , Bank of America Merger .
Bank of America ( BAC ) was hammered a whopping 21 % for its ridiculous offer for Merrill Lynch ( MER ) .
Clearly the market thinks Bank of America overpaid and so do I. Merrill Lynch which gapped up to $ 21 ( the offer was for $ 29 ) , gave every penny of it back and closed at $ 17.06 .
It is highly likely that Merrill Lynch would have fallen to $ 14 or $ 15 ( if not a lot more ) in the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman ( LEH ) .
CEO Lewis had to know that , and he had to know there would be enormous pressure on Merrill to do something today if only he waited one day .
If he did not know that , then Lewis is incompetent .
By the way , there is one other possible explanation for this foolishness : Lewis was in a mad rush to enhance his Ego .
This merger ( if it goes through ) would create a behemoth that would rival Citigroup ( C ) in terms of assets under management .
Lewis , in an impatient state did not care what he paid to achieve that fame .
The action in Bank of America ( BAC ) today is a stern warning to JPMorgan ( JPM ) to not get cute and buy Washington Mutual ( WM ) even though that is exactly what the Fed would like to see .
The moral of this story is :
The strong swallow the weak until the strong become weak .
What Really Happened With That Offer ?
Bank of America ( BAC ) agreed to pay $ 44 billion for a company that would have been worth $ 18 billion on Monday 's open , assuming a $ 5 markdown on Monday to $ 12 .
Why ?
I sense a shotgun wedding sponsored at gunpoint by the Fed .
Bank of America Threatens The Fed
Bank of America Corp is in talks with the U.S. government to receive about $ 15 billion in additional capital from the Treasury Department 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , plus government guarantees , according to a financial policy source familiar with the talks .
President - elect Barack Obama and President George W. Bush have both signed off on additional aid for Bank of America , the source said .
Bank of America has already received $ 25 billion of TARP money .
The source said Bank of America has threatened to walk away from the Merrill deal if it did not receive more government aid .
More Details
Bank of America Corp. , the biggest U.S. bank by assets , may get more aid from the government to help absorb losses tied to this month 's acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. , three people familiar with the matter said .
Details are likely to be disclosed on Jan. 20 , the people said .
That 's when Bank of America may post its first quarterly loss in 17 years as it digests the purchases of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial Corp .
The combined company has already received $ 25 billion from the U.S .
Bank of America , based in Charlotte , North Carolina , told regulators in December the takeover might be abandoned because of Merrill 's worse - than - expected results , said the people , who declined to be identified because the talks are private .
The government insisted the transaction proceed because its collapse would create new turmoil in the financial system , they said .
“ Bank of America has all kinds of problems with its acquisitions , ” said Gary Townsend , president of Hill - Townsend Capital LLC in Chevy Chase , Maryland .
“ They ’ve been so acquisitive , they find themselves with very little in tangible equity . ”
Bank Of America Is Insolvent
Huddling Under The TARP
To quote a recent op - ed in the Journal , which likened the government response to the current financial crisis to the circumstances described in Ayn Rand 's Atlas Shrugged ...
" Politicians invariably respond to crises -- that in most cases they themselves created -- by spawning new government programs , laws and regulations .
These , in turn , generate more havoc and poverty , which inspires the politicians to create more programs . . . and the downward spiral repeats itself until the productive sectors of the economy collapse under the collective weight of taxes and other burdens imposed in the name of fairness , equality and do - goodism . "
The similarities are so striking , it almost seems like regulators are using Atlas Shrugged as a playbook for their policy response to the crisis .
They must not have waded through all 1,000 pages to see how the story ended .
Atlas Shrugged : Fiction To Fact
The current economic strategy is right out of " Atlas Shrugged " :
The more incompetent you are in business , the more handouts the politicians will bestow on you .
That 's the justification for the $ 2 trillion of subsidies doled out already to keep afloat distressed insurance companies , banks , Wall Street investment houses , and auto companies -- while standing next in line for their share of the booty are real - estate developers , the steel industry , chemical companies , airlines , ethanol producers , construction firms and even catfish farmers .
With each successive bailout to " calm the markets , " another trillion of national wealth is subsequently lost .
Yet , as " Atlas " grimly foretold , we now treat the incompetent who wreck their companies as victims , while those resourceful business owners who manage to make a profit are portrayed as recipients of illegitimate " windfalls . "
You know those guys who can solve a Rubik 's cube in a matter of seconds ?
Well , Graham Parker is definitely not one of them .

After 26 years of trying , Parker finally managed to solve the Rubik 's cube that confounded him .
Now , you may be thinking that he only occasionally picked up the puzzle , slowing his progress — but the reality is that he obsessed over it day after day , night after night .
' I can not tell you what a relief it was to finally solve it , ' the 45 - year - old from Portchester , Hampshire , said .
' It has driven me mad over the years – it felt like it had taken over my life .
I have missed important events to stay in and solve it and I would lie awake at night thinking about it .
' I have had wrist and back problems from spending hours on it but it was all worth it .
When I clicked that last bit into place and each face was a solid color , I wept . '

Seriously .
His wife claimed that it was like three people were in their marriage .
When she met him , he was already obsessed with the cube .
And she still married him ?
What a saint .
Oh , and you know this is a record .
A spokesman for the World Cube Association , said it was ' definitely the longest it has taken ' to finish the cube .
Now that is a true champion .

ADHD Treatment
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can be treated , and is usually primarily treated with medications .
However , a combined approach that incorporates both psychotherapy ( or coaching ) along side of medications will usually result in quicker , longer - lasting improvement .
While medication is prescribed to help reduce the symptoms of ADHD , the skills learned in psychotherapy ensure a person has the tools necessary to lead the best life possible , despite the disorder .

Editor 's note :
This is the first story in an ongoing series of reports CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Sean , Brooke and Courtney with their parents , Donna and Robert LeBlanc , in a 2008 Christmas photo .
( CNN ) -- Donna LeBlanc gave her husband , a former restaurant manager , the stark ultimatum : become a pizza delivery man or their family " would n't make it . "
The Lafayette , Louisiana , family of six was struggling with $ 45,000 of mounting medical debt from Donna LeBlanc 's unexpected case of pneumonia and tonsillitis a year earlier .
The family savings account had dwindled to $ 100 .
" It 's embarrassing for my husband to take a job he is overqualified for , and I know he feels ashamed at times , " says Donna LeBlanc , a 35 - year - old mother with four children .
" But this is what we have to do and we 're going to make the best out of it . "
She watched her husband , Rob LeBlanc , 35 , load Domino 's pizza boxes into their family car and deliver orders until near dawn for $ 10 an hour .
The family first told their story of falling on hard times on iReport.com .
Share your economic survivor story with CNN .
Until last summer , Rob LeBlanc had worked as a manager at a truck stop restaurant , making $ 55,000 a year .
He lost that job to the falling economy .
Rob LeBlanc says he noticed business at the truck stop getting sluggish a year ago .
Then the spike in gas prices last summer exacerbated the restaurant 's dire circumstances .
Many penny - pinching truck drivers avoided his restaurant altogether , he says .
Rob LeBlanc filed for unemployment compensation immediately after he lost his job .
More than 4.6 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits as of early January , according to the Labor Department .
In Lafayette , a quiet city of about 114,000 tucked away in southern Louisiana , many of the jobs center around servicing the oil and gas industry , but Rob LeBlanc was unwilling to work offshore and away from his family .
When he applied for other jobs , he was told he was either under - qualified or had too much experience .
After several weeks of searching , he took the only job he could get -- a Domino 's pizza delivery man , a job that would cover the family 's expenses .
" I had to swallow my pride and take whatever I could get , " Rob LeBlanc says .
" I kept telling myself one of these days something better will come along . "
He spent nearly five months delivering pizzas at Domino's .
He admits he fell into depression during that time .
But the family received good news Friday , when a private security company hired Rob LeBlanc to be a security officer .
He says the company offers many opportunities to move up to a managerial position .
" My first thought was to tell my wife right away , " he says .
" I could hear the relief in her voice . "
Taking a job as a pizza man was n't the only sacrifice he 's made for his family -- he 's also selling his beloved 2003 Kawasaki motorcycle .
Donna LeBlanc earns a few hundred dollars a week exterminating mosquitoes for a bug control company .
Before her husband lost his job , she had talked of going back to school to pursue a biology degree at Louisiana State University .
The LeBlanc family lives lean in their five - bedroom , three - bathroom house with its $ 440 a month mortgage .
The couple is teaching their children about budgeting and bargaining while relying on coupons and sales .
They no longer eat out and no longer have cable TV .
For entertainment , they attend free movies at a church .
Donna LeBlanc takes pride that they have no credit card debt .
Their children Brooke , 9 , Christopher , 14 , and Courtney , 13 , no longer receive allowances .
Soon after her father 's job loss , Courtney started cleaning houses and baby - sitting and earned enough money to buy a dress for her first school dance -- off the clearance rack .
The LeBlancs ' oldest child , Sean , 16 , who attends high school , still has n't found a job .
He says the competition has gotten stiff , with many older workers in the area out of jobs .
" I 'm trying , " said Sean , who has been looking for a job since October .
" There are just no openings . "
The LeBlancs have found some unexpected happiness .
Donna LeBlanc says her husband now spends more time at home .
Not being able to leave the house for entertainment has brought the children closer together over books , games and conversation .
" This experience has given us time to reconnect with each other , " Donna LeBlanc says .
" And it 's taught us to just keep trying and believe that things will get better . "
All About National Economy • Unemployment Rate
To the casual observer , there is something distinctly creepy about the silver van I 'm crouching inside .
On a pitch - black winter evening , we 're crawling the streets of Reading , taking pictures of every home we pass .
Surrounded by computers in the back of the van , thermal surveyor Chris Brind points to a screen displaying a camera feed .
Ghostly multicoloured images of houses flicker in front of him .
" White will be really hot , the lowest temperature will be blue , " he says .
Snug in their homes on this cold , rainy evening , no one indoors has any idea that their houses are being inspected .
Fortunately for these unsuspecting homeowners , Brind and his van are here to help .
The images - real - time snapshots of heat escaping from a building - will be familiar to anyone who has seen thermal pictures of public buildings , including City offices and the houses of parliament , taken by energy campaigners to show how much energy is leaking out .
Brind 's company , Heatseekers , has been working in partnership with 25 local authorities across Britain since last October .
It hopes that by confronting homeowners with visual evidence of exactly how their buildings are wasting heat ( and money ) it will galvanise them into tackling the problem .
Energy efficiency in homes is an urgent , if unloved , issue : around a third of the UK 's carbon emissions come from the energy needed to heat buildings , and a lot of that energy is wasted .
Put simply , the Victorian , Edwardian and Georgian homes many of us live in are terrible at keeping in the heat .
On cold nights , their uninsulated walls and lofts do a great job of warming the outside air , at the expense of the planet and our wallets : experts estimate that one pound in three spent on household energy bills is wasted .
This results in more CO2 in the atmosphere than all of Britain 's flights and is equivalent to all emissions from cars .
If we could get a lid on it , the climate benefits would be vast .
" In the UK alone , there are probably eight million properties that require insulation of some sort , " says Keith Hewitson , director of Heatseekers .
" If you 're looking at getting cavity wall insulation and good quality roof insulation , to a depth of about 250 mm , you could save £ 200 to £ 300 per year on fuel bills . "
The difficulty is getting that message across to householders .
Endless government schemes offering financial incentives to insulate homes have come and gone for decades , with limited results .
Heatseekers thinks its images will reverse many people 's inaction .
" When they see an image of their property , they can see exactly what 's escaping from their house , " says Hewitson .
The surveys are carried out in the winter months , with shifts starting late in the evening when temperatures drop and householders crank up their heating .
The colder the surrounding air , the more clearly warm walls show up on the pictures .
Driving down a street at 10 mph , surveyors can take energy snapshots of up to 1,000 homes an hour .
After the images have been recorded , energy advisers pinpoint homes they think need attention - usually ones with no insulation or those with patches that do n't seem to be working - and call on them a few days later to offer a face - to - face consultation .
Typically advisers will help the householders to arrange quotes and provide information on government - funded schemes such as Carbon Emissions Reduction Target ( Cert ) , which can pay some or all of the costs for any work needed .
Part - time receptionist Kirsten Chapman from Leicestershire had her house scanned late last year before she was visited by a Heatseekers energy adviser .
Chapman says it was immediately clear that her home was leaking energy .
" It opened my eyes .
Had I seen the pictures years ago , I probably would have taken steps to insulate sooner . "
Like much of Britain 's housing stock , Chapman 's semi-detached home , built in the 1960s without any insulation , needs loft and wall cavity insulation .
The work will cost several hundred pounds but she is convinced that it wo n't be long before it pays for itself .
Thermal images can also reveal faulty seals around windows that might need replacing , chimneys and garage doors that are surreptitiously leaking heat , or show whether any double glazing that has been installed is doing its job properly .
In the three months since Heatseekers started its surveys it has grown from a one - van operation to a fleet of seven .
Hewitson says councils have been lining up to use the company to survey their streets .
" Currently we 're working with local authorities from the Isle of Wight to the north - east .
By the end of this year we should b e working with 30 to 40 local authorities . "
Reading council was one of the first to ask Heatseekers to drive along its streets and , so far , 6,000 homes have been surveyed , paid for by Cert .
" There 's a direct benefit for local people , especially those on low incomes , " says councillor Paul Gittings .
He points out that the Cert scheme can cover the entire cost of insulation for those on benefits or a low income .
In an attempt to tackle fuel poverty and climate change , the council aims to survey all their homes and then insulate 5,000 houses over three years - around half of the estimated need in the town .
Chapman says people approached with a thermal image of their homes should take the time to sit down with an energy adviser .
" Do n't dismiss it - it 's easy to do that when people knock on your door , but when you see the images , it 's an eye - opener " .

Sorting should be made on all objects - toebens toebens hi ,
the scenario you describe is only sorting the result that was returned to the grid .
if you use paging for example the sorting should be done on all data .
in your example you would need to get all the objects from the datasource to fill your list else only the result that was shown on the grid is sorted .
for such a case there are client script solutions for sorting a table with javascript , too .
i just saw an article in the code project newsletter about using jquery to sort a gridview .
greetings , tobi
Re : Sorting should be made on all objects - Andreas Kranister Andreas Kranister
of course there are different ways to achieve a goal .
They all have advantages and disadvantages .
I do not want to discuss these philosphical questions , the best solution depends on the project goal .
The solution I provided here is for the case when you do not page the data by sql server statement but on the webserver like the objectdatasource does out of the box .
You select all the data , sort it in the data - access - layer and give this sorted data to the objectdatasource where it gets paged .
This behaviour has of course advantages and disadvantages :
Advantages :
1 . You can sort the data on properties which are not stored on the database server ( e.g. computed properties ) .
Of course you can say that it is possible to use computed columns in the database to sort for them but that means you have to implement business logic in a layer where it should n't be and it has to fit perfectly to the way how you calculate the value in the business layer , that 's not a good solution .
2. Transparent behaviour independent from the datasource , even from provider
3. Transparent behaviour independent from the implementation of the businessobject
Disadvantages :
1. Ineffective for large datatables on the database server :
The whole data is selected each time you sort or change the page , especially when the database server and the webserver do n't have a fast connection .
This argument may fit in some cases , but I am sure it is a question of architecture and completly dependent on the project .
Greetings , Andreas

Will the show continue to feel relevant with Obama running America ?
Advertisement
With only a few episodes left in the series , BSG is about to disappear from the airwaves .
The question is whether it will stand the test of time as the world changes .
We 've got three reasons why Battlestar might remain relevant in years ahead , and three reasons why it might be headed for the ashcan of history .
Advertisement
Why it 's still relevant : Stirring portrait of multicultural , gender - equal leadership .
The Fleet is a good example of what leadership might look like in a post - Obama America .
One of the most powerful stories that BSG tells is of a community whose leadership is mixed - race and gender - equal .
Admiral Adama is the Caprican equivalent of Latino , while characters like Gaeta , Dualla , and Tory are mixed - race .
And women occupy some of the highest positions in the government and the military .
While some shows might make a big deal out of this , and smarm you with PC unctuousness , BSG simply takes it for granted that its human society is racially mixed .
Certainly there are racial issues , such as the dark - skinned Sagittarans being oppressed by the lighter - skinned Capricans .
But the Sagittaran vs. Caprican conflict is really about economic power : The Sagittarans are poor , and that 's what makes them powerless - not the color of their skins .
BSG 's mixed race future is part of that " hope " which the Obama Administration promises .

Why it's in the ashcan of history : Stale liberal siege mentality .
During the presidential campaign , fans of The Daily Show often asked whether the underdog liberal satire show could survive in a liberal administration , and you should be asking the same question about BSG .
This smart scifi allegory about US politics may lose its edge now .
For example , the new anti-cylon racism plot already feels like a rehash of stale liberal siege mentality - and stale BSG plots .
Zarek and Gaeta 's mutiny plot feels like something written for the Bush Era , a cautionary tale of what happens when xenophobia creeps into national policy .
But President Obama has turned these kinds of cautionary tales into the stuff of campaign speeches .
BSG no longer feels like a healthy dose of social criticism .
Instead it 's in lockstep with the party line espoused by one of the world 's most powerful leaders .
Why it 's still relevant :
Though most of the show is about war , it is also about the thorny road to peace .
BSG tells a timeless story of the horrors of war and the ambiguous nature of peace .
Obama may or may not make good on his promise to end the US occupation of Iraq , but assuming he does the scars of war will linger for generations .
The high - intensity , emotionally ravaging battles in BSG - especially during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica - will never get stale .
At the same time , the show manages to depict how difficult and slow the peace process is .
This season 's revelations about Starbuck 's mysterious identity - is she cylon ?
something else ?
- allow BSG 's creators to deal with what happens to people whose lives have been shaped by war .
How will Starbuck adjust to peace ?
How will other Fleet members adjust to the idea that she 's a human transformed by cylon technology ?
At the same time , the Tigh and Six plot promises to deal with the same thing .
Theirs is a war baby , and its fate is tied to the fragile peace between human and cylon .
Advertisement
Why it's in the ashcan of history :
The torture years are over .
Now that Obama has shut down Gitmo and other foreign prisons , we lack that feeling of panicked recognition as we watch the humans and cylons abusing each other .
As Newsweek 's Joshua Alston put it in a recent article about culture during the Bush Administration :
" Battlestar " has been more honest [ than anti-terrorist thriller series 24 ] about the psychological toll of the war on terror .
It confronts the thorny issues that crop up in a society 's battle to preserve its way of life : the efficacy of torture , the curtailing of personal rights , the meaning of patriotism in a nation under siege .
It also does n't flinch from one question that " 24 " would n't dare raise : is our way of life even worth saving ?
Advertisement
With a new president who is n't beating the " war on terror " drum , will BSG start to feel so retro that it 's hard to take seriously ?
Will it become
The Day After of our time , serious and intense when it was released but now naive and cheesy ?
Why it 's still relevant : BSG unflinchingly portrays the deep connection between religion and politics .
Though BSG is at its heart a show about the future politics and science , it 's also about spirituality .
Show creator Ron Moore has said a number of times that he thinks the mystical aspects of the Fleet 's quest for a new home are crucial to the show .
One of the show 's most talented scientists , Gaius Baltar , has slipped between the roles of mad scientist and cult religious leader .
President Roslin has quelled political uprisings and gone on religious vision quests .
A lot of science fiction would shy away from the idea that religion will be as important in the future as it is in the present .
And that 's what will continue to make BSG relevant in the present - the power of religion is n't going away any time soon .
Advertisement
Why it's in the ashcan of history : Religious war is being replaced with religious tolerance .
Culture wars between Judeo - Christians and Muslims may be on the wane with Obama addressing his inaugural speech to " a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus , and non-believers . "
Over the past two decades , Western pundits like Samuel Huntington have tried to claim that Muslim fundamentalism is to blame for a global " clash of civilizations " - and that in some ways , this clash caused the 9/11 attacks .
Under Obama , it 's possible that this civilization gap will start to close .
That might mean that future audiences will be unmoved or just bored by BSG 's tale of two civilizations warring over God vs. gods .
If Obama makes good on his promises of religious tolerance , in eight years BSG 's religious anguish and culty weirdness may look as dated as Logan 's Run .
“ This is a just war and we do n’t feel guilty when civilians we do n’t intend to hurt get hurt , because we feel Hamas uses these civilians as human shields , ” said Elliot Jager , editorial page editor of The Jerusalem Post , who happened to answer his phone for an interview while in Ashkelon , an Israeli city about 10 miles from Gaza , standing in front of a house that had been hit two hours earlier by a Hamas rocket .
“ We do feel bad about it , but we do n’t feel guilty , ” Mr. Jager added .
“ The most ethical moral imperative is for Israel to prevail in this conflict over an immoral Islamist philosophy .
It is a zero sum conflict .
That is what is not understood outside this country . ”
It is true that there are voices of concern here that the war may be outliving its value .
Worries over the risk to Israeli troops and over even steeper civilian casualties as the ground war escalates have produced calls to declare victory and pull out .
For many of the 1.4 million Israelis who are Arabs , the war has produced a very different feeling , a mix of anger and despair .
The largest demonstration against the war so far , with some 6,000 participants , was organized by an Arab political party .
But that is still distinctly a minority view .
Polls have shown nearly 90 percent support for the war thus far , and street interviews confirm that Israelis not only favor it but do so quite strongly .
The country ’s leaders , while seeking an arrangement to stop Hamas ’s ability to rearm , do not want a face - saving agreement .
They want one that works , or else they want to continue the war until Hamas has lost either its rockets or its will to fire them .
Boaz Gaon , a playwright and peace activist , said he found it deeply depressing how the Israeli public had embraced the military ’s arguments in explaining the deaths of civilians .
But he was livid at Hamas , both for what it had done to its own people and civilians in the south , and for its impact on the Israeli left .
“ Hamas has pushed Israeli thinking back 30 years , ” he said .
“ It has killed the peace camp . ”
Moshe Halbertal , a left - leaning professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University , helped write the army ’s ethics code .
He said he knew from personal experience how much laborious discussion went into deciding when it was acceptable to shoot at a legitimate target if civilians were nearby , adding that there had been several events in this war in which he suspected that the wrong decision had been made .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers say they have developed a cream that might prevent herpes infection for as long as a week -- a potentially big step in protecting women from the sexually transmitted infection .
The cream uses a new kind of therapy called RNA interference to turn off genes that the virus uses to invade cells , the researchers reported on Wednesday .
The cream , being developed by Massachusetts - based Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc , protected mice from herpes simplex 2 , the virus that causes genital herpes , Deborah Palliser of Harvard Medical School in Boston and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and colleagues reported .
“ A vaginal microbicide able to protect against HSV - 2 transmission could contribute significantly to controlling sexually transmitted diseases , ” Palliser ’s team wrote in the journal Cell Host & Microbe .
The World Health Organization estimates that 536 million people worldwide are infected with genital herpes , a painful and incurable virus which is highly infectious and can kill newborns .
Herpes viruses head straight to nerve cells , where they stay latent for the life of an animal or person , often causing periodic outbreaks .
Related viruses are herpes simplex 1 , which causes cold sores , and varicella , which causes chicken pox and returns in middle or old age as herpes zoster to cause shingles .
Acyclovir and related drugs can suppress symptoms and are available as both creams or pills but have not been shown to prevent infection .
An estimated one in five Americans have genital herpes , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , while 100 million have HSV - 1 .
As a new route to making better drugs , several companies have locked onto technology using small , interfering RNAs or siRNAs .
These are molecules that can silence microRNAs -- tiny strands of RNA , or ribonucleic acid , that help turn genes into proteins .
The Alnylam drug targets a gene called nectin - 1 .
Mice genetically engineered to lack this gene are less likely to be infected with HSV - 2 .
But the cream “ silencing ” nectin - 1 took a day or so to become effective .
Attacking a second gene called UL29 , found in the virus itself , provided immediate protection , they wrote .
Using both provided about a week of protection , they said .
They used a type of cholesterol to help carry the siRNAs and the resulting cream did not irritate the vaginas of the mice , they said .
“ Topically applied siRNAs might be useful to treat and prevent reactivation and sexual transmission of clinically latent HSV - 2 infection , ” they wrote .
More work is needed , they stressed , but the approach might work for other sexually transmitted infections -- notably the AIDS virus .
MIAMI --
When Dwyane Wade heard the plight of a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down her home -- and ruined all the family 's possessions -- the Miami Heat star knew he had to do something .
So he helped the family move into a new home , just in time for Christmas .
Wade presented Dawn Smith with the ultimate Christmas gift on Wednesday -- the keys to a her new house , along with some furnishings , clothing and gifts to make sure her family has a joyous holiday , something that did n't seem likely just a few weeks ago .
His Wade 's World foundation will make some payments on the home , while Smith and her family get back on their feet .
" That 's what I try to teach my kids , " said Wade , whose foundation has hosted several charity events this holiday season , mostly for needy children .
" It 's not about what you 're going to receive -- it 's what you can give to others from what you 've received . "
Smith could n't hold back happy sobs when she saw the home for the first time .
" A big - time relief , " Smith said , clearly overcome by emotion .
" Thank you so much .
Thank you so much .
Oh , God , thank you so much . "
The NBA 's leading scorer this season had a simple message : " Hopefully , you 'll like it . "
Wade 's other holiday events this year included a party for 350 children on Monday , and hosting 100 kids at Tuesday night 's Heat game against the Golden State Warriors .
He also donated $ 10,000 to each of three children 's organizations , but said he was particularly touched by being able to assist the Smith family .
" We can help this family have a new beginning , " Wade said .
Rails and Amazon : Libraries and Plugins for EC2 , S3 , SimpleDB , SQS , FPS and DevPay Integration
Unless you 've been hiding somewhere , you 're probably aware that Amazon has built up a comprehensive cloud computing infrastructure featuring a raft of pay - as - you - go services .
What you may not know is just how easy it is to integrate most of these services with Rails .
Between Rails - specific plugins and Ruby projects , you can quickly take advantage of the services that Amazon offers .
Here 's a survey of the available integration pieces .
EC2 is Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud - the overall image - based supplier of computing power .
One way to manage these images is with the amazon - ec2 gem , which gives you full access to the EC2 API .
This lets you control server resources on demand right from your application code .
Alternatively , if you 're looking for administrative control as part of a deployment process , take a look at capsize , a Capistrano extension for managing EC2 instances .
S3 is the Simple Storage Service - a web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve data to arbitrary buckets .
There are a number of projects - such as Paperclip - that can optionally use S3 storage .
For glue , many of them use the aws - s3 gem , which wraps S3 for any Ruby application .
You might also find a use for s3storage , a dedicated plugin to put anything from Rails to S3 .
Another way to get at S3 data is with cliaws , a command - line client that speaks to both S3 and SQS .
SimpleDB is the core database functionality provided by Amazon , using a flat dataset ( instead of relational ) approach .
amazon - sdb is a Ruby wrapper around SimpleDB .
Because Amazon provides a RESTful API , the wrapper is fairly straightforward , although the project itself may have gone quiet before actually getting finished .
aws - sdb is another attempt at a SDB wrapper that appears to be somewhat more up to date .
SQS , the Simple Queue Service , is the messaging infrastructure that can be used to communicate between EC2 and other web services .
There 's a gem , rufus - sqs , the lets you write to and read from SQS queues .
Flexible Payments Service ( FPS ) is Amazon 's e-commerce infrastructure , letting you manage everything from micropayments to straight credit card and bank account billings .
On the Rails side , amazon_fps_foo integrates FPS , though this is a new project that will need to develop a bit more to be really usable .
An alternative is remit , which provides a general REST wrapper for FPS in Ruby code .
DevPay is Amazon 's other billing project .
DevPay uses Amazon Payments as the backend for an online billing system , letting users move from your site into the Amazon pipeline .
If you want to use DevPay from Rails , check out the devpay plugin , which makes the whole process simple .
If you 're considering payments , you should also know about Simple Pay , which is yet another way that Amazon helps you take in money .
It 's not part of the AWS system , coming from the Payments folks instead .
Rails developers can get to Simple Pay via the simplepay plugin .
Finally , if you 're seriously interested in using the Amazon Web Services infrastructure , check out the PoolParty project .
It gives you a slick configuration file based way to build out your cloud and integrate with other services .

Stacy Snyder , a federal court has ruled , wo n't be teaching kids the three Arrrrs any time soon :
They 've rejected Snyder 's claim that her First Amendment rights were violated when a MySpace photo showing her engaged in a bit of boozy buccaneering , as well as posts complaining about her relationship with a supervisor , cost the former Millersville University student a teaching degree .
In 2006 , Snyder had been a student teacher at Conestoga Valley High School in Pennsylvania , as required by both Millersville 's teaching curriculum and the state 's teacher certification guidelines .
Her performance reviews often complained of Snyder 's lack of professionalism — and her shaky grasp of the subject matter she had been assigned to teach .
But the final straw for the school came when they saw that Snyder 's MySpace account — which she had mentioned to students on several occasions — contained a photo of the grog - swilling Snyder in a pirate hat , captioned " drunken pirate , " as well as posts alluding to her fraught relationship with her supervisor .
They called Snyder at home and told her to walk the plank out of their student teaching program .
Since she 'd failed to complete her student teaching practicum , Millersville denied Snyder a teaching degree , instead shuffling some credits around to award her a BA in English .
Snyder took the school to court , and while judge Paul Diamond of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania promptly dismissed her due process claims , as well as several statutory claims , he allowed her to press the argument that the denial had violated her First Amendment right to free expression .
On Wednesday , however , the judge tossed that claim as well .
Snyder , Diamond found , " was an apprentice more akin to a public employee / teacher than a student " during her time at CV High .
As such , the First Amendment protects her speech about matters of " public concern " — she could n't be barred from the student - teaching program for expressing an unpopular political opinion — but not personal MySpace postings the school found to be unprofessional .
Moreover , once the school had declined to certify her completion of the program , Millersville administrators had no authority to override the degree requirements to award Snyder a teaching diploma .
A warning to prospective public employees , then : it may be that on the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog .
But they are apt to find out if you 're a drunken pirate .
Palestinians search for bodies in the rubble of the destroyed house of Hamas senior leader Nizar Rayan after an Israeli missiles strike in the refugee camp of Jabaliya on January 1 , 2009 in Gaza
Israel killed a Hamas strongman yesterday by dropping a one - tonne bomb on his house , also killing two of his wives and four of his children .
This first assault on the top leadership of Gaza 's ruling group escalated a crushing aerial offensive as Israel declared itself ready to launch a ground invasion .
" We are trying to hit everybody who is a leader of the organisation , and today we hit one of their leaders , " said Israeli vice - prime minister Haim Ramon .
Medics say a total of 13 members of Rayyan 's family were killed by the airstrike on the residential neighbourhood .
A Hamas official said : " The blood of Sheikh Nizar Rayyan and the blood of other martyrs will never be wasted and the enemy will pay a heavy price for the crimes it has committed . "
Thousands of soldiers were massed along the border with Gaza yesterday , backed by tanks and artillery .
While turning up the heat on the battlefield , Israel appeared to be sounding out a possible diplomatic exit from its campaign , demanding international monitors as a key term of any future truce .
In mounting the campaign last Saturday , Israel made it clear no one in Hamas was immune , and the air attack that flattened the four - storey apartment building in the northern town of Jebaliya where Nizar Rayan lived drove that message home .
Hamas leaders went into hiding before Israel launched its operation , but Rayan was known for openly defying Israel , and the army said he had a tunnel under his house that could serve as an escape route .
Rayan ( 49 ) ranked among Hamas ' top five decision - makers .
A professor of Islamic law , he was known for his close ties to the group 's military wing and was respected in Gaza for personally participating in clashes against Israeli forces .
At least 420 people have been killed and 2,100 injured since Israel 's aerial bombardment of the Gaza strip began six days ago .

× Expand Robin Shepard Brewmaster Fred Gray describes Gray 's Oatmeal Stout as rich in color with strong roasted flavor and a creamy texture .
The Gray 's Tied House in Verona should n't be overlooked when you 're searching for a heavier - bodied brew this time of year .
One of my picks for relaxing at home with a good book in front of the fireplace is Gray 's Oatmeal Stout .
This is a beer with plenty of flavor , but it 's not overly filling .
The brew is also perfect following a meal , or with a little chocolate for the adventuresome .
Gray 's Oatmeal Stout is in my fridge this week , and you can find it around Madison in bottles and six - packs , as well as on tap at the Tied House for consumption there or for taking home in growlers .
What is it ?
Gray 's Oatmeal Stout from Gray Brewing of Janesville .
Style :
This kind of stout includes oatmeal in its grist , which adds a smoothness or silkiness to the mouth feel .
Color ranges from very dark brown to black , and the flavors emphasize a sweet maltiness , with some roastedness evident in the background and finish .
Despite their dark and thick appearance , these beers range from 3.0 to 4.8 % alcohol by volume .
Oatmeal stout has its origins in Great Britain and is slightly sweeter than its cousin , the dry or Irish stout .
It emerged under the pretense that adding oats to beer made it healthier , and was considered a table beer by the mid-1800s , even prescribed to nursing mothers and ailing children as a remedy for general sickness .
Background : Fred Gray is the fifth generation to run the family brewing business .
As brewmaster , he describes Gray 's Oatmeal Stout as rich in color with strong roasted flavor and a creamy texture .
Gray uses fresh rolled oats in the recipe for body , along with additions of dark roasted barley that impart coffee - like tones in the flavor profile .
If you look closely on packaging you 'll see " 56 , " which refers to when the Janesville brewery was founded by Joshua C. Gray in 1856 .
Gray 's Oatmeal Stout has won several awards at the World Beer Cup , most recently Gold in 2003 , Silver in 2002 and Bronze in 2006 .
The brew sells for about $ 8.50 for a six - pack , or at the Tied House for $ 4 / pint or $ 14 / growler ( and $ 10 / refill ) .
Tasting notes :
Aroma : Malty with a light roastedness .
Appearance : Dark and clear with bronze highlights .
A medium soft tan head .
Texture : Medium bodied with a silkiness .
Taste : Chocolate malt is up front , with a firm caramel maltiness in the background .
Finish / Aftertaste : Malty , with just a light coffee bitterness that lingers .
Glassware : The English pint glass with wide mouth and slight taper will offer great color and support its soft tan head .
Pairs well with : Meats with savory sauces that offer complimentary light sweet flavors .
This is also be a great beer for pastas , particularly those with Alfredo sauce .
Rating : Three Bottle Openers ( out of four ) .
The Consensus : B+ ( very good ) from Beer Advocate and an 81 from .
The Verdict : This is a smooth and silky oatmeal stout .
It pours dark and looks thick , but actually is more medium - bodied that it appears , and there is an emphasis on the chocolate malt that goes well with this soft texture .
The light hints of roastedness in the finish are distinctive , yet held in check .
Gray 's Oatmeal Stout is a good food beer , but an even better sipping stout to appreciate its flavors .
Regarding the topic of elections and politics , I just came across Jacques Ellul ’s Propaganda : The Formation of Men ’s Attitudes ( via Fantastic Planet ) .
Ellul has some very interesting things to say about the role of the individual in modern democracy :
The average citizen wants to have opinions on domestic and foreign issues .
But in reality , he can ’t .
He is caught between his desire and his inability , which he refuses to accept .
For no citizen will believe that he is unable to have opinions .
Public opinion surveys always reveal that people have opinions even on the most complicated questions , except for a small minority ( usually the better informed and those who have reflected the most ) .
The majority prefers expressing stupidities to not expressing any opinion .
For this they need simple thoughts , elementary explanations , a “ key ” that will permit them to take a position , and even ready - made opinions .
As most people have the desire and at the same time the incapacity to participate , they are ready to accept a propaganda that will permit them to participate , and which hides their incapacity beneath explanations , judgments , and news , enabling them to satisfy their desire without eliminating their incompetence .
The individual does not want information , but only value judgments and preconceived positions .
Here one must also take into account the individual ’s laziness , which plays a decisive role in the entire propaganda phenomenon , and the impossibility of transmitting all information fast enough to keep up with developments in the modern world .
Besides , the developments are not only beyond man ’s intellectual scope ; they are also beyond him in volume and intensity ; he simply cannot grasp the world ’s economic and political problems .
Faced with such matters , he feels his weakness , his inconsistency , his lack of effectiveness .
He realizes that he depends on decisions over which he has no control , and that realization drives him to despair .
Man cannot stay in this situation too long .
He needs an ideological veil to cover the harsh reality , some consolation , a purpose , a sense of values .
Only propaganda offers him a remedy for a basically intolerable situation …
If we look at the average man , and not at those few intellectuals whose special business it is to be informed , what do we actually mean when we say this man is informed ?
It means that , aside from spending eight hours at work and two more commuting , this man reads a newspaper or , more precisely , looks at the headlines and glances at a few stories .
He may also listen to news broadcasts , or watch it on TV ; and once a week , he will look at the pictures in some kind of news magazine ( Time , Newsweek , etc. ) .
This is the case of the reasonably well - informed man , that is , of 98 % of all people .
Now , what happens next to a man who wishes to be informed and receives a great deal of news each day ?
First , straight news reporting never gives him anything but factual details ; the event of the day is only always a part , for news can never deal with the whole .
Theoretically , the reporter could relate these details to other details , put them into context and even provide certain interpretations –but that would no longer be pure information .
Besides , this could only be done for the most important events , whereas most news items deal with less important matters .
But if you shower the public with the thousands of items that occur in the course of a day or week , the average person , even if he tries hard , will simply retain thousands of items which mean nothing to him .
He would need a remarkable memory to tie some event to another that happened three weeks or three months ago .
Moreover , the array of categories is bewildering — economics , politics , geography , and so on — and topics and categories change every day .
To be sure , certain major stories occasionally become the subject of continuous reporting for several weeks or months , but that is not typical .
Ordinarily , a follow - up story on a previous news item appears two weeks to a month later .
To obtain a rounded picture , one would have to do research , but the average person has neither the time or desire for it .
As a result , he finds himself in a kaleidoscope in which thousands of unconnected images follow each other rapidly .
His attention is continually diverted to new matters , new centers of interest , and is dissipated on a thousand things , which disappear from one day to the next .
The world becomes remarkably changeable and uncertain ; he feels as though he is at the hub of a merry - go - round , and can find no fixed point or continuity ; this is the effect information has on him .
Even with major events , an immense effort is required to get a proper broad view from the thousand little strokes , the variations of color , intensity , and dimension the paper gives him .
The world thus looks like a pointilliste canvas — a thousand details make a thousand points .
Moreover , blank spots on the canvas also prevent a coherent view .
Our reader would then have to be able to stand back and get a panoramic view from a distance ; but the law of news is that it is a daily affair .
Man can never stand back to get a broad view because he immediately receives a new batch of news , which supersedes the old and demands a new point of focus , for which our reader has no time .
To the average man who tries to keep informed , a world emerges that is astonishingly incoherent , absurd , and irrational , which changes rapidly and constantly for reasons that he cannot understand .
And as the most frequent news story is about an accident or calamity , our reader takes a catastrophic view of the world around him .
What he learns from the paper is inevitably the event that disturbs the order of things .
He is not told about the ordinary — and uninteresting — course of events , but only of unusual disasters and crime , etc. , that disturb that course .
He does not read about the thousands of trains that every day arrive normally at their destination , but he learns all the details of a train accident .
In the world of politics and economies , the same holds true .
The news is only about trouble , danger and problems .
This gives man the notion that he lives in a terrible and frightening era .
Man cannot stand this ; he cannot live in an absurd and incoherent world ( for this , he would have to be heroic , and even Camus , who considered this the only honest posture , was not really able to stick it to it ) ; nor can he accept the idea that the problems , which sprout all around him , cannot be solved , or that he himself has no value as an individual and is subject to the turn of events .
The man who keeps himself informed needs a framework in which all this information can be put in order ; he needs explanations and comprehensive answers to general problems ; he needs coherence .
And he needs an affirmation of his own worth .
All this is the immediate effect of information .
And the more complicated the problems are , the more simple the explanations must be ; the more fragmented the canvas , the simpler the pattern ; the more difficult the question , the more all - embracing the solution ; the more menacing the reduction of his worth , the greater the need for boosting his ego .
All this propaganda — and only propaganda — can give him . …
An analysis of propaganda therefore shows that it succeeds primarily because it corresponds exactly to a need of the masses .
Effective propaganda needs to give man an all - embracing view of the world , a view rather than a doctrine .
Such a view will first of all encompass a general panorama of history , economics and politics .
That panorama allows the individual to give proper classification to all the news items he receives ; to exercise a “ critical ” judgment , to sharply accentuate certain facts and suppress others , depending on well they fit into the framework .
News therefore loses its frightening character when it offers information for which the listener already has a ready explanation in his mind , or for which he can easily find one .
Man is doubly reassured by propaganda : first , because it tells him the reasons behind the developments which unfold , and second , because it promises a solution for all the problems that arise , which would otherwise seem insoluble .
Propaganda speaks to our mythic needs , and so when we buy into propaganda , or for that matter to any view of world events and politics , we choose to participate in a story that fits who we think we are and who we want to be .
Propaganda is the true remedy for loneliness .
It also corresponds to deep and constant needs , more developed today , perhaps , than ever before ; the need to believe and obey , to create and hear fables , to communicate in the language of myths .
It also responds to man ’s intellectual and desire for security –intrinsic characteristics of the real man as opposed to the theoretical man of the Existentialists .
This situation has another aspect .
In our society , man is being pushed more and more into passivity .
He is thrust into vast organizations which function collectively and in which each man has his own small part to play .
But he can not act on his own ; he can act only as the result of somebody else ’s decision .
He is more and more trained to participate in group movements and to act only on signal and in the way he has been taught .
The individual becomes less and less capable of acting by himself ; he needs the collective signals which integrate his actions into the complete mechanism .
Modern life induces us to wait until we are told to act .
At the same time , the individual feels himself diminished .
For one thing , he gets the feeling that he is under constant supervision and can never exercise his independent initiative ; for another , he thinks he is always being pushed down to a lower level .
To be sure , we ’re talking of the average man ; obviously a corporate president , high - level administrator , or professional man does not feel diminished , but that fact does not change the general situation .
The feeling of being unimportant stems from general working conditions , such as mechanization and regimentation
from housing conditions , with small rooms , noise , and lack of privacy
from family conditions , with loss of authority over children
from submission to an ever - growing number of authorities ( no one will ever be able to assess fully the disastrous effect on the human soul of all the bureaus and agencies ) — in short , from participation in mass society .
But man cannot stand being unimportant ; he cannot accept the status of a cipher .
He needs to assert himself , to see himself as a hero .
He needs to feel he is somebody and to be considered as such .
He needs to express his authority , the drive for power and domination that is in every man .
Under our present conditions , that instinct is completely frustrated .
Only propaganda provides the individual with a fully satisfactory response to his profound need .
The more his needs increase in the collective society , the more propaganda must give man the feeling that he is a free individual .
Propaganda alone can create this feeling , which , in turn , will integrate the individual into collective movements .
Though a mass instrument , propaganda addresses itself to each individual .
It appeals to me .
It appeals to my common sense , desires , and provokes my wrath and my indignation .
It evokes my feelings of justice and my desire for freedom .
It gives me violent feelings , and lift me out of the daily grind .
As soon as I have been politicized by propaganda , I can from my heights look down on my daily trifles .
My boss , who does not share my convictions , is merely a poor fool , a prey to the illusions of an evil world .
I take my revenge upon him by being enlightened ; I have understood the situation and know what ought to be done .
Thanks to propaganda , the diminished individual obtains the very satisfaction he needs .
In addition , to the extent that modern man is diminished , he finds himself faced with the almost constant need for repression .
Most of his natural tendencies are suppressed by social constraints .
We live in an increasingly organized and ordered society which permits less and less free and spontaneous expression of man ’s profound drives ( which , it must be admitted , would be largely anti-social if completely unleashed ) .
But it is impossible to keep the individual in such a situation for long .
The individual who feels himself in conflict with the group , whose personal values are different from those of his milieu , who feels tension toward his society and even toward the group in which he participates –that individual is in a tragic position in modern society .
To seal all outlets and suppress man in all areas is dangerous .
Man needs to express his passions and his desires ; collective social repression can have the same effect as individual repression .
Either sublimation or release is necessary .
Propaganda offers release on a grand scale .
For example , propaganda will permit what so far was prohibited , such as hatred , which is a dangerous and destructive feeling and fought by society .
But man always has a certain need to hate , just as he hides in heart the urge to kill .
Propaganda offers him an object of hatred [ think of the giant pictures of Goldstein in 1984 , shown during the Five Minutes of Hate ] , for all propaganda is aimed at an enemy .
And the hatred it offers him is not shameful , evil hatred that he must hide , but a legitimate hatred , which he can justly feel .
Moreover , propaganda points out enemies that must be slain , transforming crime into a praise - worthy act [ the Ritual Crime between citizen and state ] .
Almost every man feels a desire to kill his neighbor , but this is forbidden , and in most cases the individual will refrain from it for fear of the consequences .
But propaganda opens the door and allows him to kill the Jews , the bourgeois , the Communists , and so on , and such murder even becomes an achievement .
Authoritarian regimes know that people held very firmly in hand need some decompression , some safety valves .
The government offers these itself .
This role is played by satirical journals attacking the authorities , yet tolerated by the dictator , or by a wild holiday set aside for ridiculing the regime , yet paid for by the dictator ( Friday of Sorrows in Guatemala )
Clearly , such instruments are controlled by the regime .
These instruments of criticism serve to consolidate power and make people cling even more to the regime by providing artificial release of tendencies that the state must keep in check .
In such situations , propaganda has an almost therapeutic and compensatory function .
This role is even more prominent in the presence of another phenomenon : anxiety .
Anxiety is perhaps the most widespread psychological trait in our society .
On the one hand , the number of dangers is increasing and , because of the news media , man is more aware of them ; on the other hand , religious beliefs , which allowed men to face fear , have disappeared almost entirely .
Finally , as a result of all the threats and contradictions in contemporary society , man feels accused , guilty .
He cannot feel that he is right and good as long as he is exposed to contradictions , which place him in conflict with one of his group ’s imperatives no matter which solution he adopts .
But one of man ’s greatest inner needs is to feel that he is right .
First , man needs to be right in his own eyes .
He must be able to assert that he is right , that he does what he should , that he is worthy of his own respect .
Then , man needs to be right in the eyes of those around him , his family , his milieu , his coworkers , his friends , his country .
Finally , he feels the need to belong to a group , which he considers right and which he can proclaim as noble , just and good .
But that righteousness is not absolute righteousness , true and authentic justice .
For what matters is not to be just , or to act just , or that the group to which one belongs is just — but to seem just , to find reasons for asserting that one is just , and to have these reasons shared by one ’s audience .
[ The rallying cries of “ multiculturalism ” and “ diversity ” come to mind here . ]
This corresponds to man ’s refusal to see reality — his own reality first of all — as it is , for that would be intolerable ; it also corresponds to his refusal to acknowledge that he may be wrong .
Before himself and others , man is constantly pleading his own case and working to find good reasons for what he does or has done .
Of course , the whole process is unconscious .
Relevant here is the tendency of the individual to reconstruct his past to demonstrate that his conduct was right .
But this is justification rather than explanation of behavior .
Man thus lives in a seemingly reasonable fiction .
On the collective level one can say that most ideologies and political or economic theories are justifications .
A study by M. Rubel has shown that Marx ’s rigid and seemingly uncompromising doctrine was one gigantic intellectual justification for sentimental and spontaneous positions taken by him in his youth .
It is difficult , if not impossible , to accept reality as it is and acknowledge the true reasons for our behavior , or to see clearly the motivations of a group to which we belong .
If we practice a profession , we cannot limit ourselves to its financial rewards ; we must also invest it with idealistic or moral justification .
It becomes our “ calling , ” and we will not tolerate its being questioned .
Obviously , the prodigious universality of justification makes it so effective : the man who justifies himself and unconsciously plays this farce not only believes it himself but also has the need for others to believe it .
And , in fact , the others do believe it , because they use the rationalizations and become accomplices of the play in which they themselves are actors .
Justification really attains its effectiveness only on the basis of this complicity , which is so all - pervasive that even those who are victims of justification go along with it .
Propaganda appeases tensions and resolves conflicts .
It offers facile , ready - made justifications , which are transmitted by society and easily believed .
At the same time , propaganda has the freshness and novelty which correspond to new situations and give men the impression of having invented new ideals .
It provides man with a high ideal that permits him to give into his passions while seeing to accomplish a great mission .
Propaganda dissolves contradictions and restores man to unitary world in which the demands are in accord with the facts .
Here , propaganda plays an idealistic role , by involving a man caught in the world of reality and making him live by anticipation in a world based on principle .
In conclusion : For all these reasons contemporary man needs propaganda ; he asks for it ; in fact , he almost instigates it .
The development of propaganda is no accident .
The politician who uses it is not a monster ; he fills a social demand .
The propagandee is a close accomplice of the propagandist .
Only with the propagandee ’s unconscious complicity can propaganda fulfill its function ; and because propaganda satisfies him — even if he protests against propaganda in abstracto , or considers himself immune to it — he follows its route .
Propaganda is the inevitable result of the various components of technological society , and plays so central a role in the life of society that no economic or political development can take place without the influence of its great power .
Social work , Human Relations in social relationships , advertising ( Human Engineering in the economy ) propaganda in the strictest sense in the field of politics — the need for psychological influence is everywhere the decisive factor , which progress demands and which the individual seeks in order to be delivered from his own self .
What Ellul is describing is essentially the same as the role of the internal dialogue in an individual psyche .
The internal dialogue functions to give a sense of unity and meaning to a person ’s experience , but it can lie , it can describe things selectively and in an extremely biased way , skewing events according to its preferred and familiar biases .
It maintains the integrity of the self , providing a structure and a buffer against the vast chaos of the totality of possibilities ; but it also can imprison the self by stifling growth and explorations into that chaos .
Just as we participate as both perpetrator and victim of our internal dialogue , so do we do , on a collective level , with propaganda .
And to the extent that we have not clarified who we are , and achieved understanding , insight , and balance in the disparate , dysfunctional , and oppositional aspects of self , we are vulnerable to propaganda because it exploits ( or we allow it to exploit ) the vulnerabilities that exist in the unexamined , shadowy corners of our psyche .
As within , so without .
Pencil
Background
One of the oldest and most widely used writing utensils , the pencil originated in pre-historic times when chalky rocks and charred sticks were used to draw on surfaces as varied as animal hides and cave walls .
The Greeks and Romans used flat pieces of lead to draw faint lines on papyrus , but it was not until the late 1400s that the earliest direct ancestor of today 's pencil was developed .
About one hundred years later graphite , a common mineral occurring as soft , lustrous veins in rocks , was discovered near Borrowdale in northwestern England .
The Borrowdale mine supplied Europe with graphite for several hundred years ; however , because people could not then differentiate between graphite and lead , they referred to the former as " black lead . "
Cut into rods or strips , graphite was heavily wrapped in twine to provide strength and a comfortable handle .
The finished product , called a lead pencil , was quite popular .
In the late sixteenth century , a method for gluing strips of wood around graphite was discovered in Germany , and the modern pencil began to take form .
In 1779 , scientists determined that the material they had previously thought was lead was actually a form of microcrystalline carbon that they named graphite ( from the Greek " graphein " meaning " to write " ) .
Graphite is one of the three natural forms of pure carbon — the others are coal and diamond .
In the late eighteenth century the Borrowdale mine was depleted , and , as graphite was now less plentiful , other materials had to be mixed with it to create pencils .
A Frenchman chemist , Nicolas Jacques Conte , discovered that when powdered graphite , powdered clay , and water were mixed , molded , and baked , the finished product wrote as smoothly as pure graphite .
Conte also discovered that a harder or softer writing core could be produced by varying the proportion of clay and graphite — the more graphite , the blacker and softer the pencil .
In 1839 , Lothar von Faber of Germany developed a method of making graphite paste into rods of the same thickness .
He later invented a machine to cut and groove the pencil wood .
Following the depletion of the once - abundant graphite source at Borrowdale , other graphite mines were gradually established around the world .
A number of these mines were set up in the United States , and the first American pencils were manufactured in 1812 , after the War of 1812 ended English imports .
William Monroe , a cabinet maker in Concord , Massachusetts , invented a machine that cut and grooved wood slats precisely enough to make pencils .
Around that time , American inventor Joseph Dixon developed a method of cutting single cedar cylinders in half , placing the graphite core in one of the halves , and then gluing the two halves back together .
In 1861 , Eberhard Faber built the United States ' first pencil - making factory in New York City .
Today , the hardness of a pencil is designated by numbers or letters .
Most manufacturers use the numbers 1 to 4 , with 1 being the softest and making the darkest mark .
Number 2 pencils ( medium soft ) are used for normal writing .
Pencils are also sometimes graded by letters , from 6B , the softest , to 9H , the hardest .
The idea of attaching an eraser to a pencil is traced to Hyman W. Lipman , an American whose 1858 U.S. patent was bought by Joseph Rechendorfer in 1872 for a reported $ 100,000 .
In addition to the conventional wood pencil , a number of other pencils are widely used .
In the early 1880s , the search for a pencil that did n't require sharpening led to the invention of what has variously been termed the automatic , propelling , or repeating pencil .
These instruments have a metal or plastic case and use leads similar to those found in wood cased pencils .
The lead , lodged in a metal spiral inside the case , is held in place by a rod with a metal stud fastened to it .
When the cap is twisted , the rod and stud move downward in the spiral , forcing the lead toward the point .
The early twentieth century saw the development of colored pencils in which the graphite core was replaced by a combination of pigments or dyes and a binder .
Today , colored pencils are available in more than 70 colors , with 7 different yellows and 12 different blues .
However , the cedar - casing lead pencil — manufactured at a pace of 6 billion per year in 40 different countries — continues to outsell all of its competitors , including the ballpoint pen .
Raw Materials
The most important ingredient in a pencil is the graphite , which most people continue to call lead .
Conté 's method of combining graphite with clay is still used , and wax or other chemicals are sometimes added as well .
Virtually all graphite used today is a manufactured mixture of natural graphite and chemicals .
The wood used to manufacture pencils must be able to withstand repeated sharpening and cut easily without splintering .
Most pencils are made from cedar ( specifically , California cedar ) , the choice wood for many years .
Cedar has a pleasant odor , does not warp or lose its shape , and is readily available .
Some pencils have erasers , which are held on with a ferrule , a metal case that is either glued or held on with metal prongs .
The erasers themselves consist of pumice and rubber .
The Manufacturing
Process
Now that most commercially used graphite is made in factories rather than mined , manufacturers are able to easily control its density .
The graphite is mixed with clay according to the type of pencil being made — the more graphite used , the softer the pencil , and the darker its line .
For colored pencils , pigments are added to the clay , and virtually no graphite is used .
Processing the graphite
1 Two methods are used to form the graphite into its finished state .
The first is an extrusion method in which the graphite and wax mixture is forced through a mold to create a spaghetti- like string , which is then cut to precise measurements and dried in ovens .
In the second method , the graphite and clay mixture is poured into a machine called a billet press .
A plug is placed over the top of the press , and a metal ram ascends from the bottom to squash the mixture into a hard , solid cylinder called a " billet . "
The billet is then removed from the top of the machine and placed into an extrusion press that forces it through a mold , slicing off strips the
Making the wood casings
2 The cedar usually arrives at the factory already dried , stained , and waxed , to prevent warping .
Logs are then sawed into narrow strips called " slats " ; these are about 7.25 inches ( 18.4 centimeters ) long , .25 inch ( .635 centimeter ) thick , and 2.75 inches ( 6.98 centimeters ) wide .
The slats are placed into a feeder and dropped , one - by - one , onto a conveyor belt which moves them along at a constant rate .
3 The slats are then planed to give them a flat surface .
Next , they pass under a cutter head that makes parallel semicircular grooves — one half as deep as the graphite is thick — along the length of one side of each slat .
Continuing along the conveyor belt , half of the slats are coated with a layer of glue , and the cut graphite is laid in the grooves of these slats .
4 The slats without glue — and without graphite in the grooves — are placed on another belt that carries them to a machine that picks them up and turns them over , so they are laying on the belt with the grooves facing down .
The two conveyor belts then meet , and each unglued slat is placed over a slat with glue and graphite , forming a sandwich .
After the sandwiches have been removed from the conveyor belt , they are placed into a metal clamp and squeezed by a hydraulic press and left clamped together until the glue is dried .
When the pencils are dried , the ends are trimmed to remove excess glue .
Shaping the pencils
5 The next step is shaping , when the sandwiches actually become pencils .
The sandwiches are placed on a conveyor belt and moved through two sets of cutters , one above and one below the belt .
The cutters above the sandwiches cut around the top half , while the lower set cuts around the bottom half and separates the finished pencils .
The majority of pencils are hexagonal , so designed to keep the pencils from rolling off surfaces ; a single sandwich yields six to nine hexagonal pencils .
Final steps
6 After the pencils have been cut , their surfaces are smoothed by sanders , and varnish is applied and dried .
This is done with varnishing machines , in which the pencils are immersed in a vat of varnish and then passed through a felt disk , which removes the excess varnish .
After drying , the pencils are put through the process again and again until the desired color is achieved .
Finally , the pencils receive a finishing coat .
7 The pencils once again are sent on a conveyor belt through shaping machines , which remove any excess varnish that has accumulated on the ends of the pencils .
This step also ensures that all of the pencils are the same length .
8 Erasers are then attached , held to the pencil by a round , metal case called a " ferrule . "
The ferrule first attaches to the pencil either with glue or with small metal prongs , and then the eraser is inserted and the ferrule clamped around it .
In the final step , a heated steel die presses the company logo onto each pencil .
Colored pencils
Colored pencils are produced in much the same way as black - writing pencils , except that their cores contain coloring materials such as dyes and pigments instead of graphite .
First , clay and gum are added to pigment as bonding agents , and then the mixture is soaked in wax to give the pencils smoothness .
When the pencils have been formed , the outsides are painted according to the color of the center mixture .
Quaility Control
Because they travel along a conveyor belt during the manufacturing process , pencils are thoroughly scrutinized before they are distributed to the public .
Workers are trained to discard pencils that appear dysfunctional , and a select number are sharpened and tested when the process is complete .
A common problem is that the glue of the sandwiches sometimes does n't adhere , but this nuisance is usually caught when the sandwiches are being cut .

I am a little late to the game on this , but I just want to be on record mocking the new Official Red Ryder Carbine - Action Two - Hundred - Shot Range Model Air Rifle Red State Strike Force .
The Bradrocket made a really solid point today in an unrelated matter when he said the following :
Everything you guys write is tainted by the simple fact that you ’re crazy assholes .
If you ’d like your work to be taken seriously by anyone who is n’t on your own personal LISTSERVs and Twitter accounts , the first step is to stop being crazy assholes .
If you enjoy being crazy assholes and do n’t want to give up the habit , that ’s cool , but do n’t expect to earn much respect from normal people .
Make sense ?
The key to electoral success for the GOP is not an elite strike force of blithering idiots spamming everyone ’s email with bullshit about Obama ’s birth certificate .
The nation does n’t need a trillion twitters about William Ayers , they need a Republican party that is n’t batshit insane .
Spending all this time pretending the only problem is insufficient text message spam is going to get you nowhere , because the reason we elected a bunch of Democrats the last couple of years is because the Republicans and their ideas suck .
*** Update ***
More silliness at the RNC meet the candidate thing today :
For much of the 2008 campaign , Texas lawmaker and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul and his supporters served as a thorn in the side — or a punching bag — for the mainstream GOP establishment .
Yet today , the six men vying to run the Republican National Committee praised the grassroots enthusiasm Paul tapped into during his campaign — and discussed how they would like to capture that enthusiasm to expand the party ’s appeal .
“ Ron Paul certainly brought a whole new generation of voters and I think it ’s important going forward that we recognize the strengths and the attributes of these individuals who are out there actively building the party and building a movement , a consensus if you will , on certain issues .
We ca n’t look that in the eye and say ‘ No , we do n’t want that , ’ ” said former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele , adding that the RNC needs to find “ creative ways ” to work with candidates supported by Paul and his followers , and to work with Paul directly to that end .
“ I think , at this stage at this party , everyone who can help us should be brought into the room to help us , ” Steele said .
South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Katon Dawson recalled memories of Paul ’s supporters campaigning during his state ’s early primary .
“ I witnessed early on the Ron Paul army in South Carolina , ” Dawson said , stressing the importance of building new coalitions .
“ I want people involved in my party that will hang off bridges and paint on their cars and make up t- shirts .
There was a passion that I saw of those people for him and his ideas .
Do we agree with all of them ?
No , but we are a party that has to embrace differences . ”
What party are these guys trying to become the chairman of , because it sure as hell is n’t the Republican party if they are praising Ron Paul .
Christ on a crutch , if the GOP is all into the newfangled intertrons , what with these alien inventions of facebook and twitter , they might try out the google , too .
I would suggest doing a search for the term “ Paultard , ” and see what the Republican base thinks of Ron Paul and his supporters .
So the future for the GOP lies in twitter and attracting the support of people they declared all out war on for the past year .
Good luck with that .
